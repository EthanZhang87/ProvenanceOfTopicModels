predecessor it s certainly smarter and more heartfelt Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate but the franchise has definitely grown up Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying Hill s neurotic motormouth act and Tatum s lovable lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film three out of four stars saying This is the ultimate meta movie The repetition is exactly the point br Jocelyn Noveck of the Associated Press gave the film three out of four stars saying Hill and Tatum have a Laurel and Hardy like implausible chemistry that keeps you laughing pretty much no matter what they re doing Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars saying What makes it all work is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum which in turn of course is a rich source of the film s humor Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying The peculiar sweetness of Jump Street has taken a hiatus in Jump Street a brazen sequel that s both slightly disappointing and a reliable often riotous laffer in the old Variety trade magazine parlance Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars saying Jump Street is damn funny sometimes outrageously so It laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of four stars saying Like its stars Jump Street gets extra credit for getting by on charm while sticking to the rules Ian Buckwalter of NPR gave the film a seven out of ten saying What separates Jump Street from sequel mediocrity is that everyone s in on the joke br Sean Fitz Gerald of The Denver Post gave the film three out of four stars saying Jump Street knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip offs and in this case to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd unique franchise Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review saying This sequel s spoof of its predecessor s riff on the original s era buddy cop TV show coalesces into a raucous raunchy irreverent imperfect riot Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half stars out of four saying Lord and Miller are on a roll and there may be no better moviemakers at playing to our modern need for irony at giving us the entertainment we crave while acknowledging our distrust of it Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film three out of four stars saying There s something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of Jump Street a testament to the care and attention to detail directors Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying At what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit Exactly when does joking about how all sequels are just lame repetitive cash grabs start to suggest that maybe yours is too Actually in this case about minutes in Bill Zwecker of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film three out of four stars saying Though I enjoyed enormously this latest offering in the rebooted Jump franchise it s the effortless unexpected bromance partnership between the two unlikely undercover cops is what makes this franchise work br James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying There are times when Jump Street is borderline brilliant Unfortunately those instances are outnumbered by segments that don t work for one reason or another Jaime N Christley of Slant Magazine gave the film two out of four stars saying As funny and batshit insane as the movie often is the fact that Jump Street knows it s a tiresome sequel doesn t save it from being a tiresome sequel even as Lord and Miller struggle to conceal the bitter pill of convention in the sweet tapioca pudding of wall to wall jokes Scott Tobias of The Dissolve gave the film three and a half stars out of five saying Jump Street squeezes every last drop of comic inspiration it can get from Tatum and Hill as well as the very notion of a sequel to such a superfluous enterprise br Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B saying Jump Street is a mixed bag of clever spoofery and miscalculated outrageousness The unveiled homoeroticism of practically all interaction between Jenko and Schmidt is amusing to the point when it isn t Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of five stars saying This is a sequel that wears its well worn formula mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly flying the high lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not too dumb Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a positive review saying Jump Street hits far more often than it misses and even when it misses by a mile the effort is so delightfully zany that it s hard not to give Lord and Miller an A for effort br Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars saying If it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldn t possibly exceed their over the top buddy cop antics of Jump Street you lost that bet Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film a B saying There s no real reason Jump Street should work Yet it does Joe Williams of the St Louis Post Dispatch gave the film three out of four stars saying A self aware sequel has to hop over hurdles to keep from swallowing its own tail but the sharp writing and tag team antics lift Jump Street to a high level Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three out of four stars saying Jump Street is exactly what comedy is today It s coarse free flowing and playful In James Charisma of Playboy ranked the film on a list of Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals br br br Home media br Jump Street was
