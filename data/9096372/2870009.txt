The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute SCBI is a unit of the Smithsonian Institution located on a acre km campus located just outside the town of Front Royal Virginia An extension of the National Zoo in Washington D C the SCBI has played a leading role in the fields of veterinary medicine reproductive physiology and conservation biology since its founding in br Previously named the Conservation and Research Center the CRC became known as the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in as a symbol of its growing independence from the captive animals associated with the traditional images of zoos br br br History br br The land on which the SCBI lies has a history dating back to when the United States Army leased some area farms In the years predating World War I the land served as a series of U S Army Remount Service depots supplying horses and mules to the military The federal government ultimately purchased the land in and began construction on the Ayleshire Quartermaster Remount Depot Completed in the Depot consisted of eleven barn and stable facilities hundreds of miles of split rail fencing many miles of access roads and a rail yard facility for the import and export of animals The Ayleshire Quartermaster Remount Depot remained in operation throughout both world wars and was eventually expanded to include a canine training facility and detention barracks for German and Italian prisoners of war br In Congress passed legislation transferring ownership of the land to the Department of Agriculture which redeveloped the property into a beef cattle research station In conjunction with the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Virginia Tech the USDA experimented with various environmental and husbandry conditions designed to quantitatively and qualitatively improve the meat production of various cattle breeds The Department of State leased part of the compound from USDA for use as an emergency relocation and communications site with support infrastructure for the Secretary of State and other departmental employees The USDA closed the station in leaving the site temporarily vacant br The Conservation and Research Center was founded in when the director of the National Zoo Theodore Reed recognized the need for a captive breeding facility and initiated negotiations to obtain the land The title was transferred to the Smithsonian in and work was begun immediately on developing the site into a zoological research facility br Today the SCBI is host to range of zoological and ecological research It hosts a hectare acre forest dynamics plot that is part of the Center for Tropical Forest Science Smithsonian Institution Global Earth Observatory and has hosted the Mid Atlantic core site in the National Ecological Observatory Network since br br br Programs br br Amongst the SCBI s most well known research programs are those based on the captive breeding and reintroduction of such endangered species as the black footed ferret Mustela nigripes the clouded leopard Neofelis nebulosa and the Matschie s tree kangaroo Dendrolagus matechiei br However despite its accomplishments the SCBI has not been exempt from controversy In the former Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence M Small backed by former Zoo Director Lucy Spelman proposed the closure of the facility as a cost saving measure Opposition from the public and the scientific and conservation communities forced Secretary Small to back down from this decision Afterwards the leadership of Lawrence M Small was shown to be fraught with corruption and waste and he resigned as Secretary in br Since the departure of Small the SCBI has formed many long term partnerships e g with Center for Tropical Forest Science George Mason University Smithsonian Mason Global Conservation Studies Program and National Ecological Observatory Network to help ensure its long term viability br br br Specimens br Currently the SCBI s collection of animals stands at over specimens including mammalian and avian species br Ordinarily closed to the public the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute hosts an annual open house event each fall The Autumn Conservation Festival is sponsored by Friends of the National Zoo FONZ and provides an opportunity for members of the public to tour the grounds and veterinary facilities interact with the staff and learn more about the research conducted at the SCBI The Autumn Conservation Festival is held on the first weekend in October FONZ also hosts a summer sleepaway camp on the site for children ages ten to fifteen br Some of the species kept here include American bison hooded cranes red crowned cranes white naped crane maned wolves cheetahs a mariana crow black footed ferrets persian onagers Hartmann s mountain zebras and scimitar horned oryxs br br br br br br External links br Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute Front Royal Campus br Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute at the Smithsonian Institution Archives
