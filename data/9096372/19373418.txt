title: Middle Assyrian Empire
id: 19373418
The Middle Assyrian Empire was the third stage of Assyrian history covering the history of Assyria from the accession of Ashur uballit I c BC and the rise of Assyria as a territorial kingdom to the death of Ashur dan II in BC The Middle Assyrian Empire was Assyria s first period of ascendancy as an empire Though the empire experienced successive periods of expansion and decline it remained the dominant power of northern Mesopotamia throughout the period In terms of Assyrian history the Middle Assyrian period was marked by important social political and religious developments including the rising prominence of both the Assyrian king and the Assyrian national deity Ashur br The Middle Assyrian Empire was founded through Assur a city state through most of the preceding Old Assyrian period and the surrounding territories achieving independence from the Mitanni kingdom Under Ashur uballit Assyria began to expand and assert its place as one of the great powers of the Ancient Near East This aspiration chiefly came into fruition through the efforts of the kings Adad nirari I r c BC Shalmaneser I r c BC and Tukulti Ninurta I r c BC under whom Assyria expanded to for a time become the dominant power in Mesopotamia The reign of Tukulti Ninurta I marked the height of the Middle Assyrian Empire and included the subjugation of Babylonia and the foundation of a new capital city Kar Tukulti Ninurta though it was abandoned after his death Though Assyria was left largely unscathed by the direct effects of the Late Bronze Age collapse of the th century BC the Middle Assyrian Empire began to experience a significant period of decline roughly at the same time The assassination of Tukulti Ninurta I c BC led to inter dynastic conflict and a significant drop in Assyrian power br Even during its period of decline Middle Assyrian kings continued to be assertive geopolitically both Ashur dan I r c BC and Ashur resh ishi I r BC campaigned against Babylonia Under Ashur resh ishi I s son and successor Tiglath Pileser I r BC the Middle Assyrian Empire experienced a period of resurgence owing to wide ranging campaigns and conquests Tiglath Pileser s armies marched as far from the Assyrian heartland as the Mediterranean Though the reconquered and newly conquered lands were held on to for some time the empire experienced a second and more catastrophic period of decline after the death of Tiglath Pileser s son Ashur bel kala r BC which saw the loss of most of the empire s territories outside of its heartlands partly due to invasions by Aramean tribes Assyrian decline began to be reversed again under Ashur dan II r BC who campaigned extensively in the peripheral regions of the Assyrian heartland The successes of Ashur dan II and his immediate successors in restoring Assyrian rule over the empire s former lands and in time going far beyond them is used by modern historians to mark the transition from the Middle Assyrian Empire to the succeeding Neo Assyrian Empire br Theologically the Middle Assyrian period saw important transformations of the role of Ashur Having originated as a deified personification of the city of Assur itself sometime centuries earlier in the Early Assyrian period Ashur in the Middle Assyrian period became equated with the old Sumerian head of the pantheon Enlil and was as a result of Assyrian expansionism and warfare transformed from a primarily agricultural god into a military one The transition of Assyria from a city state into an empire also had important administrative and political consequences While the Assyrian rulers of the Old Assyrian period had governed with the title i iak governor jointly with a city assembly made up of influential figures from Assur the Middle Assyrian kings were autocratic rulers who used the title ar king and sought equal status to the monarchs of other empires The transition into an empire also led to the development of various necessary systems such as a sophisticated road system various administrative divisions of territory and a complex web of royal administrators and officials br br br History br br br Formation and rise br br Assyria became an independent territorial state under Ashur uballit I c BC having previously been under the suzerainty of the Mitanni kingdom Though the transition of Assyria from being merely a city state around Assur as it was throughout most of the preceding Old Assyrian period had begun already in the last few decades under Mittani suzerainty it is the independence achieved under Ashur uballit as well as Ashur uballit s conquests of nearby territories such as the fertile region between the Tigris the foothills of the Taurus Mountains and the Upper Zab which modern historians use to mark the beginning of the Middle Assyrian period br Ashur uballit was the first native Assyrian ruler to claim the royal title ar king and the first ruler of Assur to do so since the time of the Amorite conqueror Shamshi Adad I in the th century BC Shortly after achieving independence he further claimed the dignity of a great king on the level of the pharaohs and the Hittite kings Ashur uballit s claim to be a great king meant that he also embedded himself in the ideological implications of that role a great king was expected to expand the borders of his realm to incorporate uncivilized territories ideally eventually ruling the entire world On account of political realism however the true situation was most often diplomacy with adversaries of equal rank such as Babylonia and conquest only of smaller and military inferior states in the near vicinity Ashur uballit s reign was often regarded by later generations of Assyrians as the true birth of Assyria The term land of Ashur m t A ur i e designating Assyria as comprising a larger kingdom is first attested as being used in his time br The rise of Assyria was intertwined with the decline and collapse of its former suzerain Mitanni Assyria was subjugated by Mittani c BC and as such spent about years under Mitanni rule Chiefly responsible for bringing an end to Mitanni dominance in northern Mesopotamia was the Hittite king uppiluliuma I whose th century BC war with Mitanni over control of Syria effectively led to the beginning of the end of the Mitanni kingdom It was in this struggle for supremacy and hegemony that Ashur uballit secured independence The Mittani Hittite conflict was preceded by a period of weakness in the Mitanni kingdom the heir to the Mitanni throne Artashumara was murdered in the th century BC which led to the accession of the otherwise minor figure Tushratta Tushratta s rise to power led to internal conflict within the Mittani kingdom as different factions vied with each other to depose him During the wars that followed Tushratta s accession multiple rivals came to rule Mitanni such as Artatama II and Shuttarna III The Assyrians sometimes fought them and sometimes allied with them Shuttarna III secured Assyrian support but had to pay heavily for it in silver and gold br br Ashur uballit doubtlessly watching the conflict between Mitanni and the Hittites closely out of interest in expanding Assyria directed much of his attention to the lands south of his realm Successful campaigns were directed against both Arrapha and Nuzi which was destroyed by Assyrian troops in the s BC or before Neither city was formally incorporated into Assyria the Assyrian army probably withdrew to the Little Zab allowing Babylonia to conquer the sites In the centuries to come Assyrian kings often found themselves as rivals of the Babylonian kings Ashur uballit himself did not wish to engage in long lasting conflicts with the Babylonians clearly illustrated since he married his daughter Muballitat Serua to the Babylonian king Burnaburiash II Prior to achieving peace Burnaburiash had been a prominent enemy of the Assyrians At one point he had attempted to tarnish Assyrian diplomatic and trade relations with Egypt by sending a letter to the pharaoh Akhenaten wherein he falsely claimed that the Assyrians were his vassals After several years of peaceful co existence between Assyria and Babylonia the Babylonian king Kara hardash son of Burnaburiash and Muballitat Serua was overthrown Muballitat Serua was most likely killed at the same time which prompted Ashur uballit to march south and restore order The usurper who had taken Babylonia in the meantime Nazi Bugash was overthrown and replaced by the Assyrians with Kurigalzu II another son of Burnaburiash br Ashur uballit s successors Enlil nirari r c BC and Arik den ili r c BC were less successful than Ashur uballit in expanding and consolidating Assyrian power and as such the new kingdom developed somewhat haltingly and remained fragile Kurigalzu did not remain loyal to the Assyrians and instead fought with Enlil nirari His treason and betrayal resulted in deep trauma still referenced in Assyrian writings concerning diplomacy and wars against Babylonia more than a century later it was seen by many later Assyrians as the starting point of the historical enmity between the two civilizations At one point Kurigalzu reached as far into the Assyrian lands as Sugagu a settlement located only a day s journey from Assur Although the Assyrians drove him away an incursion this deep into the Assyrian heartland left an impression on the Assyrians who in future conflicts often focused on Babylonian border outposts along the eastern Tigris river as a preventive measure br br br First period of expansion and consolidation br br br Reigns of Adad nirari I and Shalmaneser I br br Under the warrior kings Adad nirari I r c BC Shalmaneser I r c BC and Tukulti Ninurta I r c BC Assyria began to realize its aspirations of becoming a significant regional power Though the other powers of the Ancient Near East such as Egypt the Hittites and Babylonia had at first been reluctant to view the new Assyrian kingdom as their equal from the time of Adad nirari I onwards when Assyria grew to take the place of Mitanni its status as one of the major kingdoms became undeniable Adad nirari I was the first Assyrian king to march against the remnants of the Mitanni kingdom and the first Assyrian king to include lengthy narratives of his campaigns in his royal inscriptions Adad nirari early in his reign defeated Shattuara I of Mitanni and forced him to pay tribute to Assyria as a vassal ruler Given that the Assyrian army extensively plundered and destroyed portions of Mitanni during this campaign it is unlikely that there at this point were any plans to outright annex and consolidate the Mitanni lands Sometime later Shattuara s son Wasashatta rebelled against the Assyrians though was defeated by Adad nirari who as punishment annexed several cities alongside the Khabur river At Taite a former Mitanni capital Adad nirari constructed a royal palace for himself br The primary focus of Adad nirari was the conquest and or pacification of Babylonia Not only did Babylonia present a more immediate threat but conquering southern Mesopotamia would also be more prestigious Through military focus on Babylonian border towns such as Lubdi and Rapiqu it is clear that Adad nirari s ultimate goal was to subdue the Babylonians and achieve hegemony over all of Mesopotamia Adad nirari s temporary occupations of Lubdi and Rapiqu were met with an attack by the Babylonian king Nazi Maruttash though Adad nirari defeated him at the Battle of K r I tar c BC and the Assyro Babylonian border was redrawn in Assyria s favor Under Adad nirari s son Shalmaneser I Assyrian campaigns against its neighbors and equals intensified According to his own inscriptions Shalmaneser conquered eight countries likely minor states in the first year of his reign Among the sites captured was the fortress Arinnu which Shalmaneser razed to the ground and turned into dust Some of the dust from Arinnu was collected and symbolically brought back to Assur br br After the new Mitanni king Shattuara II rebelled against Assyrian authority assisted by the Hittites further campaigns were conducted against Mitanni in order to suppress the resistance Shalmaneser s campaign against Mitanni was a great success the Mitanni capital of Washukanni was sacked and realizing that the Mitanni lands were clearly not controllable through allowing the local rulers to continue to govern as vassals the kingdom s lands were with some reluctance annexed into the Assyrian kingdom The lands were not annexed directly into the royal domains but rather placed under the rule of a viceroy who bore the title of grand vizier and king of Hanigalbat The first such ruler was Shalmaneser s brother Ibashi ili whose descendants later continued to occupy the position This arrangement placing the Mitanni lands under the rule of a lesser branch of the royal family suggests that the Assyrian elites in the heartland had only a marginal interest in the new conquests Though Shalmaneser boasted of brutal acts against the defeated Mitanni armies in one inscription claiming to have blinded over prisoners of war he was also one of the first Assyrian kings to take prisoners in the first place instead of simply executing captured enemies Adad nirari was also a great builder among his most significant construction projects was the construction of the city of Nimrud a highly significant site in later Assyrian history br Under Shalmaneser the Assyrians also conducted significant campaigns against the Hittites Already in the time of Adad nirari Assyrian envoys had been treated poorly at the court of the Hittite king Mursili III When Mursili s successor Hattusili III reached out to Shalmaneser in an attempt to forge an alliance probably due to recent losses against Egypt he was insultingly rejected and called a substitute of a great king The strained relations between the two empires sometimes erupted into war Shalmaneser warred several times against Hittite vassal states in the Levant The hostilities reached their zenith under Shalmaneser s son and successor Tukulti Ninurta I who defeated the Hittites at the Battle of Nihriya c BC The Hittite defeat at Nihriya marked the beginning of the end of their influence in northern Mesopotamia br br br Reign of Tukulti Ninurta I br br Shalmaneser I s son Tukulti Ninurta I became king c BC He had according to historian Stefan Jakob an unconditional will to create something that would last forever and his wide ranging conquests brought the Middle Assyrian Empire to its greatest extent Even before he became king neighboring kingdoms had been wary of his accession when he assumed the throne the Hittite king Tud aliya IV sent him a letter of congratulations but secretly also sent a letter to the Assyrian grand vizier Babu aha iddina in which he implored the vizier to dissuade Tukulti Ninurta from attacking the Hittite territories in the mountains northwest of Assyria and to work on improving relations Tud aliya s letter did little to dissuade him who saw through the empty flatteries and attacked and conquered the lands in question in his first few years as king According to his inscriptions the conquest was widely celebrated as one of his outstanding early achievements br As for his predecessors Tukulti Ninurta s main focus was on Babylonia His first act in regard to his southern neighbor Kashtiliash IV was to escalate conflict through claiming traditionally Assyrian lands along the eastern Tigris Tukulti Ninurta shortly thereafter invaded Babylonia through what modern historians generally regard to be an unprovoked attack In the contemporary Tukulti Ninurta Epic a propaganda epic used to justify his exploits the king is described as acting according to divine order against Kashtiliash who is described as vile ruler abandoned by the gods In the text he is accused of various atrocities including attacking Assyria violating temples and deporting or killing civilians Though there is no evidence for these accusations they might well have been based on real events albeit probably exaggerated According to the Tukulti Ninurta epic he marched south to the Diyala River and began targeting Babylonian cities including Sippar and Dur Kurigalzu Kashtiliash then attacked the Assyrians confident that he would be victorious but he was defeated and then avoided conflict himself for the rest of the war Tukulti Ninurta eventually emerged as the winner conquering Babylonia c BC dragging Kashtiliash back to Assyria as a prisoner and assuming the ancient title king of Sumer and Akkad Given that some inscriptions report Assyrian refugees from Babylonia and that some soldiers were starving it appears that the victory was a costly one Tukulti Ninurta s rule over Babylonia which nominally placed territories as far south as the Persian Gulf under Assyrian rule lasted for several years and began the apex of Middle Assyrian power though Assyrian domination appears to have been rather indirect br br Tukulti Ninurta experienced some difficulties in keeping his empire together particularly in Babylonia Though the period after Kashtiliash s deposition is poorly attested in Babylonia it appears that there was a second Assyrian campaign directed towards the south c BC after the rule of Tukulti Ninurta s vassal kings Enlil nadin shumi and Kadashman Harbe II which resulted in the accession of another vassal Adad shuma iddina Because Tukulti Ninurta was able to come to Babylon as a guest in c BC and make offerings to the Babylonian gods it is clear that Adad shuma iddina enjoyed Assyrian support for his rule Though this campaign was followed by several years of peace it is clear that Adad shuma iddina eventually stopped acting like a puppet ruler Though Tukulti Ninurta forgave him for a revolt in which he seized the city of Lubdi a second revolt by Adad shuma iddina in c BC was met with a third campaign against Babylon in which Tukulti Ninurta looted the city and carried off the religiously important Statue of Marduk Marduk being Babylonia s national deity to Assyria He assumed the further style king of the extensive mountains and plains and claimed to rule from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea and that he received tribute from the four quarters In one of his inscriptions Tukulti Ninurta went as far as proclaiming himself to be the sun god Shamash incarnated titling himself am u ki at ni e sun god of all people This claim was highly unusual for an Assyrian king to make as the Assyrian rulers were generally not regarded to be divine figures themselves br The last Babylonian campaign did not resolve all of Tukulti Ninurta s problems the Assyrian army at times had to be deployed to the mountains to the northwest and northeast of the Assyrian heartland to quell uprisings and soon enough a Babylonian uprising led by Adad shuma usur perhaps a son of Kashtiliash IV drove the Assyrians out of Babylonia c BC Tukulti Ninurta is recorded to have complained to the Hittite king uppiluliuma II at this point an ally of Assyria and expected to cooperate militarily that he had remained silent on the illegal seizure of power of Adad shuma usur br In addition to his campaigns and conquests Tukulti Ninurta is also famous for the most dramatic construction project of the entire Middle Assyrian period the construction of a new capital city Kar Tukulti Ninurta named after himself the name meaning fortress of Tukulti Ninurta Founded in the eleventh year of his reign c BC the construction and brief occupation of the city was the only time the Assyrian capital was moved before the Neo Assyrian period centuries later After Tukulti Ninurta s death the capital was transferred back to Assur br br br First period of decline br br Inscriptions from the late reign of Tukulti Ninurta showcase increasing internal isolation as many among the powerful nobility of Assyria grew dissatisfied with his rule especially after the loss of Babylonia In some of his own inscriptions Tukulti Ninurta appears to lament the losses since his glory days His long and prosperous reign ended with his assassination which was followed by inter dynastic conflict and a significant drop in Assyrian power Though some historians have attributed the assassination to Tukulti Ninurta s moving the capital away from Assur a possibly sacrilegious act it is more probable that it was the result of the growing dissatisfaction during his late reign Later chroniclers blame the assassination on his son Ashur nasir apli perhaps a misspelled version of the name of his successor Ashur nadin apli r c BC Another leader of the conspiracy appears to have been the grand vizier and vassal king of Hanigalbat Ili ipadda who retained a prominent position at the court for years thereafter Ashur nadin apli was after his short reign succeeded by two of his brothers Ashur nirari III r c BC and Enlil kudurri usur r c BC who also ruled only briefly and were unable to maintain Assyrian power Though the line of Assyrian kings continued uninterrupted over the course of the decline Assyria became restricted mostly to just the Assyrian heartland The decline of the Middle Assyrian Empire broadly coincided with the Late Bronze Age collapse a time when the Ancient Near East experienced monumental geopolitical changes within a single generation the Hittite Empire and the Kassite dynasty of Babylon had fallen and Egypt had been severely weakened through losing its lands in the Levant Modern researchers tend to varyingly ascribe the collapse to large scale migrations invasions by the mysterious Sea Peoples new warfare technology and its effects starvation epidemics climate change and unsustainable exploitation of the working population br Enlil kudurri usur enjoyed a much poorer relationship with the line of vassal rulers of Hanigalbat perhaps because he might not have supported the assassination of his father Such a poor relationship was dangerous given that these vassal rulers were also members of the Assyrian royal family as descendants of Adad nirari I At some point during Enlil kudurri usur s reign Ili ipadda s son Ninurta apal Ekur traveled to Babylonia where he met with Adad shuma usur With Babylonian support Ninurta apal Ekur then invaded Assyria and defeated Enlil kudurri usur in battle According to the Babylonian Chronicles he was captured and surrendered to the Babylonians by his own people Ninurta apal Ekur then became king ending the line of rulers who were direct descendants of Tukulti Ninurta During his reign c BC Ninurta apal Ekur proved to be like his immediate predecessors unable to do much about the collapse of the empire In the reign of his son Ashur dan I r c BC the situation improved somewhat as can be gathered from a campaign directed by Ashur dan I against the Babylonian king Zababa shuma iddin illustrating that hopes for gaining control of at least some southern lands and reasserting superiority over Babylonia had not been completely abandoned br After Ashur dan s death in BC his two sons Ninurta tukulti Ashur and Mutakkil Nusku struggled for power with Mutakkil Nusku emerging victorious but then only ruling for less than a year Mutakkil Nusku began a conflict with the Babylonian king Itti Marduk balatu over control of the city of Zanqi or Zaqqa which continued in the reign of his son and successor Ashur resh ishi I r BC In the Synchronistic History a later Assyrian document further tensions at Zanqi are described between Ashur resh ishi and the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I which included a battle in which the Babylonians burned down their own siege engines so that they would not be captured by the Assyrians Though the Synchronistic History describes Assyria as in danger of Babylonian aggression in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar s father and predecessor Ninurta nadin shumi it casts Ashur resh ishi as a savior of the empire who defeated Nebuchadnezzar in several battles and was able to defend the southern Assyrian border Ashur resh ishi as such began to reverse the decades of Assyrian decline and in his inscriptions claimed the epithet avenger of Assyria mut r gimilli m t A ur br br br Second period of expansion and consolidation br br Ashur resh ishi s son and successor Tiglath Pileser I r BC inaugurated a second period of Middle Assyrian ascendancy Owing to his father s victories against Babylon Tiglath Pileser was free to divert his attention to other regions and not worry about a southern attack Texts written already during his first few regnal years demonstrate that Tiglath Pileser ruled with more confidence than his predecessors using titles such as unrivalled king of the universe king of the four quarters king of all princes lord of lords and epithets such as splendid flame which covers the hostile land like a rain storm In his first year as king Tiglath Pileser defeated the Mushki a tribe who had taken control of various lands in the north fifty years prior The inscriptions mention that no king had defeated them in battle before and that their men strong army led by five kings was defeated by Tiglath Pileser who however allowed the surviving enemies to settle in Assyria as his subjects One of the Mushki strongholds the city of Katmu u in the northeast continued to be troublesome for a few years before it was reconquered looted and its king Errupi was deported Numerous other sites in the northeast were also conquered and incorporated into his empire br Tiglath Pileser also went on significant campaigns in the west The cities of northern Syria which had ceased to pay tribute decades prior were reconquered and the Kaskians and Urumeans tribes who had also settled in the region voluntarily submitted to him immediately upon the arrival of his army He also waged war on the Nairi people in the Armenian highlands Famed for their knowledge of horse breeding his self admitted goal of this campaign was to acquire more horses for the Assyrian army It is clear from his inscriptions that the goal of the campaigns were to instill respect among the rulers of the lands formerly subordinate to Assyria to reconquer the old Assyrian borders and to go beyond them Altogether I conquered lands and their rulers from the other side of the Lower Zab in distant mountainous regions to the other side of the Euphrates River people of atti and the Upper Sea in the west from my accession year to my fifth regnal year I subdued them to one authority took hostages from them and imposed upon them tribute and impost br br Tiglath Pileser s inscriptions are the first Assyrian inscriptions to describe punitive measures against rebelling cities and regions in any detail A more important innovation was increasing the size of the Assyrian cavalry and introducing war chariots on a grander scale than previous kings Chariots were also increasingly used by Assyria s enemies In the final years of his reign he twice engaged the Babylonian king Marduk nadin ahhe in battles with a great number of chariots Though he did not conquer Babylonia several cities including Babylon itself were successfully attacked and looted He was probably unable to conquer Babylonia since a significant amount of attention needed to be diverted to the Aramean tribes in the west Though he was one of the most powerful kings of the Middle Assyrian period succeeding in imposing tribute from as far away as Phoenicia his achievements were not long lasting and several territories especially in the west were likely lost again before his death br As a result of Tiglath Pileser s campaigns Assyria became somewhat overstretched and his successors had to adapt to be on the defensive His son and successor Asharid apal Ekur r BC ruled too briefly to do anything and his successor Ashur bel kala r BC another son of Tiglath Pileser managed to only briefly follow in his father s footsteps Ashur bel kala campaigned in the mountains to the northeast and the Levant and is recorded to have received gifts from Egypt Though political objectives had thus not changed since Tiglath Pileser s time Ashur bel kala too had to divert significant attention to the Arameans Due to the Aramean tactics of avoiding open battle and instead attacking the Assyrians in numerous minor skirmishes the Assyrian army could not take advantage of their technical and numerial superiority The Arameans were not Ashur bel kala s only enemies in the west given that he is also recorded to have fought against Tukulti Mer king of Mari The conflict with Marduk nadin ahhe in Babylonia continued under Ashur bel kala though it was eventually resolved diplomatically After the death of Marduk nadin ahhe s successor Marduk shapik zeri in c BC Ashur bel kala was even able to intervene and install the unrelated Adad apla iddina as king of Babylon Adad apla iddina s daughter then married Ashur bel kala bringing peace to the two kingdoms Though he shared his father s ambition and claimed the title lord of all after his victorious campaigns in Syria Babylonia and the northeastern mountains Ashur bel kala was ultimately unable to surpass Tiglath Pileser and his successes were built on shaky foundations br br br Second period of decline br br br Century of crisis br br Ashur bel kala s son and successor Eriba Adad II r BC and generations of kings thereafter were unable to maintain the achievements of their predecessors The period of decline initiated after Ashur bel kala s death was not reversed until the middle of the th century BC Though this period is poorly documented it is clear that Assyria underwent a major crisis br Although Assyria was only marginally affected by the Late Bronze Age collapse the collapse caused great changes in the geopolitics of the lands surrounding Assyria In large part the power vacuum left by the Hittites and Egyptians in Anatolia and the Levant allowed various ethno tribal communities and states to take their place In northern Anatolia and northern Syria the Luwians seized power forming the Syro Hittite states In Syria the Arameans grew increasingly prominent In Palestine the Philistines and Israelites carved out realms of their own eventually coalescing into the Kingdom of Israel Though cuneiform had previously been the main writing system of these regions the rise of new peoples and realms led to cuneiform being replaced in the west by more simple alphabetic writing systems Out of the new players on the scene the Arameans through their at times eastward movements had the most effect on Assyria Documents as old as from the reign of Tiglath Pileser I demonstrate that even at that early stage Aramean raids penetrated deep into the Assyrian heartland at one point reaching Assur itself The Arameans were tribal and their attacks were uncoordinated raids carried out by individual groups As such Assyrian kings were able to defeat several Aramean groups in battle The guerilla tactics and ability of the Arameans to quickly withdraw into difficult terrain however prevented Assyrian armies from ever achieving a lasting decisive victory From the death of Ashurnasirpal I r BC to the end of the Middle Assyrian period more than a century later no surviving Assyrian royal inscriptions describe any military activities whatsoever Though kings from this time such as Shalmaneser II r BC and Ashur rabi II r BC used names that proudly echoed those of earlier successful rulers suggesting a desire to restore old glory later Assyrian documents saw this time as one of painful losses of territory By BC Assyria was at the low point of its power with many previously large settlements lying in ruins and local rulers battling new tribal chiefs for control of lands that were previously part of the empire The Assyrian heartland continued to remain intact however protected due to its geographical remoteness br br br Beginning of the Assyrian reconquista br br The Assyrian kings never ceased to believe that the lost lands would eventually be retaken In the end the collapse of the Hittites and the Egyptian lands in the Levant benefitted Assyria with the old empires shattered the fragmented territories surrounding the Assyrian heartland would eventually prove to be easy conquests for the Assyrian army The reign of Ashur dan II r BC effectively terminated the poorly documented second period of Middle Assyrian decline Multiple inscriptions survive from Ashur dan s time several of which describe campaigns in the peripheries of the Assyrian heartland illustrating that Assyrian power was beginning to resurge Ashur dan s campaigns were mainly focused on the northeast and northwest Among the victories recorded in his inscriptions was the conquest of Katmu u which once again had gained independence during the decline According to the inscription Ashur dan captured Katmu u razed the city s royal palace brought its king to Arbela flayed and executed him and then displayed his skin on the wall of one of his cities Assyrian reconquest meant that a high level of threat had to be established in order to keep the vassals in line an explanation for the brutality and violence of certain acts such as Ashur dan s treatment of the defeated king committed by the Assyrian kings The descriptions of such acts in inscriptions do not necessarily reflect the truth given that they also served as intimidating tools for propaganda and psychological warfare br The campaigns of Ashur dan paved the way of grander efforts to restore and expand Assyrian power beginning in the reign of his son and successor Adad nirari II r BC whose accession conventionally marks the beginning of the succeeding Neo Assyrian Empire Although historically sometimes treated as a separate and distinct entity from the Middle Assyrian Empire the Neo Assyrian Empire was clearly the direct continuation of the Middle Assyrian civilization given that the line of kings and inhabitation of the Assyrian heartland was continuous The inscriptions of early Neo Assyrian kings typically treat their wars of expansions as reconquests of territory lost during the decline of the Middle Assyrian Empire br br br Government br br br Kingship br br br Power and role br br In the preceding Old Assyrian period the Assyrian government was in many respects an oligarchy with the king being a permanent but not the only prominent actor presiding over the meetings of Assur s main administrative body the city assembly Perhaps partly inspired by the period of more autocratic rule when Assur was under the rule of the Amorite conqueror Shamshi Adad I c BC the influence of the city assembly had disappeared by the time of Ashur uballit I s accession Although the old traditional royal title i iak A ur governor on behalf of Ashur continued to be used at times throughout the period the Middle Assyrian kings had little in common with their Old Assyrian predecessors and were very much sole rulers As Assyria s power grew the kings began to employ an increasingly sophisticated array of royal titles far more autocratic in nature than the old i iak A ur Ashur uballit I was the first to assume the style ar m t A ur king of the land of Ashur and his grandson Arik den ili introduced the style arru dannu strong king The kings during Assyria s first major phase of expansion accelerated the adoption of new titles Adad nirari I s inscriptions required lines to be devoted just to his titles which included among others n r dapn ti umm n ka qut lullum u ubar defeater of the aggressive armies of the Kassites Qut Lullumu and ubaru akanki il ni appointee of the gods and rub u ellu holy prince The development reached its peak under the wide ranging Tukulti Ninurta I who used various styles denoting the size of his domain such as king of Assyria and Karduniash king of Sumer and Akkad king of the Upper and the Lower Seas and king of all peoples Royal titles and epithets were often highly reflective of current political developments and the achievements of individual kings during the periods of decline the royal titles used typically grew more simple again only to grow grander once more as Assyrian power experienced resurgences br In addition to their roles as military leaders the kings were religiously significant Already in the Old Assyrian period the kings were regarded to be the stewards of the Assyrian national deity Ashur though this began to manifest itself even more in the Middle Assyrian period The earliest Assyrian king known to have explicitly referred to himself as a priest ang was Adad nirari I who among his titles used the epithet ang ru a Enlil exalted priest of the god Enlil Several sources emphasize the Assyrian king being close to Ashur and their role as intermediaries between Ashur and mankind The king was expected to in conjunction with the Assyrian people provide offerings to the god Middle Assyrian kings were also expected to care for all the other gods Shalmaneser I in his inscriptions mentions that he provided offerings for all of the gods From the time of Ashur resh ishi I onwards the religious and cultic duties of the king were pushed somewhat into the background though they were still prominently mentioned in accounts of building and restoring temples Assyrian titles and epithets in inscriptions from then on generally emphasize the kings as powerful warriors br Middle Assyrian kings were the supreme judicial authority in the empire though they generally appear to have been less concerned with their role as judges than their predecessors in the Old Assyrian period were The kings were however expected to ensure the welfare and prosperity of the Assyrian lands and people often referring to themselves as shepherds re Middle Assyrian royal inscriptions also pay special attention to public works with the building and repairs of temples being the primary concern but construction of other works such as palaces also being mentioned When rebuilding or constructing buildings the kings often laid down foundation deposits with their names Later rulers were expected to honor the works of their predecessors and anyone who did not was cursed One of Tukulti Ninurta s foundation deposits relating to the construction of Kar Tukulti Ninurta included the message He who destroys that wall discards my monumental inscriptions and my inscribed name abandons Kar Tukulti Ninurta my capital and neglects it may the god Ashur my lord overthrow his sovereignty smash his weapons bring about the defeat of his army diminish his borders decree the end of his reign darken his days vitiate his years and destroy his name and his seed from the land br br br Royal palaces and attendants br br Middle Assyrian royal palaces were prominent symbols of royal power and the centers and main institutions of the Assyrian government Though the main palace was located in Assur kings had palaces at several different sites which they often traveled between The most important surviving source concerning Middle Assyrian royal palaces are the Middle Assyrian palace decrees a set of documents composed either late in the reign of Tiglath Pileser I or in the reigns of his immediate successors These documents contain a large number of regulations on the personnel of the palaces and their roles and duties in particular the women These regulations differentiate between the wife of the king a at arre what modern historians would term the queen and a group of palace women sinniltu a ekalle i e a royal harem composed of women of lower rank The life and court politics within the palaces followed strict rules overseen by a council of appointed office holders closely linked to the royal court Officials included provincial governors b l p ete palace administrators rab ekalle palace heralds n gir ekalle chief supervisors rab z riqe and physicians of the Inner Quarters as a bet n These councilors supervised the conduct of other courtiers who were divided into a r i and mazz z p ni The meaning of these designations are poorly understood and some individuals are attested with both It is possible that the a r i were eunuchs though this is disputed The mazz z p ni may have been close friends and confidants of the king br The surviving palace decrees deal with rules and daily lives of the people who lived in the palaces They include texts concerning admission requirements for male personnel and whether they should have access to the harem the proper behavior of the palace women both within and outside the palaces custody of property and dispute resolution Among the Middle Assyrian kings Ninurta apal Ekur was responsible for a particularly large amount of decrees perhaps because he wished to restore order after his usurpation of the throne Curiously one of his decrees is that any palace woman who crused a descendant of Tukulti Ninurta should be mutilated despite Ninurta apal Ekur having taken the throne by force from Enlil kudurri usur the last of Tukulti Ninurta I s descendants to rule Assyria br The chief administrator of the palaces were the stewards ma ennu identified in writings as great stewards ma ennu rabi u from the late th century BC onwards to distinguish from stewards of smaller households The stewards were in charge of the large storage facilities of the palaces where craftsmen produced various products gathered from raw materials The stewards also served as organizers of long distance trade Their main duty was to provide the palaces with metals animals animal skins and luxury goods such as jewelry wooden objects textiles and perfume br br br Administration br br br Royal administration and provincial framework br br Recognized as the intermediary between mankind and the gods the Assyrian king was the head of the administration of Assyria during the Middle Assyrian period Though there is no evidence that the Middle Assyrian kings had a cabinet of his highest officials as might have been the case in the succeeding Neo Assyrian period the kings did surround themselves with a group of counselors that advised on politics and decisions Among the most prominent such counselors were the viziers sukkallu who at times involved themselves in diplomatic matters From at least the time of Shalmaneser I onwards there were also grand viziers sukkallu rabi u superior to the ordinary viziers who often also served as vassal rulers of the lands of the former Mitanni kingdom The grand viziers were typically members of the royal family Like many other administrative and bureaucratic offices the position was hereditary with sons succeeding their fathers Other bureaucrats were drawn from the a r i of the palaces and were tasked with various fields of responsibility to aid the king in keeping contact with various institutions throughout the empire including keeping track of crop yields and the number of farm animals allocating royal gifts certifying private sales of land and noting down amounts of tribute prisoners of war and levies If they so wished the king could intervene at any level at any time either in person through a command by issuing a decree or by sending a representative The most powerful officials had representatives of their own termed qep br The territory of the Middle Assyrian Empire was divided into a set of provinces or districts p utu first attested during the reign of Ashur uballit I In some th century BC sources there also appears another type of subdivision the al u fortifications districts but these were soon thereafter replaced completely with p utu The number of provinces changed as the territory of Assyria expanded and contracted with the highest number of provinces being recorded in the reign of Tukulti Ninurta I Each province was headed by a provincial governor bel p ete who was responsible for the local economy and public safety and order Another important task of the governors was to store and distribute the goods produced in the province which were inspected and collected by royal representatives once a year Through this system the central government remained informed about current stocks of supplies throughout the empire The governors also supervised local craftsmen and farmers organizing their activities and ensuring that they had enough food and other supplies to live If rations were low governors requested support from the king and other governors and were in turn required to provide such support for others as well In addition to taxes provinces had to supply offerings to the god Ashur marking their affiliation and allegiance to the Assyrian government The offerings were quite small and mainly symbolic br br br Non provincial territories br br Some regions of the Assyrian realm were outside of the provincial framework but still subject to the Assyrian kings these included vassal states ruled by lesser kings such as the Mitanni lands governed by the grand viziers Under the provincial governors cities also had their own administrations headed by mayors azi nu appointed by the kings but representing the local city elite Similar to the governors though less important the mayors were mostly responsible for local economy including overseeing rations agriculture and organization of labor br The Assyrians also employed what they referred to as the ilku system not entirely unlike the feudalism of Medieval Europe the Assyrian kings had claims to most of the empire s lands including private property so in turn for providing attendants and personnel with arable lands to sustain themselves the kings expected their service in return The extent and nature of these services varied and was determined by the royal administration If a landowner died or refused their agreed upon duties his families could lose the lands they had been given It is not clear what factors determined the nature of the services nor what determined how much land a particular individual or family were given The most high ranking officials were typically provided with large states perhaps including entire villages and their people In theory the system ensured close links between landowners and their land but numerous factors destabilized the system These included that the duties did not have to be exercised in person but could be fulfilled by paying money or by sending a representative and that lands could be sold to a purchaser who then had to take on the duties the previous owner had been demanded to undertake Over long periods of time this meant that the connection between duties and overseeing the land allotted was severed br Some influential Assyrian officials were as rewards for their services granted dunnu settlements large estates that functioned as large farmsteads and were exempt from taxation on their produce Such estates are most common in the empire s western territories were local governors and representatives required greater autonomy to deal with local geopolitics and challenges The most well known site today that at one point functioned as a dunnu estate is Tell Sabi Abyad Documents describe the estate as a large agricultural one comprising about hectares and employing around free farmers and their families as well as unfree iluhlu farmers and their families br br br Taxation and recruitment br br In order for the large construction projects and military activities of the Middle Assyrian kings to have been possible the Middle Assyrian Empire employed a sophisticated system of recruiting and administering personnel To keep track of and administer the diverse people under imperial control a specific type of waxed tablets dubbed le n le in singular form were employed These tablets attested from the time of Adad nirari I onwards summarized data on the available manpower calculated required rations and provisions and documented responsibilities and tasks According to administrative records on construction work at the royal palaces of Kar Tukulti Ninurta and Assur these projects were completed with workforces of about men divided into recruits from various cities ur du mostly gathered through the ilku system engineers or architects alimp ju carpenters and religious functionaries br The taxation system of the Middle Assyrian Empire is not yet fully understood Though tax collectors are known to have existed records of taxes being collected and what these were are lacking the only currently confidently attested direct tax paid by individuals was an import tax levied on imports of goods from foreign states In at least one case this tax amounted to about percent of the purchase price Some documents also mention the gin u tax which had some connection to the provincial governments Other economically important sources of money for the empire included plundering conquered territories which reduced the cost of the campaign that had conquered them continuous tribute madattu from vassal states as well as audience gifts n murtu from foreign rulers and powerful individuals These gifts could sometimes be carry large value for the empire itself one documents attests that a gift given to Ninurta tukulti Ashur while he was still a prince in the reign of his father Ashur dan I included sheep br br br Military br br There was no standing army in the Middle Assyrian period Instead the majority of soldiers used for military engagements were mobilized only when they were needed such as for civil projects or in the time of campaigns Large amounts of soldiers could be recruited and mobilized relative quickly on the basis of legal obligations and regulations It is impossible to ascertain from the surviving inscriptions the extent to which Middle Assyrian levies were trained for their tasks but it is unlikely that the Assyrian army would be able to be as successful as it was in the reigns of figures like Tukulti Ninurta I and Tiglath Pileser I without trained soldiers In addition to the levies who are called ur du or b ur d tu in the inscriptions there was also a more experienced class of professional soldiers called the b ka r tu It is not clear what exactly separated the b ka r tu from the other soldiers perhaps the term included some certain branches of the army such as archers and charioteers who required more extensive training than normal foot soldiers probably part of the b ur d tu It is also clear from inscriptions that bands of mercenaries were recruited for some campaigns br br The foot soldiers appear to have been divided into the s b a kakk weapon troops and the s b a ar t shield bearing troops Surviving inscriptions do not specify what kind of weaponry these soldiers carried In lists of the troops in armies the s b a kakk appear opposite the chariots whereas the s b a ar t appear opposite to the archers It is possible that the s b a kakk included ranged troops such as slingers b a u pe and archers b a qalte The chariots were a separate component of the army Based on surviving depictions chariots were crewed by two soldiers an archer who commanded the chariot m ru damqu and a driver a mugerre Chariots were not used extensively before the time of Tiglath Pileser I who put particular emphasis on the chariots not just as a combat unit but also as the vehicle to be used by the king Clear evidence of the special strategic importance of chariots comes from chariots forming their own branch of the army whereas cavalry a pet alle did not When used cavalry was often simply employed for escorting or message deliveries Further specialized combat roles existed including the sappers a n pe e particularly useful at sieges br Military officials and generals included individuals appointed to positions termed sukkallu sukkallu rabi u tartennu and n giru Generals were generally recruited from officials in the royal administration not the common soldiers Some appointed generals used the title ki ri captain The personnel of the baggage train not partaking in active combat also included a variety of people with different positions and duties br br br Society br br br Population and culture br br br Social classes br br Because of the limited surviving material information regarding social life and living conditions of the Middle Assyrian period is generally available in detail only for the socio economic elite and upper classes of society At the top of Middle Assyrian society were members of long established and large families called houses who tended to occupy the most important offices within the government These houses were in many cases the descendants of the most prominent merchant families of the Old Assyrian period It is clear from surviving documents that corruption among royal officials who at times used the resources provided to them by the Assyrian government to generate private profits was a large problem Corruption was viewed as high treason with officials accused of using royal funds for their own personal gain simultaneously being accused of hating the king On the other hand officials were at times expected to provide some of their own personal funds to public institutions if the king commanded them to In addition to the funds granted to them by the government high officials could generate money in various other ways They could for instance loan money to private individuals and charge highly unfavorable interests sometimes amounting to up to percent in addition to demanding goods such as sheep and vessels Another source of income was gifts ulman i e bribes from private individuals In exchange for money many officials are recorded to have paid extra attention to certain requests made to them or to the royal administration br The majority of the population who did not belong to the upper class had a much lower standard of living The highest group in terms of classes was the free men a l who like the upper classes could receive land in exchange for performing duties for the government but who could not live on these lands since they were comparably small Below them were the iluhlu or unfree men These people were men who had given up their freedom and entered into the service mainly agricultural of others on their own accord who were in turn provided with rations and clothes Many of them likely also originated as prisoners of war and foreign deportees It was possible for a iluhlu to regain their freedom by providing a substitute who could then fulfill their obligations Though not wholly different from slavery surviving documents demonstrate that the iluhlu were not considered property of their employers but rather of the Assyrian government In one instance royal officials are explicitly recorded to have intervened after the death of an employer of iluhlu to distribute their contracts among his sons and an apparently unrelated individual Other members of clearly lower social classes included the village residents l y also depended on the owner of the land they lived on as well as the lik ilke people providing services through the ilku system and hup u people though their position standing and living standards vis vis each other is not clear br br br Families and position of women br br Some information on families and living conditions in the Middle Assyrian Empire can be gathered from the preserved Middle Assyrian Laws as well as from surviving lists of rations and censuses The norm was that families were relatively small in size In addition to family members many households employed various servants Such servants could be either bought or provided by the Assyrian government Marriage was rarely decided between the prospective spouses but instead the result of negotiations between their families Polygamy was practised by Assyrians as well as by foreign groups in the empire such as the Hurrians and Elamites though many monogamous families are also attested Censuses and ration lists record members of families by age and sex chiefly due to this aiding in calculating how much rations should be provided to each family The head of a household was generally the father but in the case the father was dead and his eldest son was not yet old enough to take over the role the mother could also act as a representative of the household br The social position of women in the Middle Assyrian Empire can be examined in detail due to the laws concerning them in the Middle Assyrian Laws These laws include punishment for various crimes often sexual or marital ones Women s rights in the Middle Assyrian Empire appear to have decreased somewhat since the Old Assyrian period when women and men had little difference in legal standing and by and large the same legal rights While out in the street many women including widows wives and concubines were obligated by law to wear veils It is uncertain whether these laws were ever strongly enforced Many women were also prohibited from wearing veils Certain priestesses identified as qadiltu priestesses were only allowed to wear veils if they were married Slave women and prostitutes ar mt were not allowed to wear veils in any circumstance Children born of a concubine or someone who was not the primary wife were lower in status but could still inherit money and property if the main marriage remained childless The status of widowed women depended on whether they were the main or secondary wife and on whether they had children The Middle Assyrian Laws specify that a woman who lost her husband as a prisoner of war was expected to wait for two years if she had a father in law or a son to support her she was given no support from the government but if she was alone and her husband had been a free man she could appeal for government support by making an application to the judges da an royal officials who were obligated to help her br br br Ethnic groups br br The expansion of the Middle Assyrian Empire combined with deportations and movements of conquered peoples led to contact between the Assyrians of the Assyrian heartland and foreign groups growing closer The most prominent foreign ethnic groups within the Middle Assyrian Empire were the Hurrians incorporated through conquests in northern Syria Kassites descendants of deportees and captives from the Babylonian campaigns and Arameans Though many Aramean tribes were fought by the Assyrian kings others traded with the Assyrians and several Aramean tribes towards the end of the Middle Assyrian period had begun to settle and become well established within Assyrian borders People belonging to foreign ethnic groups often contributed with manpower being employed in construction projects Though most of them appear to have held inferior positions in society they also contributed to Assyrian cultural developments with their own cultural traditions br Ancient Assyrian civilization was relatively open in regards to what an Assyrian was with a person s fulfillment of obligations such as military service their affiliation to the Assyrian Empire and their loyalty to the Assyrian king being the primary factors of being seen as Assyrians rather than language or ethnic background As such there was likely several instances of gradual assimilation of some conquered peoples who after just a few generations may not have identified as anything other than Assyrians br br br Language br br The ancient Assyrians primarily spoke and wrote the Assyrian language a Semitic language i e related to modern Hebrew and Arabic closely related to Babylonian spoken in southern Mesopotamia Both Assyrian and Babylonian are generally regarded by modern scholars to be distinct dialects of the Akkadian language This is a modern convention as contemporary ancient authors considered Assyrian and Babylonian to be two separate languages only Babylonian was referred to as akkad m with Assyrian being referred to as a ur or a ur yu Though both were written with cuneiform script the signs look quite different and can be distinguished relatively easily br The Middle Assyrian textual record is somewhat spotty and what is known mainly comes from libraries in Assur and Kar Tukulti Ninurta As such many stages of the language still poorly documented Though a large number of texts are known from the th and th centuries BC texts from after the reign of Tiglath Pileser I are very rare The Middle Assyrian form of the Assyrian language was not the only language to be employed in the Middle Assyrian Empire Though most often used in letters legal documents and administrative documents the contemporary Babylonian dialect was often used for royal inscriptions and literature In Middle Assyrian texts from the royal archives the most official documents such as laws decrees and descriptions of coronations are all written in the Middle Assyrian language with Babylonian as in other cases being reserved only for royal inscriptions and literature In some scholarly sources from the Middle Assyrian period the ancient Sumerian language was employed alongside more modern versions of Akkadian br br br Road system br br A sophisticated Assyrian imperial road system was created in the Middle Assyrian period Though extensive road systems must have been employed in older civilizations as well such as by the Hittites and Egyptians the Middle Assyrian road system is the as of yet the earliest known such road system in the Ancient Near East its creation perhaps stemming from the trading expertise of the Assyrians in the preceding Old Assyrian period The road system of the Middle Assyrian Empire was the direct precursor of the sophisticated road systems of the succeeding Neo Assyrian Neo Babylonian and Achaemenid empires br The Middle Assyrian road system was mainly established through creating facilities along existing routes Contemporary Assyrian sources refer to the network of roads as harran sarri the king s roads Construction of new roads and extensive renovations of old roads appear to have been rather limited probably because it was not needed since the ancient roads in the region were still in good condition Only two stone bridges are securely attested to have been built in this period one at Khorsabad and the other at Nineveh with wooden bridges perhaps being used in other places The new facilities relay stations or rest stops provided nourishment accommodation for travellers and additional horses if the need arose Though the distance between stations is not entirely clear from the surviving sources it appears that many stations were placed at distances from each other equal to about a day s journey by chariot perhaps amounting to intervals of about kilometers miles br The road system was an important factor in Middle Assyrian success as it improved communication channels within the empire The most frequent users of the roads at least in terms of appearances in the surviving source material were members of the Assyrian administration couriers of officials and royal messengers sometimes accompanied by an escort for protection The roads are also known to have been used by foreign messengers and by private individuals not associated with the Assyrian government due to their appearances in documents describing the rations provided to them Many travellers travelled in carriages or chariots but many also travelled on foot br br br Religion br br The Assyrians worshipped the same pantheon of gods as the Babylonians in southern Mesopotamia The chief Assyrian deity was the national deity Ashur Though the deity and the city are commonly distinguished by modern historians through calling the god Ashur and the city Assur both were inscribed in the exact same way in ancient times A ur In documents from the preceding Old Assyrian period the city and god are often not clearly differentiated which suggests that Ashur originated sometime in the Early Assyrian period as a deified personification of the city itself Ashur s role as a deity was flexible and changed with the changing culture and politics of the Assyrians themselves In the Old Assyrian period Ashur was mainly regarded as a god of death and revival related to agriculture In the Middle Assyrian Empire Ashur s role had been thoroughly altered Possibly originating as a reaction to the period of suzerainty under the Mittani kingdom Middle Assyrian theology presented Ashur as a god of war who bestowed the Assyrian kings not only with divine legitimacy something retained from the Old Assyrian period but also commanded the kings to enlarge the land of Ashur with Ashur s just scepter i e expand the Assyrian Empire through military conquest br br It is possible that the dominant military role of Ashur in the Middle Assyrian period was the result of the theology promulgated by the Amorite conqueror Shamshi Adad I who conquered Assur in the th century BC Shamshi Adad replaced the decaying original temple of Ashur in Assur with a new temple dedicated to the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon Enlil Since Shamshi Adad also respected Ashur and his temple was in later times used as a temple of Ashur it is probable that Shamshi Adad equated Enlil with Ashur This equation might have been what resulted in later Assyrians viewing Ashur as king of the gods a role previous civilizations in both northern and southern Mesopotamia ascribed to Enlil The development of equating Ashur with Enlil or at least transferring Enlil s role to Ashur was parallelled in Babylon where the previously unimportant local god Marduk was elevated in the reign of Hammurabi th century BC to the head of the pantheon modeled after Enlil br The importance and implications of the equation of Ashur with Enlil the old Sumerian king of the gods is first apparent in the Middle Assyrian period The goods sent by every province of the Middle Assyrian Empire to Assur to be a part of the offerings to Ashur demonstrates that it was seen as important that the basic care of the god was jointly carried out by every part of the empire This helps explain why the empire as a whole was designated as m t A ur the land of Ashur since all parts of the land fed the god and the god in turn embodied the land All parts of an empire donating goods for offering was not a new idea it had for instance been employed under the Third Dynasty of Ur c BC though in that case the offerings were sent to Nippur and were for Enlil The development of Ashur into a unifying god for the entire empire through the offerings likely strengthened Assyrian identity among all social classes as it brought them together as people of the god br br br See also br br History of Mesopotamia br List of Mesopotamian dynasties br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography
