id: 15341790
The Fauna of Africa in its broader sense is all the animals living in Africa and its surrounding seas and islands The more characteristic African fauna is found in the Afro tropical realm Lying almost entirely within the tropics and equally to north and south of the equator creates favorable conditions for rich wildlife Africa is home to many of the world s most famous fauna in human culture such as lions leopards cheetahs Spotted hyenas African wild dog African elephants hippos rhinos Nile crocodile Nile monitor African rock python Black mamba Gaboon viper Forest cobra African spurred tortoises African bullfrog African civet Honey badger Meerkats Banded mongoose African clawless otters Ground pangolins Aardvark Crested porcupines Caracal Serval African wildcat Black backed jackal Bat eared foxs Gorillas Mandrills Baboons Chimpanzees Vervet monkeys Common warthogs giraffes African buffalo Blue wildebeest zebras Thomson s gazelles Impala Kudus East African oryx Nyala Waterbucks Hartebeest antelope African fish eagles Crowned eagles White backed vulture African scops owl Pygmy falcon North African ostrich Grey crowned crane Saddle billed stork Marabou stork Shoebill African spoonbill Black headed heron Greater flamingo Namaqua sandgrouse African penguins and among many others br br br Origins and history of African fauna br Whereas the earliest traces of life in fossil record of Africa date back to the earliest times the formation of African fauna as we know it today began with the splitting up of the Gondwana supercontinent in the mid Mesozoic era br After that four to six faunal assemblages the so called African Faunal Strata AFSs can be distinguished The isolation of Africa was broken intermittently by discontinuous filter routes that linked it to some other Gondwanan continents Madagascar South America and perhaps India but mainly to Laurasia Interchanges with Gondwana were rare and mainly out of Africa dispersals whereas interchanges with Laurasia were numerous and bidirectional although mainly from Laurasia to Africa Despite these connections isolation resulted in remarkable absences poor diversity and emergence of endemic taxa in Africa Madagascar separated from continental Africa during the break up of Gondwanaland early in the Cretaceous but was probably connected to the mainland again in the Eocene br The first Neogene faunal interchange took place in the Middle Miocene the introduction of Myocricetodontinae Democricetodontinae and Dendromurinae A major terrestrial faunal exchange between North Africa and Europe began at about Ma some Myr before the beginning of the Messinian salinity crisis for example introduction of Murinae immigrants from southern Asia br During the early Tertiary Africa was covered by a vast evergreen forest inhabited by an endemic forest fauna with many types common to southern Asia In the Pliocene the climate became dry and most of the forest was destroyed the forest animals taking refuge in the remaining forest islands At the same time a broad land bridge connected Africa with Asia and there was a great invasion of animals of the steppe fauna into Africa At the beginning of the Pleistocene a moist period set in and much of the forest was renewed while the grassland fauna was divided and isolated as the forest fauna had previously been The present forest fauna is therefore of double origin partly descended of the endemic fauna and partly from steppe forms that adapted themselves to forest life while the present savanna fauna is similarly explained The isolation in past times has resulted in the presence of closely related subspecies in widely separated regions Africa where humans originated shows much less evidence of loss in the Pleistocene megafaunal extinction perhaps because co evolution of large animals alongside early humans provided enough time for them to develop effective defenses Its situation in the tropics spared it also from Pleistocene glaciations and the climate has not changed much br br br Invertebrates br br There are large gaps in human knowledge about African invertebrates East Africa has a rich coral fauna with about known species More than species of Echinoderms and species of Bryozoa live there too as well as one Cubozoan species Carybdea alata Of Nematodes the Onchocerca volvulus Necator americanus Wuchereria bancrofti and Dracunculus medinensis are human parasites Some of important plant parasitic nematodes of crops include Meloidogyne Pratylenchus Hirschmanniella Radopholus Scutellonema and Helicotylenchus Of the few Onychophorans Peripatopsis and Opisthopatus live in Africa Greatest diversity of freshwater mollusks is found in East African lakes Of marine snails less diversity is present in Atlantic coast more in tropical Western Indian Ocean region over species of gastropods with endemic species Cowry shells have been used as a money by native Africans The land snail fauna is especially rich in Afromontane regions and there are some endemic families in Africa e g Achatinidae Chlamydephoridae but other tropical families are common too Charopidae Streptaxidae Cyclophoridae Subulinidae Rhytididae br tardigrade species have been found and about species of arachnids The African millipede Archispirostreptus gigas is one of the largest in the world genera of freshwater crabs are present br The soil animal communities tropical Africa are poorly known A few ecological studies have been undertaken on macrofauna mainly in West Africa Earthworms are being extensively studied in West and South Africa br br br Insects br br Approximately species of insects have been described from Sub Saharan Africa but there are very few overviews of the fauna as a whole it has been estimated that the African insects make up about of the global insect species richness and about of new species descriptions come from Afrotropics The only endemic African insect order is Mantophasmatodea br About African species of dragonflies have been recorded br The migratory locust and desert locust have been serious threats to African economies and human welfare br Africa has the biggest number of termite genera of all continents and over termite species br Of Diptera the number of described African species is about Natalimyzidae a new family of acalyptrate flies has been recently described from South Africa Anopheles gambiae Aedes aegypti and Tsetse fly are important vectors of diseases br species of bees and species of ants among other Hymenopterans are known from Africa br There live also species of butterflies being the best known group of insects The caterpillars of mopani moth are part of the South African cuisine Among the numerous species of African beetles are the famous sacred scarab the centaurus beetle manticora tiger beetles and enormous Goliath beetles br br br Butterflies br br Hotspots for butterflies include the Congolian forests and the Guinean forest savanna mosaic Some butterflies Hamanumida daedalus Precis Eurema are grassland or savannah specialists Many of these have very large populations and a vast range South Africa has one of the highest proportions of Lycaenid butterflies for any region in the world with many species restricted in range North Africa is in the Palaearctic region and has a different species assemblage br Genera which are species rich in Africa include Charaxes Acraea Colotis and Papilio most notably Papilio antimachus and Papilio zalmoxis The tribe Liptenini is endemic to the Afrotropics and includes species rich genera such as Ornipholidotos Liptenara Pentila Baliochila Hypophytala Teriomima Deloneura and Mimacraea The Miletinae are mostly African notably Lachnocnema Other endemic lycaenids include the genus Alaena Endemic Nymphalidae include Euphaedra Bebearia Heteropsis Precis Pseudacraea Bicyclus and Euxanthe Endemic Pieridae include Pseudopontia paradoxa and Mylothris Endemic skippers include Sarangesaand Kedestes The highest species diversity is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo home to species of which are endemic br br br Fish br br Africa is the richest continent of freshwater fish with about species The East African Great Lakes Victoria Malawi and Tanganyika are the center of biodiversity of many fish especially cichlids they harbor more than two thirds of the estimated species in the family The West African coastal rivers region covers only a fraction of West Africa but harbours of West Africa s fish species with being restricted to this area and being restricted to even smaller ranges The central river s fauna comprises fish species with endemics and only restricted to small areas The marine diversity is greatest near the Indian Ocean shore with about species br Characteristic to African fauna are Perciformes Lates tilapias Dichistiidae Anabantidae Mudskippers Parachanna Acentrogobius Croilia Glossogobius Hemichromis Nanochromis Oligolepis Oreochromis Redigobius Sarotherodon Stenogobius and others Gonorhynchiformes Kneriidae Phractolaemidae some lungfishes Protopterus many Characiformes Distichodontidae Hepsetidae Citharinidae

Amietia Amnirana Aubria Conraua Hildebrandtia Lanzarana Ptychadena Strongylopus Tomopterna and Pipidae Hymenochirus Pseudhymenochirus Xenopus br The Global Amphibian Assessment by IUCN Conservation International and NatureServe revealed that for only about of the Afrotropical amphibians there is least concern about their conservation status approximately species are endangered about one fourth of which are at a critical stage Almost all of the amphibians of Madagascar species are endemic to that region The West African goliath frog is the largest frog species in the world br br br Reptiles
