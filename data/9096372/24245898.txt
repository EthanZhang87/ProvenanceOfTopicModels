title: Pain in fish
id: 24245898
Fish fulfill several criteria proposed as indicating that non human animals experience pain These fulfilled criteria include a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors opioid receptors and reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics physiological changes to noxious stimuli displaying protective motor reactions exhibiting avoidance learning and making trade offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements br Whether fish feel pain similar to humans or differently is a contentious issue Pain is a complex mental state with a distinct perceptual quality but also associated with suffering which is an emotional state Because of this complexity the presence of pain in an animal or another human for that matter cannot be determined unambiguously using observational methods but the conclusion that animals experience pain is often inferred on the basis of likely presence of phenomenal consciousness which is deduced from comparative brain physiology as well as physical and behavioural reactions br If fish feel pain there are ethical and animal welfare implications including the consequences of exposure to pollutants and practices involving commercial and recreational fishing aquaculture in ornamental fish and genetically modified fish and for fish used in scientific research br br br Background br The possibility that fish and other non human animals experience pain has a long history Initially this was based around theoretical and philosophical argument but more recently has turned to scientific investigation br br br Philosophy br br The idea that non human animals might not feel pain goes back to the th century French philosopher Ren Descartes who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness In the British philosopher and social reformist Jeremy Bentham addressed in his book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation the issue of our treatment of animals with the following often quoted words The question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer br Charles Darwin said that The lower animals like man manifestly feel pleasure and pain happiness and misery br Peter Singer a bioethicist and author of Animal Liberation published in suggested that consciousness is not necessarily the key issue just because animals have smaller brains or are less conscious than humans does not mean that they are not capable of feeling pain He goes on further to argue that we do not assume newborn infants people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain than we would br Bernard Rollin the principal author of two U S federal laws regulating pain relief for animals writes that researchers remained unsure into the s as to whether animals experience pain and veterinarians trained in the U S before were taught to simply ignore animal pain In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians Rollin was regularly asked to prove that animals are conscious and to provide scientifically acceptable grounds for claiming that they feel pain br Continuing into the s discussions were further developed on the roles that philosophy and science had in understanding animal cognition and mentality In subsequent years it was argued there was strong support for the suggestion that some animals most likely amniotes have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings and that the view animals feel pain differently to humans is now a minority view br br br Scientific investigation br br In the th and st centuries there were many scientific investigations of pain in non human animals br Dr Lynne Sneddon with her colleagues Braithwaite and Gentle were the first to discover nociceptors pain receptors in fish She stated that fish demonstrate pain related changes in physiology and behaviour that are reduced by painkillers and they show higher brain activity when painfully stimulated Professor Victoria Braithwaite in her book Do Fish Feel Pain wrote that fish like birds and mammals have a capacity for self awareness and can feel pain Donald Broom Professor of Animal Welfare Cambridge University England said that most mammalian pain systems are also found in fish who can feel fear and have emotions which are controlled in the fish brain in areas anatomically different but functionally very similar to those in mammals br The American Veterinary Medical Association accepts that fish feel pain saying that the evidence supports the position that fish should be accorded the same considerations as terrestrial vertebrates concerning relief from pain br The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Britain commissioned in an independent panel of experts They concluded that it was reasonable to believe that all vertebrates are capable of suffering to some degree or another RSPCA Australia more recently added that evidence that fish are capable of experiencing pain and suffering has been growing for some years br The European Union Panel on Animal Health and Welfare European Food Safety Authority said that the balance of evidence indicates that some fish species can experience pain The British Farm Animal Welfare Committee s report Opinion on the Welfare of Farmed Fish said that the scientific consensus is that fish can detect and respond to noxious stimuli and experience pain br br br Mammals br In studies were published showing that arthritic rats self select analgesic opiates br In the veterinary Journal of Small Animal Practice published an article on the recognition of pain which started The ability to experience pain is universally shared by all mammals and in it was reported in the science journal Pain that several mammalian species rat mouse rabbit cat and horse adopt a facial expression in response to a noxious stimulus that is consistent with the expression of pain in humans br br br Birds br At the same time as the investigations using arthritic rats studies were published showing that birds with gait abnormalities self select for a diet that contains carprofen a human analgesic In it was written Avian pain is likely analogous to pain experienced by most mammals and in it is accepted that birds perceive and respond to noxious stimuli and that birds feel pain br br br Reptiles and amphibians br Veterinary articles have been published stating both reptiles and amphibians experience pain in a way analogous to humans and that analgesics are effective in these two classes of vertebrates br br br Argument by analogy br In the American philosopher Gary Varner reviewed the research literature on pain in animals His findings are summarised in the following table br br br Notes br br Arguing by analogy Varner claims that any animal which exhibits the properties listed in the table could be said to experience pain On that basis he concludes that all vertebrates including fish probably experience pain but invertebrates apart from cephalopods probably do not experience pain br Crustaceans br Some studies however find crustaceans do show responses consistent with signs of pain and distress br br br Experiencing pain br Although there are numerous definitions of pain almost all involve two key components br First nociception is required This is the ability to detect noxious stimuli which evoke a reflex response that rapidly moves the entire animal or the affected part of its body away from the source of the stimulus The concept of nociception does not imply any adverse subjective feeling it is a reflex action An example in humans would be the rapid withdrawal of a finger that has touched something hot the withdrawal occurs before any sensation of pain is actually experienced br The second component is the experience of pain itself or suffering the internal emotional interpretation of the nociceptive experience Again in humans this is when the withdrawn finger begins to hurt moments after the withdrawal Pain is therefore a private emotional experience Pain cannot be directly measured in other animals including other humans responses to putatively painful stimuli can be measured but not the experience itself To address this problem when assessing the capacity of other species to experience pain argument by analogy is used This is based on the principle that if an animal responds to a stimulus in a similar way to ourselves it is likely to have had an analogous experience br br br Nociception br br Nociception usually involves the transmission of a signal along a chain of nerve fibers from the site of a noxious stimulus at the periphery to the spinal cord and brain This process evokes a reflex arc response generated at the spinal cord and not involving the brain such as flinching or withdrawal of a limb Nociception is found in one form or another across all major animal taxa Nociception can be observed using modern imaging techniques and a physiological and behavioral response to nociception can often be detected However nociceptive responses can be so subtle in prey animals that trained human observers cannot perceive them whereas natural predators can and subsequently target injured individuals br br br Emotional pain br br Sometimes a distinction is made between physical pain and emotional or psychological pain Emotional pain is the pain experienced in the absence of physical trauma for example the pain experienced by humans after the loss of a loved one or the break up of a relationship It has been argued that only primates and humans can feel emotional pain because they are the only animals that have a neocortex a part of the brain s cortex considered to be the thinking area However research has provided evidence that monkeys dogs cats and birds can show signs of emotional pain and display behaviours associated with depression during or after a painful experience specifically a lack of motivation lethargy anorexia and unresponsiveness to other animals br br br Physical pain br br The nerve impulses of the nociception response may be conducted to the brain thereby registering the location intensity quality and unpleasantness of the stimulus This subjective component of pain involves conscious awareness of both the sensation and the unpleasantness the aversive negative affect The brain processes underlying conscious awareness of the unpleasantness suffering are not well understood br There have been several published lists of criteria for establishing whether non human animals experience pain e g Some criteria that may indicate the potential of another species including fishes to feel pain include br br Has a suitable nervous system and sensory receptors br Has opioid receptors and shows reduced responses to noxious stimuli when given analgesics and local anaesthetics br Physiological changes to noxious stimuli br Displays protective motor reactions that might include reduced use of an affected area such as limping rubbing holding or autotomy br Shows avoidance learning br Shows trade offs between noxious stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements br High cognitive ability and sentience br br br Adaptive value br The adaptive value of nociception is obvious an organism detecting a noxious stimulus immediately withdraws the limb appendage or entire body from the noxious stimulus and thereby avoids further potential injury However a characteristic of pain in mammals at least is that pain can result in hyperalgesia a heightened sensitivity to noxious stimuli and allodynia a heightened sensitivity to non noxious stimuli When this heightened sensitisation occurs the adaptive value is less clear First the pain arising from the heightened sensitisation can be disproportionate to the actual tissue damage caused Second the heightened sensitisation may also become chronic persisting well beyond the tissues healing This can mean that rather than the actual tissue damage causing pain it is the pain due to the heightened sensitisation that becomes the concern This means the sensitisation process is sometimes termed maladaptive It is often suggested hyperalgesia and allodynia assist organisms to protect themselves during healing but experimental evidence to support this has been lacking br In the adaptive value of sensitisation due to injury was tested using the predatory interactions between longfin inshore squid Doryteuthis pealeii and black sea bass Centropristis striata which are natural predators of this squid If injured squid are targeted by a bass they began their defensive behaviours sooner indicated by greater alert distances and longer flight initiation distances than uninjured squid If anaesthetic ethanol and MgCl is administered prior to the injury this prevents the sensitisation and blocks the behavioural effect The authors claim this study is the first experimental evidence to support the argument that nociceptive sensitisation is actually an adaptive response to injuries br The question has been asked If fish cannot feel pain why do stingrays have purely defensive tail spines that deliver venom Stingrays ancestral predators are fish And why do many fishes possess defensive fin spines some also with venom that produces pain in humans br br br Research findings br br br Peripheral nervous system br br br Receptors br br Primitive fish such as lampreys Petromyzon marinus have free nerve endings in the skin that respond to heat and mechanical pressure However behavioural reactions associated with nociception have not been recorded and it is also difficult to determine whether the mechanoreceptors in lamprey are truly nociceptive specific or simply pressure specific br Nociceptors in fish were first identified in The study was designed to determine whether nociceptors were present in the trigeminal nerve on the head of the trout and to observe the physiological and behavioural consequences of prolonged noxious stimulation Rainbow trout lips were injected with acetic acid while another group were injected with bee venom These substances were chosen because protons of the acid stimulate nociceptive nerves in mammals and frogs while venom has an inflammatory effect in mammals and both are known to be painful in humans The fish exhibited abnormal behaviours such as side to side rocking and rubbing of their lips along the sides and floors of the tanks Their respiration rate increased and they reduced the amount of swimming The acid group also rubbed their lips on the gravel Rubbing an injured area to ameliorate pain has been demonstrated in humans and in other mammals Fifty eight receptors were located on the face and head of the rainbow trout Twenty two of these receptors could be classified as nociceptors as they responded to mechanical pressure and heat more than C Eighteen also reacted to acetic acid The response of the receptors to mechanical noxious thermal and chemical stimulation clearly characterised them as polymodal nociceptors They had similar properties to those found in amphibians birds and mammals including humans Trout that were injected with venom or acid took approximately hours to resume eating whereas the saline and control groups took approximately hour This may be guarding behaviour where animals avoid using a painful limb preventing continuing pain and harm being caused to the area br Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have polymodal nociceptors on the face and snout that respond to mechanical pressure temperatures in the noxious range C and acetic acid a chemical irritant Cutaneous receptors overall were found to be more sensitive to mechanical stimuli than those in mammals and birds with some responding to stimuli as low g In humans at least g is required This may be because fish skin is more easily damaged necessitating nociceptors to have lower thresholds Further studies found nociceptors to be more widely distributed over the bodies of rainbow trout as well as those of cod and carp The most sensitive areas of the body are around the eyes nostrils fleshy parts of the tail and pectoral and dorsal fins br Rainbow trout also have corneal nociceptors Out of receptors investigated in one study seven were polymodal nociceptors and six were mechanothermal nociceptors Mechanical and thermal thresholds were lower than those of cutaneous receptors indicating greater sensitivity in the cornea br Bony fish possess nociceptors that are similar in function to those in mammals br br br Nerve fibres br There are two types of nerve fibre relevant to pain in fish Group C nerve fibres are a type of sensory nerve fibre which lack a myelin sheath and have a small diameter meaning they have a low nerve conduction velocity The suffering that humans associate with burns toothaches or crushing injury are caused by C fibre activity A typical human cutaneous nerve contains Group C nerve fibres A delta fibres are another type of sensory nerve fibre however these are myelinated and therefore transmit impulses faster than non myelinated C fibres A delta fibres carry cold pressure and some pain signals and are associated with acute pain that results in pulling away from noxious stimuli br Bony fish possess both Group C and A delta fibres representing combined of the fibres in the tail nerves of common carp and of the trigeminal nerve of rainbow trout However only and of these are C fibres in the carp and rainbow trout respectively br Some species of cartilagenous fish possess A delta fibres however C fibres are either absent or br found in very low numbers The Agnatha hagfishes and lamprey primarily have Group C fibres br br br Central nervous system br br The central nervous system CNS of fish contains a spinal cord medulla oblongata and the brain divided into telencephalon diencephalon mesencephalon and cerebellum br In fish similar to other vertebrates nociception travels from the peripheral nerves along the spinal nerves and is relayed through the spinal cord to the thalamus The thalamus is connected to the telencephalon by multiple connections through the grey matter pallium which has been demonstrated to receive nerve relays for noxious and mechanical stimuli br The major tracts that convey pain information from the periphery to the brain are the spinothalamic tract body and the trigeminal tract head Both have been studied in agnathans teleost and elasmobranch fish trigeminal in the common carp br spinothalamic tract in the sea robin Prionotus carolinus br br br Brain br If sensory responses in fish are limited to the spinal cord and hindbrain they might be considered as simply reflexive However recordings from the spinal cord cerebellum tectum and telencephalon in both trout and goldfish Carassius auratus show these all respond to noxious stimuli This indicates a nociceptive pathway from the periphery to the higher CNS of fish br Microarray analysis of gene expression shows the brain is active at the molecular level in the forebrain midbrain and hindbrain of common carp and rainbow trout Several genes involved in mammalian nociception such as brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF and the cannabinoid CB receptor are regulated in the fish brain after a nociceptive event br Somatosensory evoked potentials SEPs are weak electric responses in the CNS following stimulation of peripheral sensory nerves These further indicate there is a pathway from the peripheral nociceptors to higher brain regions In goldfish rainbow trout Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and Atlantic cod Gadus morhua it has been demonstrated that putatively non noxious and noxious stimulation elicit SEPs in different brain regions including the telencephalon which may mediate the co ordination of pain information Moreover multiple functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI studies with several species of fishes have shown that when suffering from putative pain there is profound activity in the forebrain which is highly reminiscent of that observed in humans and would be taken as evidence of the experience of pain in mammals br Therefore higher brain areas are activated at the molecular physiological and functional levels in fish experiencing a potentially painful event Sneddon stated This gives much weight to the proposal that fish experience some form of pain rather than a nociceptive event br br br Opioid system and effects of analgesics br br Teleost fish have a functional opioid system which includes the presence of opioid receptors similar to those of mammals br Opioid receptors were already present at the origin of jawed vertebrates million years ago All four of the main opioid receptor types delta kappa mu and NOP are conserved in vertebrates even in primitive jawless fishes agnathastoma br The same analgesics and anaesthetics used in humans and other mammals are often used for fish in veterinary medicine These chemicals act on the nociceptive pathways blocking signals to the brain where emotional responses to the signals are further processed by certain parts of the brain found in amniotes higher vertebrates br br br Effects of morphine br br Pre treatment with morphine an analgesic in humans and other mammals has a dose dependent anti nociceptive effect and mitigates the behavioural and ventilation rate responses of rainbow trout to noxious stimuli br When acetic acid is injected into the lips of rainbow trout they exhibit anomalous behaviours such as side to side rocking and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of the tanks and their ventilation rate increases Injections of morphine reduce both the anomalous noxious stimulus related behaviours and the increase in ventilation rate When the same noxious stimulus is applied to zebrafish Danio rerio they respond by decreasing their activity As with the rainbow trout morphine injected prior to the acid injection attenuates the decrease in activity in a dose dependent manner br Injection of acetic acid into the lips of rainbow trout causes a reduction in their natural neophobia fear of novelty this is reversed by the administration of morphine br In goldfish injected with morphine or saline and then exposed to unpleasant temperatures fish injected with saline acted with defensive behaviours indicating anxiety wariness and fear whereas those given morphine did not br br br Effects of other analgesics br The neurotransmitter Substance P and the analgesic opioid enkephalins and endorphin which act as endogenous analgesics in mammals are present in fish br Different analgesics have different effects on fish In a study on the efficacy of three types of analgesic buprenorphine an opioid carprofen a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and lidocaine a local anaesthetic ventilation rate and time to resume feeding were used as pain indicators Buprenorphine had limited impact on the fish s response carprofen ameliorated the effects of noxious stimulation on time to resume feeding however lidocaine reduced all the behavioural indicators Administration of aspirin prevents behavioural change caused by acetic acid br Tramadol also increases the nociceptive threshold in fish providing further evidence of an anti nociceptive opioid system in fish br br br Effects of naloxone br Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist which in mammals negates the analgesic effects of opioids Both adult and five day old zebrafish larvae show behavioural responses indicative of pain in response to injected or diluted acetic acid The anti nociceptive properties of morphine or buprenorphine are reversed if adults or larvae are co treated with naloxone Both naloxone and prolyl leucyl glycinamide another opiate antagonist in mammals reduced the analgesic effects of morphine to electric shocks received by goldfish indicating they can act as an opiate antagonist in fish br br br Physiological changes br The physiological changes of fish in response to noxious stimuli include elevations of ventilation rate and cortisol levels br br br Protective responses br br br br Studies show that fish exhibit protective behavioural responses to putatively painful stimuli br When acetic acid or bee venom is injected into the lips of rainbow trout they exhibit an anomalous side to side rocking behaviour on their pectoral fins rub their lips along the sides and floors of the tanks and increase their ventilation rate When acetic acid is injected into the lips of zebrafish they respond by decreasing their activity The magnitude of this behavioural response depends on the concentration of the acetic acid br The behavioural responses to a noxious stimulus differ between species of fish Noxiously stimulated common carp Cyprinus carpio show anomalous rocking behaviour and rub their lips against the tank walls but do not change other behaviours or their ventilation rate In contrast zebrafish Danio rerio reduce their frequency of swimming and increase their ventilation rate but do not display anomalous behaviour Rainbow trout like the zebrafish reduce their frequency of swimming and increase their ventilation rate Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus in response to a tail fin clip increase their swimming activity and spend more time in the light area of their tank br Since this initial work Sneddon and her co workers have shown that rainbow trout common carp and zebrafish experiencing a noxious stimulation exhibit rapid changes in physiology and behavior that persist for up to hours and thus are not simple reflexes br Five day old zebrafish larvae show a concentration dependent increase in locomotor activity in response to different concentrations of diluted acetic acid This increase in locomotor activity is accompanied by an increase in cox mRNA demonstrating that nociceptive pathways are also activated br Fish show different responses to different noxious stimuli even when these are apparently similar This indicates the response is flexible and not simply a nociceptive reflex Atlantic cod injected in the lip with acetic acid capsaicin or piercing the lip with a commercial fishing hook showed different responses to these three types of noxious stimulation Those cod treated with acetic acid and capsaicin displayed increased hovering close to the bottom of the tank and reduced use of shelter However hooked cod only showed brief episodes of head shaking br br br Avoidance learning br Early experiments provided evidence that fish learn to respond to putatively noxious stimuli For instance toadfish Batrachoididae grunt when they are electrically shocked but after repeated shocks they grunt simply at the sight of the electrode More recent studies show that both goldfish and trout learn to avoid locations in which they receive electric shocks Sticklebacks receive some protection from predator fish through their spines Researchers found pike and perch initially snapped them up but then rejected them After a few experiences the pike and perch learned to avoid the sticklebacks altogether When the stickleback spines were removed their protection disappeared Furthermore this avoidance learning is flexible and is related to the intensity of the stimulus br br br Trade offs in motivation br br A painful experience may change the motivation for normal behavioural responses br In a study goldfish were trained to feed at a location of the aquarium where subsequently they would receive an electric shock The number of feeding attempts and time spent in the feeding shock zone decreased with increased shock intensity and with increased food deprivation the number and the duration of feeding attempts increased as did escape responses as this zone was entered The researchers suggested that goldfish make a trade off in their motivation to feed with their motivation to avoid an acute noxious stimulus br Rainbow trout naturally avoid novelty i e they are neophobic Victoria Braithwaite describes a study in which a brightly coloured Lego brick is placed in the tank of rainbow trout Trout injected in the lip with a small amount of saline strongly avoided the Lego brick however trout injected with acetic acid spent considerably more time near the Lego block When the study was repeated but with the fish also being given morphine the avoidance response returned in those fish injected with acetic acid and could not be distinguished from the responses of saline injected fish br To explore the possibility of a trade off between responding to a noxious stimulus and predation researchers presented rainbow trout with a competing stimulus a predator cue Noxiously stimulated fish cease showing anti predator responses indicating that pain becomes their primary motivation The same study investigated the potential trade off between responding to a noxious stimulus and social status The responses of the noxiously treated trout varied depending on the familiarity of the fish they were placed with The researchers suggested the findings of the motivational changes and trade offs provide evidence for central processing of pain rather than merely showing a nociceptive reflex br br br Paying a cost for analgesia br Zebrafish given access to a barren brightly lit chamber or an enriched chamber prefer the enriched area When these fish are injected with acetic acid or saline as a control they still choose the same enriched chamber However if an analgesic is dissolved in the barren less preferred chamber zebrafish injected with noxious acid lose their preference and spend over br half their time in the previously less favourable barren chamber This suggests a trade off in motivation and furthermore they are willing to pay a cost to enter a less preferred environment to access pain relief br br br Cognitive ability and sentience br The learning abilities of fish demonstrated in a range of studies indicate sophisticated cognitive processes that are more complex than simple associative learning Examples include the ability to recognise social companions avoidance for some months or years of places where they encountered a predator or were caught on a hook and forming mental maps br It has been argued that although a high cognitive capacity may indicate a greater likelihood of experiencing pain it also gives these animals a greater ability to deal with this leaving animals with a lower cognitive ability a greater problem in coping with pain br br br Criteria for pain perception br Scientists have also proposed that in conjunction with argument by analogy criteria of physiology or behavioural responses can be used to assess the possibility of non human animals perceiving pain The following is a table of criteria suggested by Sneddon et al br br In the table Y indicates positive evidence and denotes it has not been tested or there is insufficient evidence br br br Societal implications br br Given that some have interpreted the existing scientific information to suggest that fish may feel pain it has been suggested that precautionary principles should be applied to commercial fishing which would likely have multiple consequences br Both scientists and animal protection advocates have raised concerns about the possible suffering pain and fear of fish caused by angling br Other societal implications of fish experiencing pain include acute and chronic exposure to pollutants commercial and sporting fisheries e g injury during trawling tagging fin clipping during stock assessment tissue damage physical exhaustion and severe oxygen deficit during capture pain and stress during slaughter use of live bait aquaculture e g tagging fin clipping high stocking densities resulting in increased aggression food deprivation for disease treatment or before harvest removal from water for routine husbandry pain during slaughter ornamental fish e g capture by sub lethal poisoning permanent adverse physical states due to selective breeding scientific research e g genetic modification may have detrimental effects on welfare deliberately imposed adverse physical physiological and behavioural states electrofishing tagging fin clipping or otherwise marking fish handling procedures which may cause injury br Browman et al suggest that if the regulatory environment continues on its current trajectory adding more aquatic animal taxa to those already regulated activity in some sectors could be severely restricted even banned They further argue that extending legal protection to aquatic animals is a societal choice but they emphasize that choice should not be ascribed to strong support from a body of research that does not yet exist and may never exist and the consequences of making that decision must be carefully weighed br br br Legislation br In the UK the legislation protecting animals during scientific research the Animals Scientific Procedures Act protects fish from the moment they become capable of independent feeding The legislation protecting animals in most other circumstances in the UK is The Animal Welfare Act which states that in the Act animal means a vertebrate other than man clearly including fish br In the US the legislation protecting animals during scientific research is The Animal Welfare Act This excludes protection of cold blooded animals including fish br The Norwegian Animal Rights Law states it relates to mammals birds frogs salamander reptiles fish and crustaceans br A article by Howard Browman and colleagues provides an overview of what different perspectives regarding fish pain and welfare mean to in the context of aquaculture commercial fisheries recreational fisheries and research br br br Controversy br br br Nervous system br br br Receptors and nerve fibres br It has been argued that fish cannot feel pain because they do not have a sufficient density of appropriate nerve fibres A typical human cutaneous nerve contains Group C nerve fibres however the same nerves in humans with congenital insensitivity to pain have only C type fibres Based on this James Rose from the University of Wyoming has argued that the absence of C type fibres in cartilagenous sharks and rays indicates that signalling leading to pain perception is likely to be impossible and the low numbers for bony fish e g for carp and trout indicate this is also highly unlikely for these fish A delta type fibres believed to trigger avoidance reactions are common in bony fish although they have not been found in sharks or rays Rose concludes that fish have survived well in an evolutionary sense without the full range of nociception typical of humans or other mammals Professor Culum Brown of Macquarie University Sydney states that lack of evidence has been used as evidence of lack a fundamental misinterpretation of the scientific method and has been taken to suggest that sharks and rays cannot feel pain He asserts that the fact that nociception occurs in jawless fish as well as in bony fish suggests the most parsimonious explanation is that sharks do have these capacities but that we have yet to understand that the receptors or the fibres we have identified operate in a novel manner He points out that the alternative explanation is that elasmobranchs have lost the ability of nociception and one would have to come up with a very convincing argument for the adaptive value of such a loss in a single taxon in the entire animal kingdom Professor Broom of Cambridge University submits that feeling pain gives active complex vertebrates a selective advantage through learning and responding allowing them to survive in their environment Pain and fear systems are phylogenetically extremely ancient and so are unlikely to have suddenly appeared in mammals or humans br br br Brain br In Rose published reviews arguing that fish cannot feel pain because they lack a neocortex in the brain This argument would also rule out pain perception in most mammals and all birds and reptiles However in a research team led by Lynne Sneddon concluded that the brains of rainbow trout fire neurons in the same way human brains do when experiencing pain Rose criticized the study claiming it was flawed mainly because it did not provide proof that fish possess conscious awareness particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours br Rose and more recently Brian Key from The University of Queensland argue that because the fish brain is very different from the human brain fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are and while fish may react in a way similar to the way humans react to pain the reactions in the case of fish have other causes Studies indicating that fish can feel pain were confusing nociception with feeling pain says Rose Pain is predicated on awareness The key issue is the distinction between nociception and pain A person who is anaesthetised in an operating theatre will still respond physically to an external stimulus but he or she will not feel pain According to Rose and Key the literature relating to the question of consciousness in fish is prone to anthropomorphisms and care is needed to avoid erroneously attributing human like capabilities to fish However no other animal can directly communicate how it feels and thinks and Rose and Key have not published experimental studies to show that fish do not feel pain Sneddon suggests it is entirely possible that a species with a different evolutionary path could evolve different neural systems to perform the same functions i e convergent evolution as studies on the brains of birds have shown Key agrees that phenomenal consciousness is likely to occur in mammals and birds but not in fish Animal behaviouralist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions Sneddon proposes that to suggest a function suddenly arises without a primitive form defies the laws of evolution br Other researchers also believe that animal consciousness does not require a neocortex but can arise from homologous subcortical brain networks It has been suggested that brainstem circuits can generate pain This includes research with anencephalic children who despite missing large portions of their cortex express emotions There is also evidence from activation studies showing brainstem mediated feelings in normal humans and foetal withdrawal responses to noxious stimulation but prior to development of the cortex br In papers published in and Michael Woodruff summarized a significant number of research articles that in contradiction to the conclusions of Rose and Key strongly support the hypothesis that the neuroanatomical organization of the fish pallium and its connections with subpallial structures especially those with the preglomerular nucleus and the tectum are complex enough to be analogous to the circuitry of the cortex and thalamus assumed to underlie sentience in mammals He added neurophysiological and behavioral data to these anatomical observations that also support the hypothesis that the pallium is an important part of the hierarchical network proposed by Feinberg and Mallatt to underlie consciousness in fishes br br br Protective responses br Work by Sneddon characterised behavioural responses in rainbow trout common carp and zebrafish However when these experiments were repeated by Newby and Stevens without anaesthetic rocking and rubbing behaviour was not observed suggesting that some of the alleged pain responses observed by Sneddon and co workers were likely to be due to recovery of the fish from anaesthesia But Newby and Stevens in an attempt to replicate research conducted by Sneddon s laboratory used a different protocol to the one already published The lack of abnormal rubbing behaviours and resumption of feeding in the Newby and Stevens experiment can be attributed to them injecting such a high concentration of acid If no nociceptive information is being conducted to the central nervous system then no behavioural changes will be elicited Sneddon states that this demonstrates the importance of following experimental design of published studies to get comparable results br Several researchers argue about the definition of pain used in behavioural studies as the observations recorded were contradictory non validated and non repeatable by other researchers In Rose argued that fishes resume normal feeding and activity immediately or soon after surgery But Stoskopf suggested that fish may respond to chronic stimuli in subtle ways These include colour changes alterations in posture and different utilization of the water column and that these more nuanced behaviours may be missed while Wagner and Stevens said that further testing examining more behaviours is needed br Nordgreen said that the behavioural differences they found in response to uncomfortable temperatures showed that fish feel both reflexive and cognitive pain The experiment shows that fish do not only respond to painful stimuli with reflexes but change their behavior also after the event Nordgreen said Together with what we know from experiments carried out by other groups this indicates that the fish consciously perceive the test situation as painful and switch to behaviors indicative of having been through an aversive experience In Rose and others reviewed this and further studies which concluded that pain had been found in fish They concluded that the results from such research are due to poor design and misinterpretation and that the researchers were unable to distinguish unconscious detection of injurious stimuli nociception from conscious pain br In Sneddon Donald Broom Culum Brown and others published a paper that found that despite the empirical proof sceptics still deny anything beyond reflex responses in fishes and state that they are incapable of complex cognitive abilities Recent studies on learning have shown that cleaner wrasse fish as well as parrots perform better than chimpanzees orangutans or capuchin monkeys in a complex learning task in which they have to learn to discriminate reliable food sources from unreliable ones Goldfish learn to avoid an area where they have received an electric shock Even when food has been previously provided in this area and the fish are strongly motivated to spend time there they avoid it for three days at which time they trade off their hunger with the risk of receiving another shock
