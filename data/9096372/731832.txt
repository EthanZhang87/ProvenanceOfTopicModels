Harbour in the Mi kmaq language br br The first permanent European settlement in the region was on the Halifax Peninsula The establishment of the Town of Halifax named after the nd Earl of Halifax in led to the colonial capital being transferred from Annapolis Royal br The establishment of Halifax marked the beginning of Father Le Loutre s War The war began when Edward Cornwallis arrived to establish Halifax with transports and a sloop of war on June By unilaterally establishing Halifax the British were violating earlier treaties with the Mi kmaq which were signed after Father Rale s War Cornwallis brought along settlers and their families To guard against Mi kmaq Acadian and French attacks on the new Protestant settlements British fortifications were erected in Halifax Citadel Hill Bedford Fort Sackville Dartmouth and Lawrencetown all areas within the modern day Regional Municipality St Margaret s Bay was first settled by French speaking Foreign Protestants at French Village Nova Scotia who migrated from Lunenburg Nova Scotia during the American Revolution br December saw one of the great disasters in Canadian history when the SS Mont Blanc a French cargo ship carrying munitions collided with the Belgian Relief vessel SS Imo in The Narrows between upper Halifax Harbour and Bedford Basin The resulting explosion the Halifax Explosion devastated the Richmond District in the North End of Halifax killing approximately people and injuring nearly others The blast was the largest artificial explosion before the development of nuclear weapons Significant aid came from Boston strengthening the bond between the two coastal cities br The four municipalities in the Halifax urban area had been coordinating delivery of some services through the Metropolitan Authority since the late s but remained independent towns and cities until April when the provincial government amalgamated all municipal governments within Halifax County to create the Halifax Regional Municipality The municipal boundary thus now includes all of Halifax County except for several First Nation reserves br Since amalgamation the region has officially been known as the Halifax Regional Municipality HRM although Halifax has remained in common usage for brevity On April regional council approved the implementation of a new branding campaign for the municipality The campaign would see the region referred to in promotional materials simply as Halifax although Halifax Regional Municipality would remain the region s official name br br br Geography br br br Climate br Halifax has a humid continental climate K ppen Dfb bordering on an oceanic climate Cfb with warm summers and relatively mild winters which is due to Gulf Stream moderation The weather is usually milder in the winter or cooler in the summer than areas at similar latitudes inland with the temperature remaining with occasional notable exceptions between about and C and F January is the coldest month being the only month with a high that is slightly below freezing at C F while August is the warmest The sea heavily influences the climate of the area causing significant seasonal lag in summer with August being significantly warmer than June and with September being the third mildest month in terms of mean temperature The January mean is only C F colder than the isotherm for the oceanic climate br Precipitation is high year round Winter features a mix of rain freezing rain and snow with frequent freeze thaw cycles Snowfall is heavy in winter but snow cover is usually patchy owing to the frequent freeze thaw cycles which melt accumulated snow Some winters feature colder temperatures and fewer freeze thaw cycles the most recent of which being the winter of which was the coldest snowiest and stormiest in about a century Spring is often wet and cool and arrives much later than in areas of Canada at similar latitudes due to cooler sea temperatures Summers are mild and pleasant with hot and humid conditions very infrequent Warm pleasant conditions often extend well into September sometimes into mid October Average monthly precipitation is highest from November to February due to intense late fall to winter storms migrating from the Northeastern U S and lowest in summer with August being the year s warmest and driest month on average Halifax can sometimes receive hurricanes mostly between August and October An example is when Hurricane Juan a category storm hit in September and caused considerable damage to the region Hurricane Earl grazed the coast as a category storm in In Hurricane Dorian made landfall just south of Halifax as a post tropical storm with an intensity equivalent to a category hurricane and caused significant damage across Nova Scotia In Hurricane Ida hit the region with minor damage In Hurricane Fiona hit as a category storm although damage was relatively minor in Halifax with downed trees and widespread power outages for days

temperature ever recorded in Halifax was C F on July and the lowest temperature recorded was C F on February The March North American heat wave brought unusually high temperatures to the municipality of Halifax On March the mercury climbed to C F at the Halifax Windsor Park weather station and C F at Halifax Stanfield International Airport In spite of the possibility of high temperatures in a
