Herons are long legged long necked freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae with recognised species some of which are referred to as egrets or bitterns rather than herons Members of the genera Botaurus and Ixobrychus are referred to as bitterns and together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus Zebrilus form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae Egrets do not form a biologically distinct group from herons and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes in breeding plumage Herons by evolutionary adaptation have long beaks br The classification of the individual heron egret species is fraught with difficulty and no clear consensus exists about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera Ardea and Egretta Similarly the relationships of the genera in the family are not completely resolved However one species formerly considered to constitute a separate monotypic family the Cochlearidae or the boat billed heron is now regarded as a member of the Ardeidae br Although herons resemble birds in some other families such as the storks ibises spoonbills and cranes they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted not outstretched They are also one of the bird groups that have powder down Some members of this group nest colonially in trees while others notably the bitterns use reed beds A group of herons has been called a siege br br br Name br The word heron first appeared in the English language around originating from Old French hairon eron th century earlier hairo th century from Frankish haigiro or from Proto Germanic haigr hraigr br Herons are also known as shitepokes or euphemistically as shikepokes or shypokes Webster s Dictionary suggests that herons were given this name because of their habit of defecating when flushed br The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary describes the use of shitepoke for the small green heron of North America Butorides virescens as originating in the United States citing a published example from The OED also observes that shiterow or shederow are terms used for herons and also applied as derogatory terms meaning a thin weakly person This name for a heron is found in a list of game birds in a royal decree of James VI of Scotland The OED speculates that shiterow is a corruption of shiteheron br Another former name was heronshaw or hernshaw derived from Old French heron eau Corrupted to handsaw this name appears in Shakespeare s Hamlet A possible further corruption took place in the Norfolk Broads where the heron is often referred to as a harnser br br br Description br br The herons are medium to large sized birds with long legs and necks They exhibit very little sexual dimorphism in size The smallest species is usually considered the dwarf bittern which measures cm in in length although all the species in the genus Ixobrychus are small and many broadly overlap in size The largest species of heron is the goliath heron which stands up to cm in tall All herons can retract their necks by folding them into a tight S shape due to the modified shape of the cervical vertebrae of which they have or the neck is retracted during flight unlike most other long necked birds The neck is longer in the day herons than the night herons and bitterns The legs are long and strong and in almost every species are unfeathered from the lower part of the tibia the exception is the zigzag heron In flight the legs and feet are generally held in a horizontal position pointing backwards Toes are long and thin with three pointing forwards and one backwards br br The bill is generally long and harpoon like It can vary from extremely narrow as in the agami heron to wider as in the grey heron The most atypical heron bill is owned by the boat billed heron which has a broad thick bill Herons bills and other bare parts of the body are usually yellow black or brown in colour although this can vary during the breeding season The wings are broad and long exhibiting or primary feathers the boat billed heron has only nine secondaries and rectrices in the bitterns The feathers of the herons are soft and the plumage is usually blue black brown grey or white and can often be strikingly complex Amongst the day herons little sexual dimorphism in plumage is seen except in the pond herons however for the night herons and smaller bitterns plumage differences between the sexes are the rule Many species also have different colour morphs In the Pacific reef heron both dark and light colour morphs exist and the percentage of each morph varies geographically its white morphs only occur in areas with coral beaches br br br Distribution and habitat br br The herons are a widespread family with a cosmopolitan distribution They exist on all continents except Antarctica and are present in most habitats except the coldest extremes of the Arctic extremely high mountains and the driest deserts Almost all species are associated with water they are essentially non swimming waterbirds that feed on the margins of lakes rivers swamps ponds and the sea They are predominantly found in lowland areas although some species live in alpine areas and the majority of species occur in the tropics br The herons are a highly mobile family with most species being at least partially migratory for example the grey heron is mostly sedentary in Britain but mostly migratory in Scandinavia Birds are particularly inclined to disperse widely after breeding but before the annual migration where the species is colonial searching out new feeding areas and reducing the pressures on feeding grounds near the colony The migration typically occurs at night usually as individuals or in small groups br br br Behaviour and ecology br br br Diet br br The herons and bitterns are carnivorous The members of this family are mostly associated with wetlands and water and feed on a variety of live aquatic prey Their diet includes a wide variety of aquatic animals including fish reptiles amphibians crustaceans molluscs and aquatic insects Individual species may be generalists or specialize in certain prey types such as the yellow crowned night heron which specializes in crustaceans particularly crabs Many species also opportunistically take larger prey including birds and bird eggs rodents and more rarely carrion Even more rarely herons eating acorns peas and grains have been reported but most vegetable matter consumed is accidental br br The most common hunting technique is for the bird to sit motionless on the edge of or standing in shallow water and to wait until prey comes within range Birds may either do this from an upright posture giving them a wider field of view for seeing prey or from a crouched position which is more cryptic and means the bill is closer to the prey when it is located Having seen prey the head is moved from side to side so that the heron can calculate the position of the prey in the water and compensate for refraction and then the bill is used to spear the prey br br In addition to sitting and waiting herons may feed more actively They may walk slowly around or less than paces a minute snatching prey when it is observed Other active feeding behaviours include foot stirring and probing where the feet are used to flush out hidden prey The wings may be used to frighten prey or possibly attract it to shade or to reduce glare the most extreme example of this is exhibited by the black heron which forms a full canopy with its wings over its body br Some species of heron such as the little egret and grey heron have been documented using bait to lure prey to within striking distance Herons may use items already in place or actively add items to the water to attract fish such as the banded killifish Items used may be man made such as bread alternatively striated herons in the Amazon have been watched repeatedly dropping seeds insects flowers and leaves into the water to catch fish br Three species the black headed heron whistling heron and especially the cattle egret are less tied to watery environments and may feed far away from water Cattle egrets improve their foraging success by following large grazing animals catching insects flushed by their movement One study found that the success rate of prey capture increased times over solitary foraging br br br Breeding br br While the family exhibits a range of breeding strategies overall the herons are monogamous and mostly colonial Most day herons and night herons are colonial or partly colonial depending on circumstances whereas the bitterns and tiger herons are mostly solitary nesters Colonies may contain several species as well as other species of waterbirds In a study of little egrets and cattle egrets in India the majority of the colonies surveyed contained both species Nesting is seasonal in temperate species in tropical species it may be seasonal often coinciding with the rainy season or year round Even in year round breeders nesting intensity varies throughout the year Tropical herons typically have only one breeding season per year unlike some other tropical birds which may raise up to three broods a year br Courtship usually takes part on the nest Males arrive first and begin the building of the nest where they display to attract females During courtship the male employs a stretch display and uses erectile neck feathers the neck area may swell The female risks an aggressive attack if she approaches too soon and may have to wait up to four days In colonial species displays involve visual cues which can include adopting postures or ritual displays whereas in solitary species auditory cues such as the deep booming of the bitterns are important The exception to this is the boat billed heron which pairs up away from the nesting site Having paired they continue to build the nest in almost all species although in the little bittern and least bittern only the male works on the nest br Some ornithologists have reported observing female herons attaching themselves to impotent mates then seeking sexual gratification elsewhere br The nests of herons are usually found near or above water Although the nests of a few species have been found on the ground where suitable trees or shrubs are unavailable they are typically placed in vegetation Trees are used by many species and here they may be placed high up from the ground whereas species living in reed beds may nest very close to the ground Though the majority of nesting of herons is seen in or immediately around water colonies commonly occur in several cities when human persecution is absent br Generally herons lay between three and seven eggs Larger clutches are reported in the smaller bitterns and more rarely some of the larger day herons and single egg clutches are reported for some of the tiger herons Clutch size varies by latitude within species with individuals in temperate climates laying more eggs than tropical ones On the whole the eggs are glossy blue or white with the exception being the large bitterns which lay olive brown eggs br br br Taxonomy and systematics br br Analyses of skeletons mainly skulls suggested that the Ardeidae could be split into a diurnal and a crepuscular nocturnal group which included the bitterns From DNA studies and from skeletal analyses that focussed more on bones of the body and limbs that two group division has been revealed to be incorrect Rather the similarities in skull morphology among certain herons reflect convergent evolution to cope with the different challenges of daytime and nighttime feeding Today it is believed that three major groups can be distinguished which are br br tiger herons and the boatbill br bitterns br day herons and egrets and night herons br The night herons may still warrant separation from the day herons and egrets as subfamily Nycticoracinae as it was traditionally done However the position of some genera e g Butorides or Syrigma is unclear at the moment and molecular studies have so far suffered from studying only a small number of taxa Especially among the subfamily Ardeinae the relationships are very inadequately resolved The arrangement presented here should be considered provisional br A study suggests that this family belongs to the Pelecaniformes In response to these findings the International Ornithological Congress reclassified Ardeidae and their sister taxa Threskiornithidae under the order Pelecaniformes instead of the previous order of Ciconiiformes br The cladogram shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Ardeidae by Jack Hruska and collaborators published in For several species these results conflict with the taxonomy published online in July by Frank Gill Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee IOC The least bittern Ixobrychus exilis and the stripe backed bittern Ixobrychus involucris were nested with members of the genus Botaurus Hruska and collaborators resurrected the genus Calherodius Peters to contain two night herons the white backed night heron and the white eared night heron that were previously placed in Gorsachius The western cattle egret Bubulcus ibis was embedded in the genus Ardea The eastern cattle egret Bubulcus coromandus was not sampled The placement of the forest bittern Zonerodius heliosylus was ambiguous but the results suggest that it is probably closely related to members of the genus Ardeola rather than to the subfamily Tigriornithinae br br As of July the IOC lists heron species divided into genera br br Subfamily Tigriornithinae
