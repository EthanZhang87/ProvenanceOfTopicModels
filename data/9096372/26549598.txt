An animal theme park also known as a zoological theme park is a combination of an amusement park and a zoo mainly for entertainment amusement and commercial purposes Many animal theme parks combine classic theme park elements such as themed entertainment and amusement rides with classic zoo elements such as live animals confined within enclosures for display Many times live animals are utilized and featured as part of amusement rides and attractions found at animal theme parks br Two examples of animal theme parks are Disney s Animal Kingdom in Orlando Florida acres or square kilometres and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Tampa Florida acres or square kilometres These commercial parks are similar to open range zoos and safari parks according to size but different in intention and appearance containing more entertainment and amusement elements stage shows amusement rides etc br The term animal theme park can also be used to describe certain marine mammal parks oceanariums and more elaborate dolphinariums such as SeaWorld which offers amusement rides and additional entertainment attractions and are also where marine animals such as whales are kept contained put on display and are sometimes trained to perform in shows br In the practice of keeping animals as trained show performers in theme parks was heavily criticized when a trainer was killed by an orca whale at SeaWorld
