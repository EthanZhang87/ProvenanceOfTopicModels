Madison Grant November May was an American lawyer zoologist anthropologist and writer known for his work as a conservationist eugenicist and advocate of scientific racism Grant is less noted for his far reaching achievements in conservation than for his pseudoscientific advocacy of Nordicism a form of racism which views the Nordic race as superior br As a white supremacist eugenicist Grant was the author of The Passing of the Great Race one of the most famous racist texts and played an active role in crafting immigration restriction and anti miscegenation laws in the United States As a conservationist he is credited with the saving of species including the American bison helped create the Bronx Zoo Glacier National Park and Denali National Park and co founded the Save the Redwoods League Grant developed much of the discipline of wildlife management br br br Early life br Grant was born in New York City New York the son of Gabriel Grant a physician and American Civil War surgeon and Caroline Manice Madison Grant s mother was a descendant of Jess de Forest the Walloon Huguenot who in recruited the first band of colonists to settle in New Netherland the Dutch Republic s territory on the American East Coast On his father s side Madison Grant s first American ancestor was Richard Treat dean of Pitminster Church in England who in was one of the first Puritan settlers of New England Grant s forebears through Treat s line include Robert Treat a colonial governor of New Jersey Robert Treat Paine a signer of the Declaration of Independence Charles Grant Madison Grant s grandfather who served as an officer in the War of and Gabriel Grant father of Madison a prominent physician and the health commissioner of Newark New Jersey Grant was a lifelong resident of New York City br Grant was the oldest of four siblings The children s summers and many of their weekends were spent at Oatlands the Long Island country estate built by their grandfather DeForest Manice in the s As a child he attended private schools and traveled Europe and the Middle East with his father He attended Yale University graduating early and with honors in He received a law degree from Columbia Law School and practiced law after graduation however his interests were primarily those of a naturalist He never married and had no children He first achieved a political reputation when he and his brother DeForest Grant took part in the electoral campaign of New York mayor William Lafayette Strong br br br Career and conservation efforts br Thomas C Leonard wrote that Grant was a cofounder of the American environmental movement a crusading conservationist who preserved the California redwoods saved the American bison from extinction fought for stricter gun control laws helped create Glacier and Denali national parks and worked to preserve whales bald eagles and pronghorn antelopes br Grant was a friend of several U S presidents including Theodore Roosevelt and Herbert Hoover He is credited with saving many species from extinction and co founded the Save the Redwoods League with Frederick Russell Burnham John C Merriam and Henry Fairfield Osborn in He is also credited with helping develop the first deer hunting laws in New York state legislation which spread to other states as well over time br br He was also a developer of wildlife management he believed its development to be harmonized with the concept of eugenics Grant helped to found the Bronx Zoo build the Bronx River Parkway save the American bison as an organizer of the American Bison Society and helped to create Glacier National Park and Denali National Park In as Secretary of the New York Zoological Society he lobbied to put Ota Benga a Congolese man from the Mbuti people a tribe of pygmies on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo br Throughout the s and s he served on the boards of many eugenic and philanthropic societies including the board of trustees at the American Museum of Natural History as director of the American Eugenics Society vice president of the Immigration Restriction League a founding member of the Galton Society and one of the eight members of the International Committee of Eugenics He was awarded the gold medal of the Society of Arts and Sciences in In the world s largest tree in Dyerville California was dedicated to Grant Merriam and Osborn by the California State Board of Parks in recognition for their environmental efforts A subspecies of caribou was named after Grant as well Rangifer tarandus granti also known as Grant s Caribou He was an early member of the Boone and Crockett Club a big game hunting organization since and he mobilized its wealthy members to influence the government to conserve vast areas of land against encroaching industries He was the head of the New York Zoological Society from until his death br Grant s campaigns for conservationism and eugenics were not unrelated both assumed the need for various types of stewardship over their charges Grant was generally indifferent to forms of animal life that he did not regard as aristocratic and assigned such a hierarchy to humans as well Historian Jonathan Spiro wrote Whereas wildlife managers felt that the survival of the species as a whole was more important than the lives of a few individuals so Grant preached that the fate of the race outweighed that of a few particular humans who were of no value to the community In Grant s mind natural resources needed to be conserved for the Nordic race to the exclusion of other races Grant viewed the Nordic race as he did any of his endangered species and considered the modern industrial society as infringing just as much on its existence as it did on the redwoods Like many eugenicists Grant saw modern civilization as a violation of survival of the fittest whether it manifested itself in the over logging of the forests or the survival of the poor via welfare or charity In the words of The New Yorker for figures such as Grant it was an unsettlingly short step from managing forests to managing the human gene pool br br br Nordicism br br Grant was the author of the once much read book The Passing of the Great Race an elaborate work of racial hygiene attempting to explain the racial history of Europe The most significant of Grant s concerns was with the changing stock of American immigration of the early th century characterized by increased numbers of immigrants from Southern Europe and Eastern Europe as opposed to Western Europe and Northern Europe Passing of the Great Race was a racial interpretation of contemporary anthropology and history stating race as the basic motor of civilization br br Similar ideas were proposed by prehistorian Gustaf Kossinna in Germany Grant promoted the idea of the Nordic race a loosely defined biological cultural grouping rooted in Scandinavia as the key social group responsible for human development thus the subtitle of the book was The racial basis of European history As an avid eugenicist Grant further advocated the separation quarantine and eventual collapse of undesirable traits and worthless race types from the human gene pool and the promotion spread and eventual restoration of desirable traits and worthwhile race types conducive to Nordic society He wrote A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or unfit in other words social failures would solve the whole question in one hundred years as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd our jails hospitals and insane asylums The individual himself can be nourished educated and protected by the community during his lifetime but the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him or else future generations will be cursed with an ever increasing load of misguided sentimentalism This is a practical merciful and inevitable solution of the whole problem and can be applied to an ever widening circle of social discards beginning always with the criminal the diseased and the insane and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings rather than defectives and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types br Grant s work is considered one of the most influential and vociferous works of scientific racism and eugenics to come out of the United States Stephen Jay Gould described The Passing of the Great Race as the most influential tract of American scientific racism The Passing of the Great Race was published in multiple printings in the United States and was translated into other languages including German in By the book had sold copies in the United States alone br The book was embraced by proponents of the Nazi movement in Germany and was the first non German book ordered to be reprinted by the Nazis when they took power Adolf Hitler wrote to Grant The book is my Bible br One of Grant s long time opponents was the anthropologist Franz Boas Grant disliked Boas and for several years tried to get him fired from his position at Columbia University Boas and Grant were involved in a bitter struggle for control over the discipline of anthropology in the United States while they both served along with others on the National Research Council Committee on Anthropology after the First World War br Grant represented the hereditarian branch of physical anthropology at the time despite his relatively amateur status and was staunchly opposed to and by Boas himself and the latter s students who advocated cultural anthropology Boas and his students eventually wrested control of the American Anthropological Association from Grant and his supporters who had used it as a flagship organization for his brand of anthropology In response Grant along with American eugenicist and biologist Charles B Davenport in founded the Galton Society as an alternative to Boas br br br Immigration restriction br br Grant advocated restricted immigration to the United States through limiting immigration from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe as well as the complete end of immigration from East Asia He also advocated efforts to purify the American population through selective breeding He served as the vice president of the Immigration Restriction League from to his death Acting as an expert on world racial data Grant also provided statistics for the Immigration Act of to set the quotas on immigrants from certain European countries Even after passing the statute Grant continued to be irked that even a smattering of non Nordics were allowed to immigrate to the country each year His support for anti miscegenation laws was quoted in arguments for the Racial Integrity Act of in Virginia br Though Grant was extremely influential in legislating his view of racial theory he began to fall out of favor in the United States in the early s The declining interest in his work has been attributed both to the effects of the Great Depression which resulted in a general backlash against Social Darwinism and related philosophies and to the changing dynamics of racial issues in the United States during the interwar period Rather than subdivide Europe into separate racial groups the bi racial black vs white views of Grant s proteg Lothrop Stoddard became more dominant in the aftermath of the Great Migration of African Americans from Southern States to Northern and Western ones Guterl br br br Legacy br According to historian of economics Thomas C Leonard Prominent American eugenicists including movement leaders Charles Davenport and Madison Grant were conservatives They identified fitness with social and economic position and they also were hard hereditarians dubious of the Lamarckian inheritance clung to by progressives But as eugenicists these conservatives were not classical liberals Like all eugenicists they were illiberal Conservatives do not object to state coercion so long as it is used for what they regard as the right purposes and these men were happy to trample on individual rights to obtain the greater good of improved hereditary health Historians invariably style Madison Grant a conservative because he was a blueblood clubman from a patrician family and his best known work The Passing of the Great Race is a museum piece of scientific racism But Grant s eugenic ideas originated from a corner of the conservative impulse intimately connected to Progressivism conservation br Leonard wrote that Grant also opposed war had doubts about imperialism and supported birth control br Grant became a part of popular culture in s America especially in New York Grant s conservationism and fascination with zoological natural history made him influential among the New York elite who agreed with his cause most notably Theodore Roosevelt Author F Scott Fitzgerald featured a reference to Grant in The Great Gatsby Tom Buchanan a fatuous Long Island aristocrat married to Daisy was reading a book called The Rise of the Colored Empires by this man Goddard blending Grant s Passing of the Great Race and his colleague Lothrop Stoddard s The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy br Grant left no offspring when he died in of nephritis Several hundred people attended Grant s funeral and he was buried in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Tarrytown New York He left a bequest of to the New York Zoological Society to create The Grant Endowment Fund for the Protection of Wild Life to the American Museum of Natural History and another to the Boone and Crockett Club Relatives destroyed his personal papers and correspondence after his death br br At the postwar Nuremberg Trials three pages of excerpts from Grant s Passing of the Great Race were introduced into evidence by the defense of Karl Brandt Hitler s personal physician and head of the Nazi euthanasia program in order to justify the population policies of the Third Reich or at least indicate that they were not ideologically unique to Nazi Germany br Grant s works of scientific racism have been cited to demonstrate that many of the genocidal and eugenic ideas associated with the Third Reich did not arise specifically in Germany and in fact that many of them had origins in other countries including the United States As such because of Grant s well connected and influential friends he is often used to illustrate the strain of race based eugenic thinking in the United States which had some influence until the Second World War Because of the use made of Grant s eugenics work by the policy makers of Nazi Germany his work as a conservationist has been somewhat ignored and obscured as many organizations with which he was once associated such as the Sierra Club wanted to minimize their association with him His racial theories which were popularized in the s are today seen as discredited The work of Franz Boas and his students Ruth Benedict and Margaret Mead demonstrated that there were no inferior or superior races br On June California State Parks removed a memorial to Madison Grant from Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park placed in the park in The monument s removal is part of a broader effort in California Parks to address outdated exhibits and interpretations related to the founders of Save the Redwoods In spring California State Parks will install a new interpretive panel co written with academic scholars that tells a fuller story about Grant his conservation legacy and his central role in the eugenics movement br br br Works br The Caribou New York Office of the New York Zoological Society br Moose New
