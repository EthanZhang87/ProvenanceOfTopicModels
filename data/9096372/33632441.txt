A psychoactive drug or psychoactive substance among other names such as psychoactive agent psychopharmaceutical and psychotropic drug is a chemical substance that changes the function of the nervous system and results in alterations of perception mood cognition and behavior br These substances have various applications including medical use like psychedelic therapy including research purposes recreationally or for spiritual reasons for example by altering one s consciousness as with entheogens for ritual spiritual or shamanic purposes Some categories of psychoactive drugs may be prescribed by physicians and other healthcare practitioners because of their therapeutic value br Some psychoactive substances may be used in detoxification and rehabilitation programs for people who may have become dependent upon or addicted to other mind altering or mood altering substances Drug rehabilitation attempts to reduce addiction through a combination of strategies such as psychotherapy support groups and sometimes medication such as psychoactive substances br Psychoactive substances often bring various changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find rewarding and pleasant e g euphoria or a sense of relaxation or advantageous in an observable or measurable way e g increased alertness Substances that are rewarding and thus positively reinforcing have the potential to induce a state of addiction compulsive drug use despite negative consequences In addition sustained use of some substances may produce physical or psychological dependence or both associated with somatic or psychological emotional withdrawal states respectively br Psychoactive drug misuse dependence and addiction have resulted in legal measures and moral debate Governmental controls on manufacture supply and prescription attempt to reduce problematic medical drug use Ethical concerns have also been raised about the overuse of these drugs clinically and about their marketing by manufacturers Popular campaigns to decriminalize or legalize the recreational use of certain drugs e g cannabis are also ongoing br br br History br br Psychoactive drug use can be traced back to prehistory There is archaeological evidence of the use of psychoactive substances mostly plants dating back at least years and historical evidence of cultural use over the past years The chewing of coca leaves for example dates back over years ago in Peruvian society br Medicinal use is one important facet of psychoactive drug use However some have postulated the urge to alter one s consciousness as primary as well as the drive to satiate thirst hunger or sexual desire Supporters of this belief contend that the history of drug use and even children s desire for spinning swinging or sliding indicate that the drive to alter one s state of mind is universal br br One of the first people to articulate this point of view set aside from a medicinal context was American author Fitz Hugh Ludlow in his book The Hasheesh Eater D rugs are able to bring humans into the neighborhood of divine experience and can thus carry us up from our personal fate and the everyday circumstances of our life into a higher form of reality It is however necessary to understand precisely what is meant by the use of drugs We do not mean the purely physical craving That of which we speak is something much higher namely the knowledge of the possibility of the soul to enter into a lighter being and to catch a glimpse of deeper insights and more magnificent visions of the beauty truth and the divine than we are normally able to spy through the cracks in our prison cell But there are not many drugs which have the power of stilling such craving The entire catalog at least to the extent that research has thus far written it may include only opium hashish and in rarer cases alcohol which has enlightening effects only upon very particular characters br During the th century many governments across the world initially responded to the use of recreational drugs by banning use production or distribution of them and making their use supply or trade a criminal offense A notable example of this was Prohibition in the United States where alcohol was made illegal for years However many governments government officials and persons in law enforcement have concluded that illicit drug use cannot be sufficiently stopped through criminalization Organizations such as Law Enforcement Against Prohibition LEAP have come to such a conclusion believing br br T he existing drug policies have failed in their intended goals of addressing the problems of crime drug abuse addiction juvenile drug use stopping the flow of illegal drugs into this country and the internal sale and use of illegal drugs By fighting a war on drugs the government has increased the problems of society and made them far worse A system of regulation rather than prohibition is a less harmful more ethical and a more effective public policy In some countries there has been a move toward harm reduction by health services where the use of illicit drugs is neither condoned nor promoted but services and support are provided to ensure users have adequate factual information readily available and that the negative effects of their use be minimized Such is the case of the Portuguese drug policy of decriminalization which achieved its primary goal of reducing the adverse health effects of drug abuse br br br Terminology br The term drug has become a skunked term Drugs can have a negative connotation often associated with illegal substances like cocaine or heroin This is despite the fact that the terms drug and medicine are sometimes used interchangeably br Novel psychoactive substances NPS also known as designer drugs are a category of psychoactive drugs substances that are designed to mimic the effects of often illegal drugs usually in efforts to circumvent existing drug laws br br br Types br Psychoactive drugs are divided according to their pharmacological effects Common subtypes are listed below br Anxiolytics Medicinally used to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and sometimes insomnia br Example benzodiazepines such as Xanax and Valium barbiturates br Empathogen entactogens A drug class that alters one s emotional state often resulting in an increased sense of empathy closeness and emotional communication br Example MDMA ecstasy MDA APB AMT br Stimulants This class increases activity or arousal of the central nervous system Stimulants may be used to enhance alertness attention cognition mood and physical performance Some stimulants are used medicinally to treat individuals with ADHD and Narcolepsy br Examples amphetamines caffeine cocaine nicotine br Depressants Depressants opposite to stimulates reduces or depresses activity and stimulation in the central nervous system Drugs within this classification includes sedatives hypnotics and opioids This classification encompasses a spectrum of substances with sedative soporific and anesthetic properties br Examples Ethanol alcohol opioids such as morphine fentanyl and codeine cannabis barbiturates and benzodiazepines br br br Hallucinogens br Hallucinogens encompasses all substances that produce distinct alterations in perception sensation of space and time and emotional states br br Psychedelics br Examples psilocybin LSD DMT N N Dimethyltryptamine ayahuasca mescaline br Dissociatives br Examples Salvia divinorum Nitrous oxide br Deliriants br Examples Datura scopolamine br br br Uses br br br Mental disorders br br Psychiatric medications are psychoactive drugs prescribed for the management of mental and emotional disorders or to aid in overcoming challenging behavior There are six major classes of psychiatric medications br br Antidepressants treat disorders such as clinical depression dysthymia anxiety eating disorders and borderline personality disorder br Stimulants used to treat disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy and for weight reduction br Antipsychotics used to treat psychotic symptoms such as those associated with schizophrenia or severe mania or as adjuncts to relieve clinical depression br Mood stabilizers used to treat bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder br Anxiolytics used to treat anxiety disorders br Depressants used as hypnotics sedatives and anesthetics depending upon dosage br In addition several psychoactive substances are currently employed to treat various addictions These include acamprosate or naltrexone in the treatment of alcoholism or methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy in the case of opioid addiction br Exposure to psychoactive drugs can cause changes to the brain that counteract or augment some of their effects these changes may be beneficial or harmful However there is a significant amount of evidence that the relapse rate of mental disorders negatively corresponds with the length of properly followed treatment regimens that is relapse rate substantially declines over time and to a much greater degree than placebo br br br Military br br br Drugs used by militaries br br Both military and civilian American intelligence officials are known to have used psychoactive drugs while interrogating captives apprehended in its war on terror In July Jason Leopold and Jeffrey Kaye psychologists and human rights workers had a Freedom of Information Act request fulfilled that confirmed that the use of psychoactive drugs during interrogation was a long standing br practice Captives and former captives had been reporting medical staff collaborating with interrogators to drug captives with powerful psychoactive drugs prior to interrogation since the very first captives release br In May recently released Pakistani captive Sha Mohammed Alikhel described the routine use of psychoactive drugs He said that Jihan Wali a captive kept in a nearby cell was rendered catatonic through the use of these drugs br Additionally militaries worldwide have used or are using various psychoactive drugs to improve performance of soldiers by suppressing hunger increasing the ability to sustain effort without food increasing and lengthening wakefulness and concentration suppressing fear reducing empathy and improving reflexes and memory recall among other things br The first documented case of a soldier overdosing on methamphetamine during combat was the Finnish corporal Aimo Koivunen a soldier who fought in the Winter War and the Continuation War br br br Psychochemical warfare br br Psychoactive drugs have been used in military applications as non lethal weapons br br br Pain management br br Psychoactive drugs are often prescribed to manage pain The subjective experience of pain is primarily regulated by endogenous opioid peptides Thus pain can often be managed using psychoactives that operate on this neurotransmitter system also known as opioid receptor agonists This class of drugs can be highly addictive and includes opiate narcotics like morphine and codeine NSAIDs such as aspirin and ibuprofen are also analgesics These agents also reduce eicosanoid mediated inflammation by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase br br br Anesthesia br br General anesthetics are a class of psychoactive drug used on people to block physical pain and other sensations Most anesthetics induce unconsciousness allowing the person to undergo medical procedures like surgery without the feelings of physical pain or emotional trauma To induce unconsciousness anesthetics affect the GABA and NMDA systems For example Propofol is a GABA agonist and ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist br br br Performance enhancement br br Performance enhancing substances also known as performance enhancing drugs PEDs are substances that are used to improve any form of activity performance in humans A well known example of cheating in sports involves doping in sport where banned physical performance enhancing drugs are used by athletes and bodybuilders Athletic performance enhancing substances are sometimes referred as ergogenic aids Cognitive performance enhancing drugs commonly called nootropics are sometimes used by students to improve academic performance Performance enhancing substances are also used by military personnel to enhance combat performance br br br Recreation br br Many psychoactive substances are used for their mood and perception altering effects including those with accepted uses in medicine and psychiatry Examples of psychoactive substances include caffeine alcohol cocaine LSD nicotine and cannabis Classes of drugs frequently used recreationally include br br Stimulants which activate the central nervous system These are used recreationally for their euphoric effects br Hallucinogens psychedelics dissociatives and deliriants which induce perceptual and cognitive alterations br Hypnotics which depress the central nervous system br Opioid analgesics which also depress the central nervous system These are used recreationally because of their euphoric effects br Inhalants in the forms of gas aerosols or solvents which are inhaled as a vapor because of their stupefying effects Many inhalants also fall into the above categories such as nitrous oxide which is also an analgesic br In some modern and ancient cultures drug usage is seen as a status symbol Recreational drugs are seen as status symbols in settings such as at nightclubs and parties For example in ancient Egypt gods were commonly pictured holding hallucinogenic plants br Because there is controversy about regulation of recreational drugs there is an ongoing debate about drug prohibition Critics of prohibition believe that regulation of recreational drug use is a violation of personal autonomy and freedom In the United States critics have noted that prohibition or regulation of recreational and spiritual drug use might be unconstitutional and causing more harm than is prevented br Some people who take psychoactive drugs experience drug or substance induced psychosis A systematic review and meta analysis by Murrie et al found that the pooled proportion of transition from substance induced psychosis to schizophrenia was CI compared with CI for brief atypical and not otherwise specified psychoses Type of substance was the primary predictor of transition from drug induced psychosis to schizophrenia with highest rates associated with cannabis studies CI hallucinogens studies CI and amphetamines studies CI Lower rates were reported for opioid alcohol and sedative induced psychoses Transition rates were slightly lower in older cohorts but were not affected by sex country of the study hospital or community location urban or rural setting diagnostic methods or duration of follow up br br br Ritual and spiritual br br br Offerings br br br Alcohol br br According to the Catholic Church the sacramental wine used in the Eucharist must contain alcohol Canon of the present Code of Canon Law states br br The wine must be natural made from grapes of the vine and not corrupt br br br Psychoactive use br br br Entheogen br br Certain psychoactives particularly hallucinogens have been used for religious purposes since prehistoric times Native Americans have used peyote cacti containing mescaline for religious ceremonies for as long as years The muscimol containing Amanita muscaria mushroom was used for ritual purposes throughout prehistoric Europe br The use of entheogens for religious purposes resurfaced in the West during the counterculture movements of the s and s Under the leadership of Timothy Leary new spiritual and intention based movements began to use LSD and other hallucinogens as tools to access deeper inner exploration In the United States the use of peyote for ritual purposes is protected only for members of the Native American Church which is allowed to cultivate and distribute peyote However the genuine religious use of peyote regardless of one s personal ancestry is protected in Colorado Arizona New Mexico Nevada and Oregon br br br Psychedelic therapy br br Psychedelic therapy or psychedelic assisted therapy refers to the proposed use of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin MDMA LSD and ayahuasca to treat mental disorders As of psychedelic drugs are controlled substances in most countries and psychedelic therapy is not legally available outside clinical trials with some exceptions br br br Psychonautics br br The aims and methods of psychonautics when state altering substances are involved is commonly distinguished from recreational drug use by research sources Psychonautics as a means of exploration need not involve drugs and may take place in a religious context with an established history Cohen considers psychonautics closer in association to wisdom traditions and other transpersonal and integral movements br br br Self medication br br Self medication sometime called do it yourself DIY medicine is a human behavior in which an individual uses a substance or any exogenous influence to self administer treatment for physical or psychological conditions for example headaches or fatigue br The substances most widely used in self medication are over the counter drugs and dietary supplements which are used to treat common health issues at home These do not require a doctor s prescription to obtain and in some countries are available in supermarkets and convenience stores br br br Sex br br Sex and drugs date back to ancient humans and have been interlocked throughout human history Both legal and illegal the consumption of drugs and their effects on the human body encompasses all aspects of sex including desire performance pleasure conception gestation and disease br There are many different types of drugs that are commonly associated with their effects on sex including alcohol cannabis cocaine MDMA GHB amphetamines opioids antidepressants and many others br br br Social movements br br br Cannabis br br br Operation Overgrow br br Operation Overgrow is the name given by cannabis activists of an operation to spread marijuana seeds wildly so it grows like weed The thought behind the operation is to draw attention to the debate about legalization decriminalization of marijuana br br br Suicide br br A drug overdose involves taking a dose of a drug that exceeds safe levels In the UK England and Wales until a drug overdose was the most common suicide method in females In in males the percentage is Self poisoning accounts for the highest number of non fatal suicide attempts In the United States about of suicide attempts and of suicide deaths involve drug overdoses The risk of death in suicide attempts involving overdose is about br Most people are under the influence of sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines when they die by suicide with alcoholism present in between and of cases Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide About of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male older and have tried to take their own lives in the past In adolescents who misuse alcohol neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide br Overdose attempts using painkillers are among the most common due to their easy availability over the counter br br br Route of administration br br Psychoactive drugs are administered via oral ingestion as a tablet capsule powder liquid and beverage via injection by subcutaneous intramuscular and intravenous route via rectum by suppository and enema and via inhalation by smoking vaporizing and snorting The efficiency of each method of administration varies from drug to drug br The psychiatric drugs fluoxetine quetiapine and lorazepam are ingested orally in tablet or capsule form Alcohol and caffeine are ingested in beverage form nicotine and cannabis are smoked or vaporized peyote and psilocybin mushrooms are ingested in botanical form or dried and crystalline drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are usually inhaled or snorted br br br Determinants of effects br The theory of dosage set and setting is a useful model in dealing with the effects of psychoactive substances especially in a controlled therapeutic setting as well as in recreational use Dr Timothy Leary based on his own experiences and systematic observations on psychedelics developed this theory along with his colleagues Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert Ram Dass in the s br br Dosage br The first factor dosage has been a truism since ancient times or at least since Paracelsus who said Dose makes the poison Some compounds are beneficial or pleasurable when consumed in small amounts but harmful deadly or evoke discomfort in higher doses br br Set br The set is the internal attitudes and constitution of the person including their expectations wishes fears and sensitivity to the drug This factor is especially important for the hallucinogens which have the ability to make conscious experiences out of the unconscious In traditional cultures set is shaped primarily by the worldview health and genetic characteristics that all the members of the culture share br br Setting br The third aspect is setting which pertains to the surroundings the place and the time in which the experiences transpire br This theory clearly states that the effects are equally the result of chemical pharmacological psychological and physical influences The model that Timothy Leary proposed applied to the psychedelics although it also applies to other psychoactives br br br Effects br br Psychoactive drugs operate by temporarily affecting a person s neurochemistry which in turn causes changes in a person s mood cognition perception and behavior There are many ways in which psychoactive drugs can affect the brain Each drug has a specific action on one or more neurotransmitter or neuroreceptor in the brain br Drugs that increase activity in particular neurotransmitter systems are called agonists They act by increasing the synthesis of one or more neurotransmitters by reducing its reuptake from the synapses or by mimicking the action by binding directly to the postsynaptic receptor Drugs that reduce neurotransmitter activity are called antagonists and operate by interfering with synthesis or blocking postsynaptic receptors so that neurotransmitters cannot bind to them br Exposure to a psychoactive substance can cause changes in the structure and functioning of neurons as the nervous system tries to re establish the homeostasis disrupted by the presence of the drug see also neuroplasticity Exposure to antagonists for a particular neurotransmitter can increase the number of receptors for that neurotransmitter or the receptors themselves may become more responsive to neurotransmitters this is called sensitization Conversely overstimulation of receptors for a particular neurotransmitter may cause a decrease in both number and sensitivity of these receptors a process called desensitization or tolerance Sensitization and desensitization are more likely to occur with long term exposure although they may occur after only a single exposure These processes are thought to play a role in drug dependence and addiction Physical dependence on antidepressants or anxiolytics may result in worse depression or anxiety respectively as withdrawal symptoms Unfortunately because clinical depression also called major depressive disorder is often referred to simply as depression antidepressants are often requested by and prescribed for patients who are depressed but not clinically depressed br br br Affected neurotransmitter systems br The following is a brief table of notable drugs and their primary neurotransmitter receptor or method of action Many drugs act on more than one transmitter or receptor in the brain br br br Addiction and dependence br br Psychoactive drugs are often associated with addiction or drug dependence Dependence can be divided into two types psychological dependence by which a user experiences negative psychological or emotional withdrawal symptoms e g depression and physical dependence by which a user must use a drug to avoid physically uncomfortable or even medically harmful physical withdrawal symptoms Drugs that are both rewarding and reinforcing are addictive these properties of a drug are mediated through activation of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway particularly the nucleus accumbens Not all addictive drugs are associated with physical dependence e g amphetamine and not all drugs that produce physical dependence are addictive drugs e g oxymetazoline br Many professionals self help groups and businesses specialize in drug rehabilitation with varying degrees of success and many parents attempt to influence the actions and choices of their children regarding psychoactives br Common forms of rehabilitation include psychotherapy support groups and pharmacotherapy which uses psychoactive substances to reduce cravings and physiological withdrawal symptoms while a user is going through detox Methadone itself an opioid and a psychoactive substance is a common treatment for heroin addiction as is another opioid buprenorphine Recent research on addiction has shown some promise in using psychedelics such as ibogaine to treat and even cure drug addictions although this has yet to become a widely accepted practice br br br Legality br br The legality of psychoactive drugs has been controversial through most of recent history the Second Opium War and Prohibition are two historical examples of legal controversy surrounding psychoactive drugs However in recent years the most influential document regarding the legality of psychoactive drugs is the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs an international treaty signed in as an Act of the United Nations Signed by nations including the United States the USSR Pakistan India and the United Kingdom the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs established Schedules for the legality of each drug and laid out an international agreement to fight addiction to recreational drugs by combatting the sale trafficking and use of scheduled drugs All countries that signed the treaty passed laws to implement these rules within their borders However some countries that signed the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs such as the Netherlands are more lenient with their enforcement of these laws br In the United States the Food and Drug Administration FDA has authority over all drugs including psychoactive drugs The FDA regulates which psychoactive drugs are over the counter and which are only available with a prescription However certain psychoactive drugs like alcohol tobacco and drugs listed in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs are subject to criminal laws The Controlled Substances Act of regulates the recreational drugs outlined in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Alcohol is regulated by state governments but the federal National Minimum Drinking Age Act penalizes states for not following a national drinking age Tobacco is also regulated by all fifty state governments Most people accept such restrictions and prohibitions of certain drugs especially the hard drugs which are illegal in most countries br In the medical context psychoactive drugs as a treatment for illness is widespread and generally accepted Little controversy exists concerning over the counter psychoactive medications in antiemetics and antitussives Psychoactive drugs are commonly prescribed to patients with psychiatric disorders However certain critics believe that certain prescription psychoactives such as antidepressants and stimulants are overprescribed and threaten patients judgement and autonomy br br br Effect on animals br br A number of animals consume different psychoactive plants animals berries and even fermented fruit becoming intoxicated An example of this is cats after consuming catnip Traditional legends of sacred plants often contain references to animals that introduced humankind to their use Animals and psychoactive plants appear to have co evolved possibly explaining why these chemicals and their receptors exist within the nervous system br br br Widely used psychoactive drugs br This is a list of commonly used drugs that contain psychoactive ingredients Please note that the following lists contains legal and illegal drugs based on the country s laws br
