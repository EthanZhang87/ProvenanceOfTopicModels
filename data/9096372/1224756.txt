id: 1224756
A dolphinarium is an aquarium for dolphins The dolphins are usually kept in a pool though occasionally they may be kept in pens in the open sea either for research or public performances Some dolphinariums sometimes called dolphinaria in plural consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public others are part of larger parks such as marine mammal parks zoos or theme parks with other animals and attractions as well br While cetaceans have been held in captivity since the s the first commercial dolphinarium was opened only in Their popularity increased rapidly until the s Since the s increasing concern for animal welfare led to stricter regulation which in several countries ultimately resulted in the closure of some dolphinariums Despite this trend dolphinariums are still widespread in Europe Japan and North America The most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums is the bottlenose dolphin as it is relatively easy to train and has a long lifespan in captivity While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools vary among countries Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades many animal rights groups still consider keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse br br br History br br Though cetaceans have been held in captivity in both North America and Europe by Boston Aquarial Gardens in and pairs of beluga whales in Barnum s American Museum in New York City museum dolphins were first kept for paid entertainment in the Marine Studios dolphinarium founded in in St Augustine Florida It was here that it was discovered that dolphins could be trained to perform tricks Recognizing the success of Marine Studios more dolphinariums began keeping dolphins for entertainment In the s keeping dolphins in zoos and aquariums for entertainment purposes increased in popularity after the Flipper movie and subsequent Flipper television series In the first dolphin was exported to Europe In these early days dolphinariums could grow quickly due to a lack of legislation and lack of organised animal welfare br New legislation most notably the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the United States combined with a more critical view on animal welfare forced many dolphinariums around the world to close A prominent example is the United Kingdom in the early s there were at least dolphinariums and traveling dolphin shows however the last dolphinarium closed its doors in The last dolphinarium in Hungary was closed in In both Chile and Costa Rica prohibited keeping cetaceans captive However around dolphinariums currently exist across Europe of which are within the EU Japan Mexico and the United States are also home to a relatively large number of dolphinariums br br br Design br br The water in the pools has to be constantly filtered to keep it clean for the dolphins and the temperature and composition of the water has to be controlled to match the conditions dolphins experience in the wild In the absence of a common international regulation guidelines regarding the minimum size of the pools vary between countries To give an indication of pool sizes the European Association for Aquatic Mammals recommends that a pool for five dolphins should have a surface area of m sq ft plus an additional m sq ft for every additional animal have a depth of m ft and have a water volume of at least m cu ft with an additional m cu ft for every additional animal If two of these three conditions are met and the third is not more than below standard the EAAM considers the pool size to be acceptable br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Animals br br br Species br Various species of dolphins are kept in captivity as well as several other small whale species such as harbour porpoises finless porpoises and belugas though in those cases the word dolphinarium may not be fitting as these are not true dolphins Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphins kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train have a long lifespan in captivity and a friendly appearance Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world though exact numbers are hard to determine Orcas are well known for their performances in shows but the number of orcas kept in captivity is very small especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins with only captive orcas being held in aquaria as of br The majority of orcas are located in the various SeaWorld parks in the United States Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins gray whales false killer whales pilot whales and common dolphins Commerson s dolphins as well as rough toothed dolphins but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin There are fewer than ten Amazon river dolphins Risso s dolphins or tucuxi in captivity Two unusual and very rare hybrid dolphins wolphins a cross between the bottlenose dolphin and the false killer whale are kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii Also two common bottlenose hybrids reside in captivity one at Discovery Cove and the other SeaWorld San Diego br br br Trade and capture br br In the early days many bottlenose dolphins were wild caught off the coast of Florida Though the Marine Mammal Protection Act established in allows an exception for the collection of dolphins for public display and research purposes when a permit is obtained bottlenose dolphins have not been captured in American waters since In most Western countries breeding programs have been set up to provide the dolphinariums with new animals To achieve a sufficient birth rate and to prevent inbreeding artificial insemination AI is occasionally used The use of AI also allows dolphinariums to increase the genetic diversity of their population without having to bring in any dolphins from other facilities br The trade of dolphins is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora also known as the Washington Convention or CITES Endangered dolphin species are included in CITES Appendix I in which case trade is permitted only in exceptional circumstances Species considered not to be threatened with extinction are included in Appendix II in which case trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival Most cetacean species traded for display in captivity to the public or for use in swimming with dolphins and other interaction programs are listed on Appendix II br However the dolphin trade still continues A live bottlenose dolphin is estimated to be worth between a few thousand to several tens of thousands of US dollars depending on age condition and prior training Captures are reported to be on the rise in the South Pacific and the Caribbean Cuba has also been an exporter of dolphins in recent years this being organized by the Acuario Nacional de Cuba In recent years the Solomon Islands have also allowed the collection and export of dolphins for public display facilities A law banned the export of dolphins however this ban was seemingly overturned in when some dolphins were shipped to Dubai br br br Criticism and legal bans br br br Animal welfare br Many animal welfare groups such as the World Animal Protection consider keeping dolphins in captivity to be a form of animal abuse The main arguments are that dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement in pools regardless of pool size in the wild dolphins swim hundreds of miles every day and do not get enough stimulation Dolphins often show repetitive behavior in captivity and sometimes become aggressive towards other animals or people In some cases the behavior of dolphins in captivity also results in their own death br The lifespan of dolphins in captivity is another subject of debate Research has shown that there is no significant difference between wild and captive survival rates for bottlenose dolphins This does not however reflect a global state of affairs for example bottlenose dolphins in captive facilities in Jamaica suffer from extremely high mortality rates br Some scientists suggest that the unusually high intelligence of dolphins means that they should be recognized as non human persons In the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests prohibited the captivity of dolphins on these grounds finding it morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose br br br Legal bans or restrictions relating to keeping cetaceans in captivity br In the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act became law in Canada Two facilities would be affected Marineland of Canada and the Vancouver Aquarium When passed in June Marineland was reported to have cetaceans while the Vancouver Aquarium had just one dolphin remaining The law has a grandfather clause permitting those cetaceans already in captivity to remain where they are but breeding and further acquisition of cetaceans is prohibited subject to limited exceptions br According to animal rights organizations that monitor the subject the following jurisdictions have full or partial bans on keeping dolphins in captivity Bolivia China Canada Costa Rica Croatia Cyprus Greece Hungary India Slovenia Switzerland Turkey and the American states California New York and South Carolina Other countries have laws so restrictive that is virtually impossible to keep cetaceans in captivity Brazil Luxembourg Nicaragua Norway and the United Kingdom France tried to ban keeping or breeding cetaceans in captivity in but the ban was overturned on technical grounds by the Conseil d tat in On September Environment Minister Barbara Pompili announced that France s three remaining dolphinariums would be closed within the next to years and no new dolphinariums could be opened and no new marine mammals could be bred or imported A month earlier on August the Brussels Capital Region which has no dolphinaria announced it was working on a ban on any future creation of dolphinariums to safeguard the welfare of any marine mammals that might end up being kept within its territory br br br See also br List of dolphinariums br Marine mammal park br Category Films about dolphins br br br
