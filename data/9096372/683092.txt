title: Cruelty to animals
id: 683092
Cruelty to animals also called animal abuse animal neglect or animal cruelty is the infliction of suffering or harm by humans upon animals either by omission neglect or by commission More narrowly it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievements such as killing animals for entertainment cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself referred to as zoosadism Divergent approaches to laws concerning animal cruelty occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world For example some laws govern methods of killing animals for food clothing or other products and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment education research or pets There are several conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals br Even though some practices like animal fighting are widely acknowledged as cruel not all people and nations have the same definition of what constitutes animal cruelty Many would claim that docking a piglet s tail without an anesthetic constitutes cruelty Others would respond that it is a routine technique for meat production to prevent harm later in the pig s life Additionally laws governing animal cruelty vary from nation to nation While it is routine practice in the United States docking a piglet s tail as part of regular practice is prohibited in the European Union EU br Utilitarian advocates argue from the position of costs and benefits and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach that is closer to the animal welfare position whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights Animal rights theorists criticize these positions arguing that the words unnecessary and humane are subject to widely differing interpretations and that animals have basic rights They say that most animal use itself is unnecessary and a cause of suffering so the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never viewed as a substance or as non living things br br br Definition and viewpoints br br Throughout history some individuals like Leonardo da Vinci for example who once purchased caged birds in order to set them free were concerned about cruelty to animals His notebooks also record his anger with the fact that humans used their dominance to raise animals for slaughter According to contemporary philosopher Nigel Warburton for most of human history the dominant view has been that animals are there for humans to do with as they see fit Sociologist David Nibert emphasizes that the process of domestication dramatically increased the exploitation of animals by humans particularly in Eurasia Much of this exploitation involved not only direct physical violence but also structural violence as their systemic oppression and enslavement resulted in their inability to meet their basic needs the loss of self determination and the loss of opportunity to live in a natural way He says that the remains of domesticated animals from thousands of years ago found during archeological excavations revealed numerous bone pathologies which provide evidence of extreme suffering br br Excavations from BCE revealed bone deformities in enslaved goats and cows and provided some indication of stress presumably due to the conditions in which these early domestic animals were kept Remains of sheep and goats from the early Bronze Age show a marked decrease in bone thickness reflecting calcium deficiencies resulting from the combined effects of poor nutrition and intensive milking br Several religious traditions especially those originating in India have promoted animal welfare as an important or fundamental concept even to the point of promoting vegetarianism or veganism Examples include Buddhism Jainism Hinduism cattle are sacred animals in India and some forms of Judaism many Orthodox Jews do not wear leather br Ren Descartes believed that non humans are automata complex machines with no soul mind or reason In Cartesian dualism consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace However close analysis shows that many human features such as complex sign usage tool use and self consciousness can be found in some animals br Charles Darwin by presenting the theory of evolution revolutionized the way that humans viewed their relationship with other species Darwin believed that not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals but the latter had social mental and moral lives too Later in The Descent of Man he wrote There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties br Modern philosophers and intellectuals such as Peter Singer and Tom Regan have argued that animals ability to feel pain as humans do makes their well being worthy of equal consideration There are many precursors of this train of thought Jeremy Bentham the founder of utilitarianism famously wrote in his An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation br br The question is not can they reason nor can they talk but can they suffer br These arguments have prompted some to suggest that animals well being should enter a social welfare function directly not just indirectly via its effect only on human well being Many countries have now formally recognized animal sentience and animal suffering and have passed anti cruelty legislation in response br br br Forms br Animal cruelty can be broken down into two main categories active and passive Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect in which the cruelty is a lack of action rather than the action itself Oftentimes passive animal cruelty is accidental born of ignorance In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that the cruelty occurred out of ignorance the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner then revisit the situation In more severe cases exigent circumstances may require that the animal be removed for veterinary care br br br Industrial animal farming br br Farm animals are generally produced in large industrial facilities that house thousands of animals at high densities these are sometimes called factory farms The industrial nature of these facilities means that many routine procedures or animal husbandry practices impinge on the welfare of the animals and could be considered cruelty with Henry Stephen Salt claiming in that it is impossible to transport and slaughter vast numbers of large and highly sensitive animals humanely br It has been suggested the number of animals hunted kept as companions used in laboratories reared for the fur industry raced and used in zoos and circuses is insignificant compared to farm animals and therefore the animal welfare issue is numerically reducible to the farm animal welfare issue Similarly it has been suggested by campaign groups that chickens cows pigs and other farm animals are among the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty For example because male chickens do not lay eggs newly hatched males are culled using macerators or grinders Worldwide meat overconsumption is another factor that contributes to the miserable situation of farm animals Many undercover investigators have exposed the animal cruelty taking place inside the factory farming industry and there is evidence to show that consumers provided with accurate information about the process of meat production and the abuse that accompanies it has led to changes in their attitudes br The American Veterinary Medical Association accepts maceration subject to certain conditions but recommends alternative methods of culling as more humane Egg laying hens are then transferred to battery cages where they are kept in high densities Matheny and Leahy attribute osteoporosis in hens to this caging method Broiler chickens suffer similar situations in which they are fed steroids to grow at a super fast speed so fast that their bones heart and lungs often cannot keep up Broiler chickens under six weeks old suffer painful crippling due to fast growth rates whilst one in a hundred of these very young birds dies of heart failure br To reduce aggression in overcrowded conditions shortly after birth piglets are castrated their tails are amputated and their teeth are clipped and earmarked Calves are sometimes raised in veal crates which are small stalls that immobilize calves during their growth reducing costs and preventing muscle development making the resulting meat a pale color preferred by consumers br In the United States animal cruelty such as soring which is illegal sometimes occurs on farms and ranches as does lawful but cruel treatment such as livestock branding Since ag gag laws prohibit video or photographic documentation of farm activities these practices have been documented by secret photography taken by whistleblowers or undercover operatives from such organizations as Mercy for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States posing as employees Agricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have successfully advocated for laws that tightly restrict secret photography or concealing information from farm employers br br br Welfare concerns of farm animals br br The following are lists of invasive procedures that cause pain routinely performed on farm animals and housing conditions that routinely cause animal welfare concerns In one survey of United States homeowners of respondents said they consider the price of meat a more important issue br br br Fur industry br br Animal welfare activists suggest a total ban on fur production due to the suffering inflicted on animals especially minks It has been suggested that fur production is immoral as fur clothes are luxury items Minks are solitary and territorial animals however in fur farms they are raised in cages and skinned after being killed either by breaking their necks or using lethal gas br br br Alleged link to human violence and psychological disorders br There are studies providing evidence of a link between animal cruelty and violence towards humans A study found that slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates arrests for violent crimes arrests for rape and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries A large national survey by the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies found a substantial overlap between companion animal abuse and child abuse and that cruelty to animals most frequently co occurred with psychological abuse and less severe forms of physical child abuse br A history of torturing pets and small animals a behavior known as zoosadism is considered one of the signs of certain psychopathologies including antisocial personality disorder also known as a psychopathic personality disorder According to The New York Times the FBI has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appears in its computer records of serial rapists and murderers and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals a diagnostic criterion for conduct disorders A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well including one patient who had murdered a young boy Robert K Ressler an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation s behavioral sciences unit studied serial killers and noted Murderers like this Jeffrey Dahmer very often start by killing and torturing animals as kids br Acts of intentional animal cruelty or non accidental injury may be indicators of serious psychological problems According to the American Humane Association of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence As many as of pet owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and or hurt or killed one or more of their pets of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets Battered women report that they are hesitant from leaving their abusers because they fear what will happen to the animals in their absence Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes br Cruelty to animals is one of the three components of the Macdonald triad this behavior is considered to be one of the signs of violent antisocial behavior in children and adolescents According to the studies used to form this model cruelty to animals is a common but not universal behavior in children and adolescents who grow up to become serial killers and other violent criminals It has also been found that children who are cruel to animals have often witnessed or been victims of abuse themselves In two separate studies cited by the Humane Society of the United States roughly one third of families suffering from domestic abuse indicated that at least one child had hurt or killed a pet br br br Cultural rituals br Many times when Asiatic elephants are captured in Thailand handlers use a technique known as the training crush in which handlers use sleep deprivation hunger and thirst to break the elephants spirit and make them submissive to their owners moreover handlers drive nails into the elephants ears and feet br The practice of cruelty to animals for divination purposes is found in ancient cultures e g Scapulimancy and some modern religions such as Santeria continue to do animal sacrifices for healing and other rituals Taghairm was performed by ancient Scots to summon devils br br br Entertainment br br br Television and filmmaking br br Animal cruelty has long been an issue in filmmaking industry with even some big budget Hollywood films receiving criticism for allegedly harmful and sometimes lethal treatment of animals during production Court decisions have addressed films that harm animals such as videos that in part depict dog fighting br The American Humane Association AHA has been associated with monitoring American film making since the release of the film Jesse James in which a horse was pushed off a plank and drowned in a body of water after having fallen feet into it Initially monitoring of animal cruelty was a partnership between the AHA and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America also called the Hays office through the Motion Picture Production Code Provisions in the code discouraged apparent cruelty to children and animals and because the Hays Office had the power to enforce this clause the AHA often had access to sets to assess adherence to it However because the AHA s Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets the closure of the Hays Office in corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets br By a three year contract was in place between the Screen Actors Guild SAG and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists which specified that the AHA should be consulted in the use of animals when appropriate but the contract did not provide a structure for what appropriate meant and had no enforcement powers This contract expired in br One of the most infamous examples of animal cruelty in the film was Michael Cimino s flop Heaven s Gate in which numerous animals were brutalized and even killed during production Cimino allegedly killed chickens and bled horses from the neck to gather samples of their blood to smear on actors for Heaven s Gate and also allegedly had a horse blown up with dynamite while shooting a battle sequence the shot of which made it into the film This film played a large part in renewed scrutiny of animal cruelty in films and led to renewed official on set jurisdiction to monitor the treatment of animals by the AHA in br After the release of the film Reds the star and director of the picture Warren Beatty apologized for his Spanish film crew s use of tripwires on horses while filming a battle scene when Beatty was not present Tripwires were used against horses when Rambo III and The th Warrior were being filmed A water buffalo was sliced nearly in half during the production of Apocalypse Now while a donkey was bled to death for dramatic effect for the Danish film Manderlay in a scene later deleted from the film br br There is a case of cruelty to animals in the South Korean film The Isle according to its director Kim Ki Duk In the film a real frog is skinned alive while fish are mutilated Seven animals were killed for the camera in the controversial Italian film Cannibal Holocaust The images in the film include the slow and graphic beheading and ripping apart of a turtle a monkey being beheaded and its brains being consumed by natives and a spider being chopped apart Cannibal Holocaust was only one film in a collective of similarly themed movies cannibal films that featured unstaged animal cruelty Their influences were rooted in the films of Mondo filmmakers which sometimes contained similar content In several countries Cannibal Holocaust was banned or allowed for release with most of the animal cruelty edited out br The SAG has contracted with the AHA for monitoring animal use during filming or while on the set Compliance with this arrangement is voluntary and only applies to films made in the United States Films monitored by the American Humane Association may bear one of their end credit messages Many productions including those made in the United States do not advise AHA or SAG of animal use in films so there is no oversight br Some other animal welfare organizations worldwide such as the Animal Anti Cruelty League in South Africa have also monitored the use of animals in the film br br br Internet videos br Cruelty to animals has often been filmed on video and uploaded to social media websites or private Internet groups This may involve large scale systematic operations a notable example of this was a global monkey torture ring uncovered by the BBC in June where participants would produce and distribute videos of monkeys being hurt and killed Individuals who have published animal cruelty content include Luka Magnotta a Canadian murderer who uploaded YouTube videos of himself torturing and killing cats Rub n Marrero Pernas a man in Cuba who was found to be raping torturing then killing dogs and recording the acts online for an audience and Leighton Labute a Canadian man who was arrested in for torturing and killing three hamsters and uploading the video to social media br The video sharing site YouTube has been criticized for hosting thousands of videos of real life animal cruelty especially the feeding of one animal to another for entertainment and spectacle Although some of these videos have been flagged as inappropriate by users YouTube has generally declined to remove them unlike videos that include copyright infringement In YouTube banned staged animal rescue videos where animals were purposely put in danger before being saved br br br Circuses br br The use of animals in the circus has been controversial since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals Animal abuse in circuses has been documented such as keeping them in small enclosures lack of veterinary care abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies Animal trainers have argued that some criticism is not based on fact including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going to hurt them that caging is cruel and common and that the use of whips chains or training harms animals br Bolivia has enacted what animal rights activists called the world s first ban on all animals in circuses br br br Animal fighting br br Bullfighting is criticized by animal rights or animal welfare activists referring to it as a cruel or barbaric blood sport in which the bull suffers severe stress and slow torturous death Several activist groups undertake anti bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries In Spain opponents of bullfighting are referred to as anti taurinos br The Bulletpoint Bullfight warns that bullfighting is not for the squeamish advising spectators to be prepared for blood It details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse mounted lancers the charging by the bull of a blindfolded armored horse who is sometimes doped up and unaware of the proximity of the bull the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros followed by the matador s fatal sword thrust It stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous It further warns those attending bullfights to be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down br br The Toro Jubilo or Toro embolado in Soria Medinaceli Spain is a festival associated with animal cruelty During this festival balls of pitch are attached to a bull s horns and set on fire The bull is then released into the streets and will run around in pain often smashing into walls in an attempt to douse the fire as spectators attempt to dodge the animal The pitch balls can burn for hours and they burn the bull s horns body and eyes The animal rights group PACMA has described the fiesta as a clear example of animal mistreatment br Dog fighting is a sport that turns dogs against one another in a ring or a pit for gambling or the entertainment of the spectators br br br Rattlesnake round ups br Rattlesnake round ups also known as rattlesnake rodeos are annual events common in the rural Midwest and Southern United States where the primary attractions are captured wild rattlesnakes which are sold displayed killed for food or animal products such as snakeskin or released back into the wild The largest rattlesnake round up in the United States is held in Sweetwater Texas Held every year since the event currently attracts approximately visitors per year and in each annual round up was said to result in the capture of of the state s rattlesnake population br Rattlesnake round ups became a concern by animal welfare groups and conservationists due to claims of animal cruelty In response some round ups impose catch size restrictions or releasing captured snakes back into the wild br br br Warfare br Military animals are creatures that have been employed by humankind for use in warfare They are a specific application of working animals Examples include horses dogs and dolphins Only recently has the involvement of animals in war been questioned and practices such as using animals for fighting as living bombs or for military testing purposes such as during the Bikini atomic experiments may now be criticized for being cruel br Princess Anne Princess Royal the patron of the British Animals in War Memorial stated that animals adapt to what humans want them to do but that they will not do things that they do not want to even with training Animal participation in the human conflict was commemorated in the United Kingdom in with the erection of the Animals in War Memorial in Hyde Park London br In a video of a US Marine throwing a puppy over a cliff during the Iraq conflict was popularised as an internet phenomenon and attracted widespread criticism of the soldier s actions for being an act of cruelty br br br Unnecessary scientific experiments or demonstrations br br Under all three of the conceptual approaches to animal cruelty discussed above performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty Due to changes in ethical standards this type of cruelty tends to be less common today than it used to be in the past For example schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travelers on the Grand Tour br br br No pet policies and abandonment br br Many apartment complexes and rental homes institute no pet policies No pet policies are a leading cause of animal abandonment which is considered a crime in many jurisdictions In many cases abandoned pets have to be euthanized due to the strain they put on animal shelters and rescue groups Abandoned animals often become feral or contribute to feral populations In particular feral dogs can pose a serious threat to pets children and livestock br In Ontario Canada no pet policies are outlawed under the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Act and are considered invalid even when a tenant signs a lease that includes a no pets clause Similar legislation has also been considered in Manitoba br br br Hunting br br Trophy hunting is largely a recreational activity causing death and injury to a significant number of animals In poaching the animal is killed and valuable parts such as tusks or bones are collected Canned hunting refers to the practice of bringing exotic animals as trophies to private land for hunting Despite being cruel to animals hunting is practiced in thousands of private properties around the world and is considered a profitable business br br br Laws by country br br Many jurisdictions around the world have enacted statutes that forbid cruelty to some animals but these vary by country and in some cases by the use or practice br br br Africa br br br Egypt br br Egyptian law states that anyone who inhumanely beats or intentionally kills any domesticated animal may be jailed or fined The Egyptian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established over a hundred years ago and was instrumental in promoting a ban on bullfighting in Egypt br In ancient Egyptian law the killers of cats or dogs were executed br br br Nigeria br Animal cruelty in Nigeria is prohibited under Section of the Criminal Code These include according to a cruelly beating kicking over loading infuriating or terrifying an animal or allowing this to happen as the owner Section b defines failure to act as the willful or unreasonable doing or omission of any act that causes unnecessary suffering or as the owner permitting an act that causes unnecessary suffering This section also prohibits transporting animals in a way that causes unnecessary suffering c administering poison d performing operations without due care e and actions related to animal fighting f br br br South Africa br The Animal Protection Act No of in South Africa covers farm animals domestic animals and birds and wild animals birds and reptiles that are in captivity or under the control of humans br The Act contains a detailed list of prohibited acts of cruelty including overloading causing unnecessary suffering due to confinement chaining or tethering abandonment unnecessarily denying food or water keeping in a dirty or parasitic condition or failing to provide veterinary assistance There is also a general provision prohibiting wanton unreasonable or negligible commission or omission of acts resulting in unnecessary suffering The Department of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries for to mentions updating animal protection legislation br The NSPCA is the largest and oldest animal welfare organization in South Africa that enforces of all animal cruelty cases in the country by means of enforcing the Animals Protection Act br br br South Sudan br The Criminal Code of South Sudan has laws against the maltreatment of animals The laws read br Ill treatment of Domestic Animal br br Whoever cruelly beats tortures or otherwise willfully ill treats any tame domestic or wild animal which has previously been deprived of its liberty or arranges promotes or organizes fights between cocks rams bulls or other domestic animals or encourages such acts commits an offense and upon conviction shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months or with a fine br Riding and Neglect of Animal br br Whoever wantonly rides overdrives or overloads any animal or intentionally drugs or employs any animal which by reason of age sickness wounds or infirmity is not in a condition to work or neglects any animal in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering commits an offense and upon conviction shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or with a fine or with both br br br Americas br br br Argentina br In Argentina National Law sanctions from days to one year in prison for those who mistreat or inflict acts of cruelty on animals br br br Brazil br br Brazil is a high volume animal producer slaughtering around land based animals per person per year compared to a global average of The country s dependency on farmed animals is relatively high with around farmed animals per person double the global average of br A law prohibits the abuse of domestic and wild animals It imposes more serious penalties for cruelty than the decree with a sentence of months to a year plus a fine with the penalty increased by one sixth to one third of the animal is killed br br br Canada br br In Canada it is an offense under the Criminal Code to intentionally cause unnecessary pain suffering or injury to an animal Poisoning animals is specifically prohibited It is also an offense to threaten to harm an animal belonging to someone else Most provinces and territories also have animal protection legislation However it is not explicitly illegal in Canadian law to kill a dog or cat for consumption br The Animal Legal Defense Fund releases an annual report ranking the animal protection laws of every province and territory based on their relative strength and general comprehensiveness In the strongest four jurisdictions were Manitoba British Columbia Ontario and Nova Scotia The weakest four were Saskatchewan Northwest Territories Quebec and Nunavut br br br Chile br Law established sanctions including fines from to Mensual Tributary Units and prison from days to years for those involved in acts of animal cruelty Also it facilitates animal care through school education and establishes a Bioethics Committee to define policies related to experiments with animals br br br Colombia br br In Colombia there is little control over cruel behaviors against animals and the government has proposed that bullfighting be declared a Cultural Heritage other activities like cockfighting are given the same legal treatment br br br Costa Rica br br In after many years of legal wrangling Costa Rica passed their Animal Welfare Law It includes prison sentences of three months to one year for harming or killing a domesticated animal or for conducting animal fights There are monetary fines for those who mistreat neglect or abandon animals for breeding or training animals for fighting or for violating regulations on animal experimentation The law does not cover agricultural practices aquaculture zootechnical or veterinary activities killing of animals for consumption for sanitary or scientific reasons or reproductive control Wild animals are covered under the Wild Life Act br The bill had stalled its motion through the legislature until an injured toucan was found which had lost the top half of its beak News and images of the injured bird now named Grecia raised enough contributions to create a D printed prosthesis for her and helped spur the bill s progress br br br Mexico br The current policy of Mexico in civil law condemns physical harm to animals as property damage to the owners of the abused animal considering the animals as owned property br In criminal law the situation is different In December the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District reformed the existing Penal Code of Mexico City establishing abuse and cruelty to animals as criminal offenses provided the animals are not deemed to be plagues or pests Abandoned animals are not considered to be plagues A subsequent reform was entered into force on January by a decree published in the Official Gazette of the Federal District The law provides penalties of six months to two years imprisonment and a fine of to days at minimum wage to persons who cause obvious injury to an animal and the penalty is increased by one half of those injuries endanger its life The penalty rises to two to four years of prison and a fine of to days at minimum wage if the person intentionally causes the death of an animal br This law is considered to extend throughout the rest of the constituent states of the country In addition The Law of Animal Protection of the Federal District is wide ranging based on banning unnecessary suffering Similar laws now exist in most states br br br United States br br The primary federal law relating to animal care and conditions in the US is the Animal Welfare Act of amended in and It is the only Federal law in the United States that regulates the treatment of animals in research exhibition transport and by dealers Other laws policies and guidelines may include additional species coverage or specifications for animal care and use but all refer to the Animal Welfare Act as the minimum acceptable standard br The Animal Legal Defense Fund releases an annual report ranking the animal protection laws of every state based on their relative strength and general comprehensiveness In a s report the top five states for their strong anti cruelty laws were Illinois Maine Michigan Oregon and California The five states with the weakest animal cruelty laws in were Kentucky Iowa South Dakota New Mexico and Wyoming br In Massachusetts and New York agents of humane societies and associations may be appointed as special officers to enforce statutes outlawing animal cruelty br In a Florida legislator proposed a ban on cruelty to bovines stating A person who for practice entertainment or sport intentionally fells trips or otherwise causes a cow to fall or lose its balance using roping lassoing dragging or otherwise touching the tail of the cow commits a misdemeanor of the first degree The proposal did not become law br In the United States ear cropping tail docking rodeo sports and other acts are legal and sometimes condoned Penalties for cruelty can be minimal if pursued Currently of the states have enacted felony penalties for certain forms of animal abuse However in most jurisdictions animal cruelty is most commonly charged as a misdemeanor offense In one recent California case a felony conviction for animal cruelty could theoretically net a year to a life sentence due to their three strikes law which increases sentences based on prior felony convictions br In West Hollywood California passed an ordinance banning declawing of house cats In Norfolk Virginia passed legislation only allowing the procedure for medical reasons However most jurisdictions allow the procedure br In April Texas Federal Court Judge Sim Lake ruled that the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of which criminalized the recording sale and transport of videos depicting animal cruelty as obscenity violates the First Amendment Judge Lake noted that obscenity tests require an explicitly sexual depiction which the criminalized videos lack This follows the precedent set by United States v Stevens which additionally held that restrictions on the possession of animal cruelty videos were unconstitutional br In November U S President Donald Trump signed the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act making certain intentional acts of cruelty to animals federal crimes carrying penalties of up to seven years in prison The Act expanded upon the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act signed by President Barack Obama that banned the creation and distribution of videos that showed animals being crushed burned drowned suffocated impaled or subjected to other forms of torture The underlying acts which were not included in the bill are part of the PACT Act and are now felony offenses The bill was unanimously passed in both the House and Senate br br br State welfare laws br Several states have enacted or considered laws in support of humane farming br br On November Florida voters passed Amendment by a margin of amending the Florida Constitution to ban the confinement of pregnant pigs in gestation crates br On January the bill AB died in the California Assembly s Agriculture Committee The bill would have banned gestation and veal crates eventually being amended to include only veal crates On May the bill AB was withdrawn from the California State Assembly The bill had been effectively killed in the Assembly Agriculture Committee by replacing the contents of the bill with language concerning tobacco cessation coverage under Medi Cal AB was very similar to the current language of Proposition br On November Arizona voters passed Proposition with support The measure prohibits the confinement of calves in veal crates and breeding sows in gestation crates br On June Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski signed a measure into law prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates SB th Leg Assembly Regular Session br In January Nebraska State Senate bill LB to ban the use of gestation crates for pig farmers was withdrawn within five days amidst controversy br On May Colorado Governor Bill Ritter signed into law a bill SB that phases out gestation crates and veal crates br br br Venezuela br Venezuela published a Law for Protection of Domestic Fauna free and in captivity in defining responsibilities and sanctions regarding animal care and ownership Animal cruelty acts are fined but are not a cause for imprisonment The law also forbids the possession breeding and reproduction of pit bull dogs among similar breeds that are alleged to be aggressive and dangerous It elicited reactions from dog owners who said that aggressiveness in dogs is determined more by treatment by the owner than by the breed itself br br br Asia br br br Israel br Israel banned the sale of fur to the fashion industry in June being the first country in the world to do so br br br China br br As of the year there were no laws in China governing acts of cruelty to animals There are no government supported charitable organizations like the RSPCA which monitors the cases of animal cruelty All kinds of animal abuses such as to fish tigers and bears are to be reported to law enforcement and animal welfare br In the absence of a unified law against animal mistreatment the World Animal Protection notes that some legislation protecting the welfare of animals exists in certain contexts especially ones used in research and zoos br In September legislation was drafted to address deliberate cruelty to animals in China If passed the legislation would offer some protection to pets captive wildlife and animals used in laboratories as well as regulate how farm animals are raised transported and slaughtered br In the People s Republic of China was in the process of making changes to its stray dog population laws in the capital city Beijing Mr Zheng Gang who is the director of the Internal and Judicial Committee which comes under the Beijing Municipal People s Congress BMPC supported the draft of the Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dogs from the local government The law would replace the Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dog Ownership introduced in The extant regulation talked of strictly limiting dog ownership and controlling the number of dogs in the city The proposed draft focused instead on strict management and combining restrictions with management br br br Hong Kong br As of Hong Kong has supplemented or replaced the laws against cruelty with a positive approach using laws that specify how animals should be treated br The government department primarily responsible for animal welfare in Hong Kong is the Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department AFCD br Laws enforced by the AFCD include these br br the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance also enforced by the police br the Public Health Animals and Birds Ordinance including regulations for licenses imposed on livestock keepers and animal traders and a Code of

The Act is the one that is practiced as of now The maximum penalty under the Act is Rs under br Many organizations including ones such as the local SPCA PF A and Fosterdopt are actively involved in assisting the general population in reporting cruelty cases to the police and helping bring the perpetrator to justice Due to this much change has been observed in the subcontinent In A provision of a maximum of five year imprisonment with a minimum thousand rupees fine for killing an animal has been made The draft Bill also suggests five freedoms of animals including freedom from thirst hunger and
