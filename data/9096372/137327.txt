id: 137327
An amusement park is a park that features various attractions such as rides and games as well as other events for entertainment purposes A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme often featuring multiple areas with different themes Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals amusement parks are stationary and built for long lasting operation They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups While amusement parks often contain themed areas theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects br Amusement parks evolved from European fairs pleasure gardens and large picnic areas which were created for people s recreation World s fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry br Bakken The Hill in Klampenborg Denmark Wurstelprater in Vienna Austria and Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen Denmark are the three oldest operating amusement parks in the world Lake Compounce opened in and is considered the oldest continuously operating amusement park in North America br br br History br br br Origins br The amusement park evolved from three earlier traditions traveling or periodic fairs pleasure gardens and exhibitions such as world fairs The oldest influence was the periodic fair of the Middle Ages one of the earliest was the Bartholomew Fair in England from By the th and th centuries they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses where the public could view freak shows acrobatics conjuring and juggling take part in competitions and walk through menageries br br A wave of innovation in the s and s created mechanical rides such as the steam powered carousel built by Thomas Bradshaw at the Aylsham Fair and its derivatives notably from Frederick Savage of King s Lynn Norfolk whose fairground machinery was exported all over the world his galloping horses innovation is seen in carousels today This inaugurated the era of the modern funfair ride as the working classes were increasingly able to spend their surplus wages on entertainment br The second influence was the pleasure garden An example of this is the world s oldest amusement park Bakken The Hill which opened in mainland Europe in It is located north of Copenhagen in Klampenborg Denmark br br Another early garden was the Vauxhall Gardens founded in in London By the late th century the site had an admission fee for its many attractions It regularly drew enormous crowds with its paths often noted for romantic assignations tightrope walkers hot air balloon ascents concerts and fireworks providing amusement Although the gardens were originally designed for the elites they soon became places of great social diversity Public firework displays were put on at Marylebone Gardens and Cremorne Gardens offered music dancing and animal acrobatics displays br Prater in Vienna Austria began as a royal hunting ground which was opened in for public enjoyment There followed coffee houses and caf s which led to the beginnings of the Wurstelprater as an amusement park br The concept of a fixed park for amusement was further developed with the beginning of the world s fairs The first World fair began in with the construction of the landmark Crystal Palace in London England The purpose of the exposition was to celebrate the industrial achievement of the nations of the world and it was designed to educate and entertain the visitors br br American cities and businesses also saw the world s fair as a way of demonstrating economic and industrial success The World s Columbian Exposition of in Chicago Illinois was an early precursor to the modern amusement park The fair was an enclosed site that merged entertainment engineering and education to entertain the masses It set out to bedazzle the visitors and successfully did so with a blaze of lights from the White City To make sure that the fair was a financial success the planners included a dedicated amusement concessions area called the Midway Plaisance Rides from this fair captured the imagination of the visitors and of amusement parks around the world such as the first steel Ferris wheel which was found in many other amusement areas such as the Prater by Also the experience of the enclosed ideal city with wonder rides culture and progress electricity was based on the creation of an illusory place br The midway introduced at the Columbian Exposition would become a standard part of most amusement parks fairs carnivals and circuses The midway contained not only the rides but other concessions and entertainments such as shooting galleries penny arcades games of chance and shows br br br Trolley parks and pleasure resorts br br Many modern amusement parks evolved from earlier pleasure resorts that had become popular with the public for day trips or weekend holidays for example seaside areas such as Blackpool United Kingdom and Coney Island United States In the United States some amusement parks grew from picnic groves established along rivers and lakes that provided bathing and water sports such as Lake Compounce in Connecticut first established as a picturesque picnic park in and Riverside Park in Massachusetts founded in the s along the Connecticut River br The trick was getting the public to the seaside or resort location For Coney Island in Brooklyn New York on the Atlantic Ocean a horse drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in In a million passengers rode the Coney Island Railroad and in two million visited Coney Island Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper classes and the working class at the beach The first carousel was installed in the s the first roller coaster the Switchback Railway in br br In England Blackpool was a popular beachside location beginning in the s It rose to prominence as a seaside resort with the completion in of a branch line to Blackpool from Poulton on the main Preston and Wyre Joint Railway line A sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail provided the motivation for entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions leading to more visitors and a rapid cycle of growth throughout the s and s br br In large parts of the promenade at Blackpool were wired The lighting and its accompanying pageants reinforced Blackpool s status as the North of England s most prominent holiday resort and its specifically working class character It was the forerunner of the present day Blackpool Illuminations By the s the town had a population of and could accommodate holidaymakers The number of annual visitors many staying for a week was estimated at three million br In the final decade of the th century electric trolley lines were developed in many large American cities Companies that established the trolley lines also developed trolley parks as destinations of these lines Trolley parks such as Atlanta s Ponce de Leon Park or Reading s Carsonia Park were initially popular natural leisure spots before local streetcar companies purchased the sites expanding them from picnic groves to include regular entertainments mechanical amusements dance halls sports fields boat rides restaurants and other resort facilities br br Some of these parks were developed in resort locations such as bathing resorts at the seaside in New Jersey and New York A premiere example in New Jersey was Atlantic City a famous vacation resort Entrepreneurs erected amusement parks on piers that extended from the boardwalk out over the ocean The first of several was the Ocean Pier in followed later by the Steel Pier in both of which boasted rides and attractions typical of that time such as Midway style games and electric trolley rides The boardwalk also had the first Roundabout installed in by William Somers a wooden predecessor to the Ferris Wheel Somers installed two others in Asbury Park New Jersey and Coney Island New York br Another early park was the Eldorado Amusement Park that opened in on the banks of the Hudson River overlooking New York City It consisted of acres br br br Modern amusement parks br br The first permanent enclosed entertainment area regulated by a single company was founded in Coney Island in Sea Lion Park at Coney Island in Brooklyn This park was one of the first to charge admission fee to get into the park in addition to sell tickets for rides within the park br In Sea Lion Park was joined by Steeplechase Park the first of three major amusement parks that would open in the Coney Island area George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and entertainment The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park Coney Island also featured Luna Park and Dreamland Coney Island was a huge success and by the year attendance on days could reach a million people Fueled by the efforts of Frederick Ingersoll who borrowed the name other Luna Parks were quickly erected worldwide and opened to rave reviews br The first amusement park in England was opened in the Blackpool Pleasure Beach by W G Bean In Sir Hiram Maxim s Captive Flying Machine was introduced he had designed an early aircraft powered by steam engines that had been unsuccessful and instead opened up a pleasure ride of flying carriages that revolved around a central pylon Other rides included the Grotto a fantasy ride River Caves a scenic railway water chutes and a tobogganing tower br Fire was a constant threat in those days as much of the construction within the amusement parks of the era was wooden In Dreamland was the first Coney Island amusement park to completely burn down in Luna Park also burned to the ground Most of Ingersoll s Luna Parks were similarly destroyed usually by arson before his death in br br br The Golden Age br br During the Gilded Age many Americans began working fewer hours and had more disposable income With new found money and time to spend on leisure activities Americans sought new venues for entertainment Amusement parks set up outside major cities and in rural areas emerged to meet this new economic opportunity These parks served as a source of fantasy and escape from real life By the early s hundreds of amusement parks were operating in the United States and Canada Trolley parks stood outside many cities Parks like Atlanta s Ponce de Leon and Idora Park near Youngstown OH took passengers to traditionally popular picnic grounds which by the late s also often included rides like the Giant Swing Carousel and Shoot the Chutes These amusement parks were often based on nationally known parks or world s fairs they had names like Coney Island White City Luna Park or Dreamland The American Gilded Age was in fact amusement parks Golden Age that reigned until the late s br The Golden Age of amusement parks also included the advent of the kiddie park Founded in the original Kiddie Park is located in San Antonio Texas and is still in operation as of The kiddie parks became popular all over America after World War II br This era saw the development of new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders By the end of the First World War people seemed to want an even more exciting entertainment a need met by roller coasters Although the development of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance The s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters being the decade of frenetic building for these rides br br In England Dreamland Margate opened in with Frederick Savage s carousel the first amusement ride installed In the Scenic Railway rollercoaster opened to the public with great success carrying half a million passengers in its first year The park also installed other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster the Joy Wheel Miniature Railway The Whip and the River Caves A ballroom was constructed on the site of the Skating Rink in and in a Variety Cinema was built on the site Between and over was invested in the site constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland Cinema complex in which stands to this day br Meanwhile the Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also being developed Frequent large scale investments were responsible for the construction of many new rides including the Virginia Reel Whip Noah s Ark Big Dipper and Dodgems In the s the Casino Building was built which remains to this day In land was reclaimed from the sea front It was at this period that the park moved to its acre ha current location above what became Watson Road which was built under the Pleasure Beach in During this time Joseph Emberton an architect famous for his work in the amusement trade was brought in to redesign the architectural style of the Pleasure Beach rides working on the Grand National roller coaster Noah s Ark and the Casino building to name a few br br br Depression and post World War II decline br br The Great Depression of the s and World War II during the s saw the decline of the amusement park industry War caused the affluent urban population to move to the suburbs television became a source of entertainment and families went to amusement parks less often br By the s factors such as urban decay crime and even desegregation in the ghettos led to changing patterns in how people chose to spend their free time Many of the older traditional amusement parks closed or burned to the ground Many would be taken out by the wrecking ball to make way for suburb and housing and development In Steeplechase Park once the king of all amusement parks closed down for good The traditional amusement parks which survived for example Kennywood in West Mifflin Pennsylvania and Cedar Point in Sandusky Ohio did so in spite of the odds br br br Mid Century Comeback br br Inspired by the layout of Tivoli Gardens theme park in Copenhagen Denmark in Walt Disney came up with the idea of having an amusement park next to the studios in Burbank The park would have been called Mickey Mouse Park built across the street with a western area featuring a steam driven paddleboat a turn of the century town and a midway It was rejected by the Burbank city council in fear of a carnival atmosphere In he created WED Enterprises to design the park which was now to be built in Anaheim and in was able to convince the bankers on funding the park with the help of a studio artist Herb Ryman by making an aerial drawing of Disneyland By July construction had started with a deadline of one year Disneyland opened on July and two months after the park opened it welcomed its one millionth guest Because of the financial success of Disneyland the amusement industry was reinvigorated What became Busch Gardens Tampa opened in as a garden and bird sanctuary Six Flags Over Texas opened in themed to the six different countries that ruled over Texas In Universal Studios Hollywood opened to the public with a studio tour of their backlot that had multiple adventure scenes and became a proper theme park That same year SeaWorld San Diego opened and displayed many varieties of aquatic and marine life br Initially meant to house Walt Disney s dream idea EPCOT Experimental Prototype Community Of Tomorrow Disney executives decided to settle on building the park first in Walt Disney World and the city later After six years of construction Walt Disney World opened to the public on October Meant to be a larger east coast version of Disneyland it had copies of most of the attractions from Disneyland except for Liberty Square and the Hall of Presidents yet it was financially the most ambitious project Walt Disney Productions had ever undertaken and succeeded once the holiday crowds came in during Thanksgiving In Walt Disney Productions opened the second Walt Disney World park EPCOT Center based on Walt Disney s futurist ideals and World Fairs Like a World s Fair the park would display the latest technologies in an area called Future World and the cultural pavilions in World Showcase br br br The s br br In Disney announced that it would open its third Disney World park Disney MGM Studios in which would have a working backlot However Universal knew that its Californian backlot tour would not work as a standalone attraction next to Disney World especially now as Disney built one in Disney MGM So it divided up the segments of its California tour into individual attractions such as Jaws Disaster and Kongfrontation Disney MGM Studios opened it on May with two major attractions The Backlot Tour and The Great Movie Ride The concept for the park started out as an EPCOT pavilion but was turned into a park as a half day attraction a complement to the rest of the resort The rest of the park was themed to s Hollywood and featured lost parts of Hollywood like the Brown Derby Universal Studios Florida opened on June delayed by one year to great fanfare but the primary attractions were experiencing severe technical difficulties All three of the park s major attractions Jaws Disaster and Kongfrontation were not working and suffered major technical difficulties Disaster and Kongfrontation were fixed by the end of June but Jaws had to be rebuilt and reopened three years later However Universal learned from opening day and started conducting exit surveys and special ticket deals br In Disney opened its first European park Euro Disneyland outside of Paris France designed to be like the Magic Kingdom in Florida yet it caters to the European tastes through changes including removing Tomorrowland and replacing it with Discoveryland themed to the great futuristic thinkers of European culture such as H G Wells and Jules Verne A recession in the French economy and the immense public backlash against the park led to financial hardship putting the park into debt However this did not stop Disney from expanding Disney MGM Studios with The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror in and building their fourth Walt Disney World park Disney s Animal Kingdom br br br The s br In the early s after the opening of Universal Studios Florida Universal sought to build a second theme park one aimed more towards children and their families Universal acquired the theme park rights to many properties including Marvel and Dr Seuss to build the park around In Universal Studios opened Universal Studios Islands of Adventure under the new resort name Universal Studios Escape The park was allegedly designed by former Disney Imagineers who left after the financial disaster of Disneyland Paris In the late s the Oriental Land Company the owners and operators of Tokyo Disneyland resort which opened in wanted a second park None of the current non Magic Kingdom parks satisfied the Japanese but one concept thrown away for Disneyland s second gate inspired a new one DisneySea Tokyo DisneySea is themed after stories based on the ocean and nautical adventure It was constructed at a cost of billion and opened on September The park s two signature attractions are a modernized version of Leagues Under The Sea and Journey To The Center of The Earth br In the early s Michael Eisner wanted to make Disneyland in the image of Walt Disney World s resort style Plans were made for multiple hotels such as one based on the Grand Floridian Hotel and a new west coast version of EPCOT called WESTCOT WESTCOT never came to be due to local opposition from residents rising costs and the financial fallout of Disneyland Paris After a corporate retreat in Colorado Disney executives decided to make a park themed to California so that guests could experience all of California within the confines of the Disneyland Resort and would be built across from Disneyland on its acre parking lot Disney s California Adventure would be the largest disaster Disney ever created because unlike Disneyland it would be set in the modern day and spoof modern day California with its cheap insincere and flat backdrops The park would be adult focused sell fine food and serve alcohol When the park opened on February it received a chilly reception for its lack of attractions poor environment for example Hollywood Studios Backlot was themed to a modern day movie backlot of modern day Hollywood and overemphasis on retail and dining When John Hench an original Imagineer who worked with Walt and was a chief creative executive at Imagineering since Imagineering was founded was asked for his opinion on the park he reportedly said I preferred the parking lot br Walt Disney Studios Park in Paris was the second Disneyland Paris park Disney had to build a second park or risk losing the land to the French government The park opened March with only three rides and California Adventure style theming However Hong Kong Disneyland was higher quality than the other black sheep but still lacked the number of attractions that was needed just like California Adventure and Walt Disney Studios Park It opened on September with only four lands and had exorbitant wait times on opening day for everything from rides to food br In the early s the Harry Potter book series written by J K Rowling had become a pop culture phenomenon Universal and Disney entered a bidding war over the theme park rights to the books but Disney seemed to have won after Rowling signed a letter of intent with Disney However Rowling was disappointed with Disney s small scale plans to install an omnimover attraction themed to the Defense Against the Dark Arts class with one shop and one restaurant in the former submarine lagoon at Magic Kingdom She was also displeased with the lack of creative control she had and exited the deal She went to Universal next and was also displeased with the initial plan to redress the Islands of Adventure s Lost Continent area To remedy this J K Rowling wrestled creative control from Universal and forced them to make the land a full scale realistic re creation of Hogsmeade and Hogwarts without being a refurbishment of an existing area The project was announced in and in the land was opened to the public and made Universal Orlando a must visit destination br Today there are over amusement parks in the United States ranging from mega parks and those that are operated by Warner Bros Disney Six Flags and NBCUniversal br br br Amusement and theme parks today br br The amusement park industry s offerings range from immersive theme parks such as Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi the Disneyland Resort and Universal Orlando Resort to thrilling coaster parks such as the Six Flags parks and Cedar Fair parks Countless smaller ventures exist across the United States and around the world Simpler theme parks directly aimed at smaller children have also emerged such as Legoland br Examples of amusement parks in shopping malls exist in West Edmonton Mall Pier and Mall of America br Family fun parks starting as miniature golf courses have begun to grow to include batting cages go karts bumper cars bumper boats and water slides Some of these parks have grown to include even roller coasters and traditional amusement parks now also have these competition areas in addition to their thrill rides br In theme parks in the United States had a revenue of US billion and theme parks in China had a revenue of US billion with China expected to overtake the United States by br br br Other types of amusement park br br br Educational theme parks br br Some parks use rides and attractions for educational purposes There are also Holy Land USA and the Holy Land Experience which are theme parks built to inspire Christian piety Dinosaur World entertains families with dinosaurs in natural settings while the SeaWorld and Busch Gardens parks also offer educational experiences with each of the parks housing several thousand animals fish and other sea life in dozens of attractions and exhibits focusing on animal education br Created in the Puy du Fou is a much celebrated theme park in Vend e France It is centered around European French and local history It received several international prizes br br br Family owned theme parks br br Some theme parks did evolve from more traditional amusement park enterprises such as Knott s Berry Farm In the s Walter Knott and his family sold berries from a roadside stand which grew to include a restaurant serving fried chicken dinners Within a few years lines outside the restaurant were often several hours long To entertain the waiting crowds Walter Knott built a Ghost Town in using buildings relocated from real old west towns such as the Calico California ghost town and Prescott Arizona In the Knott family fenced the farm charged admission for the first time and Knott s Berry Farm officially became a theme park Because of its long history Knott s Berry Farm currently claims to be America s First Theme Park Knott s Berry Farm is now owned by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company Lake Compounce in Bristol Connecticut may be the true oldest continuously operating amusement park in the United States open since Santa Claus Town which opened in Santa Claus Indiana in and included Santa s Candy Castle and other Santa Claus themed attractions is considered the first themed attraction in the United States a precursor to the modern day theme park Santa Claus Land renamed Holiday World in opened in in Santa Claus Indiana and many people will argue that it was the first true Theme Park despite Knott s history In the s the Herschend family took over operation of the tourist attraction Marvel Cave near Branson Missouri Over the next decade they modernized the cave which led to large numbers of people waiting to take the tour The Herschend family opened a recreation of the old mining town that once existed atop Marvel Cave The small village eventually became the theme park Silver Dollar City The park is still owned and operated by the Herschends and the family has several other parks including Dollywood Kentucky Kingdom and Wild Adventures br br br Regional parks br br The first regional amusement park as well as the first Six Flags park Six Flags Over Texas was officially opened in in Arlington Texas The first Six Flags amusement park was the vision of Angus Wynne Jr and helped create the modern competitive amusement park industry In the late s Wynne visited Disneyland and was inspired to create an affordable closer and larger amusement park that would be filled with fantasy He followed in the steps of Disney and had subdivisions within the park that reflected different lands The subdivisions included the Old South and other sections that referenced Wynne s background By the second Six Flags park Six Flags Over Georgia opened and in Six Flags Over Mid America now Six Flags St Louis opened near St Louis Missouri Also in was the opening of the Walt Disney World resort complex in Florida In Warner Bros in partnership with Village Roadshow opened their own Warner Bros Movie World It is the only Movie Related theme park in Australia Warner Bros continued their theme park ventures and opened Warner Bros World Abu Dhabi in UAE and Parque Warner Madrid in Spain br br br Admission prices and admission policies br br Amusement parks collect much of their revenue from admission fees paid by guests attending the park Other revenue sources include parking fees food and beverage sales and souvenirs br Practically all amusement parks operate using one of two admission principles br br br Pay as you go br In amusement parks using the pay as you go scheme a guest enters the park at little or no charge The guest must then purchase rides individually either at the attraction s entrance or by purchasing ride tickets or a similar exchange method like a token The cost of the attraction is often based on its complexity or popularity For example a guest might pay one ticket to ride a carousel but four tickets to ride a roller coaster br The park may allow guests to purchase a pass providing unlimited admissions to all attractions within the park for a specified duration of time A wristband or pass is then shown at the attraction entrance to gain admission br br Disneyland opened in using the pay as you go format Initially guests paid the ride admission fees at the attractions Within a short time the problems of handling such large amounts of coins led to the development of a ticket system that while now out of use is still part of the amusement park lexicon In this new format guests purchased ticket books that contained a number of tickets labeled A B and C Rides and attractions using an A ticket were generally simple with B tickets and C tickets used for the larger more popular rides Later the D ticket was added then finally the E ticket which was used on the biggest and most elaborate rides like Space Mountain Smaller tickets could be traded up for use on larger rides so that for example two or three A tickets would equal a single B ticket Disneyland as well as the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World abandoned this practice in br br br Pay one price br An amusement park using the pay one price scheme will charge guests a single admission fee The guest is then entitled to use most of the attractions usually including flagship roller coasters in the park as often as they wish during their visit A daily admission pass daypass is the most basic fare on sale also sold are season tickets which offer holders admission for the entire operating year plus special privileges for the newest attractions and express passes which gives holders priority in bypassing lineup queues for popular attractions br Pay one price format parks also have attractions that are not included in the admission charge these are called up charge attractions and can include Skycoasters or go kart tracks or games of skill where prizes are won br All Warner Bros Theme Parks Warner Bros Movie World Warner Bros World Parque Warner Madrid follow this scheme br When Angus Wynne founder of Six Flags Over Texas first visited Disneyland upon its opening in he noted that park s pay as you go format as a reason to make his park pay one price He thought that a family would be more likely to visit his park if they knew up front how much it would cost to attend br br br Rides and attractions br br Mechanized thrill rides are a defining feature of amusement park attractions Early rides include the carousel which originally developed from cavalry training methods first used in the Middle Ages By the th century carousels were common in parks around the world Another such ride which shaped the future of the amusement park was the roller coaster The origins of roller coasters can be traced back to th century Russia where gravity driven attractions which at first only consisted of individual sleds or carts riding freely down chutes on top of specially constructed snow slopes with piles of sand at the bottom for braking were used as winter leisure activities These crude and temporarily built curiosities known as Russian Mountains were the beginning of the search for even more thrilling amusement park rides The Columbian Exposition of was a particularly fertile testing ground for amusement rides and included some that the public had never seen before such as the world s first Ferris wheel one of the most recognized products of the fair In the present day many rides of various types are set around a specific theme br Parks contains a mixture of attractions which can be divided into several categories br br br Flat rides br Flat rides are usually considered to be those that move their passengers in a plane generally parallel to the ground br There is a core set of flat rides which most amusement parks have including the Enterprise Tilt A Whirl Gravitron chairswing swinging inverter ship twister and top spin However there is constant innovation with new variations on ways to spin and throw passengers around appearing in an effort to keep attracting customers Manufactures such as Huss and Zamperla specialise in creating flat rides among other amusement attractions br br br Roller coasters br br Amusement parks often feature multiple roller coasters of primarily timber or steel construction Fundamentally a roller coaster ride is one in which a specialized railroad system with steep drops and sharp curves passengers sit and are restrained in cars usually with two or more cars joined to form a train Some roller coasters feature one or more inversions such as vertical loops which turn the riders upside down Over the years there have been many roller coaster manufacturers with a variety of types of roller coasters br Manufacturers today include br br Bolliger Mabillard br Gerstlauer br The Gravity Group br Great Coasters International br Intamin br Mack Rides br Maurer AG br Premier Rides br Rocky Mountain Construction br S S Sansei Technologies br Vekoma br Zamperla br Zierer br br br Railways br br Amusement park railways have had a long and varied history in American amusement parks as well as overseas Some of the earliest park trains were not really trains they were trolleys which brought park patrons to the parks on regular rail lines from the cities to the end of the rail lines where the parks were located As such some older parks such as Kennywood in Pennsylvania were referred to as trolley parks The earliest park trains that only operated on lines within the park s boundaries such as the one on the ridable miniature Zephyr Railroad in Dorney Park were mostly custom built A few parks trains such as the Disneyland Railroad Walt Disney World Railroad and Dollywood Express operate using locomotives that had working careers on common carrier railways Amusement park railways tend to be narrow gauge meaning the space between their rails is smaller than that of ft in mm standard gauge railroads Some specific narrow gauges that are common on amusement park railroads are ft mm gauge ft in mm gauge ft mm gauge and in mm gauge br Past and present manufacturers include br br Allan Herschell Company br Brookville Equipment Corporation br Cagney Brothers br Chance Rides br Crown Metal Products br Custom Fabricators br Custom Locomotives

Unlimited br Western Train Co br br br Water rides br br Amusement parks with water resources generally feature a few water rides such as the log flume bumper boats rapids and rowing boats Such rides are usually gentler and shorter than roller coasters and many are suitable for all ages Water rides are especially popular on hot days br br br Dark rides br br Overlapping with both train rides and water rides dark rides are enclosed attractions in which patrons travel in guided vehicles along a predetermined path through an array of illuminated scenes which may include lighting effects animation music and recorded dialogue and other special effects br br br Haunted houses br br A haunted house is an attraction that intends to scare its guests for its thrill factor It usually is overlapped with dark rides Most open in the Halloween season but some are year round Most include actors lighting darkness fog and animatronics br br br Ferris wheels br br Ferris wheels are the most common type of amusement ride at state fairs and county fairs in the US br br br Transport rides br Transport rides are used to take large numbers of guests from one area to another as an alternative to walking especially for parks that are large or separated into distant areas Transport rides include chairlifts monorails aerial trams and escalators br Ocean Park Hong Kong is well known for its kilometre mi cable car connecting the Lowland and Headland areas of the park and for having the world s second longest outdoor escalator in the Headland Both transportation links provide scenic views of the park s hilly surroundings and while originally intended for practicality rather than thrills or enjoyment have become significant park attractions in their own right br br br Food br There are food stands at amusement parks which serve a variety of food and beverages They offer snack items like cotton candy ice cream fried dough funnel cake candy apples or caramel apples and french fries Meal items may include pizza hamburgers hot dogs and chicken Beverages may include soda coffee tea and lemonade Junk food items like deep fried candy bars the deep fried Twinkie Dippin Dots ice cream
