The Wildlife Conservation Society WCS is a c non governmental organization headquartered at the Bronx Zoo in New York City that aims to conserve the world s largest wild places in priority regions Founded in as the New York Zoological Society NYZS the global conservation organization is now led by Interim President and CEO Robb Menzi as of April WCS manages four New York City wildlife parks in addition to the Bronx Zoo the Central Park Zoo New York Aquarium Prospect Park Zoo and Queens Zoo Together these parks receive million visitors per year All of the New York City facilities are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA br br br History br br br Founding br br The Wildlife Conservation Society was originally chartered by the state of New York on April Then known as the New York Zoological also reported as Zo logical Society the organization embraced a mandate to advance native wildlife conservation promote the study of zoology and create a first class zoological park that would be free to the public Its name was changed to the Wildlife Conservation Society in Andrew H Green was the first president of the society but was replaced by Levi P Morton after Green resigned due to declining health Henry Fairfield Osborn who was the curator of the American Museum of Natural History and the founder of the American Eugenics Society was Morton s successor Madison Grant popular eugenicist and author of The Passing of The Great Race acted as the society s secretary and the chairman of the executive committee William Temple Hornaday operated as the founding Director and General Curator of the park itself Together these leaders wrote hundreds of works promoting preservationist values Their writings and arguments were foundational for conservation but notably partially motivated by racial discrimination hyper masculinity and an association between protecting the nation s wildlife and the nation s white population br Other notable figures were also involved in the Society s creation including George Bird Grinnell founder of the Audubon Society and editor of Forest and Stream Magazine and members of the Boone and Crockett Club br The Bronx Zoo formerly the New York Zoological Park was designed along the lines of other cultural institutions in New York City such as the American Museum of Natural History The city provided the land for the new zoo and some funding for buildings and annual operating costs WCS raised most of the funds for construction and operations from private donors and selected the scientific and administrative personnel Hornaday s tenure was very significant for conservation but he encountered controversy after the exhibiting Ota Benga a Mbuti Congo pygmy man br br br Work br In the late nineteenth century William Temple Hornaday then director of the New York Zoological Park now the Bronx Zoo carried out a direct mail survey of wildlife conditions through the United States and publicized the decline of birds and mammals in the organization s annual reports He was a prolific writer who published The Extermination of the American Bison and Our Vanishing Wildlife It s Extermination and Preservation among many other texts Our Vanishing Wildlife in particular revealed an association between species extinction and the decline of the white race in America br In Hornaday also hired field researcher Andrew J Stone to survey the condition of wildlife in the territory of Alaska On the basis of these studies Hornaday led the campaign for new laws to protect the wildlife there and the United States as a whole In a small herd of American Bison were gathered in a acre meadow just off what is now the Pelham Parkway roadway Starting in Hornaday led a national campaign to reintroduce the almost extinct bison to government sponsored refuges Hornaday Theodore Roosevelt and others formed the American Bison Society in The Bronx Zoo sent bison to Wichita Reserve in and additional bison in later years The saving of this uniquely American symbol is one of the great success stories in the history of wildlife conservation Hornaday campaigned for wildlife protection throughout his thirty years as director of the Bronx Zoo Beginning in Hornaday featured Ota Benga a member of the Mbuti from the Congo in a zoo exhibit In July the Wildlife Conservation Society apologized br Madison Grant and Osborn worked together with John C Merriam another eugenics supporter in to form the Save The Redwoods League Together they succeeded in convincing legislators to preserve many redwoods by comparing the trees to a race in danger Local communities sometimes saw the attitudes of Grant Osborn and Hornaday as being elitist compared to those of poorer citizens and nonwhite citizens br William Beebe the first curator of birds at the Bronx Zoo began a program of field research soon after the Bronx Zoo opened His research on wild pheasants took him to Asia from to and resulted in a series of books on the birds Beebe s field work also resulted in the creation of the Society s Department of Tropical Research which Beebe directed from until his retirement in From to off of the coast of Bermuda Beebe conducted research in an undersea vessel called the bathysphere The vessel made thirty five dives in total taking him half a mile deep and along the ocean floor During the dives Beebe made observations on bioluminescent fish as well as identifying several new species This expedition was significant as it was the first time humans observed the bottom of the deep sea and its creatures in their natural habitat The bathysphere is currently displayed at the New York Aquarium br During the World War II era Henry Fairfield Osborn Jr was elected president of the NYZS and Laurance Rockefeller was elected as executive committee chairman A best selling writer on conservation and son of WCS founder Henry Fairfield Osborn Osborn embraced changes that represented new thinking within the organization Guests were allowed to bring their own cameras into the Bronx Zoo Beginning with the African Plains exhibit in animals were grouped by continents and ecosystems rather than genetic orders and families br After World War II under the leadership of Osborn the organization extended its programs in field biology and conservation In WCS helped found the Jackson Hole Wildlife Park which later became part of Grand Teton National Park in In the late s WCS began a series of wildlife surveys and projects in Kenya Tanganyika now Tanzania Uganda Ethiopia Sudan Burma and the Malay peninsula In it sponsored George Schaller s seminal study of mountain gorillas in Congo Following that expedition Schaller went on to become the world s preeminent field biologist studying wildlife throughout Africa Asia and South America Conservation activities continued to expand under the leadership of William G Conway who became director of the Bronx Zoo in and President of WCS in Active as a field biologist in Patagonia Conway promoted a new vision of zoos as conservation organizations which cooperated in breeding endangered species He also designed new types of zoo exhibits aimed at teaching visitors about habitats that support wildlife and encouraged the expansion of WCS s field programs br During the s and s the WCS took a leadership role in pioneering zoological exhibitions by seeking to recreate natural environments for the animals on display Under the leadership of WCS director William G Conway the Bronx Zoo opened its World of Darkness for nocturnal species in and its World of Birds for avian displays in Eventually New York City turned to WCS to renew and manage three city run facilities in Manhattan Brooklyn and Queens The redesigned Central Park Zoo opened in followed by the Queens Zoo in and the Prospect Park Zoo in From through Archie Carr III of WCS helped establish the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary in Belize a reserve for endangered jaguars br Today WCS is working in sixty nations around the world on more than five hundred projects designed to help protect both wildlife and the habitats in which they live The organization endeavors to work in fourteen priority regions that contain fifty percent of the world s biodiversity These projects range from the conservation of gorillas in Africa tigers in Asia and macaws in South America In recent years WCS has actively worked in conflict areas like Afghanistan South Sudan and Myanmar where agreements on wildlife resources have contributed to peace and stability More than million people visit WCS s wildlife parks in New York City each year br br br Digital projects br WCS has backed numerous digital projects including the Mannahatta Project Welikia Project and the Last of the Wild The Manhatta Project is an initiative on the historical ecology of the New York area in prior to colonization The project illustrates the fifty five different ecosystems that existed in the region through digital reconstructions The Last of the Wild is a dataset showing different areas relative Human Footprint overlaid onto a map of the world This data is used to map wild areas as well as natural resource distribution br br br International projects br br br Makira National Park br In in collaboration with the Madagascar Ministry of Environment and Forests the WCS launched a program to create the hectare Makira Forest Protected Area In WCS partnered with carbon reduction platform Cool Effect to allow users to fund ongoing carbon reduction projects directly supporting the Makira Natural Park br br br Melanesia Program br Directed by Stacy Jupiter the Wildlife Conservation Society s Melanesia Program focuses on conservation in the Melanesian region of Oceania The program works specifically in Fiji Papua New Guinea Solomon Islands and Vanuatu Melanesia contains a high amount of biodiversity and is home to the world s largest and most elevated tropical islands The program works both terrestrially and aquatically within the Bismarck Solomon Seas Ecoregion and the Bismarck Forest Corridor It strives to combine community involvement and conservation rooted in science to resolve issues such as habitat loss environmental degradation overexploitation and climate change br br br Facilities br br br See also br st Century
