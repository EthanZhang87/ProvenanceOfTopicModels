this name for Egypt is the Akkadian mi i ru mi ru related to mi ru mi irru mi aru meaning border or frontier The Neo Assyrian Empire used the derived term Mu ur br br br History br br br Prehistory and Ancient Egypt br br There is evidence of rock carvings along the Nile terraces and in desert oases In the th millennium BCE a culture of hunter gatherers and fishers was replaced by a grain grinding culture Climate changes or overgrazing around BCE began to desiccate the pastoral lands of Egypt forming the Sahara Early tribal peoples migrated to the Nile River where they developed a settled agricultural economy and more centralised society br By about BCE a Neolithic culture took root in the Nile Valley During the Neolithic era several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt The earliest known Lower Egyptian site Merimda predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years remaining culturally distinct but maintaining frequent contact through trade The earliest known evidence of Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions appeared during the predynastic period on Naqada III pottery vessels dated to about BCE br br A unified kingdom was founded c BCE by King Menes leading to a series of dynasties that ruled Egypt for the next three millennia Egyptian culture flourished during this long period and remained distinctively Egyptian in its religion arts language and customs The first two ruling dynasties of a unified Egypt set the stage for the Old Kingdom period c BCE which constructed many pyramids most notably the Third Dynasty pyramid of Djoser and the Fourth Dynasty Giza pyramids br The First Intermediate Period ushered in a time of political upheaval for about years Stronger Nile floods and stabilisation of government however brought back renewed prosperity for the country in the Middle Kingdom c BCE reaching a peak during the reign of Pharaoh Amenemhat III A second period of disunity heralded the arrival of the first foreign ruling dynasty in Egypt that of the Semitic Hyksos The Hyksos invaders took over much of Lower Egypt around BCE and founded a new capital at Avaris They were driven out by an Upper Egyptian force led by Ahmose I who founded the Eighteenth Dynasty and relocated the capital from Memphis to Thebes br The New Kingdom c BCE began with the Eighteenth Dynasty marking the rise of Egypt as an international power that expanded during its greatest extension to an empire as far south as Tombos in Nubia and included parts of the Levant in the east This period is noted for some of the most well known Pharaohs including Hatshepsut Thutmose III Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti Tutankhamun and Ramesses II The first historically attested expression of monotheism came during this period as Atenism Frequent contacts with other nations brought new ideas to the New Kingdom The country was later invaded and conquered by Libyans Nubians and Assyrians but native Egyptians eventually drove them out and regained control of their country br br In BCE the Achaemenid Empire led by Cambyses II began their conquest of Egypt eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the battle of Pelusium Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh but ruled Egypt from his home of Susa in Persia modern Iran leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy The entire Twenty seventh Dynasty of Egypt from to BCE save for Petubastis III was an entirely Achaemenid ruled period with the Achaemenid emperors all being granted the title of pharaoh A few temporarily successful revolts against the Achaemenids marked the fifth century BCE but Egypt was never able to permanently overthrow the Achaemenids br The Thirtieth Dynasty was the last native ruling dynasty during the Pharaonic epoch It fell to the Achaemenids again in BCE after the last native Pharaoh King Nectanebo II was defeated in battle This Thirty first Dynasty of Egypt however did not last long as the Achaemenids were toppled several decades later by Alexander the Great The Macedonian Greek general of Alexander Ptolemy I Soter founded the Ptolemaic dynasty br br br Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt br br The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a powerful Hellenistic state extending from southern Syria in the east to Cyrene to the west and south to the frontier with Nubia Alexandria became the capital city and a centre of Greek culture and trade To gain recognition by the native Egyptian populace they named themselves as the successors to the Pharaohs The later Ptolemies took on Egyptian traditions had themselves portrayed on public monuments in Egyptian style and dress and participated in Egyptian religious life br The last ruler from the Ptolemaic line was Cleopatra VII who committed suicide following the burial of her lover Mark Antony after Octavian had captured Alexandria and her mercenary forces had fled br The Ptolemies faced rebellions of native Egyptians and were involved in foreign and civil wars that led to the decline of the kingdom and its annexation by Rome br Christianity was brought to Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist in the st century Diocletian s reign CE marked the transition from the Roman to the Byzantine era in Egypt when a great number of Egyptian Christians were persecuted The New Testament had by then been translated into Egyptian After the Council of Chalcedon in CE a distinct Egyptian Coptic Church was firmly established br br br Middle Ages th century br br The Byzantines were able to regain control of the country after a brief Sasanid Persian invasion early in the th century amidst the Byzantine Sasanian War of during which they established a new short lived province for ten years known as Sasanian Egypt until when Egypt was invaded and br conquered by the Islamic caliphate by the Muslim Arabs When they defeated the Byzantine armies in Egypt the Arabs brought Islam to the country Some time during this period Egyptians began to blend in their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices leading to various Sufi orders that have flourished to this day These earlier rites had survived the period of Coptic Christianity br In an army were sent in Egypt by the second caliph Umar under the command of Amr ibn al As They defeated a Roman army at the battle of Heliopolis Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria which surrendered to him by a treaty signed on November Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in but was retaken by Amr in In an invasion fleet sent by Constans II was repulsed br br The Arabs founded the capital of Egypt called Fustat which was later burned down during the Crusades Cairo was later built in the year to grow to become the largest and richest city in the Arab caliphate second only to Baghdad br The Abbasid period was marked by new taxations and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule At the beginning of the th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir who decided to reside at Baghdad sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him In another Egyptian revolt broke out and in the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government Eventually the power loss of the Abbasids in Baghdad led for general upon general to take over rule of Egypt yet being under Abbasid allegiance the Tulunid dynasty and Ikhshidid dynasty were among the most successful to defy the Abbasid Caliph br Muslim rulers remained in control of Egypt for the next six centuries with Cairo as the seat of the Fatimid Caliphate With the end of the Ayyubid dynasty the Mamluks a Turco Circassian military caste took control about By the late th century Egypt linked the Red Sea India Malaya and East Indies The mid th century Black Death killed about of the country s population br br br Early modern period Ottoman Egypt br br Egypt was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in after which it became a province of the Ottoman Empire The defensive militarisation damaged its civil society and economic institutions The weakening of the economic system combined with the effects of plague left Egypt vulnerable to foreign invasion Portuguese traders took over their trade Between and Egypt experienced six famines The famine cost it roughly one sixth of its population Egypt was always a difficult province for the Ottoman Sultans to control due in part to the continuing power and influence of the Mamluks the Egyptian military caste who had ruled the country for centuries Egypt remained semi autonomous under the Mamluks until it was invaded by the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte in After the French were defeated by the British a three way power struggle ensued between the Ottoman Turks Egyptian Mamluks who had ruled Egypt for centuries and Albanian mercenaries in the service of the Ottomans br br After the French were expelled power was seized in by Muhammad Ali Pasha an Albanian military commander of the Ottoman army in Egypt Muhammad Ali massacred the Mamluks and established a dynasty that was to rule Egypt until the revolution of The introduction in of long staple cotton transformed its agriculture into a cash crop monoculture before the end of the century concentrating land ownership and shifting production towards international markets Muhammad Ali annexed Northern Sudan Syria and parts of Arabia and Anatolia but in the European powers fearful lest he topple the Ottoman Empire itself forced him to return most of his conquests to the Ottomans His military ambition required him to modernise the country he built industries a system of canals for irrigation and transport and reformed the civil service He constructed a military state with around four percent of the populace serving the army to raise Egypt to a powerful positioning in the Ottoman Empire in a way showing various similarities to the Soviet strategies without communism conducted in the th century br Muhammad Ali Pasha evolved the military from one that convened under the tradition of the corv e to a great modernised army He introduced conscription of the male peasantry in th century Egypt and took a novel approach to create his great army strengthening it with numbers and in skill Education and training of the new soldiers became mandatory the new concepts were furthermore enforced by isolation The men were held in barracks to avoid distraction of their growth as a military unit to be reckoned with The resentment for the military way of life eventually faded from the men and a new ideology took hold one of nationalism and pride It was with the help of this newly reborn martial unit that Muhammad Ali imposed his rule over Egypt The policy that Mohammad Ali Pasha followed during his reign explains partly why the numeracy in Egypt compared to other North African and Middle Eastern countries increased only at a remarkably small rate as investment in further education only took place in the military and industrial sector Muhammad Ali was succeeded briefly by his son Ibrahim in September then by a grandson Abbas I in November then by Said in and Isma il in who encouraged science and agriculture and banned slavery in Egypt br Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in The Suez Canal built in partnership with the French was completed in Its construction was financed by European banks Large sums also went to patronage and corruption New taxes caused popular discontent In Isma il avoided bankruptcy by selling all Egypt s shares in the canal to the British government Within three years this led to the imposition of British and French controllers who sat in the Egyptian cabinet and with the financial power of the bondholders behind them were the real power in the Government Other circumstances like epidemic diseases cattle disease in the s floods and wars drove the economic downturn and increased Egypt s dependency on foreign debt even further br br Local dissatisfaction with the Khedive and with European intrusion led to the formation of the first nationalist groupings in with Ahmed Urabi a prominent figure After increasing tensions and nationalist revolts the United Kingdom invaded Egypt in crushing the Egyptian army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir and militarily occupying the country Following this the Khedivate became a de facto British protectorate under nominal Ottoman sovereignty In the Anglo Egyptian Condominium Agreement was signed the Agreement stated that Sudan would be jointly governed by the Khedivate of Egypt and the United Kingdom However actual control of Sudan was in British hands only In the Denshawai incident prompted many neutral Egyptians to join the nationalist movement br br br Sultanate and Kingdom of Egypt br br In the Ottoman Empire entered World War I in alliance with the Central Empires Khedive Abbas II who had grown increasingly hostile to the British in preceding years decided to support the motherland in war Following such decision the British forcibly removed him from power and replaced him with his brother Hussein Kamel Hussein Kamel declared Egypt s independence from the Ottoman Empire assuming the title of Sultan of Egypt Shortly following independence Egypt was declared a protectorate of the United Kingdom br After World War I Saad Zaghlul and the Wafd Party led the Egyptian nationalist movement to a majority at the local Legislative Assembly When the British exiled Zaghlul and his associates to Malta on March the country arose in its first modern revolution The revolt led the UK government to issue a unilateral declaration of Egypt s independence on February Following independence from the United Kingdom Sultan Fuad I assumed the title of King of Egypt despite being nominally independent the Kingdom was still under British military occupation and the UK still had great influence over the state The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in based on a parliamentary system The nationalist Wafd Party won a landslide victory in the election and Saad Zaghloul was appointed as the new Prime Minister In the Anglo Egyptian Treaty was concluded and British troops withdrew from Egypt except for the Suez Canal The treaty did not resolve the question of Sudan which under the terms of the existing Anglo Egyptian Condominium Agreement of stated that Sudan should be jointly governed by Egypt and Britain but with real power remaining in British hands br Britain used Egypt as a base for Allied operations throughout the region especially the battles in North Africa against Italy and Germany Its highest priorities were control of the Eastern Mediterranean and especially keeping the Suez Canal open for merchant ships and for military connections with India and Australia When the war began in September Egypt declared martial law and broke off diplomatic relations with Germany It broke diplomatic relations with Italy in but never declared war even when the Italian army invaded Egypt The Egyptian army did no fighting In June the King dismissed Prime Minister Aly Maher who got on poorly with the British A new coalition Government was formed with the Independent Hassan Pasha Sabri as Prime Minister br Following a ministerial crisis in February the ambassador Sir Miles Lampson pressed Farouk to have a Wafd or Wafd coalition government replace Hussein Sirri Pasha s government On the night of February British troops and tanks surrounded Abdeen Palace in Cairo and Lampson presented Farouk with an ultimatum Farouk capitulated and Nahhas formed a government shortly thereafter br Most British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in although the British army maintained a military base in the area but nationalist anti British feelings continued to grow after the War Anti monarchy sentiments further increased following the disastrous performance of the Kingdom in the First Arab Israeli War The election saw a landslide victory of the nationalist Wafd Party and the King was forced to appoint Mostafa El Nahas as new Prime Minister In Egypt unilaterally withdrew from the Anglo Egyptian Treaty of and ordered all remaining British troops to leave the Suez Canal br As the British refused to leave their base around the Suez Canal the Egyptian government cut off the water and refused to allow food into the Suez Canal base announced a boycott of British goods forbade Egyptian workers from entering the base and sponsored guerrilla attacks On January Egyptian guerrillas staged a fierce attack on the British forces around the Suez Canal during which the Egyptian Auxiliary Police were observed helping the guerrillas In response on January General George Erskine sent out British tanks and infantry to surround the auxiliary police station in Ismailia The police commander called the Interior Minister Fouad Serageddin Nahas s right hand man to ask if he should surrender or fight Serageddin ordered the police to fight to the last man and the last bullet The resulting battle saw the police station levelled and Egyptian policemen killed together with British soldiers The Ismailia incident outraged Egypt The next day January was Black Saturday as the anti British riot was known that saw much of downtown Cairo which the Khedive Ismail the Magnificent had rebuilt in the style of Paris burned down Farouk blamed the Wafd for the Black Saturday riot and dismissed Nahas as prime minister the next day He was replaced by Aly Maher Pasha br On July the Free Officers Movement led by Muhammad Naguib and Gamal Abdel Nasser launched a coup d tat Egyptian Revolution of against the king Farouk I abdicated the throne to his son Fouad II who was at the time a seven month old baby The Royal Family left Egypt some days later and the Council of Regency led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was formed The council however held only nominal authority and the real power was actually in the hands of the Revolutionary Command Council led by Naguib and Nasser Popular expectations for immediate reforms led to the workers riots in Kafr Dawar on August Following a brief experiment with civilian rule the Free Officers abrogated the monarchy and the constitution and declared Egypt a republic on June Naguib was proclaimed as president while Nasser was appointed as the new Prime Minister br br br Republican Egypt under Nasser br br Following the Revolution by the Free Officers Movement the rule of Egypt passed to military hands and all political parties were banned On June the Egyptian Republic was declared with General Muhammad Naguib as the first President of the Republic serving in that capacity for a little under one and a half years Republic of Egypt was declared br Naguib was forced to resign in by Gamal Abdel Nasser a Pan Arabist and the real architect of the movement and was later put under house arrest After Naguib s resignation the position of President was vacant until the election of Nasser in In October Egypt and the United Kingdom agreed to abolish the Anglo Egyptian Condominium Agreement of and grant Sudan independence the agreement came into force on January Nasser assumed power as president in June and began dominating the history of modern Egypt British forces completed their withdrawal from the occupied Suez Canal Zone on June He nationalised the Suez Canal on July his hostile approach towards Israel and economic nationalism prompted the beginning of the Second Arab Israeli War Suez Crisis in which Israel with support from France and the United Kingdom occupied the Sinai peninsula and the Canal The war came to an end because of US and USSR diplomatic intervention and the status quo was restored br In Egypt and Syria formed a sovereign union known as the United Arab Republic The union was short lived ending in when Syria seceded thus ending the union During most of its existence the United Arab Republic was also in a loose confederation with North Yemen or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen known as the United Arab States In the early s Egypt became fully involved in the North Yemen Civil War Despite several military moves and peace conferences the war sank into a stalemate In mid May the Soviet Union issued warnings to Nasser of an impending Israeli attack on Syria Although the chief of staff Mohamed Fawzi verified them as baseless Nasser took three successive steps that made the war virtually inevitable on May he deployed his troops in Sinai near the border with Israel on May he expelled the UN peacekeepers stationed in the Sinai Peninsula border with Israel and on May he closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping On May Nasser declared The battle will be a general one and our basic objective will be to destroy Israel br This prompted the beginning of the Third Arab Israeli War Six Day War in which Israel attacked Egypt and occupied Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip which Egypt had occupied since the Arab Israeli War During the war an Emergency Law was enacted and remained in effect until with the exception of an month break in Under this law police powers were extended constitutional rights suspended and censorship legalised At the time of the fall of the Egyptian monarchy in the early s less than half a million Egyptians were considered upper class and rich four million middle class and million lower class and poor Fewer than half of all primary school age children attended school most of them being boys Nasser s policies changed this Land reform and distribution the dramatic growth in university education and government support to national industries greatly improved social mobility and flattened the social curve From academic year through overall public school enrolments more than doubled Millions of previously poor Egyptians through education and jobs in the public sector joined the middle class Doctors engineers teachers lawyers journalists constituted the bulk of the swelling middle class in Egypt under Nasser During the s the Egyptian economy went from sluggish to the verge of collapse the society became less free and Nasser s appeal waned considerably br br br Egypt under Sadat and Mubarak br br In President Nasser died and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat During his period Sadat switched Egypt s Cold War allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States expelling the Soviet advisors in Egypt was renamed as Arab Republic of Egypt in Sadat launched the Infitah economic reform policy while clamping down on religious and secular opposition In Egypt along with Syria launched the Fourth Arab Israeli War Yom Kippur War a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured years earlier In Sadat shifted Nasser s economic policies and sought to use his popularity to reduce government regulations and encourage foreign investment through his programme of Infitah Through this policy incentives such as reduced taxes and import tariffs attracted some investors but investments were mainly directed at low risk and profitable ventures like tourism and construction abandoning Egypt s infant industries Because of the elimination of subsidies on basic foodstuffs it led to the Egyptian Bread Riots Sadat made a historic visit to Israel in which led to the Egypt Israel peace treaty in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from Sinai In return Egypt recognised Israel as a legitimate sovereign state Sadat s initiative sparked enormous controversy in the Arab world and led to Egypt s expulsion from the Arab League but it was supported by most Egyptians Sadat was assassinated by an Islamic extremist in October br Hosni Mubarak came to power after the assassination of Sadat in a referendum in which he was the only candidate He became another leader to dominate the Egyptian history Hosni Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt s relationship with Israel yet eased the tensions with Egypt s Arab neighbours Domestically Mubarak faced serious problems Mass poverty and unemployment led rural families to stream into cities like Cairo where they ended up in crowded slums barely managing to survive On February the Security Police started rioting protesting against reports that their term of duty was to be extended from to years Hotels nightclubs restaurants and casinos were attacked in Cairo and there were riots in other cities A day time curfew was imposed It took the army days to restore order people

Gama a al Islamiyya engaged in an extended campaign of violence from the murders and attempted murders of prominent writers and intellectuals to the repeated targeting of tourists and foreigners Serious damage was done to the largest sector of Egypt s economy tourism and in turn to the government but it also devastated the livelihoods of many of the people on whom the group depended for support During Mubarak s reign the political scene was dominated by the National Democratic Party which was created by Sadat in It passed the Syndicates Law Press Law and Nongovernmental Associations Law which hampered freedoms of association and expression by imposing new regulations and draconian penalties on violations As a result by the late s parliamentary politics had become virtually irrelevant and alternative avenues for political expression were curtailed as well Cairo grew into a metropolitan area with a population of over million br On November people mostly tourists were massacred near Luxor In late February Mubarak announced a reform of the presidential election law paving the way for multi candidate polls for the first time since the movement However the new law placed restrictions on the candidates and led to Mubarak s easy re election victory Voter turnout was less than Election observers also alleged government interference in the election process After the election Mubarak imprisoned Ayman Nour the runner up br Human Rights Watch s report on Egypt detailed serious human rights violations under Mubarak s rule including routine torture arbitrary detentions and trials before military and state security courts In Amnesty International released a report alleging that Egypt had become an international centre for torture where other nations send suspects for interrogation often as part of the War on Terror Egypt s foreign ministry quickly issued a rebuttal to this report Constitutional changes voted on March prohibited parties from using religion as a basis for political activity allowed the drafting of a new anti terrorism law authorised broad police powers of arrest and surveillance and gave the president power to dissolve

Minister Hisham Qandil announced his member cabinet comprising newcomers including four from the Muslim Brotherhood Liberal and secular groups walked out of the constituent assembly because they believed that it would impose strict Islamic practices while Muslim Brotherhood backers threw their support behind Morsi On November President Morsi issued a temporary declaration immunising his decrees from challenge and seeking to protect the work of the constituent assembly br The move led to massive protests and violent action throughout Egypt On December tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of President Morsi clashed in what was described as the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country s revolution Mohamed Morsi offered a national dialogue with opposition leaders but refused to cancel the December constitutional referendum On July after a wave of public discontent with autocratic excesses of Morsi s Muslim Brotherhood government the

Egypt br Egypt has an unusually hot sunny and dry climate Average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer The cooler Mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast which helps to get more moderated temperatures especially at the height of the summertime The Khamaseen is a hot dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer It brings scorching sand and dust particles and usually brings daytime temperatures over C F and sometimes over C F in the interior while the relative humidity can drop to or even less br Prior to the construction of the Aswan Dam the Nile flooded annually replenishing Egypt s soil This gave Egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years br The potential rise in sea levels due to global warming could threaten Egypt s densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country s economy agriculture

species monera species plants species protozoans species For some major groups for example lichen forming fungi and nematode worms the number was not known Apart from small and well studied groups like amphibians birds fish mammals and reptiles the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt For the fungi including lichen forming species for example subsequent work has shown that over species have been recorded from Egypt and the final figure of all fungi actually occurring in the country is expected to be much higher For the grasses native and
