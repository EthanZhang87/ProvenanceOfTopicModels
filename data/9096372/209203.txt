id: 209203
This page gives a list of domesticated animals also including a list of animals which are or may be currently undergoing the process of domestication and animals that have an extensive relationship with humans beyond simple predation This includes species which are semi domesticated undomesticated but captive bred on a commercial scale or commonly wild caught at least occasionally captive bred and tameable In order to be considered fully domesticated most species have undergone significant genetic behavioural and morphological changes from their wild ancestors while others have changed very little from their wild ancestors despite hundreds or thousands of years of potential selective breeding A number of factors determine how quickly any changes may occur in a species but there is not always a desire to improve a species from its wild form Domestication is a gradual process so there is no precise moment in the history of a given species when it can be considered to have become fully domesticated br Zooarchaeology has identified three classes of animal domesticates br br Pets dogs cats ferrets hamsters etc br Livestock cattle sheep pigs goats etc br Beasts of burden horses camels donkeys etc br br br Domesticated animals br br br Tame partially domesticated and widely captive bred animals br Due to the somewhat unclear outlines of what precisely constitutes domestication there are some species that may or may not be fully domesticated There are also some species that are extensively commercially used by humans but are not significantly altered from wild type animals Many animals on this second table are at least somewhat altered from wild type animals due to their extensive interactions with humans albeit not to the point that they are regarded as distinct forms therefore no separate wild ancestors are noted or would be unable to survive if reintroduced to the wild br br br Taxonomical groupings br The categories used in the Taxon group column are br br a Artiodactyla except Bovidae b Bovidae c Carnivora d Rodentia e Other mammals br a Anseriformes b Galliformes c Columbiformes d Passeriformes e Psittaciformes f Palaeognathae g Other birds br a Serpentes b Lacertilia c Testudines d Other reptiles br a Anura b Other amphibians br a Cyprinidae b Other fish br a Hymenoptera b Other insects c Other arthropods br a Mollusca b Annelida c Other animals br br br See also br List of domesticated plants br List of domesticated fungi and microorganisms br br br
