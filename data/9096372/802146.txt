A rhinoceros from Ancient Greek rhin ker s nose horned from rhis nose and k ras horn pl rhinoceros or rhinoceroses commonly abbreviated to rhino is a member of any of the five extant species or numerous extinct species of odd toed ungulates in the family Rhinocerotidae it can also refer to a member of any of the extinct species of the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea Two of the extant species are native to Africa and three to South and Southeast Asia br Rhinoceroses are some of the largest remaining megafauna all weigh at least one tonne in adulthood They have a herbivorous diet small brains g oz for mammals of their size one or two horns and a thick cm in protective skin formed from layers of collagen positioned in a lattice structure They generally eat leafy material although their ability to ferment food in their hindgut allows them to subsist on more fibrous plant matter when necessary Unlike other perissodactyls the two African species of rhinoceros lack teeth at the front of their mouths they rely instead on their lips to pluck food br Rhinoceroses are killed by poachers for their horns which are bought and sold on the black market for high prices leading to most living rhinoceros species being considered endangered The contemporary market for rhino horn is overwhelmingly driven by China and Vietnam where it is bought by wealthy consumers to use in traditional Chinese medicine among other uses Rhino horns are made of keratin the same material as hair and fingernails and there is no good evidence of any health benefits A market also exists for rhino horn dagger handles in Yemen which was the major source of demand for rhino horn in the s and s br br br Taxonomy and naming br br The word rhinoceros is derived through Latin from the Ancient Greek which is composed of rhino of the nose and keras horn with a horn on the nose The name has been in use since the th century br The family Rhinocerotidae consists of only four extant genera Ceratotherium white rhinoceros Diceros black rhinoceros Dicerorhinus Sumatran rhinoceros and Rhinoceros Indian and Javan rhinoceros The living species fall into three categories The two African species the white rhinoceros and the black rhinoceros belong to the tribe Dicerotini which originated in the middle Miocene about million years ago The species diverged during the early Pliocene about million years ago The main difference between black and white rhinos is the shape of their mouths white rhinos have broad flat lips for grazing whereas black rhinos have long pointed lips for eating foliage There are two living Rhinocerotini species the Indian rhinoceros and the Javan rhinoceros which diverged from one another about million years ago The Sumatran rhinoceros is the only surviving representative of the Dicerorhinini br A subspecific hybrid white rhino Ceratotherium s simum C s cottoni was bred at the Dv r Kr lov Zoo Zoological Garden Dvur Kralove nad Labem in the Czech Republic in Interspecific hybridisation of black and white rhinoceroses has also been confirmed br While the black rhinoceros has chromosomes diploid number N per cell all other rhinoceros species have chromosomes Chromosomal polymorphism might lead to varying chromosome counts For instance in a study there were three northern white rhinoceroses with chromosomes br br br Species br br br White br br There are two subspecies of white rhinoceros the southern white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum simum and the northern white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum cottoni As of the southern subspecies has a wild population of making them the most abundant rhino subspecies in the world The northern subspecies is critically endangered with all that is known to remain being two captive females There is no conclusive explanation of the name white rhinoceros A popular idea that white is a distortion of either the Afrikaans word wyd or the Dutch word wijd or its other possible spellings whyde weit etc meaning wide and referring to the rhino s square lips is not supported by linguistic studies br The white rhino has an immense body and large head a short neck and broad chest Females weigh kg lb and males kg lb The head and body length is m ft and the shoulder height is m ft On its snout it has two horns The front horn is larger than the other horn and averages cm in in length and can reach cm in The white rhinoceros also has a prominent muscular hump that supports its relatively large head The colour of this animal can range from yellowish brown to slate grey Most of its body hair is found on the ear fringes and tail bristles with the rest distributed rather sparsely over the rest of the body White rhinos have the distinctive flat broad mouth that is used for grazing br br br Black br br The name black rhinoceros Diceros bicornis was chosen to distinguish this species from the white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum This can be confusing as the two species are not truly distinguishable by color There are four subspecies of black rhino South central Diceros bicornis minor the most numerous which once ranged from central Tanzania south through Zambia Zimbabwe and Mozambique to northern and eastern South Africa South western Diceros bicornis occidentalis which are better adapted to the arid and semi arid savannas of Namibia southern Angola western Botswana and western South Africa East African Diceros bicornis michaeli primarily in Tanzania and West African Diceros bicornis longipes which was declared extinct in November The native Tswanan name keitloa describes a South African variation of the black rhino in which the posterior horn is equal to or longer than the anterior horn br An adult black rhinoceros stands m in high at the shoulder and is m ft in length An adult weighs from to kg to lb exceptionally to kg lb with the females being smaller than the males Two horns on the skull are made of keratin with the larger front horn typically cm in long exceptionally up to cm in Sometimes a third smaller horn may develop The black rhino is much smaller than the white rhino and has a pointed mouth which it uses to grasp leaves and twigs when feeding br During the latter half of the th century their numbers were severely reduced from an estimated in the late s to a record low of in Since then numbers have been steadily increasing at a continental level with numbers doubling to by the end of As of the numbers are still lower than three generations ago br br br Indian br br The Indian rhinoceros or greater one horned rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis has a single horn to cm long It is nearly as large as the African white rhino Its thick silver brown skin folds into the shoulder back and rump giving it an armored appearance Its upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart like bumps and it has very little body hair Grown males are larger than females in the wild weighing from kg lb Shoulder height is m ft Females weigh about kg lb and are m ft long The record sized specimen was approximately kg lb br Indian rhinos once inhabited many areas ranging from Pakistan to Myanmar and maybe even parts of China Because of humans they now exist in only several protected areas of India in Assam West Bengal and a few pairs in Uttar Pradesh and Nepal plus a pair in Lal Suhanra National Park in Pakistan reintroduced there from Nepal They are confined to the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas Two thirds of the world s Indian rhinoceroses are now confined to the Kaziranga National Park situated in the Golaghat district of Assam India br br br Javan br br The Javan rhinoceros Rhinoceros sondaicus is one of the most endangered large mammals in the world According to estimates only about remain in Java Indonesia all in the wild It is also the least known rhino species Like the closely related and larger Indian rhinoceros the Javan rhino has a single horn Its hairless hazy gray skin falls into folds into the shoulder back and rump giving it an armored appearance Its length reaches m ft including the head and its height m ft in ft in Adults are variously reported to weigh kg lb or kg lb Male horns can reach cm in in length while in females they are knobs or altogether absent These animals prefer dense lowland rain forest tall grass and reed beds that are plentiful with large floodplains and mud wallows br Though once widespread throughout Asia by the s they were nearly hunted to extinction in Nepal India Burma Peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra for the supposed medical powers of their horns and blood As of only individuals remain in Ujung Kulon National Park Java Indonesia The last known Javan rhino in Vietnam was reportedly killed for its horn in by Vietnamese poachers Now only Java contains the last Javan rhinos br br br Sumatran br br The Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis is the smallest extant rhinoceros species as well as the one with the most hair It can be found at very high altitudes in Borneo and Sumatra Because of habitat loss and poaching their numbers have declined and it has become the second most threatened rhinoceros About Sumatran rhinos are believed to remain There are three subspecies of Sumatran rhinoceros the Sumatran rhinoceros proper Dicerorhinus sumatrensis sumatrensis the Bornean rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni and the possibly extinct Northern Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis lasiotis br A mature rhino typically stands about m ft in high at the shoulder has a length of m ft in ft in and weighs around kg lb though the largest individuals have been known to weigh as much as kilograms lb Like the African species it has two horns the larger is the front centimetres in with the smaller usually less than centimetres in long Males have much larger horns than the females Hair can range from dense the densest hair in young calves to sparse The color of these rhinos is reddish brown The body is short and has stubby legs The lip is prehensile br Sumatran rhinoceros once were spread across South east Asia but now are on the verge of extinction confined to several parts of Indonesia and Malaysia by reproductive isolation There were D sumatrensis in which by had dwindled to It has been found through DNA comparison that the Sumatran rhinoceros is the most ancient extant rhinoceros and related to the extinct Eurasian woolly rhino species Coelodonta In Alan Rabinowitz publicly denounced governments non governmental organizations and other institutions for lacking in their attempts to conserve the Sumatran rhinoceros To conserve it they would have to relocate them from small forests to breeding programs that could monitor their breeding success To boost reproduction the Malaysian and Indonesian governments could also agree to exchange the gametes of the Sumatran and smaller Bornean subspecies The Indonesian and Malaysian governments have also proposed a single management unit for these two ancient subspecies br Plantations for palm oil have taken out the living areas and led to the eradication of the rhino in Sumatra br br br Evolution br br Rhinocerotoids diverged from other perissodactyls by the early Eocene Fossils of Hyrachyus eximus found in North America date to this period This small hornless ancestor resembled a tapir or small horse more than a rhino Four families sometimes grouped together as the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea evolved in the late Eocene namely the Hyracodontidae Amynodontidae Paraceratheriidae and Rhinocerotidae br br br Hyracodontidae br br Hyracodontidae also known as running rhinos showed adaptations for speed and would have looked more like horses than modern rhinos The smallest hyracodontids were dog sized Hyracodontids spread across Eurasia from the mid Eocene to early Oligocene br br br Amynodontidae br br The Amynodontidae also known as aquatic rhinos dispersed across North America and Eurasia from the late Eocene to early Oligocene The amynodontids were hippopotamus like in their ecology and appearance inhabiting rivers and lakes and sharing many of the same adaptations to aquatic life as hippos br br br Paraceratheriidae br br The Paraceratheriidae also known as paraceratheres or indricotheres originated in the Eocene epoch and lived until the early Miocene The first paraceratheres were only about the size of large dogs growing progressively larger in the late Eocene and Oligocene The largest genus of the family was Paraceratherium which was more than twice as heavy as a bull African elephant and was one of the largest land mammals that ever lived br br br Rhinocerotidae br The family of all modern rhinoceroses the Rhinocerotidae first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia The earliest members of Rhinocerotidae were small and numerous at least genera lived in Eurasia and North America until a wave of extinctions in the middle Oligocene wiped out most of the smaller species Several independent lineages survived Menoceras a pig sized rhinoceros had two horns side by side The North American Teleoceras had short legs a barrel chest and lived until about five million years ago The last rhinos in the Americas became extinct during the Pliocene br Modern rhinos are thought to have begun dispersal from Asia during the Miocene Alongside the extant species four additional species of rhinoceros survived into the Last Glacial Period the woolly rhinoceros Coelodonta antiquitatis Elasmotherium sibiricum and two species of Stephanorhinus Merck s rhinoceros Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis and the Narrow nosed rhinoceros Stephanorhinus hemitoechus The woolly rhinoceros appeared in China around million years ago and first arrived in Europe around years ago It reappeared years ago alongside the woolly mammoth and became numerous Elasmotherium was two meters tall five meters long and weighed around five tons with a single enormous horn hypsodont teeth and long legs for running The latest known well dated bones of Elasmotheriumin found in the south of Western Siberia the area that is today Kazakhstan date as recently as years ago br The origin of the two living African rhinos can be traced to the late Miocene mya species Ceratotherium neumayri The lineages containing the living species diverged by the early Pliocene when Diceros praecox the likely ancestor of the black rhinoceros appears in the fossil record The black and white rhinoceros remain so closely related that they can still mate and successfully produce offspring br br Cladogram showing the

crocodiles African wild dogs and hyenas br Although rhinos are large and aggressive and have a reputation for being resilient they are very easily poached they visit water holes daily and can be easily killed while they drink As of December poaching increased globally while efforts to protect the rhino are considered increasingly ineffective The most serious estimate that only of poachers are successfully countered is reported of Zimbabwe while Nepal has largely avoided the crisis Poachers have become more sophisticated South African officials have called for urgent action against poaching after poachers killed the last female rhino in the Krugersdorp Game Reserve near Johannesburg Statistics from South African National Parks show that rhinoceroses were killed in South Africa in increasing to by over in and over killed in In some cases rhinos are tranquilized and their horns removed leaving them to bleed to death while in other instances more than the horn is taken br The Namibian government has supported the practice of rhino trophy hunting as a way to raise money for conservation Hunting licenses for five Namibian Black rhinos are auctioned annually with the money going to the government s Game Products Trust Fund Some conservationists and members of the public oppose or question this practice br br br Horn use br br Rhinoceros horns develop from subcutaneous tissues and are made of keratinous mineralized compartments The horns root in a germinative layer br Rhinoceros horns are used in traditional medicines in parts of Asia and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman Esmond Bradley Martin has reported on the trade for dagger handles in Yemen In Europe it was historically believed that rhino horns could purify water and could detect poisoned liquids and likely believed to be an aphrodisiac and an antidote to poison br It is a common misconception that rhinoceros horn in powdered form is used as an aphrodisiac or a cure for cancer in traditional Chinese medicine TCM as Cornu Rhinoceri Asiatici x ji o rhinoceros horn no TCM text in history has ever mentioned such prescriptions In TCM rhino horn is sometimes prescribed for fevers and convulsions a treatment not supported by evidence based medicine this treatment has been compared to consuming fingernail clippings in water In China signed the CITES treaty and removed rhinoceros horn from the Chinese medicine pharmacopeia administered by the Ministry of Health In the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine in the United Kingdom issued a formal statement condemning the use of rhinoceros horn A growing number of TCM educators are also speaking out against the practice although some TCM practitioners still believe that it is a life saving medicine br Vietnam reportedly has the biggest number of rhino horn consumers with their demand driving most of the poaching which has risen to record levels The Vietnam CITES Management Authority has claimed that Hanoi recently experienced a drop in the usage of rhino horn but National Geographic has challenged these claims noticing that there was no rise in the numbers of criminals who were apprehended or prosecuted South African rhino poaching s main destination market is Vietnam An average sized horn can bring in as much as a quarter of a million dollars in Vietnam and many rhino range states have stockpiles of rhino horn br br br Horn trade br International trade in rhinoceros horn has been declared illegal by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES since A proposal by Swaziland to lift the international ban was rejected in October Domestic sale of rhinoceros horn in South Africa home of of the remaining rhino population was banned as of The ban was overturned in a court case in and South Africa plans to draft regulations for the sale of rhino horn possibly including export for non commercial purposes The South African government has proposed that a legal trade of rhino horn be established arguing that this could reduce poaching and prevent the extinction of this species br br In March some researchers suggested that the only way to reduce poaching would be to establish a regulated trade based on humane and renewable harvesting from live rhinos The World Wildlife Fund opposes legalization of the horn trade as it may increase demand while IFAW released a report by EcoLarge suggesting that more thorough knowledge of economic factors is required to justify the pro trade option br br br Conservation br According to the World Wide Fund for Nature conservation of African rhinoceroses as consumers of large amounts of vegetation is crucial to maintaining the shape of the African landscape and the natural resources of local communities br br br Ways to prevent poaching br br br Horn removal br To prevent poaching in certain areas rhinos have been tranquillized and their horns removed Armed park rangers particularly in South Africa are also working on the front lines to combat poaching sometimes killing poachers who are caught in the act A spike in rhino killings increased concerns about the future of the species br br br Horn poisoning br In the Rhino Rescue Project began a horn trade control method consisting of infusing the horns of living rhinos with a mixture of a pink dye and an acaricide to kill ticks which is safe for rhinos but toxic to humans The procedure also includes inserting three RFID identification chips and taking DNA samples Because of the fibrous nature of rhino horn the pressurized dye infuses the interior of the horn but does not color the surface or affect rhino behavior Depending on the quantity of horn a person consumes experts believe the acaricide would cause nausea stomach ache and diarrhea and possibly convulsions It would not be fatal the primary deterrent is the knowledge that the treatment has been applied communicated by signs posted at the refuges The original idea grew out of research into the horn as a reservoir for one time tick treatments and experts selected an acaricide they think is safe for the rhino oxpeckers vultures and other animals in the preserve s ecosystem Proponents claim that the dye cannot be removed from the horns and remains visible on x ray scanners even when the horn is ground to a fine powder br The UK charity organization Save the Rhino has criticized horn poisoning on moral and practical grounds The organization questions the assumptions that the infusion technique works as intended and that even if the poison were effective whether middlemen in a lucrative illegal trade would care much about the effect it would have on buyers Additionally rhino horn is increasingly purchased for decorative use rather than for use in traditional medicine Save the Rhino questions the feasibility of applying the technique to all African rhinos since workers would have to reapply the acaricide every four years It was also reported that one out of rhinos treated did not survive the anesthesia br br br Artificial substitute for rhinoceros horn br Another way to undercut the rhinoceros horn market has been suggested by Matthew Markus of Pembient a biotechnology firm He proposes the synthesis of an artificial substitute for rhinoceros horn To enable authorities to distinguish the bioengineered horn from real rhinoceros horn the genetic code of the bioengineered horn could be registered similar to the DNA of living rhinoceros in the RhODIS Rhino DNA Index System Initial responses from many conservationists were negative but a report from TRAFFIC which monitors trade in wildlife and animal parts conceded that it would be rash to rule out the possibility that trade in synthetic rhinoceros horn could play a role in future conservation strategies br br br Historical representations br br Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides nd century BC mentions the rhinoceros in his book On the Erythraean Sea br In Khmer art the Hindu god Agni is depicted with a rhinoceros as his vahana Similarly in medieval era Thai literature Agni also called Phra Phloeng is sometimes described as riding a rhinoceros br Albrecht D rer created a famous woodcut of a rhinoceros in based on a written description and brief sketch by Valentim Fernandes a German printer resident in Lisbon He never saw the animal itself so D rer s Rhinoceros is a somewhat inaccurate depiction Rhinoceroses are depicted in the Chauvet Cave in France pictures dated to years ago br There are legends about rhinoceroses stamping out fire in Burma India and Malaysia The mythical rhinoceros has a special name in Malay badak api wherein badak means rhinoceros and api means fire The animal would come when a fire was lit in the forest and stamp it out There are no recent confirmations of this phenomenon This legend was depicted in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy which shows an African rhinoceros putting out two
