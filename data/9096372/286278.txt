title: Pygmy peoples
id: 286278
In anthropology pygmy peoples are ethnic groups whose average height is unusually short The term pygmyism is used to describe the phenotype of endemic short stature as opposed to disproportionate dwarfism occurring in isolated cases in a population for populations in which adult men are on average less than cm ft in tall br Although the term is considered derogatory it is primarily associated with the African Pygmies the hunter gatherers of the Congo Basin comprising the Bambenga Bambuti and Batwa br The terms Asiatic Pygmies and Oceanic pygmies have been used to describe the Negrito populations of Southeast Asia and Australo Melanesian peoples of short stature The Taron people of Myanmar are an exceptional case of a pygmy population of East Asian phenotype br br br Etymology br br The term pygmy as used to refer to diminutive people derives from Greek pygmaios via Latin Pygmaei sing Pygmaeus derived from meaning a short forearm cubit or a measure of length corresponding to the distance from the wrist to the elbow or knuckles See also Greek p khys In Greek mythology the word describes a tribe of dwarfs first described by Homer the ancient Greek poet and reputed to live in India and south of modern day Ethiopia br In French speaking Africa they are sometimes referred to as autochthon autochtone referring to native or indigenous Many prefer to be identified by their ethnicity such as the Aka Mbenga Baka Mbuti and Twa The term Bayaka the plural form of the Aka Yaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local pygmies Likewise the Kongo word Bambenga is used in Congo In parts of Africa they are called Wochua or Achua br br br Short stature br br Various theories have been proposed to explain the short stature of pygmies Some studies suggest that it could be related to adaptation to low ultraviolet light levels in rainforests This might mean that relatively little vitamin D can be made in human skin thereby limiting calcium uptake from the diet for bone growth and maintenance and leading to the evolution of the small skeletal size br Other explanations include lack of food in the rainforest environment low calcium levels in the soil the need to move through dense jungle adaptation to heat and humidity and as an association with rapid reproductive maturation under conditions of early mortality Other evidence points towards unusually low levels of expression of the genes encoding the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone compared to the related tribal groups associated with low serum levels of insulin like growth factor and short stature br br br Africa br br African Pygmies live in several ethnic groups in Rwanda Burundi Uganda Democratic Republic of the Congo Republic of the Congo ROC Central African Republic Cameroon Equatorial Guinea Gabon Angola Botswana Namibia Madagascar and Zambia There are at least a dozen pygmy groups sometimes unrelated to each other The best known are the Mbenga Aka and Baka of the western Congo basin who speak Bantu and Ubangian languages the Mbuti Efe etc of the Ituri Rainforest who speak Bantu and Central Sudanic languages and the Twa of the African Great Lakes who speak Bantu Rundi and Kiga Most pygmy communities are partially hunter gatherers living partially but not exclusively on the wild products of their environment They trade with neighbouring farmers to acquire cultivated foods and other material items no group lives deep in the forest without access to agricultural products It is estimated that there are between and Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest However although Pygmies are thought of as forest people the groups called Twa may live in open swamp or desert br br br Origins br Expansion to Central Africa by the ancestors of African Pygmies most likely took place before years ago and certainly before years ago A commonly held belief is that African Pygmies are the direct descendants of Late Stone Age hunter gatherer peoples of the central African rainforest who were partially absorbed or displaced by later immigration of agricultural peoples and adopted their Central Sudanic Ubangian and Bantu languages This view has no archaeological support and ambiguous support from genetics and linguistics br Some of Aka language is not Bantu and a similar percentage of Baka language is not Ubangian Much of pygmy vocabulary is botanical dealing with honey collecting or is otherwise specialized for the forest and is shared between the two western pygmy groups It has been proposed that this is the remnant of an independent western pygmy Mbenga or Baaka language However this type of vocabulary is subject to widespread borrowing among the Pygmies and neighboring peoples and the Baaka language was only reconstructed to the th century br African Pygmy populations are genetically diverse and extremely divergent from all other human populations suggesting they have an ancient indigenous lineage Their uniparental markers represent the second most ancient divergence after those typically found in Khoisan peoples Recent advances in genetics shed some light on the origins of the various Pygmy groups Researchers found an early divergence of the ancestors of Pygmy hunter gatherers and farming populations years ago followed by a split of the Pygmies ancestors into the Western and Eastern pygmy groups years ago br New evidence suggests East and West African Pygmy children have different growth patterns The difference between the two groups may indicate the Pygmies short stature did not start with their common ancestor but instead evolved independently in adapting to similar environments which adds support that some sets of genes related to height were advantageous in Eastern Pygmy populations but not in Western Pygmy populations br However Roger Blench argues that the Pygmies are not descended from residual hunter gatherer groups but rather are offshoots of larger neighboring ethnolinguistic groups that had adopted forest subsistence strategies Blench notes the lack of clear linguistic and archaeological evidence for the antiquity of pygmy cultures and peoples and also notes that the genetic evidence can be problematic Blench also notes that there is no evidence of the Pygmies have hunting technology distinctive from that of their neighbors and argues that the short stature of pygmy populations can arise relatively quickly in less than a few millennia due to strong selection pressures br br br Culture br br The African Pygmies are particularly known for their usually vocal music usually characterised by dense contrapuntal communal improvisation Simha Arom says that the level of polyphonic complexity of pygmy music was reached in Europe in the th century yet Pygmy culture is unwritten and ancient Music permeates daily life and there are songs for entertainment as well as specific events and activities br br br Violence against Pygmies br br br Reported genocides br br The pygmy population was a target of the Interahamwe during the Rwandan genocide Of the Pygmies in Rwanda an estimated were killed and another were displaced They have been described as forgotten victims of the genocide br From the end of through January around Pygmy civilians and combatants were killed and often cannibalized in an extermination campaign known as Effacer le tableau during the Second Congo War Human rights activists have made demands for the massacre to be recognized as genocide br br br Forced removal br br In a strategy referred to as fortress conservation in national parks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo such as Kahuzi Bi ga National Park Messok Dja protected area in the Republic of the Congo and Cameroon s Lob k National Park heavily armed park rangers come into deadly conflict with the Pygmy inhabitants who often cut the trees down to sell charcoal The conservation efforts of national parks in the country are often financed by international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund and often involve removing native inhabitants off the land Some have argued that the most efficient conservation methods involve giving land rights to the land s indigenous inhabitants br br br Reported slavery br In the Republic of the Congo where Pygmies make up of the population many Pygmies live as slaves to Bantu masters The nation is deeply stratified between these two major ethnic groups The Pygmy slaves belong to their Bantu masters from birth in a relationship that the Bantus call a time honored tradition A news report stated that even though Pygmies are responsible for much of the hunting fishing and manual labor in jungle villages Pygmies and Bantus alike say that Pygmies are often paid at the master s whim in cigarettes used clothing or even nothing at all As a result of pressure from UNICEF and human rights activists in a law that would grant special protections to the Pygmy people was awaiting a vote by the Congo parliament According to reports made in this law was never passed br In the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Ituri conflict Ugandan backed rebel groups were accused by the UN of enslaving Mbutis to prospect for minerals and forage for forest food with those returning empty handed being killed and eaten br br br Ethnic conflict br br In Northern Katanga Province starting in the Pygmy Batwa people whom the Luba people often exploit and allegedly enslave rose up into militias such as the Perci militia and attacked Luba villages A Luba militia known as Elements counterattacked More than a thousand people were killed in the first eight months of alone with the number of displaced people estimated to be as of December The weapons used in the conflict are often arrows and axes rather than guns br br br Discrimination br br Historically the pygmy have always been viewed as inferior by both colonial authorities and the village dwelling Bantu tribes Pygmy children were sometimes captured during the period of the Congo Free State which exported Pygmy children to zoos throughout Europe including the world s fair in the United States in Pygmies are often evicted from their land and given the lowest paying jobs At a state level Pygmies are sometimes not considered citizens and are refused identity cards deeds to land health care and proper schooling The Lancet published a review showing that Pygmy populations often had worse access to health care than neighboring communities br br br Asia and Pacific br br br Southeast Asia br br Negritos in Southeast Asia including the Batak and Aeta of the Philippines the Andamanese of the Andaman Islands and the Semang of the Malay Peninsula are sometimes called pygmies especially in older literature Negritos share some common physical features with African pygmy populations including short stature and dark skin The name Negrito from the Spanish adjective meaning small black person was given by early explorers The explorers who named the Negritos assumed the Andamanese they encountered were from Africa This belief was however discarded by anthropologists who noted that apart from dark skin peppercorn hair and steatopygia the Andamanese had little in common with any African population including the African pygmies Their superficial resemblance to some Africans and Melanesians is thought to be from living in a similar environment or simply retentions of the initial human form br Their origin and the route of their migration to Asia is a matter of great speculation They are genetically distant from Africans and have been shown to have separated early from Asians suggesting that they are either surviving descendants of settlers from the early out of Africa migration of the Great Coastal Migration of the Proto Australoids or that they are descendants of one of the founder populations of modern humans br Frank Kingdon Ward in the early th century reported a tribe of pygmy Tibeto Burman speakers known as the Taron inhabiting the remote region of Mt Hkakabo Razi in Southeast Asia on the border of China Yunnan and Tibet Burma and India A Burmese survey done in the s reported a mean height of an adult male Taron at m and that of females at m These are the only known pygmies of clearly East Asian descent br The cause of their diminutive size is unknown but diet and endogamous marriage practices have been cited The population of Taron pygmies has been steadily shrinking and is now down to only a few individuals In a link between the Taron and the Derung people in Yunnan China was uncovered by Richard D Fisher which may indicate the presence of pygmy populations among the Derung tribe br br br Disputed pygmy presence in Australia br Australian anthropologist Norman Tindale and American anthropologist Joseph Birdsell suggested there were Negrito like tribes of short statured Aboriginal peoples living on the coastal and rainforest areas around Cairns on the lands of the Mbabaram people and Djabugay people Birdsell found that the average adult male height of Aboriginal people in this region was significantly less than that of other Aboriginal Australian groups however it was still greater than the maximum height for classification as a pygmy people so the term pygmy may be considered a misnomer He called this short statured group Barrineans after Lake Barrine br br Birdsell classified Aboriginal Australians into three major groups mixed together to varying degrees the Carpentarians best represented in Arnhem Land the Murrayans centred in southeastern Australia and the Barrineans He argued that people related to Oceanic Negritos were the first arrivals and had been absorbed or replaced over time by later incoming peoples the present day Barrineans retained the greatest proportion of ancestry from this original Negrito group b ut this is not to say that the Barrineans are Negritos the Negritic component is clearly subordinate and the preponderant element is Murrayian This trihybrid model is generally considered defunct today craniometric genetic and linguistic evidence does not support a separate origin of Barrinean or other Aboriginal groups and physical differences between Aboriginal groups can be explained by adaptation to differing environments br In the purported existence of short statured people in Queensland was brought into the public eye by Keith Windschuttle and Tim Gillin in an article published by the right wing Quadrant magazine edited by Windschuttle himself The authors argued that these people were evidence for a distinct Negrito population in support of Birdsell s theory and claimed that the fact that the Australian pygmies have been so thoroughly expunged from public memory suggests an indecent concurrence between scholarly and political interests because evidence of descent from earlier or later waves of origin could lead to conflicting claims of priority by Aboriginal people and hence pose a threat to political co operation among them This and other publications promoting the trihybrid model drew several responses which went over the current scientific evidence against the theory and suggested that attempts to revive the theory were motivated by an agenda of undermining Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander claims to native title br Some Aboriginal oral histories and oral traditions from Queensland tell of little red men In a member of the Jinibara the Dalla people tribe of SE Queensland Gaiarbau who was born in and had lived for many years traditionally with his tribe said that he knew of the existence of these little people the Dinderi also known as Dimbilum Danagalalangur and Kandju Gaiarbau claims he saw members of a tribe of small people and said they were like dwarfs and not any of them stood five feet m The Dinderi are also recorded in other stories such as one concerning a platypus myth and another The Dinderi and Gujum The Legend of the Stones of the Mary River br Susan McIntyre Tamwoy archaeologist and Adjunct Professor at James Cook University has written of the northern Cape York Aboriginal people s belief of the bipotaim which is when the landscape as we know it today was created Bipotaim was formed before people although not perhaps before the short people or the red devils as these were also here before people She writes many ethnographers recorded stories of short people or what they referred to as pygmy tribes such as Lindsey Page Winterbotham She used information collected both through oral accounts including those of Injinoo people observation and archival research McIntyre Tamwoy recounts a bipotaim story We are the short people pygmies Red devils occupy parts of the adjacent stony coast but our home is here in the sand dunes and forest Before the Marakai white people came to our land the people were plentiful and they roamed the land They understood the land and called out in the language of the country to seek permission as they should br According to Nathan Sentance a librarian from the indigenous Wiradjuri nation employed by the Australian National Museum there is no known archaeological or biological evidence such a people existed Sentance claims it is a myth used to justify the colonisation of Australia as well as other countries by Europeans br br br Micronesia and Melanesia br Norman Gabel mentions that rumours exist of pygmy people in the interior mountains of Viti Levu in Fiji but explains he had no evidence of their existence as of br E W Gifford reiterated Gabel s statement in and claims that tribes of pygmies in the closest proximity to Fiji would most likely be found in Vanuatu br In the remains of at least miniature humans who lived between and years ago were found on the islands of Palau in Micronesia br During the s when Vanuatu was known as New Hebrides sizable pygmy tribes were first reported throughout northeastern Santo It is likely that they are not limited to this region of New Hebrides Nonetheless there is no anthropological evidence linking pygmies to other islands of Vanuatu br br br Archaic humans br The extinct archaic human species Homo luzonensis has been classified as a pygmy group The remains used to identify Homo luzonensis were discovered in Luzon the Philippines in and were designated as a species in Homo floresiensis another archaic human from the island of Flores in Indonesia stood around m ft in tall The pygmy phenotype evolved as a result of island syndrome which amongst other things results in reduced body size in insular humans br br br See also br Koro pok
