Tampa Bay area and the county seat of Hillsborough County With an estimated population of in Tampa is the th most populous city in the country and the third most populous city in Florida after Jacksonville and Miami br Tampa was founded as a military center during the th century with the establishment of Fort Brooke The cigar industry was also brought to the city by Vincente Martinez Ybor after whom Ybor City is named Tampa was reincorporated as a city in following the Civil War Tampa s economy is driven by tourism health care finance insurance technology construction and the maritime

behind Dallas Fort Worth Houston Washington D C Atlanta and Miami The Greater Tampa Bay area has over million residents and generally includes the Tampa and Sarasota metro areas br br br Etymology br When the pioneer community living near the U S Army outpost of Fort Brooke was incorporated in it was called Tampa Town and the name was shortened to simply Tampa in The earliest instance of the name Tampa in the form Tanpa appears in the memoirs of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda who spent years as a captive of the Calusa and traveled through much of peninsular Florida He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain possibly under another chief Archaeologist Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by barrier islands and their locations and the names applied to them were a source of confusion to explorers surveyors and map makers from the th century through the th century Bah a Tampa and Bah a de Esp ritu Santo were each used at one time or another for the modern Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor Tampa Bay was labeled Bah a de Esp ritu Santo Bay of the Holy Spirit in the earliest Spanish maps of Florida but became known as B Tampa Bah a Tampa or Tampa Bay as early as B Tampa corresponding to Tampa Bay appeared for the first time on a printed map in Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas s Description del Destricto del Audiencia de la Espanola from his book Descripcion de las Indias Ocidentales printed in Madrid in br A British map of also shows B Tampa with Carlos Bay for Charlotte Harbor to the south while a British map had B del Spirito Santo for Tampa Bay and again Carlos Bay to the south A Spanish map of renamed Tampa Bay as San Fernando As late as Bernard Romans called Tampa Bay Bay of Espiritu Santo with Tampa Bay restricted to the Northwest arm what is now Old Tampa Bay and the northeast arm named Hillsborough Bay The name may have come from the Calusa language or possibly the Timucua language Some scholars have compared Tampa to itimpi which means close to or nearby in the Creek language but its meaning is not known br People from Tampa are generally known as Tampans Tampanians or Tampe os Local authorities consulted by Michael Kruse of the Tampa Bay Times suggest that Tampan was historically more common while Tampanian became popular when the former term came to be seen as a potential insult A mix of Cuban Italian and Spanish immigrants began arriving in the late s to found and work in the new communities of Ybor City and West Tampa By about these newcomers came to be known as Tampe os or Tampe as for females a term that is still sometimes used to refer to their descendants living in the area and potentially to all residents of Tampa regardless of their ethnic background br br br History br br br Indigenous peoples and European exploration br br The shores of Tampa Bay have been inhabited for thousands of years A variant of the Weeden Island culture developed in the area by about years ago with archeological evidence suggesting that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline and there is little evidence of farming At the time of European contact in the early th century several chiefdoms of the Safety Harbor culture dominated the area br Early Spanish explorers interacted most extensively with the Tocobaga whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today s Safety Harbor in Pinellas County While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga and the Calusa who lived to the south there is less surviving documentation describing the Pohoy who lived near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today s downtown Tampa However evidence suggests that the language and culture of the Pohoy and other lesser known groups around the bay were very similar to that of the Tocobaga br Expeditions led by P nfilo de Narv ez and Hernando de Soto landed near Tampa but neither conquistador stayed long There is no natural gold or silver in Florida and the native inhabitants repulsed Spanish attempts to establish a permanent settlement or convert them to Catholicism The fighting resulted in a few deaths but the many more deaths were caused by infectious diseases brought from Europe which devastated the population of Native Americans across Florida and the entire Western Hemisphere The indigenous cultures of the Tampa Bay area had collapsed by around leaving the west coast of Spanish Florida largely depopulated and ignored for more than years br In the mid th century events in the American colonies and the early United States drove the Seminole people into northern Florida but they did not move into central Florida until after the United States gained control of Florida in br Before the American period the Tampa Bay area had a handful of residents Cuban and Native American fishermen who established small seasonal camps called ranchos on the shores of Tampa Bay The largest was at the mouth of Spanishtown Creek in today s Hyde Park neighborhood along Bayshore Boulevard br br br U S control br br After purchasing Florida from Spain in the United States built forts and trading posts in the new territory Fort Brooke was established in January at the mouth of the Hillsborough River on Tampa Bay in Downtown Tampa br Tampa was initially an isolated frontier outpost The sparse civilian population practically abandoned the area during the Second Seminole War from to after which the Seminoles were forced out and many settlers returned br Florida became the th state on March On January Tampa was officially incorporated as the Village of Tampa It was home to civilians or total residents including military personnel in Tampa was reincorporated as a town on December br br br Civil War and Reconstruction br br During the Civil War Florida seceded along with most of the southern states to form the Confederate States of America and Fort Brooke was defended by Confederate troops Martial law was declared in Tampa in January and Tampa s city government ceased to operate for the duration of the war br In the Union Navy set up a blockade around many southern ports to cut off the Confederacy Several US Navy ships were stationed near the mouth of Tampa Bay but small blockade running ships were often able to slip by the blockade to deliver cattle to Spanish Cuba earning gold for the Confederate cause On June the gunboat USS Sagamore sailed into Tampa Bay and opened fire on Fort Brooke which returned fire The Sagamore withdrew after a few hours and the Battle of Tampa caused little damage During the Battle of Fort Brooke on October and the Battle of Ballast Point on October Union forces inflicted serious damage to the city s economy when under the cover of another bombardment of the fort troops landed and destroyed two blockade running ships that had been hidden upstream along the Hillsborough River br In May Union troops landed again and took Fort Brooke largely unopposed They destroyed much of the fort s facilities and confiscated the remaining military supplies other than the canons which they tossed into the Hillsborough River then left the desolate town after two days br The Civil War ended in April with a Confederate defeat In May federal troops arrived in Tampa to occupy the fort and the town as part of Reconstruction They remained until August br During the immediate post war period Tampa was a poor isolated fishing village with about residents and little industry Yellow fever borne by mosquitoes from nearby swamps broke out several times during the s and s causing more residents to leave In residents voted to abolish the city of Tampa government br The population of Tampa Town was about by and dropped to about by Fort Brooke was decommissioned in further impacting the local economy in the short run but opening up the waterfront for development Except for two cannons displayed on the University of Tampa campus all traces of the fort are gone br br br s economic prosperity br br In the mid s Tampa s fortunes took several sudden turns for the better First phosphate was discovered in the Bone Valley region southeast of Tampa in The mineral vital for the production of fertilizers and other products was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter br The discovery of phosphate the arrival of Plant s railroad and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa all in the mid s were crucial to Tampa s development The once struggling village of Tampa became a bustling boomtown almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by br br br Plant s railroad br Henry B Plant s narrow gauge South Florida Railroad reached Tampa and its port in late finally connecting the small town to the nation s railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders Previously Tampa s overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside Plant s railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area Phosphate and commercial fishing exports could be sent north by rail and many new products were brought into the Tampa market along with the first tourists br br br Ybor s cigars br br The new railroad link enabled another important industry to come to Tampa In the Tampa Board of Trade enticed Vicente Martinez Ybor to move his cigar manufacturing operations to Tampa from Key West Proximity to Cuba made importation of clear Havana tobacco easy by sea and Plant s railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land br Since Tampa was still a small town at the time population less than Ybor built hundreds of small houses around his factory to accommodate the immediate influx of mainly Cuban and Spanish cigar workers Ybor City s factories rolled their first cigars in and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years Many Italian and a few Eastern European Jewish immigrants arrived starting in the late s opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers By over immigrants had moved to the neighborhood Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built West Tampa another cigar centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane Between them two Latin communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa s population economic base and tax revenues as Tampa became the Cigar Capital of the World br br br Early th century br During the first few decades of the th century the cigar making industry was the backbone of Tampa s economy The factories in Ybor City and West Tampa made an enormous number of cigars in the peak year of over million cigars were hand rolled in the city br In a civic association of local businessmen dubbed themselves Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla named after local mythical pirate Jos Gaspar and staged an invasion of the city followed by a parade With a few exceptions the Gasparilla Pirate Festival has been held every year since br br br Bolita and organized crime br br Beginning in the late th century illegal bolita lotteries were very popular among the Tampa working classes especially in Ybor City In the early s this small time operation was taken over by Charlie Wall the rebellious son of a prominent Tampa family and went big time Bolita was able to openly thrive only because of kick backs and bribes to key local politicians and law enforcement officials and many were on the take br Profits from the bolita lotteries and Prohibition era bootlegging led to the development of several organized crime factions in the city Charlie Wall was the first major boss but various power struggles culminated in consolidation of control by Sicilian mafioso Santo Trafficante Sr and his faction in the s After his death in from cancer control passed to his son Santo Trafficante Jr who established alliances with families in New York City and extended his power throughout Florida and into Batista era Cuba br The era of rampant and open corruption ended in the s when Estes Kefauver s traveling organized crime hearings came to town and were followed by the sensational misconduct trials of several local officials Although many of the worst offenders in government and the mob were not charged the trials helped to end the sense of lawlessness which had prevailed in Tampa for decades br br br Mid to late th century br br Tampa grew considerably as a result of World War II Prior to the United States involvement in the conflict construction began on MacDill Field which served as a main base for Army Air Corps and later Army Air Forces operations just before and during World War II with multiple auxiliary airfields around the Tampa Bay area and surrounding counties At the end of the war MacDill remained as an active military installation while the auxiliary fields reverted to civilian control Two of these auxiliary fields would later become the present day Tampa International Airport and St Pete Clearwater International Airport With the establishment of an independent U S Air Force in MacDill Field became MacDill Air Force Base br During the s and s Tampa saw record setting population growth that has not been seen since This growth spurred expansion of the city s highways and bridges bringing thousands into the city and creating opportunities for Tampa business owners who welcomed the influx of tourists and new residents It was during this time period in the city s history that two of the most popular tourist attractions in the area were developed Busch Gardens and Lowry Park Many of the well known institutions that play an important role in the economic development of the city were established during this time period br The University of South Florida was established in North Tampa in and opened for students in September The school spurred the construction of several residential and commercial developments in the previously agriculture dominated area around the new campus Overall Tampa continued to expand away from the city center during the s as new hospitals schools churches and subdivisions all began appearing to accommodate the growth Many business offices began moving away from the traditional downtown office building into more convenient neighborhood office plazas br In the U S Census Bureau reported city s population as white and black br Four attempts have been made to consolidate the municipal government of the city of Tampa with the county government of Hillsborough County and all of which failed at the ballot box the greatest loss was the most recent attempt in with the final tally being in favor and against the proposed charter br The biggest recent growth in the city was the development of New Tampa which started in when the city annexed a mostly rural area of sq mi km between I and I br East Tampa historically a mostly black community was the scene of several race riots during and for some time after the period of racial segregation mainly due to problems between residents and the Tampa Police Department br br br Geography br br br Topography br According to the United States Census Bureau the city has a total area of sq mi km including sq mi km of land and sq mi km of water The highest point in the city is only ft m above sea level Tampa is bordered by two bodies of water Old Tampa Bay and

be grown although some specimens do grow in northern Tampa Recently certain palm tree species in the area along with the rest of the state have been and continue to be severely affected by a plant

Tropical storms br Though threatened by tropical systems almost every hurricane season which runs from June to November Tampa seldom feels major effects from tropical storms or hurricanes No hurricane has made landfall in the immediate Tampa Bay area since the category Tampa Bay hurricane made landfall near Tarpon Springs and caused extensive damage throughout the region br Over the past few decades four major hurricanes were forecast to hit the Tampa Bay area from the south southwest which is a worse case track that would result in a maximum storm surge event Hurricane Donna Hurricane Charley Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Ian However all of these storms veered to the east or northeast before reaching Tampa Bay and instead made landfall down the coast resulting in serious damage in southwest Florida Irma had the greatest effect on Tampa It made landfall near Marco Island on September and moved due north passing through eastern Hillsborough County as a Category storm and causing widespread issues in the area particularly disrupting the electrical grid for several days br Because of tremendous population growth and coastal development in the century since the last hurricane landfall combined with rising sea levels due to climate change the Tampa Bay Area is considered one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to a direct hit from a major storm br br br Seasonal trends br br br Summer br Summertime weather patterns predominate from late May through early October which is the region s rainy season Daily weather is very consistent during this period with daytime highs usually reaching the average high of about F C lows usually in the mid to upper s F C high humidity and a regular chance of rain especially in the afternoon Mainly due to the proximity of large bodies of water the official high temperature has never hit F C the all time record high temperature is F C first recorded on June and tied on June Afternoon thunderstorms are regularly generated by the interaction of the Gulf and Atlantic sea breezes and are such a regular occurrence during the summer that the Tampa Bay area and nearby inland areas of Central Florida are recognized
