Sentiocentrism sentio centrism or sentientism is an ethical view that places sentient individuals at the center of moral concern Both humans and other sentient individuals have rights and or interests that must be considered br Sentiocentrists consider discrimination between sentient beings of different species to be speciesism an arbitrary discrimination Coherent sentiocentrist belief respects all sentient beings Many self described humanists see themselves as sentientists where the term humanism contrasts with theism and does not describe the sole focus of humanist concerns Sentiocentrism stands in opposition to the philosophy of anthropocentrism br br br History br br The th century utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham was among the first to argue for sentiocentrism He maintained that any individual who is capable of subjective experience should be considered a moral subject Members of species who are able to experience pleasure and pain are thus included in the category In his Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation Bentham made a comparison between slavery and sadism toward humans and non human animals The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason why a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor see Louis XIV s Code Noir What else is it that should trace the insuperable line Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old But suppose the case were otherwise what would it avail The question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer br The late th and early th century American philosopher J Howard Moore in Better World Philosophy described every sentient being as existing in a constant state of struggle He argued that what aids them in their struggle can be called good and what opposes them can be called bad Moore believed that only sentient beings can make such moral judgements because they are the only parts of the universe which can experience pleasure and suffering As a result he argued that sentience and ethics are inseparable and therefore every sentient piece of the universe has an intrinsic ethical relationship to every other sentient part but not the insentient parts Moore used the term zoocentricism to describe the belief that universal consideration and care should be given to all sentient beings he believed that this was too difficult for humans to comprehend in their current stage of development br Other prominent philosophers discussing or defending sentiocentrism include Peter Singer Tom Regan and Mary Anne Warren br Sentiocentrism is a term contained in the Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare edited by Marc Bekoff and Carron A Meaney br br br Concept br Sentiocentrism believes that sentience is the necessary and sufficient condition in order to belong to the moral community Other organisms therefore aside from humans are morally important in their own right According to the concept there are organisms that have some subjective experience which include self awareness rationality as well as the capacity to experience pain and suffering br There are sources that consider sentiocentrism as a modification of traditional ethic which holds that moral concern must be extended to sentient animals br br br Justification br Peter Singer provides the following justification of sentiocentrism br The capacity for suffering and enjoying things is a prerequisite for having interests at all a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way It would be nonsense to say that it was not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a child A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare A mouse on the other hand does have an interest in not being tormented because mice will suffer if they are treated in this way br If a being suffers there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration No matter what the nature of the being the principle of equality requires that the suffering be counted equally with the like suffering in so far as rough comparisons can be made of any other being If a being is not capable of suffering or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness there is nothing to be taken into account This is why the limit of sentience is the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others br In line with the above utilitarian philosophers such as Singer not only care about the wellbeing of humans but also about the wellbeing of sentient non human animals Utilitarians reject speciesism the discrimination of individuals on the basis of their species membership Drawing an analogy between speciesism and other forms of arbitrary discrimination Peter Singer writes that br br Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race Sexists violate the principle of equality by favoring the interests of their own sex Similarly speciesists allow the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species The pattern is identical in each case br br br Gradualism br br In the animal kingdom there is a gradation in the nervous complexity taking examples from the marine sponges that lack neurons intestinal worms with neurons or humans with billion While the existence of neurons is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of sentience in an animal it is a necessary condition There is no known mechanism by which sentience can arise without the presence of neurons br Gradualist sentiocentrism states that more complex interests deserve more consideration than less complex moral interests One implication of this premise is that the best interests of a simple organism do not deserve consideration before the non best interest in a complex organism e g a dog with intestinal worms should be healed even though this results in the death of the parasites Note that this does not lead to the rejection of interests of complex animals such as pigs versus the human desire to feed on them br This is a vision that expands to areas that are not only relevant to other species but to uniquely human issues as is the case on the legalization of abortion Gradualism poses a greater consideration of the mother against the fetus in question given that the latter does not have the ability for complex interests in the early stages of gestation An emblematic case in this debate is the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins who says that an early stage human embryo with no nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear might defensibly be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig which is clearly well equipped to suffer br As a fetus progresses they gain sentience until the majority of neurons are already present in our brains by the time we are born Since a month fetus is nearing the mother s level of sentience a sentiocentrist may therefore believe that greater rights should be afforded to a month fetus than a month fetus if any Late term abortions should then require much greater justification under the law than a week abortion which may not require any justification under the law br For example psycho social justifications are often viewed as valid reasons for aborting a fetus with little to no sentience but it may take medical necessity to justify killing a fetus with a level of sentience approaching that of their mother br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br MacClellan Joel P Minding Nature A Defense of a Sentiocentric Approach to Environmental Ethics
