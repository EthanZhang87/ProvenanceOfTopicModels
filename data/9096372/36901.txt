garden with more than one million plants representing over species The park houses a large array of wild and endangered animals from every continent except Antarctica Located in a semi arid climate the area is noted for its year round feeling of an African environment br The zoo is an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA the American Alliance of Museums AAM and the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums WAZA Its parent organization the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance is a private nonprofit conservation organization and has one of the largest zoological membership associations in the world The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance also operates the San Diego Zoo br br br History br The San Diego Zoological Society became interested in developing a larger facility in The initial concept of the park was as a supplementary breeding facility for the San Diego Zoo which would allow ample space for large animals and herding behaviors of ungulates br The development proposed would differ significantly from that of a typical zoo in that animals would be exhibited in a naturalistic spacious environment rather than in cages In the park was assessed financially and then moved onto the next phase with this resulting in three alternative developments a conservation farm a game preserve or a natural environment zoo The natural environment zoo development was chosen over the conservation farm and game preserve even though it was the most expensive option The estimated initial cost was br The main purposes of this zoo were to be species conservation breeding of animals for the San Diego Zoo as well as trading between zoos and providing areas where exotic animals arriving to the state of California could be quarantined and monitored When it came to naming the park five titles were considered San Diego Animal Land San Diego Safari Land San Diego Wild Animal Safari or the San Diego Wildlife Park ultimately the name chosen was the San Diego Wild Animal Park br The scheduled opening day of the park was set for April however the gates did not open until May The general layout of the park designed by Charles Faust included a large lagoon with a jungle plaza an African fishing village an aviary at the entrance of the park and approximately plants were to be included in the landscaping Although the park was scheduled to open in three years from the time of the groundbreaking the total development of the park was estimated to take ten years br The first two species to arrive at the park were the nilgai an antelope from India and Nepal and the Grant s zebra native to East Africa br Subsequent species to arrive at the park included the gemsbok a type of oryx from Southern Africa and Namibia in addition to Zambian sable antelope greater kudu southern and northern white rhinoceros subspecies which were both in danger of extinction the one horned Indian rhinoceros as well as ten South African cheetahs brought to the park for breeding purposes br When the park first opened there were many cultural shows and programs with groups invited from Africa and Asia There were also many animal encounters and entertainment options available for guests to view various animal ambassador species br In the summer of the San Diego Zoological Society and Lowry Park Zoo orchestrated the capture of wild African elephants from the Hlane Royal National Park in Swaziland since renamed to Eswatini The zoos said the animals were scheduled to be killed due to overpopulation However In Defense of Animals disputes this claiming that new fencing costing many times less than the capture and transport would have ended the need to remove any elephants from Swaziland and that the Save Wild Elephants Coalition reported that there were three other sanctuaries in Africa that had offered to take the elephants br Five of these elephants are now at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park and cumulatively they have produced thirteen babies as of In March five elephants were moved to the Reid Park Zoo in Tucson Arizona to form a new herd A bull elephant two cows and two baby bulls were moved and in return two female elephants that had been together for years Connie an Asian elephant and Shaba an African elephant were sent to the San Diego Zoo Connie died from cancer in July just five months after the move Shaba was slowly introduced into the herd in February On July Ndulagave birth to Umzula A male calf named Zuli was the largest elephant born at the park The California wildfire season in which officially started on October that year burned acres km of native chaparral lands within the park and caused the park s temporarily closure The park moved many of their endangered animals out of danger of the fire The flames did not reach any of the main enclosures and no animals were killed or burned by the fire though the flames could be seen clearly from several of the exhibits The incidental deaths of a clapper rail and kiang were attributed to indirect effects of the blaze br On June the San Diego Zoo board of trustees voted to change the name of the park from the Wild Animal Park to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to clarify what it offers since the difference between the zoo proper and the animal park was unclear to some visitors The name safari is supposed to emphasize the park s spacious enclosures of free ranging animals as opposed to the closer quarters of the zoo encouraging visits to both locations br In July the park opened a new exhibit specifically for their rhinoceroses the Nikhita Khan Rhino Centre named after animal lover and lawyer Nikhita Khan debuting as the home for six white rhinos A few days after the center s opening one of the rhinos named Victoria gave birth to Edward a male calf becoming the first rhinoceros in North America to be born via artificial insemination br In April the Ellen Trout Zoo s male southern white rhinoceros Bwana permanently moved into this zoo to officially join its large crash br br br Exhibits and attractions br br br Asian Savanna and African Plains br br The park s largest exhibits covering over acres ha are the open range enclosures

chief designer Chuck Faust as a profane inside joke with WGASA being an acronym for who gives a shit anyway Zoo officials later came up with a backronym for the name saying that it stood for World s Greatest Animal Show Anywhere br The Monorail line has been retired partially due to high maintenance costs and in March the Journey into Africa attraction now renamed Africa Tram opened The Africa Tram tour runs counterclockwise and brings visitors to the field exhibits to see wildlife from different parts of Africa In addition another route is planned to bring visitors through the Asian field

Zoo The park is Southern California s quarantine center for zoo animals imported into the United States through San Diego br The safari park was a major factor in the recovery of the California condor Beginning in it worked with the U S Fish and Wildlife Service and the Los Angeles Zoo to start a captive breeding program The last condors were taken into captivity in To breed the condors quickly the Safari Park would remove the eggs from the nests to induce the females to lay a second egg The removed egg hatches in an incubator and is raised with a condor handpuppet to prevent human imprinting while the second egg is raised by its parents The first condor born through this process is Siscouc a male condor who was the patriarch of the flock last chick Kitwon Now that title goes to Siwon
