Hern n Cort s de Monroy y Pizarro Altamirano st Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca air NAHN kor TESS Spanish e na ko tes e mon roj i pi aro altami ano December December was a Spanish conquistador who led an expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire and brought large portions of what is now mainland Mexico under the rule of the King of Castile in the early th century Cort s was part of the generation of Spanish explorers and conquistadors who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas br Born in Medell n Spain to a family of lesser nobility Cort s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the New World He went to Hispaniola and later to Cuba where he received an encomienda the right to the labor of certain subjects For a short time he served as alcalde magistrate of the second Spanish town founded on the island In he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland which he partly funded His enmity with the governor of Cuba Diego Vel zquez de Cu llar resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment an order which Cort s ignored br Arriving on the continent Cort s executed a successful strategy of allying with some indigenous people against others He also used a native woman Do a Marina as an interpreter She later gave birth to his first son When the governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort s he fought them and won using the extra troops as reinforcements Cort s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny After he overthrew the Aztec Empire Cort s was awarded the title of marqu s del Valle de Oaxaca while the more prestigious title of viceroy was given to a high ranking nobleman Antonio de Mendoza In Cort s returned to Spain where he died six years later of natural causes br br br Name br br Cort s himself used the form Hernando or Fernando for his first name as seen in the contemporary archive documents his signature and the title of an early portrait William Hickling Prescott s Conquest of Mexico also refers to him as Hernando Cort s At some point writers began using the shortened form of Hern n more generally br br br Physical appearance br In addition to the illustration by the German artist Christoph Weiditz in his Trachtenbuch there are three known portraits of Hern n Cort s which were likely made during his lifetime though only copies of them have survived All of these portraits show Cort s in the later years of his life The account of the conquest of the Aztec Empire written by Bernal D az del Castillo gives a detailed description of Hern n Cort s s physical appearance br br He was of good stature and body well proportioned and stocky the color of his face was somewhat grey not very cheerful and a longer face would have suited him more His eyes seemed at times loving and at times grave and serious His beard was black and sparse as was his hair which at the time he sported in the same way as his beard He had a high chest a well shaped back and was lean with little belly br br br Early life br br Cort s was born in in the town of Medell n then a village in the Kingdom of Castile now a municipality of the modern day province of Badajoz in Extremadura Spain His father Mart n Cort s de Monroy born in to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar a Cort s was an infantry captain of distinguished ancestry but slender means Hern n s mother was Catal na Pizarro Altamirano br Through his mother Hern n was second cousin once removed of Francisco Pizarro who later conquered the Inca Empire of modern day Peru and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro who joined Cort s to conquer the Aztecs His maternal grandmother Leonor S nchez Pizarro Altamirano was first cousin of Pizarro s father Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodriguez Through his father Hern n was related to Nicol s de Ovando the third governor of Hispaniola His paternal great grandfather was Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz th Lord of Monroy br According to his biographer and chaplain Francisco L pez de G mara Cort s was pale and sickly as a child At the age of he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca Later historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca br After two years Cort s returned home to Medell n much to the irritation of his parents who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career However those two years in Salamanca plus his long period of training and experience as a notary first in Valladolid and later in Hispaniola gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico br At this point in his life Cort s was described by G mara as ruthless haughty and mischievous The year old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town By this time news of the exciting discoveries of Christopher Columbus in the New World was streaming back to Spain br br br Early career in the New World br br Plans were made for Cort s to sail to the Americas with a family acquaintance and distant relative Nicol s de Ovando the newly appointed Governor of Hispaniola This island is now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic Cort s suffered an injury and was prevented from traveling He spent the next year wandering the country probably spending most of his time in Spain s southern ports of Cadiz Palos Sanlucar and Seville He finally left for Hispaniola in and became a colonist br br br Arrival br Cort s reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages Quintero s mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cort s in his subsequent career br Upon his arrival in in Santo Domingo the capital of Hispaniola the year old Cort s registered as a citizen this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm Soon afterward Governor Nicol s de Ovando granted him an encomienda and appointed him as a notary of the town of Azua de Compostela His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony in Cort s took part in the conquests of Hispaniola and Cuba The expedition leader awarded him a large estate of land and Ta no slaves for his efforts br br br Cuba br In Cort s accompanied Diego Vel zquez de Cu llar an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola in his expedition to conquer Cuba Vel zquez was appointed Governor of New Spain At the age of Cort s was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the quinto or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition br Vel zquez was so impressed with Cort s that he secured a high political position for him in the colony He became secretary for Governor Vel zquez Cort s was twice appointed municipal magistrate alcalde of Santiago In Cuba Cort s became a man of substance with an encomienda to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to In Cort s led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers br As time went on relations between Cort s and Governor Vel zquez became strained Cort s found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xu rez or Ju rez the sister in law of Governor Vel zquez Part of Vel zquez s displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cort s was trifling with Catalina s affections Cort s was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina s sisters but finally married Catalina reluctantly under pressure from Governor Vel zquez However by doing so he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Vel zquez br It was not until he had been almost years in the Indies that Cort s began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony He missed the first two expeditions under the orders of Francisco Hern ndez de C rdoba and then Juan de Grijalva sent by Diego Vel zquez to Mexico in News reached Vel zquez that Juan de Grijalva had established a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold and Vel zquez decided to send him help Cort s was appointed captain general of this new expedition in October but was advised to move fast before Vel zquez changed his mind br With Cort s s experience as an administrator knowledge gained from many failed expeditions and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and men within a month Vel zquez s jealousy exploded and he decided to put the expedition in other hands However Cort s quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports br br br Conquest of Mexico br br In Vel zquez put Cort s in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization At the last minute due to the old argument between the two Vel zquez changed his mind and revoked Cort s s charter Cort s ignored the orders and in an act of open mutiny went anyway in February He stopped in Trinidad Cuba to hire more soldiers and obtain more horses Accompanied by about ships men including seasoned slaves horses and a small number of cannons Cort s landed on the Yucat n Peninsula in Maya territory There he encountered Geronimo de Aguilar a Spanish Franciscan priest who had survived a shipwreck followed by a period in captivity with the Maya before escaping Aguilar had learned the Chontal Maya language and was able to translate for Cort s br Cort s s military experience was almost nonexistent but he proved to be an effective leader of his small army and won early victories over the coastal Indians In March Cort s formally claimed the land for the Spanish crown Then he proceeded to Tabasco where he met with resistance and won a battle against the natives He received twenty young indigenous women from the vanquished natives and he converted them all to Christianity br Among these women was La Malinche his future mistress and mother of his son Mart n Malinche knew both the Nahuatl language and Chontal Maya thus enabling Cort s to communicate with the Aztecs through Aguilar At San Juan de Ul a on Easter Sunday Cort s met with Moctezuma II s Aztec Empire governors Tendile and Pitalpitoque br br In July his men took over Veracruz By this act Cort s dismissed the authority of the governor of Cuba to place himself directly under the orders of King Charles To eliminate any ideas of retreat Cort s scuttled his ships br br br March on Tenochtitl n br In Veracruz he met some of the tributaries of the Aztecs and asked them to arrange a meeting with Moctezuma II the tlatoani ruler of the Aztec Empire Moctezuma repeatedly turned down the meeting but Cort s was determined Leaving a hundred men in Veracruz Cort s marched on Tenochtitl n in mid August along with soldiers horsemen cannons and hundreds of indigenous carriers and warriors br On the way to Tenochtitl n Cort s made alliances with indigenous peoples such as the Totonacs of Cempoala and the Nahuas of Tlaxcala The Otomis initially and then the Tlaxcalans clashed with the Spanish in a series of three battles from to September and at one point Diaz remarked they surrounded us on every side After Cort s continued to release prisoners with messages of peace and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Moctezuma Xicotencatl the Elder and Maxixcatzin persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader Xicotencatl the Younger that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them br In October Cort s and his men accompanied by about Tlaxcalteca marched to Cholula the second largest city in central Mexico Cort s either in a pre meditated effort to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him at Tenochtitlan or as he later claimed when he was being investigated wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza then partially burned the city br br By the time he arrived in Tenochtitl n the Spaniards had a large army On November they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II Moctezuma deliberately let Cort s enter the Aztec capital the island city of Tenochtitl n hoping to get to know their weaknesses better and to crush them later br Moctezuma gave lavish gifts of gold to the Spaniards which rather than placating them excited their ambitions for plunder In his letters to King Charles Cort s claimed to have learned at this point that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl or Quetzalcoatl himself a belief which has been contested by a few modern historians But quickly Cort s learned that several Spaniards on the coast had been killed by Aztecs while supporting the Totonacs and decided to take Moctezuma as a hostage in his palace indirectly ruling Tenochtitl n through him br br Meanwhile Vel zquez sent another expedition led by P nfilo de Narv ez to oppose Cort s arriving in Mexico in April with men Cort s left men in Tenochtitl n and took the rest to confront Narv ez He overcame Narv ez despite his numerical inferiority and convinced the rest of Narv ez s men to join him In Mexico one of Cort s s lieutenants Pedro de Alvarado committed the massacre in the Great Temple triggering a local rebellion br Cort s speedily returned to Tenochtitl n On July Moctezuma was killed he was stoned to death by his own people as reported in Spanish accounts although some claim he was murdered by the Spaniards once they realized his inability to placate the locals Faced with a hostile population Cort s decided to flee for Tlaxcala During the Noche Triste June July the Spaniards managed a narrow escape from Tenochtitl n across the Tlacopan causeway while their rearguard was being massacred Much of the treasure looted by Cort s was lost as well as his artillery during this panicked escape from Tenochtitl n br br br Destruction of Tenochtitl n br After a battle in Otumba they managed to reach Tlaxcala having lost men With the assistance of their allies Cort s s men finally prevailed with reinforcements arriving from Cuba Cort s began a policy of attrition towards Tenochtitl n cutting off supplies and subduing the Aztecs allied cities During the siege he would construct brigantines in the lake and slowly destroy blocks of the city to avoid fighting in an urban setting The Mexicas would fall back to Tlatelolco and even succeed in ambushing the pursuing Spanish forces inflicting heavy losses but would ultimately be the last portion of the island that resisted the conquistadores The siege of Tenochtitlan ended with Spanish victory and the destruction of the city br In January Cort s countered a conspiracy against him headed by Antonio de Villafana who was hanged for the offense Finally with the capture of Cuauht moc the tlatoani ruler of Tenochtitl n on August the Aztec Empire was captured and Cort s was able to claim it for Spain thus renaming the city Mexico City From to Cort s personally governed Mexico br br br Appointment to governorship of Mexico and internal dissensions br br Many historical sources have conveyed an impression that Cort s was unjustly treated by the Spanish Crown and that he received nothing but ingratitude for his role in establishing New Spain This picture is the one Cort s presents in his letters and in the later biography written by Francisco L pez de G mara However there may be more to the picture than this Cort s s own sense of accomplishment entitlement and vanity may have played a part in his deteriorating position with the king br br Cort s personally was not ungenerously rewarded but he speedily complained of insufficient compensation to himself and his comrades Thinking himself beyond reach of restraint he disobeyed many of the orders of the Crown and what was more imprudent said so in a letter to the emperor dated October Ycazbalceta Documentos para la Historia de M xico Mexico I In this letter Cort s besides recalling in a rather abrupt manner that the conquest of Mexico was due to him alone deliberately acknowledges his disobedience in terms which could not fail to create a most unfavourable impression br King Charles appointed Cort s as governor captain general and chief justice of the newly conquered territory dubbed New Spain of the Ocean Sea But also much to the dismay of Cort s four royal officials were appointed at the same time to assist him in his governing in effect submitting him to close observation and administration Cort s initiated the construction of Mexico City destroying Aztec temples and buildings and then rebuilding on the Aztec ruins what soon became the most important European city in the Americas br Cort s managed the founding of new cities and appointed men to extend Spanish rule to all of New Spain imposing the encomienda system in He reserved many encomiendas for himself and for his retinue which they considered just rewards for their accomplishment in conquering central Mexico However later arrivals and members of factions antipathetic to Cort s complained of the favoritism that excluded them br In the Crown possibly influenced by Cort s s enemy Bishop Fonseca sent a military force under the command of Francisco de Garay to conquer and settle the northern part of Mexico the region of P nuco This was another setback for Cort s who mentioned this in his fourth letter to the King in which he describes himself as the victim of a conspiracy by his archenemies Diego Vel zquez de Cu llar Diego Columbus and Bishop Fonseca as well as Francisco Garay The influence of Garay was effectively stopped by this appeal to the King who sent out a decree forbidding Garay to interfere in the politics of New Spain causing him to give up without a fight br br br Royal grant of arms br br Although Cort s had flouted the authority of Diego Vel zquez in sailing to the mainland and then leading an expedition of conquest Cort s s spectacular success was rewarded by the crown with a coat of arms a mark of high honor following the conqueror s request The document granting the coat of arms summarizes Cort s s accomplishments in the conquest of Mexico The proclamation of the king says in part br br We respecting the many labors dangers and adventures which you underwent as stated above and so that there might remain a perpetual memorial of you and your services and that you and your descendants might be more fully honored it is our will that besides your coat of arms of your lineage which you have you may have and bear as your coat of arms known and recognized a shield br The grant specifies the iconography of the coat of arms the central portion divided into quadrants In the upper portion there is a black eagle with two heads on a white field which are the arms of the empire Below that is a golden lion on a red field in memory of the fact that you the said Hernando Cort s by your industry and effort brought matters to the state described above i e the conquest The specificity of the other two quadrants is linked directly to Mexico with one quadrant showing three crowns representing the three Aztec emperors of the conquest era Moctezuma Cuitlahuac and Cuauhtemoc and the other showing the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan Encircling the central shield are symbols of the seven city states around the lake and their lords that Cort s defeated with the lords to be shown as prisoners bound with a chain which shall be closed with a lock beneath the shield br br br Death of his first wife and remarriage br br Cort s s wife Catalina S arez arrived in New Spain around summer along with her sister and brother His marriage to Catalina was at this point extremely awkward since she was a kinswoman of the governor of Cuba Diego Vel zquez whose authority Cort s had thrown off and who was therefore now his enemy Catalina lacked the noble title of do a so at this point his marriage with her no longer raised his status Their marriage had been childless Since Cort s had sired children with a variety of indigenous women including a son around by his cultural translator Do a Marina Cort s knew he was capable of fathering children Cort s s only male heir at this point was illegitimate but nonetheless named after Cort s s father Mart n Cort s This son Mart n Cort s was also popularly called El Mestizo br Catalina Su rez died under mysterious circumstances the night of November There were accusations at the time that Cort s had murdered his wife There was an investigation into her death interviewing a variety of household residents and others The documentation of the investigation was published in the nineteenth century in Mexico and these archival documents were uncovered in the twentieth century The death of Catalina Su rez produced a scandal and investigation but Cort s was now free to marry someone of high status more appropriate to his wealth and power In he built an imposing residence for himself the Palace of Cort s in Cuernavaca in a region close to the capital where he had extensive encomienda holdings In he had been accorded the noble designation of don but more importantly was given the noble title of Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do a Juana de Z iga The marriage produced three children including another son who was also named Mart n As the first born legitimate son Don Mart n Cort s y Z iga was now Cort s s heir and succeeded him as holder of the title and estate of the Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca Cort s s legitimate daughters were Do a Maria Do a Catalina and Do a Juana br br br Cort s and the Spiritual Conquest of Mexico br Since the conversion to Christianity of indigenous peoples was an essential and integral part of the extension of Spanish power making formal provisions for that conversion once the military conquest was completed was an important task for Cort s During the Age of Discovery the Catholic Church had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars particularly the mendicant orders Cort s made a request to the Spanish monarch to send Franciscan and Dominican friars to Mexico to convert the vast indigenous populations to Christianity In his fourth letter to the king Cort s pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians conversion br br If these people Indians were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain knowing that such men were the ministers of God it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail br He wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith so Cort s laid out a solution to this to the king br br Your Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness the pope to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here and that they should be his delegates one from the Order of St Francis and the other from the Order of St Dominic They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain for because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome and we the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and as we are human so subject to sin it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials br The Franciscans arrived in May a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the Twelve Apostles of Mexico led by Fray Mart n de Valencia Franciscan Geronimo de Mendieta claimed that Cort s s most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast This story was told by Franciscans to demonstrate Cort s piety and humility and was a powerful message to all including the Indians that Cort s s earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual power of the friars However one of the first twelve Franciscans Fray Toribio de Benavente Motolinia does not mention it in his history Cort s and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico with Franciscans seeing him as the new Moses for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization In Motolinia s response to Dominican Bartolom de Las Casas he praises Cort s br br And as to those who murmur against the Marqu s del Valle Cort s God rest him and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqu s Although as a human he was a sinner he had faith and works of a good Christian and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ and dying for the conversion of these gentiles Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cort s Through this captain God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church br In Fray Bernardino de Sahag n s revision of the conquest narrative first codified as Book XII of the Florentine Codex there are laudatory references to Cort s that do not appear in the earlier text from the indigenous perspective Whereas Book XII of the Florentine Codex concludes with an account of Spaniards search for gold in Sahag n s revised account he ends with praise of Cort s for requesting the Franciscans be sent to Mexico to convert the Indians br br br Expedition to Honduras and aftermath br br br Expedition to Honduras br From to Cort s headed an expedition to Honduras where he defeated Crist bal de Olid who had claimed Honduras as his own under the influence of the Governor of Cuba Diego Vel zquez Fearing that Cuauht moc might head an insurrection in Mexico he brought him with him to Honduras In a controversial move Cuauht moc was executed during the journey Raging over Olid s treason Cort s issued a decree to arrest Vel zquez whom he was sure was behind Olid s treason This however only served to further estrange the Crown of Castile and the Council of Indies both of which were already beginning to feel anxious about Cort s s rising power br Cort s s fifth letter to King Charles attempts to justify his conduct concludes with a bitter attack on various and powerful rivals and enemies who have obscured the eyes of your Majesty Charles who was also Holy Roman Emperor had little time for distant colonies much of Charles s reign was taken up with wars with France the German Protestants and the expanding Ottoman Empire except insofar as they contributed to finance his wars In year of the Conquest Charles was attending to matters in his German domains and Bishop Adrian of Utrecht functioned as regent in Spain br Vel zquez and Fonseca persuaded the regent to appoint a commissioner a Juez de residencia Luis Ponce de Le n with powers to investigate Cort s s conduct and even arrest him Cort s was once quoted as saying that it was more difficult to contend against his own countrymen than against the Aztecs Governor Diego Vel zquez continued to be a thorn in his side teaming up with Bishop Juan Rodr guez de Fonseca chief of the Spanish colonial department to undermine him in the Council of the Indies br A few days after Cort s s return from his expedition Ponce de Le n suspended Cort s from his office of governor of New Spain The Licentiate then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival appointing Marcos de Aguilar as alcalde mayor The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed Alonso de Estrada governor who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August Cort s suspected of poisoning them refrained from taking over the government br Estrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release Gonzalo de Salazar and Chirinos When Cort s complained angrily after one of his adherents hands was cut off Estrada ordered him exiled Cort s sailed for Spain in to appeal to King Charles br br br First return to Spain and Marquessate of the Valley of Oaxaca br br In Cort s returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master Charles V Juan Altamirano and Alonso Valiente stayed in Mexico and acted as Cort s s representatives during his absence Cort s presented himself with great splendor before Charles V s court By this time Charles had returned and Cort s forthrightly responded to his enemy s charges Denying he had held back on gold due the crown he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto one fifth required Indeed he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl n leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire br He was received by Charles with every distinction and decorated with the order of Santiago In return for his efforts in expanding the still young Spanish Empire Cort s was rewarded in by being accorded the noble title of don but more importantly named the Marqu s del Valle de Oaxaca Marquess of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do a Juana Z iga after the death of his much less distinguished first wife Catalina Su rez The noble title and senorial estate of the Marquesado was passed down to his descendants until The Oaxaca Valley was one of the wealthiest regions of New Spain and Cort s had vassals in named encomiendas in perpetuity br Although confirmed in his land holdings and vassals he was not reinstated as governor and was never again given any important office in the administration of New Spain During his travel to Spain his property was mismanaged by abusive colonial administrators He sided with local natives in a lawsuit The natives documented the abuses in the Huexotzinco Codex br The entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don Mart n Cort s upon Cort s s death in who became the Second Marquess Don Mart n s association with the so called Encomenderos Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hern n Cort s s family through the generations br br br Return to Mexico and appointment of a viceroy br br Cort s returned to Mexico in with new titles and honors Although Cort s still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests Don Antonio de Mendoza was appointed in as a viceroy to administer New Spain s civil affairs This division of power led to continual dissension and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cort s was engaged On returning to Mexico Cort s found the country in a state of anarchy There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cort s br After reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order Cort s retired to his estates at Cuernavaca about miles km south of Mexico City There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration Remaining in Mexico between and Cort s quarreled with Nu o Beltr n de Guzm n and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today California with Antonio de Mendoza the first viceroy br Cort s acquired several silver mines in Zumpango del Rio in By the early s he owned silver mines in Sultepec in Taxco and in Zacualpan Earlier Cort s had claimed the silver in the Tamazula area br In Cort s explored the northwestern part of Mexico and discovered the Baja California peninsula Cort s also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico The Gulf of California was originally named the Sea of Cort s by its discoverer Francisco de Ulloa in This was the last major expedition by Cort s br br br Later life and death br br br Second return to Spain br After his exploration of Baja California Cort s returned to Spain in hoping to confound his angry civilians who had brought many lawsuits against him for debts abuse of power etc On his return he went through a crowd to speak to the emperor who demanded of him who he was I am a man replied Cort s who has given you more provinces than your ancestors left you cities br br br Expedition against Algiers br br The emperor finally permitted Cort s to join him and his fleet commanded by Andrea Doria at the great expedition against Algiers in the Barbary Coast in which was then part of the Ottoman Empire During this campaign Cort s was almost drowned in a storm that hit his fleet while he was pursuing the Pasha of Algiers br br br Last years death and remains br Having spent a great deal of his own money to finance expeditions he was now heavily in debt In February he made a claim on the royal treasury but was ignored for the next three years Disgusted he decided to return to Mexico in When he reached Seville he was stricken with dysentery He died in Castilleja de la Cuesta Seville province on December from a case of pleurisy at the age of br He left his many mestizo and white children well cared for in his will along with every one of their mothers He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico Before he died he had the Pope remove the natural status of four of his children legitimizing them in the eyes of the church including Mart n the son he had with Do a Marina also known as La Malinche said to be his favourite His daughter Do a Catalina however died shortly after her father s death br br After his death his body was moved more than eight times for several reasons On December he was buried in the mausoleum of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo Sevilla Three years later due to the space being required by the duke his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church In his testament Cort s asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in M xico ten years after his death but the monastery was never built So in his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of San Francisco de Texcoco where his mother and one of his sisters were buried br br In Cortes s last male descendant Don Pedro Cort s fourth Marquez del Valle died The viceroy decided to move the bones of Cort s along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in M xico This was delayed for nine years while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of Franciscan church where it stayed for years In it was moved to another place in the same church In his bones were moved to the Hospital de Jesus founded by Cort s where a statue by Tols and a mausoleum were made There was a public ceremony and all the churches in the city rang their bells br In after the independence of M xico it seemed imminent that his body would be desecrated so the mausoleum was removed the statue and the coat of arms were sent to Palermo Sicily to be protected by the Duke of Terranova The bones were hidden and everyone thought that they had been sent out of M xico In his bones were moved to another place in the same building br It was not until November that they were rediscovered thanks to the discovery of a secret document by Lucas Alam n His bones were put in the charge of the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog a e Historia INAH The remains were authenticated by INAH They were then restored to the same place this time with a bronze inscription and his coat of arms When the bones were first rediscovered the supporters of the Hispanic tradition in Mexico were excited but one supporter of an indigenist vision of Mexico proposed that the remains be publicly burned in front of the statue of Cuauhtemoc and the ashes flung into the air Following the discovery and authentication of Cort s s remains there was a discovery of what were described as the bones of Cuauht moc resulting in a battle of the bones br On December the lawsuits related to vassals of the Cortes estate were resolved by a royal order issued by Philip II br br br Taxa named after Cort s br Cort s is commemorated in the scientific name of a subspecies of Mexican lizard Phrynosoma orbiculare cortezii br br br Disputed interpretation of his life br There are relatively few sources to the early life of Cort s his fame arose from his participation in the conquest of Mexico and it was only after this that people became interested in reading and writing about him br Probably the best source is his letters to the king which he wrote during the campaign in Mexico but they are written with the specific purpose of putting his efforts in a favourable light and so must be read critically Another main source is the biography written by Cort s s private chaplain Lopez de G mara which was written in Spain several years after the conquest G mara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cort s had told him and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls the lies of Gomara the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador Bernal D az del Castillo which does not paint Cort s as a romantic hero but rather tries to emphasize that Cort s s men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico br br In the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written The Dominican friar Bartolom de Las Casas wrote his A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cort s in particular The accounts of the conquest given in the Florentine Codex by the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag n and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cort s The scarcity of these sources has led to a sharp division in the description of Cort s s personality and a tendency to describe him as either a vicious and ruthless person or a noble and honorable cavalier br br br Representations in Mexico br br In M xico there are few representations of Cort s However many landmarks still bear his name from the castle Palacio de Cort s in the city of Cuernavaca to some street names throughout the republic br The pass between the volcanoes Iztacc huatl and Popocat petl where Cort s took his soldiers on their march to Mexico City It is known as the Paso de Cort s br The muralist Diego Rivera painted several representation of him but the most famous depicts him as a powerful and ominous figure along with Malinche in a mural in the National Palace in Mexico City br br In President Lopez Portillo tried to
