title: Siberian tiger
id: 543466
The Siberian tiger or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies Panthera tigris tigris native to the Russian Far East Northeast China and possibly North Korea It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula but currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote Alin mountain region in southwest Primorye Province in the Russian Far East In there were adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region with a breeding adult population of about individuals The population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive conservation efforts but partial surveys conducted after indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining An initial census held in indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to individuals in the Russian Far East including cubs This was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of wild Siberian tigers in Russia As of about individuals were estimated to range in the international border area between Russia and China br The Siberian tiger is genetically close to the now extinct Caspian tiger Results of a phylogeographic study comparing mitochondrial DNA from Caspian tigers and living tiger populations indicate that the common ancestor of the Siberian and Caspian tigers colonized Central Asia from eastern China via the Gansu Silk Road corridor and then subsequently traversed Siberia eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East The Caspian and Siberian tiger populations were the northernmost in mainland Asia br The Siberian tiger was also called Amur tiger Manchurian tiger Korean tiger and Ussurian tiger depending on the region where individuals were observed br br br Taxonomy br br Felis tigris was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in for the tiger In the th century several tiger specimens were collected in East Asia and described br br Felis tigris altaicus proposed by Coenraad Jacob Temminck in were tiger skins with long hairs and dense coats sold in Japan which originated in Korea most likely from animals killed in the Altai and Pisihan Mountains br Tigris longipilis proposed by Leopold Fitzinger in was based on a long haired tiger skin in the Natural History Museum Vienna br Felis tigris var amurensis proposed by Charles Dode in was based on tiger skins from the Amur region br Felis tigris coreensis by Emil Brass in was a tiger skin from Korea br The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in Most putative subspecies described in the th and th centuries were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration striping patterns and body size characteristics that vary widely within populations Morphologically tigers from different regions vary little and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene Therefore it was proposed to recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid namely Panthera tigris tigris in mainland Asia and P t sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands and possibly in Sundaland br In morphological ecological and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach Results support distinction of the two evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies namely P t tigris comprising the Bengal Malayan Indochinese South China Siberian and Caspian tiger populations and P t sondaica comprising the Javan Bali and Sumatran tiger populations br In the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and now recognizes all the tiger populations in mainland Asia as P t tigris br br br Phylogeny br br Several reports have been published since the s on the genetic makeup of the Siberian tiger and its relationship to other populations One of the most important outcomes has been the discovery of low genetic variability in the wild population especially when it comes to maternal or mitochondrial DNA lineages It seems that a single mtDNA haplotype almost completely dominates the maternal lineages of wild Siberian tigers On the other hand captive tigers appear to show higher mtDNA diversity This may suggest that the subspecies has experienced a very recent genetic bottleneck caused by human pressure with the founders of the captive population having been captured when genetic variability was higher in the wild br At the start of the st century researchers from the University of Oxford U S National Cancer Institute and Hebrew University of Jerusalem collected tissue samples from of Caspian tiger specimens kept in museums across Eurasia They sequenced at least one segment of five mitochondrial genes and found a low amount of variability of the mitochondrial DNA in Caspian tigers as compared to other tiger subspecies They re assessed the phylogenetic relationships of tiger subspecies and observed a remarkable similarity between Caspian and Siberian tigers indicating that the Siberian tiger is the genetically closest living relative of the Caspian tiger which strongly implies a very recent common ancestry Based on phylogeographic analysis they suggested that the ancestor of Caspian and Siberian tigers colonized Central Asia less than years ago via the Gansu Silk Road region from eastern China and subsequently traversed eastward to establish the Siberian tiger population in the Russian Far East The events of the Industrial Revolution may have been the critical factor in the reciprocal isolation of Caspian and Siberian tigers from what was likely a single contiguous population br Samples of wild Amur tigers were collected throughout their native range to investigate questions relative to population genetic structure and demographic history Additionally targeted individuals from the North American ex situ population were sampled to assess the genetic representation found in captivity Population genetic and Bayesian structure analyses clearly identified two populations separated by a development corridor in Russia Despite their well documented th century decline the researchers failed to find evidence of a recent population bottleneck although genetic signatures of a historical contraction were detected This disparity in signal may be due to several reasons including historical paucity in population genetic variation associated with postglacial colonisation and potential gene flow from an extirpated Chinese population The extent and distribution of genetic variation in captive and wild populations were similar yet gene variants persisted ex situ that were lost in situ Overall their results indicate the need to secure ecological connectivity between the two Russian populations to minimize loss of genetic diversity and overall susceptibility to stochastic events and support a previous study suggesting that the captive population may be a reservoir of gene variants lost in situ br In the whole genome of the Siberian tiger was sequenced and published Tigers in mainland Asia fall into two clades the northern clade comprises the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations and the southern clade all remaining continental tiger populations A study published in was based on tiger specimens using a whole genome sequencing for analysis Results support six monophyletic tiger clades and indicate that the most recent common ancestor lived about years ago br br br Characteristics br br The tiger is reddish rusty or rusty yellow in colour with narrow black transverse stripes The body length is not less than cm in condylobasal length of skull mm in zygomatic width mm in and length of upper carnassial tooth over mm in long It has an extended supple body standing on rather short legs with a fairly long tail br br br Body size br In the s the typical weight range of wild Siberian tigers was indicated as to kg to lb for males and to kg to lb for females Exceptionally large individuals were targeted and shot by hunters br In a group of Russian American and Indian zoologists published an analysis of historical and contemporary data on body weights of wild and captive tigers both female and male across all subspecies The data used include weights of tigers that were older than months and measured in the presence of authors Their comparison with historical data indicates that up to the first half of the th century both male and female Siberian tigers were on average heavier than post ones The average historical wild male Siberian tiger weighed kg lb and the female kg lb the contemporary wild male Siberian tiger weighs kg lb on average with an asymptotic limit being kg lb a wild female weighs kg lb on average Historical Siberian tigers and Bengal tigers were the largest ones whereas contemporary Siberian tigers are on average lighter than Bengal tigers The reduction of the body weight of today s Siberian tigers may be explained by concurrent causes namely the reduced abundance of prey because of illegal hunting and that the individuals were usually sick or injured and captured in a conflict situation with people br Measurements taken by scientists of the Siberian Tiger Project in the Sikhote Alin range from to cm to in in head and body length measured in straight line with an average of cm in for males and for females ranging from to cm to in with an average of cm in The average tail measures cm in in males and cm in in females The longest male measured cm in in total length including a tail of cm in and with a chest girth of cm in The longest female measured cm in in total length including tail of cm in and with a chest girth of cm in br A male captured by members of the Siberian Tiger Project weighed kg lb and the largest radio collared male weighed kg lb br The Siberian tiger is often considered to be the largest tiger br A wild male killed in Manchuria by the Sungari River in reportedly measured cm in over the curves with a tail length of about m ft in It weighed about kg lb Dubious sources mention weights of and kg and lb and even kg lb br br br Skull br The skull of the Siberian tiger is characterized by its large size The facial region is very powerful and very broad in the region of the canines The skull prominences especially in the sagittal crest and crista occipitalis are very high and strong in old males and often much more massive than usually observed in the biggest skulls of Bengal tigers The size variation in skulls of Siberian tigers ranges from to mm to in in nine individuals measured A female skull is always smaller and never as heavily built and robust as that of a male The height of the sagittal crest in its middle part reaches as much as mm in and in its posterior part up to mm in br Female skulls range from to mm to in The skulls of male Caspian tigers from Turkestan had a maximum length of to mm to in while that of females measured to mm to in A tiger killed on the Sumbar River in Kopet Dag in January had a greatest skull length of mm in which is considerably more than the known maximum for this population and slightly exceeds that of most Siberian tigers However its condylobasal length was only mm in smaller than those of the Siberian tigers with a maximum recorded condylobasal length of mm in The biggest skull of a Siberian tiger from northeast China measured mm in in length which is about mm in more than the maximum skull lengths of tigers from the Amur region and northern India with the exception of a skull of a northern Indian tiger from the vicinity of Nagina which measured mm in over the bone br br br Fur and coat br br The ground colour of Siberian tigers pelage is often very pale especially in winter coat However variations within populations may be considerable Individual variation is also found in form length and partly in colour of the dark stripes which have been described as being dark brown rather than black br The fur of the Siberian tiger is moderately thick coarse and sparse compared to that of other felids living in the former Soviet Union Compared to the extinct westernmost populations the Siberian tiger s summer and winter coats contrast sharply with other subspecies Generally the coat of western populations was brighter and more uniform than that of the Far Eastern populations The summer coat is coarse while the winter coat is denser longer softer and silkier The winter fur often appears quite shaggy on the trunk and is markedly longer on the head almost covering the ears Siberian and Caspian tigers had the thickest fur amongst tigers br The whiskers and hair on the back of the head and the top of the neck are also greatly elongated The background colour of the winter coat is generally less bright and rusty compared to that of the summer coat Because of the winter fur s greater length the stripes appear broader with less defined outlines The summer fur on the back is mm in long mm in along the top of the neck mm in on the abdomen and mm in on the tail The winter fur on the back is mm in mm in on the top of the neck mm in on the throat mm in on the chest and mm in on the abdomen The whiskers are mm in br br br Distribution and habitat br br The Siberian tiger once inhabited much of the Korean Peninsula Manchuria and other parts of north eastern China the eastern part of Siberia and the Russian Far East perhaps as far west as Mongolia and the area of Lake Baikal where the Caspian tiger also reportedly occurred br During the late Pleistocene and Holocene it was likely connected to the South China tiger population through corridors in the Yellow River basin before humans interrupted gene flow br Today its range stretches south to north for almost km mi the length of Primorsky Krai and into southern Khabarovsk Krai east and south of the Amur River It also occurs within the Greater Xing an Range which crosses into Russia from China at several places in southwest Primorye This region represents a merger zone of the East Asian temperate broadleaf and mixed forest and the taiga resulting in a mosaic of forest types that vary in elevation and topography Key habitats of the Siberian tiger are Korean pine forests with a complex composition and structure br The faunal complex of the region is represented by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms The ungulate complex is represented by seven species with Manchurian wapiti Siberian roe deer and wild boar being the most common throughout the Sikhote Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce fir forests Sika deer are restricted to the southern half of the Sikhote Alin mountains Siberian musk deer and Amur moose are associated with the conifer forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote Alin mountains br In the number of Amur tigers in China was estimated at and in the Russian Far East comprising a breeding adult population of about fewer than likely to be sub adults more than likely to be less than years of age More than of the population occurred in the Sikhote Alin mountain region An unknown number of tigers survive in the reserve areas around Baekdu Mountain on the border between China and North Korea based on tracks and sightings br In August a Siberian tiger with four cubs was recorded for the first time in northeastern China s Hunchun National Nature Reserve located in the vicinity of the international borders with Russia and North Korea Camera trap surveys carried out in the spring seasons of and revealed between and tigers along the China Russian border br In April World Wide Fund for Nature personnel captured a video of a tigress with cubs in inland China br The tiger population in the Changbai Mountains dispersed westwards between and br Camera trap surveys between and revealed about Siberian tigers in four forested landscapes in northeastern China Laoyeling Zhangguangcai Range Wandashan and Lesser Khingan Mountains Feces urine and hair was used to genetically identify tigers in this region However only Laoyeling is thought to support a breeding population br br br Ecology and behavior br br Siberian tigers are known to travel up to km mi over ecologically unbroken country In and the maximum total population density of the Sikhote Alin tiger population was estimated at tigers in km sq mi The maximum adult population estimated in reached tigers in km sq mi with a sex ratio of averaging females per male These density values were much lower than what had been reported for other subspecies at the time br In dramatic changes in land tenure population density and reproductive output in the core area of the Sikhote Alin Zapovednik Siberian Tiger Project were detected suggesting that when tigers are well protected from human induced mortality for long periods the adult female population density increases significantly When more adult females survived the mothers shared their home ranges with their daughters once the daughters reached maturity By population density of tigers was estimated at tigers in km sq mi in the southern part of Sikhote Alin Zapovednik and tigers in km sq mi in the central part of the protected area br Siberian tigers share habitat with Amur leopards P pardus orientalis but in the Changbai Mountains have been recorded more often in lower elevations than leopards br br br Hunting and diet br br Prey species of the tiger include ungulates such as Manchurian wapiti Cervus canadensis xanthopygus Siberian musk deer Moschus moschiferus long tailed goral Naemorhedus caudatus moose Alces alces Siberian roe deer Capreolus pygargus and sika deer Cervus nippon wild boar Sus scrofa and even sometimes small size Asiatic black bears Ursus thibetanus and brown bears Ursus arctos Siberian tigers also take smaller prey like hares rabbits pikas and even salmon Scat was collected along the international border between Russia and China between November and April scat samples of nine tigers contained foremost remains of wild boar sika deer and roe deer br Between January and November tigers were captured fitted with radio collars and monitored for more than months in the eastern slopes of the Sikhote Alin mountain range Results of this study indicate that their distribution is closely associated with distribution of Manchurian wapiti while distribution of wild boar was not such a strong predictor for tiger distribution Although they prey on both Siberian roe deer and sika deer overlap of these ungulates with tigers was low Distribution of moose was poorly associated with tiger distribution The distribution of preferred habitat of key prey species was an accurate predictor of tiger distribution br Results of a three year study on Siberian tigers indicate that the mean interval between their kills and estimated prey consumption varied across seasons during to three adult tigers killed prey every days in summer and consumed a daily average of kg lb in winter they killed more large bodied prey made kills every days and consumed a daily average of kg lb br br br Interspecific predatory relationships br br Following a decrease of ungulate populations from to cases of Amur tigers attacking both Ussuri brown Ursus arctos lasiotus and Ussuri black bears U thibetanus ussuricus were recorded in the Russian Far East and hair of bears were found in several tiger scat samples Tigers attack black bears less often than brown bears as the latter live in more open habitats and are not able to climb trees In the same time period four cases of brown bears killing female tigers and young cubs were reported both in disputes over prey and in self defense Tigers mainly feed on the bear s fat deposits such as the back hams and groin br When Amur tigers prey on brown bears they usually target young and sub adult bears besides small female adults taken outside their dens generally when lethargic from hibernation Predation by tigers on denned brown bears was not detected during a study carried between and Ussuri brown bears along with the smaller black bears constitute of the Siberian tiger s annual diet of which are brown bears br The effect the presence of tigers has on brown bear behavior seems to vary In the winters of Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded two cases of bears showing no fear of tigers and another case of a brown bear changing path upon crossing tiger tracks Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tiger kills and to potentially prey on tigers Despite the threat of predation some brown bears actually benefit from the presence of tigers by appropriating tiger kills that the bears may not be able to successfully hunt themselves Brown bears generally prefer to contest the much smaller female tigers During telemetry research in the Sikhote Alin Nature Reserve direct confrontations between bears and tigers were observed in which bears in general were killed in cases and tigers in cases There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting Amur leopards and tigers to abstract their prey In the Sikhote Alin reserve of tiger kills were stolen by bears with tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the kill for the bear Some studies show that bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger A report from describes twelve known cases of brown bears killing tigers including adult males in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears br The relationship between the Amur tiger and the Himalayan bear is not specifically studied Numerous publications on these species there are mainly episodic and survey data on this issue are collected by different authors in selected areas which do not give a complete picture of the nature br Tigers depress wolf Canis lupus numbers either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a functionally insignificant component of the ecosystem Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human pressure decreases tiger numbers In areas where wolves and tigers share ranges the two species typically display a great deal of dietary overlap resulting in intense competition Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in Sikhote Alin where until the beginning of the th century very few wolves were sighted Wolf numbers may have increased in the region after tigers were largely eliminated during the Russian colonisation in the late th century and early th century This is corroborated by native inhabitants of the region claiming that they had no memory of wolves inhabiting Sikhote Alin until the s when tiger numbers decreased Today wolves are considered scarce in tiger habitat being found in scattered pockets and usually seen travelling as loners or in small groups First hand accounts on interactions between the two species indicate that tigers occasionally chase wolves from their kills while wolves will scavenge from tiger kills Tigers are not known to prey on wolves though there are four records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them Tigers recently released are also said to hunt wolves br This competitive exclusion of wolves by tigers has been used by Russian conservationists to convince hunters in the Far East to tolerate the big cats as they limit ungulate populations less than wolves and are effective in controlling wolf numbers br Siberian tigers also compete with the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx and occasionally kill and eat them Eurasian lynx remains have been found in the stomach contents of Siberian tigers in Russia In March a dead lynx discovered in Bastak Nature Reserve bore evidence of predation by a Siberian tiger The tiger apparently ambushed pursued and killed the lynx but only consumed it partially This incident marks one of the first documented cases of a tiger preying on a lynx and indicates that the tiger might have been more intent on eliminating a competitor than on catching prey br br br Reproduction and life cycle br br Siberian tigers mate at any time of the year A female signals her receptiveness by leaving urine deposits and scratch marks on trees She will spend or days with the male during which she is receptive for three days Gestation lasts from to months Litter size is normally two or four cubs but there can be as many as six The cubs are born blind in a sheltered den and are left alone when the female leaves to hunt for food Cubs are divided equally between sexes at birth However by adulthood there are usually two to four females for every male The female cubs remain with their mothers longer and later they establish territories close to their original ranges Males on the other hand travel unaccompanied and range farther earlier in their lives making them more vulnerable to poachers and other tigers br A Siberian tiger family comprising an adult male a female and three cubs were recorded in br At months of age tigers are sub adults Males reach sexual maturity at the age of to months br The average lifespan for Siberian tigers ranges from years Wild individuals tend to live between years while in captivity individuals may live up to years br br br Threats br Results of genetic analysis of wild Siberian tiger samples from Russia revealed that genetic diversity is low only individuals contributed to their genes Further exacerbating the problem is that more than of the population occurred in the Sikhote Alin mountain region Tigers rarely move across the development corridor which separates this sub population from the much smaller sub population in southwest Primorye province br The winter of was marked by heavy poaching Poaching of tigers and their wild prey species is considered to be driving the decline although heavy snows in the winter of could have biased the data In northern China s Huang Ni He National Nature Reserve poachers set up foremost snare traps but there is not sufficient personnel to patrol this km sq mi area throughout the year In Hunchun National Nature Reserve poaching of ungulate species impedes recovery of the tiger population br br br In the past br After the dissolution of the Soviet Union illegal deforestation and bribery of park rangers facilitated poaching of Siberian tigers Local hunters had access to a formerly sealed off lucrative Chinese market and this once again put the region s tiger population at risk of extinction While improvement in the local economy has led to greater resources being invested in conservation efforts an increase in economic activity has led to an increased rate of development and deforestation The major obstacle in preserving the tiger is the enormous territory individual tigers require up to km sq mi is needed by a single female and more for a single male br The Siberian tiger was once common in the Korean Peninsula It was eradicated during the period of Korea under Japanese rule between and br br br Conservation br Tigers are included on CITES Appendix I banning international trade All tiger range states and countries with consumer markets have banned domestic trade as well At the th Conference of the Parties to CITES in stronger enforcement measures were called for as well as an end to tiger farming br In the Siberian Tiger Project was founded with the aim of providing a comprehensive picture of the ecology of the Amur tiger and the role of tigers in the Russian Far East through scientific studies By capturing and outfitting tigers with radio collars their social structure land use patterns food habits reproduction mortality patterns and their relation with other inhabitants of the ecosystem including humans is studied These data compilations will hopefully contribute toward minimizing poaching threats because of traditional hunting The Siberian Tiger Project has been productive in increasing local capacity to address human tiger conflict with a Tiger Response Team part of the Russian government s Inspection Tiger which responds to all tiger human conflicts by continuing to enhance the large database on tiger ecology and conservation with the goal of creating a comprehensive Siberian tiger conservation plan and training the next generation of Russian conservation biologists br br In August China and Russia agreed to enhance conservation and cooperation in protected areas in a transboundary area for Amur tigers China has undertaken a series of public awareness campaigns including celebration of the first Global Tiger Day in July and International Forum on Tiger Conservation and Tiger Culture and China Hunchun Amur Tiger Culture Festival in August br br br Reintroduction br br Inspired by findings that the Amur tiger is the closest relative of the Caspian tiger there has been discussion whether the Amur tiger could be an appropriate subspecies for reintroduction into a safe place in Central Asia The Amu Darya Delta was suggested as a potential site for such a project A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers A viable tiger population of about animals would require at least km sq mi of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations Such habitat is not presently available in the delta and so cannot be provided in the short term The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction at least at this stage of development br br A second possible introduction site in Kazakhstan is the Ili River delta at the southern edge of Lake Balkhash The delta is situated between the Saryesik Atyrau Desert and the Taukum Desert and forms a large wetland of about km sq mi Until the delta was a refuge of the extinct Caspian tiger Reintroduction of the Siberian tiger to the delta has been proposed Large populations of wild boar inhabit the swamps of the delta The reintroduction of the Bukhara deer which was once an important prey is under consideration The Ili delta is therefore considered as a suitable site for introduction br In Russia exchanged two captive Siberian tigers for Persian leopards with the Iranian government as conservation groups of both countries agreed on reintroducing these animals into the wild within the next five years This issue is controversial since only of such releases have been successful In addition the Siberian tiger is not genetically identical to the Caspian tiger Another difference is the climatic with temperatures higher in Iran than in Siberia Introducing exotic species into a new habitat could inflict irreversible and unknown damage In December one of the tigers exchanged died in Eram Zoo in Tehran Nevertheless the project has its defenders and Iran has successfully reintroduced the Persian onager and Caspian red deer br In re introduction was planned as part of the rewilding project at Pleistocene Park in the Kolyma River basin in northern Yakutia Russia provided the herbivore population has reached a size warranting the introduction of large predators br br br In captivity br br In recent years captive breeding of tigers in China has accelerated to the point where the captive population of several tiger subspecies exceeds animals Three thousand specimens are reportedly held by significant facilities with the remainder scattered among some facilities This makes China home to the second largest captive tiger population in the world after the U S which in had an estimated captive tigers In a census conducted by the U S based Feline Conservation Federation tigers were documented as residing in American facilities br In the Chinese government established the world s largest Siberian tiger breeding base the Harbin Siberian Tiger Park and was meant to build a Siberian tiger gene pool to ensure the genetic diversity of the tiger The Park and its existing tiger population would be further divided into two parts one as the protective species for genetic management and the other as the ornamental species It was discovered that when the Heilongjiang Northeast Tiger Forest Park was founded it had only tigers but according to the current breeding rate of tigers at the park the worldwide number of wild Siberian tigers will break through in late South Korea expected to receive three tigers pledged for donation in by Russia in br br br Attacks on humans br br The Siberian tiger very rarely becomes a man eater Numerous cases of attacks on humans were recorded in the th century occurring usually in central Asia excluding Turkmenistan Kazakhstan and the Far East Tigers were historically rarely considered dangerous unless provoked though in the lower reaches of the Syr Darya a tiger reportedly killed a woman collecting firewood and an unarmed military officer whilst passing through reed thickets Attacks on shepherds were recorded in the lower reaches of Ili In the Far East during the middle and late th century attacks on people were recorded In on the Tsymukha River tigers killed men and injured others In China s Jilin Province tigers reportedly attacked woodsmen and coachmen and occasionally entered cabins and dragged out both adults and children br br According to the Japanese Police Bureau in Korea in a tiger killed one human whereas leopards killed three wild boars four and wolves killed Six cases were recorded in th century Russia of unprovoked attacks leading to man eating behaviour Provoked attacks are however more common usually the result of botched attempts at capturing them In December an injured Amur tiger attacked killed and consumed two people Both attacks occurred in the Bikin River valley The anti poaching task force Inspection Tiger investigated both deaths tracked down and killed the tiger br In January a man was attacked by a tiger on a remote mountain road near Hunchun in Jilin province China near the borders of Russia and North Korea He suffered compound fractures but managed to survive When he sought medical attention his story raised suspicions as Siberian tigers seldom attack humans An investigation of the attack scene revealed that raw venison carried by the man was left untouched by the tiger Officials suspected the man to be a poacher who provoked the attack The following morning tiger sightings were reported by locals along the same road and a local TV station did an on site coverage The group found tiger tracks and blood spoor in the snow at the attack scene and followed them for approximately meters hoping to catch a glimpse of the animal Soon the tiger was seen ambling slowly ahead of them As the team tried to get closer for a better camera view the tiger suddenly turned and charged causing the four to flee in panic About an hour after that encounter the tiger attacked and killed a year old woman on the same road Authorities retrieved the body with the help of a bulldozer By then the tiger was found lying meters away weak and barely alive It was successfully tranquilized and taken for examination which revealed that the tiger was anemic and gravely injured by a poacher s snare around its neck with the steel wire cutting deeply down to the vertebrae severing both trachea and esophagus Despite extensive surgery by a team of veterinarians the tiger died of wound infection Subsequent investigation revealed that the first victim was a poacher who set multiple snares that caught both the tiger and a deer The man was later charged for poaching and harming endangered species He served two years in prison After being released from prison he worked in clearing the forest of old snares br In an incident at the San Francisco Zoo in December a tiger escaped and killed a visitor and injured two others The animal was shot by the police The zoo was widely criticized for maintaining only a ft m fence around the tiger enclosure while the international standard is ft m The zoo subsequently erected a taller barrier topped by an electric fence One of the victims admitted to taunting the animal br Zookeepers in Anhui province and the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen were attacked and killed in In January a tiger attacked and killed a tour bus driver at a breeding park in Heilongjiang province Park officials reported that the bus driver violated safety guidelines by leaving the vehicle to check on the condition of the bus In September a tiger mauled a zookeeper to death at a zoo in western Germany after the worker forgot to lock a cage door during feeding time In July a female tiger attacked and killed a year old zookeeper at the Z rich Zoo in Switzerland br br br In culture br br The English name Siberian tiger was coined by James Cowles Prichard in the s The name Amur tiger was used in for Siberian tigers killed by the Amur River for an exhibition in the American Museum of Natural History br The Tungusic peoples considered the tiger a near deity and often referred to it as Grandfather or Old man The Udege and Nani people call it Amba The Manchu considered the Siberian tiger as Hu Lin the king Since the tiger has a mark on its foreheads that looks like a Chinese character for King Chinese pinyin W ng or a similar character meaning Great Emperor it is revered by the Udege and Chinese people
