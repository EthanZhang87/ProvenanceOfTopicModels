Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus NEER oh born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus December AD June AD was a Roman emperor and the final emperor of the Julio Claudian dynasty reigning from AD until his death in AD br Nero was born at Antium in AD the son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger great granddaughter of the emperor Augustus Nero was three when his father died By the time Nero turned eleven his mother married Emperor Claudius who then adopted Nero as his heir Upon Claudius death in AD Nero ascended to the throne with the backing of the Praetorian Guard and the Senate In the early years of his reign Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina his tutor Seneca the Younger and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus but sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences The power struggle between Nero and his mother reached its climax when he orchestrated her murder Roman sources also implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina and his stepbrother Britannicus br Nero s practical contributions to Rome s governance focused on diplomacy trade and culture He ordered the construction of amphitheaters and promoted athletic games and contests He made public appearances as an actor poet musician and charioteer which scandalized his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves public entertainers and infamous persons However the provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower class citizens The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy br During Nero s reign the general Corbulo fought the Roman Parthian War of and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire and the First Jewish Roman War began When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia He fled Rome and on June AD committed suicide His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors br Most Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical self indulgent and debauched The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned Golden House Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive seemingly motivated not by public justice but personal cruelty Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Nero s tyrannical acts considering his popularity among the Roman commoners In the eastern provinces of the Empire a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return After his death at least three leaders of short lived failed rebellions presented themselves as Nero reborn to gain popular support br br br Early life br Nero was born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus on December AD in Antium modern Anzio eight months after the death of Tiberius He was an only child the son of the politician Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger His mother Agrippina was the sister of the third Roman emperor Caligula Nero was also the great great grandson of former emperor Augustus descended from Augustus only daughter Julia br br The ancient biographer Suetonius who was critical of Nero s ancestors wrote that emperor Augustus had reproached Nero s grandfather for his unseemly enjoyment of violent gladiator games According to J rgen Malitz Suetonius tells that Nero s father was known to be irascible and brutal and that both enjoyed chariot races and theater performances to a degree not befitting their position Suetonius also mentions that when Nero s father Domitius was congratulated by his friends for the birth of his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger br Domitius died in AD A few years before his father s death his father was involved in a serious political scandal His mother and his two surviving sisters Agrippina and Julia Livilla were exiled to a remote island in the Mediterranean Sea His mother was said to have been exiled for plotting to overthrow the emperor Caligula Nero s inheritance was taken from him and he was sent to live with his paternal aunt Domitia Lepida the mother of later emperor Claudius s third wife Messalina br After Caligula s death Claudius became the new emperor Nero s mother married Claudius in AD becoming his fourth wife On February AD Claudius was pressured to adopt Nero as his son giving him the new name of Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus Claudius had gold coins issued to mark the adoption Classics professor Josiah Osgood has written that the coins through their distribution and imagery alike showed that a new Leader was in the making However David Shotter noted that despite events in Rome Nero s step brother Britannicus was more prominent in provincial coinages during the early s br br Nero formally entered public life as an adult in AD while years old When he turned Nero married Claudius daughter his step sister Claudia Octavia Between the years AD and AD he gave several speeches on behalf of various communities including the Ilians the Apameans requesting a five year tax reprieve after an earthquake and the northern colony of Bologna after their settlement had suffered a devastating fire br Claudius died in AD many ancient historians claim that he was poisoned by Agrippina Shotter has written that Claudius death has usually been regarded as an event hastened by Agrippina due to signs that Claudius was showing a renewed affection for his natural son He notes that among ancient sources the Roman historian Josephus was uniquely reserved in describing the poisoning as a rumor Contemporary sources differ in their accounts of the poisoning Tacitus says that the poison maker Locusta prepared the toxin which was served to the Emperor by his servant Halotus Tacitus also writes that Agrippina arranged for Claudius doctor Xenophon to administer poison in the event that the Emperor survived Suetonius differs in some details but also implicates Halotus and Agrippina Like Tacitus Cassius Dio writes that the poison was prepared by Locusta but in Dio s account it is administered by Agrippina instead of Halotus In Apocolocyntosis Seneca the Younger does not mention mushrooms at all Agrippina s involvement in Claudius death is not accepted by all modern scholars br Before Claudius death Agrippina had maneuvered to remove Claudius sons tutors in order to replace them with tutors that she had selected She was also able to convince Claudius to replace two prefects of the Praetorian Guard who were suspected of supporting Claudius son with Afranius Burrus Nero s future guide Since Agrippina had replaced the guard officers with men loyal to her Nero was subsequently able to assume power without incident br br br Reign AD br The main ancient Roman literary sources for Nero s reign are Tacitus Suetonius and Cassius Dio They found Nero s construction projects overly extravagant and claim that their cost left Italy thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money with the provinces ruined Modern historians note that the period was riddled with deflation and that Nero intended his spending on public work and charities to ease economic troubles br br br Early reign br br Nero became emperor in AD aged His tutor Seneca prepared Nero s first speech before the Senate During this speech Nero spoke about eliminating the ills of the previous regime H H Scullard writes that he promised to follow the Augustan model in his principate to end all secret trials intra cubiculum to have done with the corruption of court favorites and freedmen and above all to respect the privileges of the Senate and individual Senators His respect for Senatorial autonomy which distinguished him from Caligula and Claudius was generally well received by the Roman Senate br Scullard writes that Nero s mother Agrippina meant to rule through her son Agrippina murdered her political rivals Domitia Lepida the Younger the aunt that Nero had lived with during Agrippina s exile Marcus Junius Silanus a great grandson of Augustus and Narcissus One of the earliest coins that Nero issued during his reign shows Agrippina on the coin s obverse side usually this would be reserved for a portrait of the emperor The Senate also allowed Agrippina two lictors during public appearances an honor that was customarily bestowed upon only magistrates and the Vestalis Maxima In AD Nero removed Agrippina s ally Marcus Antonius Pallas from his position in the treasury Shotter writes the following about Agrippina s deteriorating relationship with Nero What Seneca and Burrus probably saw as relatively harmless in Nero his cultural pursuits and his affair with the slave girl Claudia Acte were to her signs of her son s dangerous emancipation of himself from her influence Britannicus was poisoned after Agrippina threatened to side with him Nero who was having an affair with Acte exiled Agrippina from the palace when she began to cultivate a relationship with his wife Octavia br br J rgen Malitz writes that ancient sources do not provide any clear evidence to evaluate the extent of Nero s personal involvement in politics during the first years of his reign He describes the policies that are explicitly attributed to Nero as well meant but incompetent notions like Nero s failed initiative to abolish all taxes in AD Scholars generally credit Nero s advisors Burrus and Seneca with the administrative successes of these years Malitz writes that in later years Nero panicked when he had to make decisions on his own during times of crisis br Nevertheless his early administration ruled to great acclaim A generation later those years were seen in retrospect as an exemplar of good and moderate government and described as Quinquennium Neronis by Trajan Especially well received were fiscal reforms which among others put tax collectors under more strict control by establishing local offices to supervise their activities After the affair of Lucius Pedanius Secundus who was murdered by a desperate slave Nero allowed slaves to file complaints about their treatment to the authorities br br br Residences br Outside of Rome Nero had several villas or palaces built the ruins of which can still be seen today These included the Villa of Nero at Antium his place of birth where he razed the villa on the site to rebuild it on a more massive and imperial scale and including a theatre At Subiaco Lazio near Rome he had artificial lakes built with waterfalls bridges and walkways for the luxurious villa He stayed at the Villa of Nero at Olympia Greece during his participation at the Olympic Games of AD br br br Matricide br The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome cautiously notes that Nero s reasons for killing his mother in AD are not fully understood According to Tacitus the source of conflict between Nero and his mother was Nero s affair with Poppaea Sabina In Histories Tacitus writes that the affair began while Poppaea was still married to Rufrius Crispinus but in his later work Annals Tacitus says Poppaea was married to Otho when the affair began In Annals Tacitus writes that Agrippina opposed Nero s affair with Poppaea because of her affection for his wife Octavia Anthony A Barrett writes that Tacitus account in Annals suggests that Poppaea s challenge drove Nero over the brink A number of modern historians have noted that Agrippina s death would not have offered much advantage for Poppaea as Nero did not marry Poppaea until AD Barrett writes that Poppaea seems to serve as a literary device utilized by Tacitus because he could see no plausible explanation for Nero s conduct and also incidentally served to show that Nero like Claudius had fallen under the malign influence of a woman According to Suetonius Nero had his former freedman Anicetus arrange a shipwreck Agrippina survived the wreck swam ashore and was executed by Anicetus who reported her death as a suicide br br br Decline br Modern scholars believe that Nero s reign had been going well in the years before Agrippina s death For example Nero promoted the exploration of the Nile river sources with a successful expedition After Agrippina s exile Burrus and Seneca were responsible for the administration of the Empire However Nero s conduct became far more egregious after his mother s death Miriam T Griffins suggests that Nero s decline began as early as AD with the murder of his stepbrother Britannicus but also notes that Nero lost all sense of right and wrong and listened to flattery with total credulity after Agrippina s death Griffin points out that Tacitus makes explicit the significance of Agrippina s removal for Nero s conduct br He began to build a new palace the Domus Transitoria from about AD It was intended to connect all of the imperial estates that had been acquired in various ways with the Palatine including the Gardens of Maecenas Horti Lamiani Horti Lolliani etc br In AD Nero s adviser Burrus died That same year Nero called for the first treason trial of his reign maiestas trial against Antistius Sosianus He also executed his rivals Cornelius Sulla and Rubellius Plautus J rgen Malitz considers this to be a turning point in Nero s relationship with the Roman Senate Malitz writes that Nero abandoned the restraint he had previously shown because he believed a course supporting the Senate promised to be less and less profitable br After Burrus death Nero appointed two new Praetorian prefects Faenius Rufus and Ofonius Tigellinus Politically isolated Seneca was forced to retire According to Tacitus Nero divorced Octavia on grounds of infertility and banished her After public protests over Octavia s exile Nero accused her of adultery with Anicetus and she was executed br In AD during the Saturnalia Nero married Pythagoras a freedman br br br Great Fire of Rome br br The Great Fire of Rome began on the night of to July probably in one of the merchant shops on the slope of the Aventine overlooking the Circus Maximus or in the wooden outer seating of the Circus itself Rome had always been vulnerable to fires and this one was fanned to catastrophic proportions by the winds Tacitus Cassius Dio and modern archaeology describe the destruction of mansions ordinary residences public buildings and temples on the Aventine Palatine and Caelian hills The fire burned for over seven days before subsiding it then started again and burned for three more It destroyed three of Rome s districts and severely damaged seven more br Some Romans thought the fire an accident as the merchant shops were timber framed and sold flammable goods and the outer seating stands of the Circus were timber built Others claimed it was arson committed on Nero s behalf The accounts by Pliny the Elder Suetonius and Cassius Dio suggest several possible reasons for Nero s alleged arson including his creation of a real life backdrop to a theatrical performance about the burning of Troy Suetonius wrote that Nero started the fire to clear the site for his planned palatial Golden House This would include lush artificial landscapes and a meter tall statue of himself the Colossus of Nero sited more or less where the Colosseum would eventually be built Suetonius and Cassius Dio claim that Nero sang the Sack of Ilium in stage costume while the city burned The popular legend that Nero played the lyre while Rome burned is at least partly a literary construct of Flavian propaganda which looked askance on the abortive Neronian attempt to rewrite Augustan models of rule br Tacitus suspends judgment on Nero s responsibility for the fire he found that Nero was in Antium when the fire started and returned to Rome to organize a relief effort providing for the removal of bodies and debris which he paid for from his own funds After the fire Nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors br Tacitus writes that to remove suspicion from himself Nero accused Christians of starting the fire According to this account many Christians were arrested and brutally executed by being thrown to the beasts crucified and being burned alive Tacitus asserts that in his imposition of such ferocious punishments Nero was not motivated by a sense of justice but by a penchant for personal cruelty br Houses built after the fire were spaced out built in brick and faced by porticos on wide roads Nero also built himself a new palace complex known as the Domus Aurea in an area cleared by the fire The cost to rebuild Rome was immense requiring funds the state treasury did not have To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction Nero s government increased taxation Particularly heavy tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire To meet at least a portion of the costs Nero devalued the Roman currency increasing inflationary pressure for the first time in the Empire s history br br br Later years br In AD Gaius Calpurnius Piso a Roman statesman organized a conspiracy against Nero with the help of Subrius Flavus and Sulpicius Asper a tribune and a centurion of the Praetorian Guard According to Tacitus many conspirators wished to rescue the state from the emperor and restore the Republic The freedman Milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero s secretary Epaphroditus As a result the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including Lucan the poet Nero s previous advisor Seneca was accused by Natalis he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide as by this point he had fallen out of favor with Nero br Nero was said to have kicked Poppaea to death in AD before she could give birth to his second child Modern historians noting the probable biases of Suetonius Tacitus and Cassius Dio and the likely absence of eyewitnesses to such an event propose that Poppaea may have died after miscarriage or in childbirth Nero went into deep mourning Poppaea was given a sumptuous state funeral and divine honors and was promised a temple for her cult A year s importation of incense was burned at the funeral Her body was not cremated as would have been strictly customary but embalmed after the Egyptian manner and entombed it is not known where br In AD Nero married Sporus a young boy who is said to have greatly resembled Poppaea Nero had him castrated and married him with all the usual ceremonies including a dowry and a bridal veil It is believed that he did this out of regret for his killing of Poppaea br br br Revolt of Vindex and Galba and Nero s death br In March Gaius Julius Vindex the governor of Gallia Lugdunensis rebelled against Nero s tax policies Lucius Verginius Rufus the governor of Germania Superior was ordered to put down Vindex s rebellion In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province Vindex called upon Servius Sulpicius Galba the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis to join the rebellion and to declare himself emperor in opposition to Nero br br At the Battle of Vesontio in May Verginius forces easily defeated those of Vindex and the latter committed suicide However after defeating the rebel Verginius legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor Verginius refused to act against Nero but the discontent of the legions of Germania and the continued opposition of Galba in Hispania did not bode well for him br While Nero had retained some control of the situation support for Galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy The prefect of the Praetorian Guard Gaius Nymphidius Sabinus also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support of Galba br In response Nero fled Rome with the intention of going to the port of Ostia and from there to take a fleet to one of the still loyal eastern provinces According to Suetonius Nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands responding with a line from Virgil s Aeneid Is it so dreadful a thing then to die Nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to Parthia throwing himself upon the mercy of Galba or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences and if he could not soften their hearts to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt Suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in Nero s writing desk but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the Forum br Nero returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace After sleeping he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left Dispatching messages to his friends palace chambers for them to come he received no answers Upon going to their chambers personally he found them all abandoned When he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him no one appeared He cried Have I neither friend nor foe and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber br br Returning Nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts An imperial freedman Phaon offered his villa located mi km outside the city Travelling in disguise Nero and four loyal freedmen Epaphroditus Phaon Neophytus and Sporus reached the villa where Nero ordered them to dig a grave for him At this time Nero learned that the Senate had declared him a public enemy Nero prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down muttering Qualis artifex pereo What an artist the world is losing Losing his nerve he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first At last the sound of approaching horsemen drove Nero to face the end However he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead forced his private secretary Epaphroditus to perform the task br When one of the horsemen entered and saw that Nero was dying he attempted to stop the bleeding but efforts to save Nero s life were unsuccessful Nero s final words were Too late This is fidelity He died on June the anniversary of the death of his first wife Claudia Octavia and was buried in the Mausoleum of the Domitii Ahenobarbi in what is now the Villa Borghese Pincian Hill area of Rome According to Sulpicius Severus it is unclear whether Nero took his own life br With his death the Julio Claudian dynasty ended Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four Emperors br br br After Nero br br According to Suetonius and Cassius Dio the people of Rome celebrated the death of Nero Tacitus though describes a more complicated political environment Tacitus mentions that Nero s death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class The lower class slaves frequenters of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of Nero on the other hand were upset with the news Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to Nero but had been bribed to overthrow him br Eastern sources namely Philostratus and Apollonius of Tyana mention that Nero s death was mourned as he restored the liberties of Hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them Modern scholarship generally holds that while the Senate and more well off individuals welcomed Nero s death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for Otho and Vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia br Nero s name was erased from some monuments in what Edward Champlin regards as an outburst of private zeal Many portraits of Nero were reworked to represent other figures according to Eric R Varner over such images survive This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously a practice known as damnatio memoriae Champlin doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of Nero long after his death Damaged portraits of Nero often with hammer blows directed to the face have been found in many provinces of the Roman Empire three recently having been identified from the United Kingdom br The civil war during the year of the Four Emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period According to Tacitus this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as Nero and those before him could Galba began his short reign with the execution of many of Nero s allies One such notable enemy included Nymphidius Sabinus who claimed to be the son of Emperor Caligula br Otho overthrew Galba Otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of Nero and resembled him somewhat in temperament It was said that the common Roman hailed Otho as Nero himself Otho used Nero as a surname and reerected many statues to Nero Vitellius overthrew Otho Vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for Nero complete with songs written by Nero br After Nero s death in AD there was a widespread belief especially in the eastern provinces that he was not dead and somehow would return This belief came to be known as the Nero Redivivus Legend The legend of Nero s return lasted for hundreds of years after Nero s death Augustine of Hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in AD br At least three Nero impostors emerged leading rebellions The first who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared in AD during the reign of Vitellius After persuading some to recognize him he was captured and executed Sometime during the reign of Titus another impostor appeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like Nero but he too was killed Twenty years after Nero s death during the reign of Domitian there was a third pretender He was supported by the Parthians who only reluctantly gave him up and the matter almost came to war br br br Military conflicts br br br Boudica s uprising br br In Britannia Britain in AD Prasutagus leader of the Iceni tribe and a client king of Rome during Claudius reign had died The client state arrangement was unlikely to survive following the death of Claudius The will of the Iceni tribal King Prasutagus leaving control of the Iceni to his daughters was denied When the Roman procurator Catus Decianus scourged Prasutagus wife Boudica and raped her daughters the Iceni revolted They were joined by the Celtic Trinovantes tribe and their uprising became the most significant provincial rebellion of the st century AD Under Queen Boudica the towns of Camulodunum Colchester Londinium London and Verulamium St Albans were burned and a substantial body of Roman legion infantry were eliminated The governor of the province Gaius Suetonius Paulinus assembled his remaining forces and defeated the Britons Although order was restored for some time Nero considered abandoning the province Julius Classicianus replaced the former procurator Catus Decianus and Classicianus advised Nero to replace Paulinus who continued to punish the population even after the rebellion was over Nero decided to adopt a more lenient approach by appointing a new governor Petronius Turpilianus br br br Peace with Parthia br br Nero began preparing for war in the early years of his reign after the Parthian king Vologeses set his brother Tiridates on the Armenian throne Around AD and AD Domitius Corbulo and his legions advanced on Tiridates and captured the Armenian capital Artaxata Tigranes was chosen to replace Tiridates on the Armenian throne When Tigranes attacked Adiabene Nero had to send further legions to defend Armenia and Syria from Parthia br The Roman victory came at a time when the Parthians were troubled by revolts when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the Armenian situation A Roman army under Paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both Roman and Parthian forces withdrew from Armenia it was under Parthian control The triumphal arch for Corbulo s earlier victory was part built when Parthian envoys arrived in AD to discuss treaties Given imperium over the eastern regions Corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this Parthian delegation An agreement was thereafter reached with the Parthians Rome would recognize Tiridates as king of Armenia only if he agreed to receive his diadem from Nero A coronation ceremony was held in Italy AD Dio reports that Tiridates said I have come to you my God worshiping you as Mithras Shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to Nero in the East including The New Apollo and The New Sun After the coronation friendly relations were established between Rome and the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Armenia Artaxata was temporarily renamed Neroneia br br br First Jewish War br br In there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension In Nero dispatched Vespasian to restore order This revolt was eventually put down in after Nero s death This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem br br br Pursuits br Nero studied poetry music painting and sculpture He both sang and played the cithara a type of lyre Many of these disciplines were standard education for the Roman elite but Nero s devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a Roman of his class Ancient sources were critical of Nero s emphasis on the arts chariot racing and athletics Pliny described Nero as an actor emperor scaenici imperatoris and Suetonius wrote that he was carried away by a craze for popularity since he was acclaimed as the equal of Apollo in music and of the Sun in driving a chariot he had planned to emulate the exploits of Hercules as well br In AD Nero participated in the Olympics He had bribed organizers to postpone the games for a year so he could participate and artistic competitions were added to the athletic events Nero won every contest in which he was a competitor During the games Nero sang and played his lyre on stage acted in tragedies and raced chariots He won a horse chariot race despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race He was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race After he died a year later his name was removed from the list of winners Champlin writes that though Nero s participation effectively stifled true competition Nero seems to have been oblivious of reality br Nero established the Neronian games in AD Modeled on Greek style games these games included musical gymnastic and equestrian contests According to Suetonius the gymnastic contests were held in the Saepta area of the Campus Martius br br br Historiography br br The history of Nero s reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with Nero These first histories while they still existed were described as biased and fantastical either overly critical or praising of Nero The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events Nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Nero written by the next generations of historians A few of the contemporary historians are known by name Fabius Rusticus Cluvius Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories on Nero that are now lost There were also pro Nero histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds Nero was praised br The bulk of what is known of Nero comes from Tacitus Suetonius and Cassius Dio who were all of the upper classes Tacitus and Suetonius wrote their histories on Nero over years after his death while Cassius Dio wrote his history over years after Nero s death These sources contradict one another on a number of events in Nero s life including the death of Claudius the death of Agrippina and the Roman fire of AD but they are consistent in their condemnation of Nero br br Cassius Dio br Cassius Dio c was the son of Cassius Apronianus a Roman senator He passed the greater part of his life in public service He was a senator under Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus and afterwards suffect consul around and also proconsul in Africa and Pannonia br Books of Dio s Roman History describe the reign of Nero Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John Xiphilinus an th century monk br br Dio Chrysostom br Dio Chrysostom c a Greek philosopher and historian wrote the Roman people were very happy with Nero and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely They longed for his rule once he was gone and embraced imposters when they appeared br br Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive And the great majority do believe that he still is although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive br Epictetus br Epictetus c was the slave to Nero s scribe Epaphroditos He makes a few passing negative comments on Nero s character in his work but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule He describes Nero as a spoiled angry and unhappy man br br Josephus br The historian Josephus c while calling Nero a tyrant was also the first to mention bias against Nero Of other historians he said br br But I omit any further discourse about these affairs for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour as having received benefits from him while others out of hatred to him and the great ill will which they bore him have so impudently raved against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred since those writers lived a long time after them br Lucan br Although more of a poet than a historian Lucanus c has one of the kindest accounts of Nero s rule He writes of peace and prosperity under Nero in contrast to previous war and strife Ironically he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow Nero and was executed br br Philostratus br Philostratus II the Athenian c spoke of Nero in the Life of Apollonius Tyana Books Although he has a generally bad or dim view of Nero he speaks of others positive reception of Nero in the East br br Pliny the Elder br The history of Nero by Pliny the Elder c did not survive Still there are several references to Nero in Pliny s Natural Histories Pliny has one of the worst opinions of Nero and calls him an enemy of mankind br br Plutarch br Plutarch c mentions Nero indirectly in his account of the Life of Galba and the Life of Otho as well as in the Vision of Thespesius in Book of the Moralia where a voice orders that Nero s soul be transferred to a more offensive species Nero is portrayed as a tyrant but those that replace him are not described as better br br Seneca the Younger br It is not surprising that Seneca c BC AD Nero s teacher and advisor writes very well of Nero br br Suetonius br br Suetonius c was a member of the equestrian order and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence While in this position Suetonius started writing biographies of the emperors accentuating the anecdotal and sensational aspects By this account Nero raped the vestal virgin Rubria br br Tacitus br br The Annals by Tacitus c is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of Nero despite being incomplete after the year AD Tacitus described the rule of the Julio Claudian emperors as generally unjust He also thought that existing writing on them was unbalanced br br The histories of Tiberius Caius Claudius and Nero while they were in power were falsified through terror and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred br Tacitus was the son of a procurator who married into the elite family of Agricola He entered his political life as a senator after Nero s death and by Tacitus own admission owed much to Nero s rivals Realising that this bias may be apparent to others Tacitus protests that his writing is true br br Girolamo Cardano br In Girolamo Cardano published in Basel his Encomium Neronis which was one of the first historical references of the modern era to portray Nero in a positive light br br br In Jewish and Christian tradition br br br Jewish tradition br An Aggadah in the Talmud says that at the end of AD conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea According to the Talmud during the Great Jewish Revolt Nero went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions All the arrows landed in the city He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day The child responded I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel Ezekiel Nero became terrified believing that God wanted the Second Temple to be destroyed but that he would punish the one to carry it out Nero said He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such retribution Vespasian was then dispatched to put down the rebellion br The Talmud adds that the sage Reb Meir Baal HaNess lived in the time of the Mishnah and was a prominent supporter of the Bar Kokhba rebellion against Roman rule Rabbi Meir was considered one of the greatest of the Tannaim of the third generation According to the Talmud he was a descendant of Nero who had converted to Judaism His wife Bruriah is one of the few women cited in the Gemara He is the third most frequently mentioned sage in the Mishnah br The Talmudic legend about Nero is not supported by contemporary sources Roman and Greek sources nowhere report Nero s alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism There is also no record of Nero having any offspring who survived infancy his only recorded child Claudia Augusta died aged months br br br Christian tradition br br Tacitus describes Nero extensively torturing and executing Christians after the fire of AD Suetonius also mentions Nero punishing Christians though he does so because they are given to a new and mischievous superstition and does not connect it with the fire br Christian writer Tertullian c was the first to call Nero the first persecutor of Christians He wrote Examine your records There you will find that Nero was the first that persecuted this doctrine Lactantius c also said that Nero first persecuted the servants of God as did Sulpicius Severus However Suetonius writes that since the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus the emperor Claudius expelled them from Rome Iudaeos impulsore Chresto assidue tumultuantis Roma expulit These expelled Jews may have been early Christians although Suetonius is not explicit Nor is the Bible explicit calling Aquila of Pontus and his wife Priscilla both expelled from Italy at the time Jews Acts br br br Martyrdoms of Peter and Paul br The first text to suggest that Nero ordered the execution of an apostle is a letter by Clement to the Corinthians traditionally dated to around AD The apocryphal Ascension of Isaiah a Christian writing from the nd century says the slayer of his mother who himself even this king will persecute the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands this is interpreted as referring to Nero br Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea c was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded and Peter crucified in Rome during the reign of Nero He states that Nero s persecution led to Peter and Paul s deaths but that Nero did not give any specific orders However several other accounts going back to the first century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to Hispania before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death br Peter is first said to have been crucified specifically upside down in Rome during Nero s reign but not by Nero in the apocryphal Acts of Peter c The account ends with Paul still alive and Nero abiding by God s command not to persecute any more Christians br By the fourth century a number of writers were stating that Nero killed Peter and Paul br br br Antichrist br br The Sibylline Oracles Book and written in the second century speak of Nero returning and bringing destruction Within Christian communities these writings along with others fueled the belief that Nero would return as the Antichrist In Lactantius wrote that Nero suddenly disappeared and even the burial place of that noxious wild beast was nowhere to be seen This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that having been conveyed to a distant region he is still reserved alive and to him they apply the Sibylline verses Lactantius maintains that it is not right to believe this br In Augustine of Hippo wrote about Thessalonians where he believed that Paul mentioned the coming of the Antichrist Although he rejects the theory Augustine mentions that many Christians believed Nero was the Antichrist or would return as the Antichrist He wrote that in saying For the mystery of iniquity doth already work he alluded to Nero whose deeds already seemed to be as the deeds of Antichrist br Some modern biblical scholars such as Delbert Hillers Johns Hopkins University of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford Study Bible and HarperCollins Study Bible contend that the number in the Book of Revelation is a code for Nero a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries The statement concerns Revelation the longest explanatory passage in Revelation which predicts the destruction of Rome by work of an eighth emperor who was also one of the seven kings of the most extended and powerful empire ever known in the human history according to this lecture Babylon the Great is identified with Rome which has poured the blood of saints and martyrs verse and subsequently become the seat of the Vatican State reigning over all the kings existing on Earth br br br See
