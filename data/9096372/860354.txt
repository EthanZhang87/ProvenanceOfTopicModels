A menagerie is a collection of captive animals frequently exotic kept for display or the place where such a collection is kept a precursor to the modern zoo or zoological garden br The term was first used in th century France referring to the management of household or domestic stock Later it came to be used primarily in reference to aristocratic or royal animal collections The French language Methodical Encyclopaedia of defines a menagerie as an establishment of luxury and curiosity Later on the term referred also to travelling animal collections that exhibited wild animals at fairs across Europe and the Americas br br br Aristocratic menageries br br A menagerie was mostly connected with an aristocratic or royal court and was situated within a garden or park of a palace These aristocrats wanted to illustrate their power and wealth by displaying exotic animals which were uncommon difficult to acquire and expensive to maintain in a living and active state br The aristocratic menageries are distinguished from the later zoological garden zoos since they were founded and owned by aristocrats whose intentions were not primarily of scientific and educational interest br br br Medieval period and Renaissance br During the Middle Ages several sovereigns across Europe maintained menageries at their royal courts An early example is that of the Emperor Charlemagne in the th century His three menageries at Aachen Nijmegen and Ingelheim located in present day Netherlands and Germany housed the first elephants seen in Europe since the Roman Empire along with monkeys lions bears camels falcons and many exotic birds br Charlemagne received exotic animals for his collection as gifts from rulers of Africa and Asia br In the caliph of Baghdad Harun al Rashid presented Charlemagne with an Asian elephant named Abul Abbas The pachyderm arrived on July to the Emperor s residence in Aachen He died in June br William the Conqueror had a small royal menagerie At his manor Woodstock he began a collection of exotic animals Around the year his son Henry I enclosed Woodstock and enlarged the collection br At the beginning of the th century Henry I of England is known to have kept a collection of animals at his palace in Woodstock Oxfordshire reportedly including lions leopards lynxes camels owls and a porcupine br The most prominent animal collection in medieval England was the Tower Menagerie in London that began as early as br It was established by King John who reigned in England from to and is known to have held lions and bears br Henry III received a wedding gift in of three leopards from Frederick II Holy Roman Emperor br The most spectacular arrivals in the early years were a white bear and an elephant gifts from the kings of Norway and France in and in respectively br In the animals were moved to the Bulwark which was renamed the Lion Tower near the main western entrance of the Tower br This building was constituted by rows of cages with arched entrances enclosed behind grilles They were set in two storeys and it appears that the animals used the upper cages during the day and were moved to the lower storey at night br The menagerie was opened to the public during the reign of Elizabeth I in the th century During the th century the price of admission was three half pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions br Animals recorded here at the end of the th century included lions tigers hyenas and bears br Most of the animals were transferred in to the newly opened London Zoo at Regent s Park which did not receive all the animals but rather shared them with Dublin Zoo br The Tower Menagerie was finally closed in on the orders of the Duke of Wellington The Tower Menagerie in London can be considered to have been the royal menagerie of England for six centuries br In the first half of the thirteenth century Emperor Frederick II had three permanent menageries in Italy at Melfi in Basilicata at Lucera in Apulia and at Palermo in Sicily br In the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II established at his court in southern Italy the first great menagerie in western Europe An elephant a white bear a giraffe a leopard hyenas lions cheetahs camels and monkeys were all exhibited but the emperor was particularly interested in birds and studied them sufficiently to write a number of authoritative books on them br In the beginning of the th century a royal menagerie was established in the Royal Palace of Lisbon located nearby the Castle of Saint George Following the conquest of Ceuta in King John I of Portugal brought back to Lisbon two Barbary lions and they were installed in a large room inside his Palace in the Citadel of Lisbon This area of the palace came to be known as Casa dos Le es the Lions House today the area is occupied by a famed restaurant with the same name Later that century German humanist Hieronymus M nzer spent five days in Lisbon in and learned about the lions claiming to be the most beautiful wild beasts he had ever seen br Later on the m nagerie of King Manuel I inside the Ribeira Palace in downtown Lisbon was appreciated in Europe due to its huge elephants that the king ordered to be brought from India One of his elephants Hanno as well as a rhinoceros depicted by D rer were famous gifts to Pope Leo X However the rhinoceros drowned as a result of a shipwreck suffered during the transport trip to Italy br By the end of the th century the aristocracy of Renaissance Italy began to collect exotic animals at their residences on the outskirts of the cities The role played by animals within the gardens of Italian villas expanded at the end of the th century and the beginning of the seventeenth century and one prominent example was the Villa Borghese built in Rome br br br Versailles and its legacy br br During the seventeenth century exotic birds and small animals provided diverting ornaments for the court of France lions and other large animals were kept primarily to be brought out for staged fights br The collecting grew and attained more permanent lodgings in the s when Louis XIV constructed two new menageries one at Vincennes next to a palace on the eastern edge of Paris and a more elaborate one which became a model for menageries throughout Europe at Versailles the site of a royal hunting lodge two hours by carriage west of Paris br Around he had a menagerie of ferocious beasts built at Vincennes for the organization of fights Surrounding a rectangular courtyard a two storey building with balconies allowed spectators to view the scene The animals were housed on the ground floor in cells bordering the courtyard with small yards on the outside where they could take a bit of exercise br At Vincennes lions tigers and leopards as well as polecat minks and weasels were kept in cages around an amphitheater where the king could entertain courtiers and visiting dignitaries with bloody battles br In for instance the ambassador of Persia enjoyed the spectacle of a fight to the death between a royal tiger and an elephant br When the palace of Versailles was built Louis XIV of France also erected a menagerie within the palace s park br The menagerie at Versailles was to be something very different from the one at Vincennes br Most of it was constructed in when the first animals were introduced although the interior fittings were not finished until Situated in the south west of the park it was Louis XIV s first major project at Versailles and one of several pleasure houses that were gradually assembled around the palace br It represented the first menagerie according to Baroque style The prominent feature of Baroque menageries was the circular layout in the middle of which stood a beautiful pavilion Around this pavilion was a walking path and outside this path were the enclosures and cages Each enclosure had a house or stable at the far end for the animals and was bounded on three sides with walls There were bars only in the direction of the pavilion br Animal fights were halted at Vincennes around the site fell into disuse and the animals were installed at Versailles with the others br At about this time the lions leopards and tigers from the menagerie at Vincennes were transferred to Versailles where they were housed in newly built enclosures fronted with iron bars br br This particular enterprise marked a decisive step in the creation of menageries of curiosities and was imitated to some extent throughout Europe after the late seventeenth century br Monarchs princes and important lords built them in France Chantilly from England Kew Osterley the United Provinces Het Loo from Portugal Bel m in Queluz around Spain Madrid in and Austria Belvedere in Sch nbrunn in as well in the Germanic lands following the ravages of the Thirty Years War and the ensuing reconstruction Frederick William Elector of Prussia equipped Potsdam with a menagerie around The Elector of the Palatinate the Prince Regent of Westphalia and many others followed suit br This design was adopted particularly by the Habsburg monarchy in Austria In Francis I erected his famous Baroque menagerie in the park of Sch nbrunn Palace near Vienna br Being at first a courtly menagerie with private character it was opened to the general public in Initially it was only open for respectably dressed persons br Another aristocratic menagerie was founded in by Charles III of Spain on grounds which were part of the gardens of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid br During two centuries it was a predecessor institution of the modern facilities of the Madrid Zoo Aquarium moved in to the Casa de Campo br In the nineteenth century the aristocratic menageries were displaced by the modern zoological gardens with their scientific and educational approach The last menagerie in Europe was the Tiergarten Sch nbrunn in Vienna which was known officially as a menagerie until before evolving into a modern zoological garden with a scientific educational and conservationist orientation Due to its local continuity the former menagerie established in the medieval through baroque tradition of private wild animal collections of princes and kings is often seen as the oldest remaining zoo in the world Although many of the old Baroque enclosures have been changed one can still obtain a good impression of the symmetrical ensemble of the formerly imperial menagerie br br br Travelling menageries br br In England travelling menageries had first appeared at around In contrast to the aristocratic menageries these travelling animal collections were run by showmen who met the craving for sensation of the ordinary population These animal shows ranged in size but the largest was George Wombwell s The earliest record of a fatality at one such travelling menagerie was the death of Hannah Twynnoy in who was killed by a tiger in Malmesbury Wiltshire br Also in North America travelling menageries became even more popular during that time br The first exotic animal known to have been exhibited in America was a lion in Boston in followed a year later in the same city by a camel br A sailor arrived in Philadelphia in August with another lion which he exhibited in the city and surrounding towns for eight years br The first elephant was imported from India to America by a ship s captain Jacob Crowninshield in It was first displayed in New York City and travelled extensively up and down the East Coast br In James and William Howes New York Menagerie toured New England with an elephant a rhinoceros a camel two tigers a polar bear and several parrots and monkeys br America s touring menageries slowed to a crawl under the weight of the depression of the s and then to a halt with the outbreak of the Civil War Only one travelling menagerie of any size existed after the war The Van Amburgh menagerie travelled the United States for nearly forty years Unlike their European counterparts America s menageries and circuses had combined as single travelling shows with one ticket to see both This increased the size and the diversity of their collections Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus advertised their shows as the World s Greatest Menagerie br br br See also br Anthrozoology br br br br Hahn Daniel The Tower Menagerie London Simon Schuster ISBN br Baratay Eric
