Gerald Malcolm Durrell January January was a British naturalist writer zookeeper conservationist and television presenter He founded the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Jersey Zoo on the Channel Island of Jersey in He wrote approximately forty books mainly about his life as an animal collector and enthusiast the most famous being My Family and Other Animals Those memoirs of his family s years living in Greece were adapted into two television series My Family and Other Animals and The Durrells and one television film My Family and Other Animals He was the youngest brother of novelist Lawrence Durrell br br br Early life and education br Durrell was born in Jamshedpur British India on January He was the fifth and youngest child an elder sister having died in infancy of Louisa Florence Dixie and Lawrence Samuel Durrell both of whom were born in India of English and Irish descent Durrell s father was a British engineer and as was commonplace for a family of their status the infant Durrell spent most of his time in the company of an ayah nursemaid Durrell reportedly recalled his first visit to a zoo in India and attributed his lifelong love of animals to that encounter br The family moved to the UK after the death of his father in India Durrell was enrolled in Wickwood School but frequently stayed at home feigning illness br br br Corfu br Louisa moved to the Greek island of Corfu in with Leslie Margaret and Gerald joining her eldest son Lawrence who had arrived there with his wife Nancy about a week earlier On Corfu Durrell began to collect and keep the local fauna as pets br The family lived on Corfu until and this interval became the basis of Durrell s books My Family and Other Animals Birds Beasts and Relatives and The Garden of the Gods plus a few short stories such as My Donkey Sally The Corfu years also set the background for two TV series and one telefilm Durrell was home schooled during this time by various private tutors mostly friends of his brother Lawrence br Theodore Stephanides was a Greek British doctor scientist poet translator and a friend of George Wilkinson one of Durrell s tutors He became Durrell s greatest friend and mentor his ideas leaving a lasting impression on the young naturalist Together they examined Corfu s fauna which Durrell housed in a variety of items including test tubes and bathtubs Stephanides daughter Alexia Mercouri accompanied the two on their field trips She stated that both families had hoped that she and Durrell would marry one day but any such prospect was disrupted by the outbreak of war in br Other influences on Durrell during his formative years were the works of naturalists Charles Darwin Alfred Russel Wallace Jean Henri Fabre and Gilbert White br br br London and Whipsnade Zoo br Durrell his mother his brother Leslie and their Greek maid Maria Kondos moved back to Britain in at the outbreak of the Second World War It was difficult to find a job in the war and post war years especially for a homeschooled youth but the enterprising Durrell worked as a helper at an aquarium and pet store Some of the difficulties that he faced in this period can be found in Fillets of Plaice br His call up for the war came in but he was exempted from military duty on medical grounds and asked to serve the war effort by working on a farm After the war Durrell joined Whipsnade Zoo as a junior or student keeper This move fulfilled a lifelong dream Durrell claims in The Stationary Ark that the first word that he could enunciate with any clarity was zoo Beasts in My Belfry recalls events of this period br br br Early animal expeditions br Durrell left Whipsnade Zoo in May to join wildlife collecting expeditions but was denied a place in the voyages due to his lack of experience His wildlife expeditions began with a trip to the British Cameroons now part of Cameroon with ornithologist John Yealland financed by a inheritance from his father on turning The animals that he brought back were sold to London Zoo Chester Zoo Paignton Zoo Bristol Zoo and Belle Vue Zoological Gardens He followed this expedition with two others accompanied by fellow Whipsnade zookeeper Ken Smith a repeat trip to the British Cameroon in and a trip to British Guiana now Guyana in On the first of these trips he met the Fon of Bafut Achirimbi II a West African chieftain who helped him organise future missions br Durrell housed and fed his captives with the best supplies obtainable not trapping animals having merely show value or those which would fetch high prices from collectors These practices differed from those of other animal collecting expeditions and he was in financial straits by the end of his third expedition He had a falling out with George Cansdale superintendent of the London Zoo and Durrell was blackballed by the British zoo community and could not secure a job in most zoos He eventually found one at the aquarium at Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester where he remained for some time br Durrell started writing humorous autobiographical accounts to raise money with encouragement and assistance from Jacquie and advice from his brother Lawrence He did this initially because he and Jacquie were in need of money after their wedding and he had no source of income and later he wrote in order to fund his expeditions and conservation efforts His first book The Overloaded Ark was a huge success causing him to follow up with other such accounts He only made from British rights Faber and Faber but he obtained from the United States rights Viking Press for the book and thus managed to raise money for a fourth expedition to South America in This however was undertaken during a political coup d tat in Paraguay and was unsuccessful br br br Foundations for the Jersey Zoo br The publication of My Family and Other Animals in made Durrell a notable author and brought him public recognition as a naturalist Royalties from this book which made best seller lists in the United Kingdom helped to fund Durrell s next expedition br Durrell s growing disillusionment with the way zoos of the time were run and his belief that they should primarily act as reserves and regenerators of endangered species made him contemplate founding his own zoo His trip to Cameroon for the third and last time was primarily to collect animals which would form the core collection of his own zoo br This expedition was also filmed it being Durrell s first experiment with making a cinematographic record of his work with animals The success of the film To Bafut with Beagles together with his autobiographical radio programme Encounters with Animals made Durrell a regular with the BBC Natural History unit for decades to come as well as generating funds for his conservation projects He made the Jersey zoo in his backyard br On his return from Bafut Durrell and wife Jacquie stayed with his sister Margaret at her boarding house in the seaside resort of Bournemouth His animals were housed in her gardens and garage on a temporary basis while Durrell sought prospective sites for a zoo To his dismay both Bournemouth and Poole municipalities turned down his suggestion for a zoo This experience provided material for his book A Zoo in My Luggage br br br Zoo and the trust br br Durrell founded the Jersey Zoological Park in to house his growing collection of animals The site for the zoo a th century manor house Les Augres Manor came to Durrell s notice by chance after a long and unsuccessful search for a suitable site Durrell leased the manor and set up his zoo on the redesigned manor grounds In the same year Durrell undertook another more successful expedition to South America to collect endangered species The zoo was opened to the public in on March br As the zoo grew in size so did the number of projects undertaken to save threatened wildlife in other parts of the world Durrell was instrumental in founding the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust now Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust on July to cope with the increasingly difficult challenges of zoo wildlife and habitat management br The trust opened an international wing the Wildlife Preservation Trust International in the United States in to aid international conservation efforts in a better fashion That year the trust bought out Les Augres Manor from its owner Major Hugh Fraser giving the zoo a permanent home br Durrell s initiative caused the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society to start the World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival in at Jersey today one of the most prestigious conferences in the field also saw Princess Anne becoming a patron of the trust an action which brought the trust into media limelight and helped raise funds br The s saw Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust become a leading zoo in the field of captive breeding championing the cause among species like the lowland gorilla and various Mauritian fauna Durrell visited Mauritius several times and coordinated large scale conservation efforts in Mauritius with conservationist Carl Jones involving captive breeding programmes for native birds and reptiles ecological recovery of Round Island training local staff and setting up local conservation facilities This ultimately led to the founding of the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation in br Jacquie Durrell separated from and then divorced Durrell in citing his increasing work pressure associated alcoholism and mounting stress as causes br Durrell met his second wife Lee McGeorge Wilson in when he lectured at Duke University where she was studying for a PhD in animal communication In a year after they first met Durrell wrote a love letter to his future wife They married in She co authored a number of books with him including The Amateur Naturalist and became the honorary director of the trust after his death br In Durrell started the training centre for conservationists at the zoo or the mini university in his words As of over a thousand biologists naturalists zoo veterinarians and zoo architects from countries have attended the International Training Centre Durrell was also instrumental in forming the Captive Breeding Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union in br Durrell founded Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada now Wildlife Preservation Canada in The official appeal Saving Animals from Extinction was launched in at a time when British zoos were not faring well and London Zoo was in danger of closing down br In Durrell and his wife along with David Attenborough and cricketer David Gower helped launch the World Land Trust then the World Wide Land Conservation Trust The initial goal of the trust was to purchase rainforest land in Belize as part of the Programme for Belize Around this time Gerald Durrell developed a friendship with Charles Rycroft who became an important donor of funds both for building works in Jersey the Harcroft Lecture Theatre and for conservation work in East Africa Madagascar and elsewhere br saw the trust establish a conservation programme in Madagascar along the lines of the Mauritius programme Durrell visited Madagascar in to start captive breeding of a number of endemic species like the aye aye br br Durrell chose the dodo the flightless bird of Mauritius that was hunted to extinction in the th century as the logo for both the Jersey Zoo and the trust The children s chapter of the trust is called the Dodo Club Following his death the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust was renamed the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust at the th anniversary of the zoo on March The Wildlife Preservation Trust International also changed its name to Wildlife Trust in and adopted the logo of the black tamarin br In A Zoo in My Luggage Durrell wrote br br To me the extirpation of an animal species is a criminal offence just as the destruction of something else that we cannot recreate or replace such as a Rembrandt or the Acropolis would be br br br Personal life br On February Durrell married Manchester resident Jacqueline Jacquie Sonia Wolfenden after a lengthy courtship they eloped when she was because of opposition from her father The couple initially lived in a small bedsitter in Durrell s sister Margaret s Bournemouth boarding house Jacquie accompanied him on most of his following animal expeditions and helped found and manage the Jersey Zoo She also authored two humorous best selling memoirs on the lines of Durrell s books in order to raise money for conservation efforts They separated and then divorced in citing the pressure of his work and his alcoholism br In Gerald married American Lee McGeorge Wilson who met him when he gave a lecture at Duke University in North Carolina in where she was a doctoral student He was and she was years old Both were enthusiastic naturalists They remained married until his death br br br Death br By the s Durrell was experiencing significant health challenges He underwent hip replacement surgery in a bid to counter arthritis and he also suffered from alcohol related liver problems His health deteriorated rapidly after the Madagascar trip Durrell had a liver transplant in King s College Hospital on March and he died of septicaemia on January shortly after his th birthday in Jersey General Hospital His ashes are buried in Jersey Zoo under a memorial plaque bearing a quote by William Beebe br br The beauty and genius of a work of art may be re conceived though its first material expression be destroyed a vanished harmony may yet again inspire the composer but when the last individual of a race of living beings breathes no more another heaven and another earth must pass before such a one can be again The Bird br A memorial celebrating Durrell s life and work was held at the Natural History Museum in London on June Participants included personal friends such as David Attenborough and Princess Anne br br br Books br Durrell s books have a very loose style which pokes fun at himself as well as those around him Perhaps his best known work is My Family and Other Animals which tells of his idyllic childhood on Corfu and was developed into two TV series and one film It is deprecating about the whole family especially elder brother Lawrence who became a famous novelist Despite Durrell s jokes at Lawrence s expense the two were close friends all their lives br Durrell always insisted that he wrote for royalties to help the cause of environmental stewardship not out of an inherent love for writing He describes himself as a writer in comparison to his brother br br The subtle difference between us is that he loves writing and I don t To me it s simply a way to make money which enables me to do my animal work nothing more br Durrell was a regular contributor to magazines on both sides of the Atlantic including Harper s Atlantic Monthly and the Sunday Times Supplement He was also a regular book reviewer for The New York Times A number of excerpts and stories from his books were used by Octopus Books and Reader s Digest Publishing including in the Reader s Digest Condensed Books His works have been
