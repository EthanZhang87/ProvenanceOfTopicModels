Jersey Zoo formerly Durrell Wildlife Park is a zoological park established in on the island of Jersey in the English Channel by naturalist and writer Gerald Durrell It is operated by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust It has approximately visitors per year br Jersey Zoo has always concentrated on rare and endangered species It has mammals birds amphibians and reptiles comprising over species br Since the zoo has been home to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust formerly the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust br br br Overview br br The park is located at Les Augr s Manor Trinity Jersey miles km north of Saint Helier It officially opened on March br The park is situated in acres ha of landscaped parkland and water gardens The Trust has a strong commitment to looking after the Island s native wildlife and large areas within the grounds have been designated native habitat areas The extensive planting of flowering and fruiting trees throughout the grounds also serves to attract a plethora of wild birds and insects Included in the former are several species of bird which used to be commonly seen in island gardens but have become increasingly scarce including the house sparrow and song thrush br There are over nest boxes positioned around the grounds which are used by a variety of birds including barn owls kestrels swallows and house martins Other animals which are commonly seen within the grounds are the red squirrel bank vole and the short toed treecreeper br br br History br br Gerald Durrell began his career capturing animals for other zoos but thought that the facilities needed to concentrate more on animal conservation rather than mere entertainment He started the zoo in Durrell tells the story of starting the zoo in his book Menagerie Manor and others br In January plans known as New Vision were unveiled for the future of the zoo These ambitious plans had an emphasis on the notion of TopSpots places where the greatest diversity of animals are found such as islands and highlands The plan included projects including African Bai an environment mirroring the ecology of the African habitat that the western lowland gorillas would need to adapt to if one day it would be safe for them to be left alone in the wild Mascarenia to the mammals birds and terrapins of Madagascar Mauritius and islands of the western Indean Ocean and eco lodge cabins for visitors to stay in br It was budgeted that the cost of the redevelopment would be in the region of million over the next five years All funds needed to be raised through public and private donations But most of the plan was eventually cancelled due to costs br In May a new visitor centre and restaurant was officially opened by Princess Anne Access to the zoo is not required for access to the restaurant A webcam service has been recently developed at Durrell Wildlife Park Cameras have been installed in the meerkat enclosure as well as in those of the Telfair s skinks the Livingstone s fruit bats and in the Kirindy Forest the home of a rare and colourful bird collection The webcam lets viewers to those species at times when they are often inaccessible including watching the fruit bats during the evening when they are most active In an infant silverback gorilla named Indigo who lived at the park was chosen to be the mascot of the Island Games which were held on the island br br br Exhibits br br br Jewels of the Forest br Opened in this exhibit houses various Asian birds such as br br Palawan peacock pheasant br Blue crowned laughingthrush br Red tailed

the meerkat s habitat in the wild br br Meerkat br Aardvark br br br Gorillas br The western lowland gorilla family has been represented at Durrell since it first opened in when they had only an infant female thought to be male at first gorilla named N Pongo who was later joined by a younger infant female gorilla named Nandi and continue today to be one of the icons of the park br The current enclosure includes a good sized outdoor play area and three internal rooms two large on show ones and a smaller off show one br The current family of five is led by a silverback called Badongo who was born in La Vall e des Singes Badongo is the successor of Ya Kwanza and has had two offspring with Bahasha a male named Indigo and a female named Amari Indigo has since left to start his own family The remaining members of the troupe are Kishka who passed in and Hlalli Kahilli a female descendant of Jambo and N Pongo br A expanded and updated gorilla complex is due to be completed in br br Jambo br br Jambo was a gorilla who was born in in the Zoo Basel Switzerland Jambo shot to international news stardom overnight on August when five year old Levan Merritt fell into the gorilla enclosure and lost consciousness Jambo stood guard over the boy when he was unconscious placing himself between the boy and other gorillas in what ethnologists analyze as a protective gesture He later stroked the unconscious boy When the boy regained consciousness and started to cry Jambo and the other gorillas retreated and an ambulance paramedic and two keepers rescued the boy Most of the drama was shot on home video by Brian Le Lion and extensively photographed by other zoo visitors The publicity on major news channels and newspapers helped the reputations of gorillas br br br Orangutans and gibbons br In an enclosure which was revamped in the s the orangutans have a large outdoor play area for them to swing around The enclosure consists of one large main house with two extensive external islands surrounded by a moat br The orangutan family have been in Durrell since and come from Sumatra Durrell used to have the Bornean orangutans until it was decided that Durrell should focus on the rarest when the redevelopment took place There are currently five orangutans at Durell The dominant male is called Dagu The adult females are Annette and Dana The two offspring are Mawar who moved to Prague

programmes to reintroduce them to their own environment br br Mauritius kestrel br In there were only four individuals in the wild with one female Durrell took the risk of taking a recent clutch of eggs and had them hatched successfully rebuilding the species almost from scratch The conservation for the species has moved on to the next stage and its focus has returned to Mauritius re establishing the species in the community and ecosystem br br Przewalski s horse br With the newly established wild population of these species originally extinct from the wild the zoo was part of the coalition of zoos which together brought the species from the brink of extinction br br br Work in Jersey br br Helping the local species br Durrell is working closely with local wildlife groups to help with the declining populations of Jersey s sand lizard the Jersey crapaud common toad and Jersey s agile frog br br Local rare and declining plant propagation br The aim is maintain the genetic diversity of the locally rare plants br Currently four species are being grown in the propagation unit Fragaria vesca wild strawberry Dianthus gallicus Jersey pink Anogramma leptophylla Jersey fern and Linaria vulgaris common toadflax br Other plant species will be propagated as seed or cutting material becomes available As some of these plant species are severely threatened finding specimens for propagation will be a challenge br br Bird reintroductions br In Durrell undertook a project to reintroduce birds that once populated the island s clifftops but have long disappeared The red billed chough is the first focus of the programme There are also plans to do something similar with the yellowhammer should the project prove successful br br Red billed chough br The red billed chough became extinct on Jersey in the nineteenth century but they have once again returned Durrell has joined a breeding programme and so a group are being kept at Durrell to form a captive colony with hope to establish a free flying colony on Jersey s north coast br br br Durrell overseas br Pygmy hog br Although no longer located in Jersey conservation is still monitored by Durrell in Assam India and other locations The species is still in dire need of funding and help During some pygmy hogs were released into the wild in Assam early reports show good progress with the species br Blue iguana br Hitting headlines recently is some success in Grand Cayman with the blue iguana Working alongside local authorities the iguana is being saved from extinction It shows what can be done In the project suffered a drawback when intruders broke into the complex and killed numerous iguanas including juveniles and expecting females br Madagascar pochard br Previously thought extinct found when looking for something else Durrell have recently teamed up with Madagascar to help research and study the species With scouts unable to locate more individuals it has become a possibility that experts will have to bring the survivors back to Jersey using expertise from the Madagascar teal and Meller s duck to help the duck get back from the brink br Antiguan racer br In it was dubbed the world s

Wildlife Camp br Work began on the Durrell Wildlife Camp in early which will allow the park to sell lodging and services to visitors br A wooded copse to the west of Les Augr s Manor has been landscaped to provide a nine metre square level wooden deck roughly every seven metres These decks will house twelve geodesic dome shaped semi permanent tent structures and a separate shower and toilet cubicle for each A further two platforms will house a communal structure and a pod for health and beauty treatments br Durrell Wildlife Camp is described as a glamorous camping resort The site has WiFi coverage and each pod has a hard wired electrical feed for running AC V appliances br br br br br br External links br br Official website
