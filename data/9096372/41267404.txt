conservation This is the future of tourism br The company introduces travellers directly to responsible travel and tourism options including accommodation owners and holiday providers br According to

agents do Francis urges them to talk directly In www responsiblevacation com was launched in the US The company is based in Brighton East Sussex UK As of March there were employees br br br Responsible travel and tourism br Responsible Travel was the first online guide to responsible international travel Responsible travel and tourism is about making better places for people to live in and to visit One of the founding principles of Responsible Travel was to help create this new sector of the travel and tourism industry and to firmly root it in ethical values br br br Activities br br br World Responsible Tourism Awards br In Justin Francis founded The Responsible Tourism Awards which were organised by Responsible Travel and hosted by World Travel Market as part of World Responsible Tourism Day Professor Harold Goodwin of the International Centre for Responsible Tourism is Chair of the Judges The Awards aim to inspire change in the tourism industry by celebrating those organisations destinations and individuals working innovatively with local cultures communities and biodiversity at the forefront of responsible tourism br br br Trip For A Trip br In November Responsible Travel began funding day trips for children around the world to visit a local tourist attraction that they may never had had the privilege of visiting before The company asks its customers to opt in to the scheme to offer a child the opportunity to appreciate more deeply the value of their own wildlife landscapes history and culture Actor and traveller Michael Palin said Trip For A Trip sounds an excellent idea My appetite for travel began with day trips so I know how much they can mean to a child Good luck and thanks to all who can make this happen br br br Zoos br In April Responsible Travel stopped promoting holidays that included a visit to a zoo describing them as relics of the past The move was supported by The Born Free Foundation and was praised by actress Joanna Lumley br It only takes one to create a movement for change and it is fabulous to see a travel company being brave sticking their heads above the parapet and saying that in keeping animals in captivity purely for our entertainment is just not acceptable There are so many superb ways to learn about and appreciate animals in the wild we should be encouraging people to get out into nature not watching wildlife behind bars I hope that more companies will follow this excellent example br br br Elephants and tourism br After consulting with local suppliers NGOs and animal welfare experts in Responsible Travel published a detailed guide on elephants in tourism including the rights and wrongs of elephant trekking br The company also changed its own policy and removed elephant trekking and elephant performance trips from its collection br br br Whales and dolphins in captivity br In April the company launched a public petition to urge travel companies to stop selling tickets to establishments keeping whales and dolphins collectively known as cetaceans for public entertainment purposes They also released a poll along with The Born Free Foundation demonstrating that of the public no longer wished to see cetaceans in captivity On July UK tour operator Thomas Cook finally announced that they would stop selling trips to SeaWorld br br br Orphanage volunteering br In July Responsible Travel temporarily suspended trips that involved volunteering at orphanages around the world for ethical reasons The company was concerned that well intentioned volunteers were fuelling a demand for fake orphans and children were being separated from their families and communities as a result causing long term psychological and emotional developmental problems br After formulating a working group which included ECPAT Save the Children Friends International People Places Professor Harold Goodwin and Daniela Papi an international advocate for responsible volunteering the company published new guidelines for partner organisations wishing to promote any trip that involved volunteering with vulnerable children As a result trips were removed from the website in total br br br Carbon offsetting br In Responsible Travel became one of the first companies to offer carbon offsets In October Responsible Travel stopped offering carbon offsetting claiming that people were using the offset as an excuse to pollute more br Responsible Travel founder Justin Francis told The New York Times that offsets had become a magic pill a kind of get out of jail free card distracting people from making more significant behavioral changes like flying less br br br Had Enough br In the company launched a campaign urging three of the UK s largest travel companies Thomas Cook Thomson and MyTravel to implement responsible tourism policies The Had Enough petition was launched after research showed widespread dissatisfaction with mass tourism among ordinary travellers A year later all three had published their first Responsible Business policies br br br Overtourism concerns br In and several major news outlets published articles citing the problems caused by an excessive number of tourists in cities such as Venice Barcelona Cornwall in England and Amsterdam br Reports in The Guardian have often quoted Justin Francis one of the founders of Responsible Travel who stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are producing an overtourism crisis in addition to managing tourism more responsibly br Ultimately residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing infrastructure and access to services because they have a long term stake in the city s success he said Limits on the number of visitors during peak periods have already been set by cities such as London New York Reykjavik Amsterdam and Paris Francis understands the rationale Some destinations may just have too many tourists and that issue calls for strategies such as taxation demarketing and limiting accommodation for tourists br In July Responsible Travel released its first documentary film Crowded Out The Story of Overtourism Presented by Justin Francis and directed by Beth Walker the film documents the issue of overtourism from the perspective of local people in hotspots such as Venice and Barcelona as well as further afield in places such as the Gili Islands br br
