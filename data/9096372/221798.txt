id: 221798
The National Zoological Park commonly known as the National Zoo is one of the oldest zoos in the United States The zoo is part of the Smithsonian Institution and does not charge admission Founded in its mission is to provide engaging experiences with animals and create and share knowledge to save wildlife and habitats br The National Zoo has two campuses The first is a acre ha urban park located at Rock Creek Park in the Woodley Park neighborhood of Northwest Washington D C minutes from the National Mall by MetroRail The other campus is the acre ha Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute SCBI formerly known as the Conservation and Research Center in Front Royal Virginia On this land there are species of trees species of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants species of grasses and different species of bamboo The SCBI is a non public facility devoted to training wildlife professionals in conservation biology and to propagating rare species through natural means and assisted reproduction The National Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA br The two facilities host about animals of different species About one fifth of them are endangered or threatened Most species are on exhibit at the Rock Creek Park campus The zoo is home to birds great apes big cats Asian elephants insects amphibians reptiles aquatic animals small mammals and many more but the best known residents were giant pandas The SCBI facility houses between and endangered species at any given time depending on research needs and recommendations from the zoo and the conservation community The zoo was one of the first to establish a scientific research program Because it is a part of the Smithsonian Institution the National Zoo receives federal appropriations for operating expenses A new master plan for the park was introduced in to upgrade the park s exhibits and layout br The National Zoo is open every day of the year except for December Christmas Day though it was closed for a long period during the COVID pandemic The zoo reopened following this on May br br br History br br The zoo first started as the National Museum s Department of Living Animals in By an act of Congress on March for the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the people the National Zoo was created In it became a part of the Smithsonian Institution Three well known individuals drew up plans for the zoo Samuel Langley third Secretary of the Smithsonian William Temple Hornaday noted conservationist and head of the Smithsonian s vertebrate division and Frederick Law Olmsted the premier landscape architect of his day William T Hornaday was the park s first director and curator of all animals when the park was first opened and took office on May Together they designed a new zoo to exhibit animals for the public and to serve as a refuge for wildlife such as bison and beaver which were rapidly vanishing from North America br br For the first years the National Zoo like most zoos around the world focused on exhibiting one or two representative exotic animal species The number of many species in the wild began to decline drastically because of human activities In the Kansas frontiersman Charles Buffalo Jones captured a bighorn sheep for the zoo The fate of animals and plants became a pressing concern Many of these species were favorite zoo animals such as elephants and tigers hence the staff began to concentrate on the long term management and conservation of entire species br Several exotic animals were donated by former US presidents often they were acquired as gifts from foreign dignitaries Notable among them are Billy the pygmy hippopotamus who is the common ancestor to almost all pygmy hippos in American zoos and Rebecca the raccoon one of many exotic presidential pets of Calvin Coolidge and First Lady Grace br In the mid s the zoo hired its first full time permanent veterinarian reflecting a priority placed on professional health care for the animals In Friends of the National Zoo FONZ was founded The citizen group s first accomplishment was to persuade Congress to fund the zoo s budget entirely through the Smithsonian previously the zoo s budget was divided between appropriations for the Smithsonian and the District of Columbia Congressional funding placed the zoo on a firmer financial base allowing for a period of growth and improvement In Congress approved an additional million for renovations in both facilities FONZ incorporated as a nonprofit organization and turned its attention to developing education and volunteer programs supporting these efforts from its operation of concessions at the zoo and expanding community support for the zoo through a growing membership which annually raises between million and million for the zoo br In the early s the zoo turned its attention to breeding and studying threatened and endangered species Although some zoo animals had been breeding and raising young it was not understood why some species did so successfully while others did not In the zoo created the zoological research division to study the reproduction behavior and ecology of zoo species and to learn how best to meet the needs of the animals br The Ivy A Pelzman Memorial Glockenspiel constructed by the Petit Fritsen bell foundry is a foot tall clock tower standing at the zoo s southeastern entrance consisting of a carillon of bells four moving figurines of animals and a faced clock that was dedicated on May It was designed and donated by the late Dr Ivy A Pelzman as a memorial in honor of his wife Katherine The glockenspiel s steam engine powered rotating display of animals malfunctioned a few years after the glockenspiel s installation due to the steam engine becoming Inoperable A few years later the glockenspiel was relocated on the zoo grounds from Connecticut Avenue entrance to the southeastern entrance The glockenspiel s bells became inoperable in due to a mechanical malfunction with the carillon keyboard console The Smithsonian lists the glockenspiel as an attractive but dysfunctional gift and it requires expensive funds for restoration and maintenance br br In the zoo established the Conservation and Research Center CRC In the complex was renamed the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute SCBI a title also used as an umbrella term for the scientific endeavors that take place on both campuses On acres km in the Virginia countryside rare species such as Mongolian wild horses scimitar horned oryx maned wolves cranes and others live and breed in spacious surroundings SCBI s modern efforts emphasize reproductive physiology analysis of habitat and species relationships genetics husbandry and the training of conservation scientists br In September the zoo s last giraffe Randale was transferred to the Lowry Park Zoo and in September the zoo s last hippopotamus Happy was transferred to the Milwaukee County Zoo to make space for Elephant Trails br During the COVID pandemic during the zoo was closed for several months as a precautionary effort br br br Modern status br br Expanding knowledge about the needs of zoo animals and commitment to their well being has changed the look of the National Zoo Today animals live in natural groupings rather than individually Rare and endangered species such as golden lion tamarins Sumatran tigers and sarus cranes breed and raise their young showing the success of the zoo s conservation and research programs The zoo s research team studies animals both in the wild and at the zoo Its research encompasses reproductive biology conservation biology biodiversity monitoring veterinary medicine nutrition behavior ecology and bird migration br The National Zoo has developed public education programs to help students teachers and families explore the intricacies of the animal world The zoo also designed specialized programs to train wildlife professionals from around the world and to form a network to provide crucial support for international conservation The National Zoo is at the forefront of the use of web technology and programming to expand its programs to an international virtual audience br Plans for the future include modernizing the zoo s aging facilities and expanding its education research and conservation efforts in Washington Virginia and in the wild As part of a year renewal program Asia Trail a series of habitats for seven Asian species including sloth bears red pandas and clouded leopards was created Kids Farm exhibit opened in was slated for closure in but is to remain open for another years following a donation to the exhibit Elephant Trails opened in provides a new home for the zoo s Asian elephants br The zoo which is supported by tax revenues and open to everyone attracts million visitors per year according to The Washington Post in br The National Zoo has a Federal Law Enforcement Agency deployed on its grounds the National Zoological Park Police NZPP which consists of full time Law Enforcement Officers The NZPP is an agency that has been recognized by the United States Congress and is one of five original police agencies within the District of Columbia with full police powers They work very closely with the Metropolitan Police Department the United States Park Police Department of State Capital Police Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Defense The agency is considered the first line of defense in the event of any crisis br Dennis W Kelly was named director of the zoo on February overseeing both campuses Kelly succeeded John Berry who was the National Zoo director for three years until February when he resigned to become the director of the U S Office of Personnel Management under the Obama Administration Steven Monfort the zoo s associate director for conservation and science served as the acting director between February and February Kelly retired as the zoo s director in November and Steven Monfort was named acting director In November Brandie Smith was appointed director Smith is the second woman to serve as director in the zoo s year history br br br National Zoological Park Police br br US National Zoological Park Police officers are specifically assigned to the National Zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal Virginia The National Zoological Park Police is one of the oldest police forces in the District of Columbia According to the official National Zoo Website the Zoological Police was one of the original five police agencies in D C created in The acre km National Zoo is a Smithsonian facility in the District of Columbia and is staffed hours a day by full time US National Zoological Park police officers br The National Zoo also maintains a acre Research facility Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute SCBI in Front Royal Virginia which is staffed by members of the National

after the zoo s pandas Mei Xiang Tian Tian and their cub Xiao Qi Ji left for China in November They are the focus of a research conservation and breeding program that aims to preserve the species br Mei Xiang and Tian Tian who were on loan from the China Wildlife Conservation Association have successfully had four surviving cubs together all by artificial insemination The first was a male cub named Tai Shan in Tai Shan currently lives at the Bifengxia Panda Base in Sichuan China taking part in Bifengxia s breeding program On September Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub but the cub died six days after its birth On August Mei Xiang gave birth to two cubs one a female named Bao Bao survived while the other was stillborn Mei delivered two cubs in August one died a few days later The surviving male was given the name Bei Bei on September and was on public exhibit in January Bei Bei traveled to China in November On August at Mei Xiang gave birth to a single male cub and became the oldest giant panda to give birth in the US at years old On November he was named Xiao Qi Ji by popular vote which translates to Little Miracle in English br br br Elephant Trails br br In spring the National Zoo began construction on Elephant Trails a new home for its Asian elephants The first part of the million project opened in September expanding the zoo s former elephant area with a square

most famous animals to have spent much of his life at the zoo was Smokey Bear the living symbol of the cartoon icon created as part of a campaign to prevent forest fires A black bear cub rescued from a fire he lived at the zoo from until his death in During his time at the zoo he had millions of visitors and an abundance of personal mail addressed to him up to letters a week such that the U S Post Office designated a special zip code for correspondence addressed to him br During his time at the zoo he was married to Goldie Bear with the hope that one of his offspring would continue to hold the title of Smokey Bear When the pair produced no offspring an orphaned bear cub was added to their cage It was named Little Smokey with the announcement that the bear couple had adopted the new cub In an official ceremony was held to recognize the retirement of Smokey Bear and the new title of Smokey Bear II for Little Smokey Upon the death of the original Smokey Bear The Washington Post printed an obituary recognizing him as a New Mexico native who had resided in Washington D C for many years working for the government br br br Ham br br Ham was the first great ape ever launched into space in The chimp would later retire to the National Zoo in where he would spend years until he was transferred to the North Carolina Zoo for the remaining years of his life br br br Giant pandas br br From to one of the zoo s exhibits featured pandas br During President Richard Nixon s historic visit to China the Chinese government donated two giant pandas Ling Ling female and Hsing Hsing male to the official United States delegation First Lady Pat Nixon donated the pandas to the zoo where she welcomed them in an April ceremony The first giant pandas in America Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing were among the most popular animals at the zoo Ling Ling died in and Hsing Hsing in Although Ling Ling and Hsing Hsing had five cubs between and all died as infants br A new pair of pandas female Mei Xiang Beautiful Fragrance and male Tian Tian More and More arrived on loan from the Chinese government in late The zoo paid an estimated million dollars for the year loan On July a male panda cub was born at the zoo It was the first surviving panda birth at the zoo and the product of artificial insemination by the zoo s reproductive research team The cub was named Tai Shan Peaceful Mountain on October days after his birth the panda went without a name for its first hundred days in observance of a Chinese custom Tai Shan is property of the Chinese government and was scheduled to be sent to China after his second birthday although that deadline was extended in by two years Tai Shan left Washington D C on February and was taken to the Ya an Bifengxia Panda Base part of the Wolong nature reserve s panda conservation center br On September Mei Xiang gave birth to another cub believed by zoo officials to have been a female which died after about a week Initial results from a necropsy animal autopsy revealed the abnormal presence of fluid in the abdomen and also discoloration of the liver hepatic tissue of unknown etiology the cub had managed to nurse before death because milk was found in its system Zoo officials said that while upsetting they and by extension the public can hope to learn more about giant panda breeding reproduction and health as a result and will work closely and cooperatively with their Chinese colleagues during the inquiry br In January Dennis Kelly director of the National Zoo and Zang Chunlin secretary general of the China Wildlife Conservation Association signed a new Giant Panda Cooperative Research and Breeding Agreement extending the zoo s giant panda program for five more years further cementing the two countries commitment to the conservation of the species The agreement effective through December stipulates that the zoo will conduct research in the areas of breeding and cub behavior A new agreement was put in place December and was in effect until December In December the deal got extended until br Mei Xiang gave birth in August to two live cubs the smaller one died a few days later keepers had to care for it after Mei decided to focus on the larger cub Sperm from both Tian Tian and another male giant panda based in a China preserve was used It was determined on August that both cubs were male and sired by Tian Tian The larger surviving cub was named Bei Bei precious treasure on September In celebration of a state visit the name was selected by First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama and First Lady of the People s Republic of China Peng Liyuan br Bao Bao was healthy at that time eating bamboo and special fruitsicle treats having been separated from Mei at months of age She celebrated her second birthday in August shortly after the cubs were born Her contract extended to August Bao Bao left the National Zoo on February for the Dujiangyan base of the China Panda Conservation and Research Center br In March shortly after the National Zoo closed due to the COVID pandemic Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated using only frozen sperm to avoid too much close contact In August the National Zoo announced that Mei Xiang was pregnant A few days after announcing that they had detected fetal tissue the zoo tweeted a short video of an ultrasound showing a panda fetus On August Mei Xiang gave birth to a live male cub named Xiao Qi Ji making her the oldest panda in the United States to give birth at years old This meant the first success for this type of procedure br On November Mei Xiang Tian Tian and Xiao Qi Ji left the zoo and were transported in a Boeing F aircraft to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China ending the year era of pandas at the zoo br br br
