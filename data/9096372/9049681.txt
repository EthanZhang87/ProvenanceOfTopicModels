Carl Hagenbeck June April was a German merchant of wild animals who supplied many European zoos as well as P T Barnum He created the modern zoo with animal enclosures without bars that were closer to their natural habitat He was also an ethnography showman and a pioneer in displaying humans next to animals in human zoos His use of human zoos is widely considered to be inhumane today and was controversial even at the time The transformation of the zoo architecture initiated by him is known as the Hagenbeck revolution Hagenbeck founded Germany s most successful privately owned zoo the Tierpark Hagenbeck which moved to its present location in Hamburg s Stellingen district in br br br Biography br Hagenbeck was born on June to Claus Gottfried Carl Hagenbeck a fishmonger who ran a side business buying showing and selling exotic animals br When Hagenbeck was his father gave him some seals and a polar bear He took a more proactive role in the animal trade and his collection of animals grew until he needed large buildings to keep them Hagenbeck left his home in Hamburg to accompany hunters and explorers on trips to jungle regions and snow clad mountains He captured animals in nearly every continent in the world In he decided to exhibit Samoan and S mi people then known as Laplanders as purely natural populations with their tents weapons sleds near a group of reindeer br In Hagenbeck began to exhibit his animals in all the large cities of Europe as well as in the United States merging his interests in commercial success the preservation and acclimatization of animals and bringing the exotic to industrializing countries br In he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian Sudan to bring back some wild beasts and Nubians The Nubian exhibit was a success in Europe and toured Paris London and Berlin In his agent Johan Adrian Jacobsen recruited a group of eight Labrador Inuit The group toured Hamburg Berlin Prague Frankfurt Darmstadt Krefeld and Paris One member of the group Abraham Ulrikab kept a diary during his travels in Europe All eight Inuit were killed by smallpox br Hagenbeck s exhibit of human beings considered as savages in a natural state was the probable source of inspiration for Albert Geoffroy Saint Hilaire s similar human zoo exhibition in the Jardin d acclimatation in Paris Saint Hilaire organized in two ethnological exhibitions presenting Nubians and Greenlandic Inuit to the public thereby doubling the number of visitors of the zoo br br Hagenbeck also trained animals for his circuses at the World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago Illinois in and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis in br Hagenbeck s circus was one of the most popular attractions His collection included large animals and reptiles Many of the animals were trained to do tricks The circus that Hagenbeck assembled for the Louisiana Purchase Expo was purchased and merged into the B E Wallace Circus as the Hagenbeck Wallace Circus Hagenbeck s trained animals also performed at amusement parks in New York City s Coney Island before br Hagenbeck planned a permanent exhibit where animals could live in surroundings like their natural homes Despite the existence of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg Hagenbeck opened his great zoo the Tierpark Hagenbeck at Stellingen near Hamburg in br In he supervised the building of the Giardino Zoologico in Rome Today his ideas are followed by most large zoos br In Hagenbeck used his skills as an animal collector to capture a thousand camels for the German Empire for use in Africa He described his adventures and his methods of capturing and training animals in his book Beasts and Men published in br Hagenbeck was one of the first Europeans to report living dinosaurs In Beasts and Men Hagenbeck claimed he had received reports of a huge monster half elephant half dragon inhabiting the interior of Rhodesia Hagenbeck thought the animal was some kind of dinosaur similar to a brontosaurus and unsuccessfully searched for it His claim made headlines in newspapers around the world and helped launch legends of living dinosaurs br Hagenbeck died on April in Hamburg from a bite by a snake probably a boomslang After
