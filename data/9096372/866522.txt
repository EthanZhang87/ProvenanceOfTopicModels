Human zoos also known as ethnological expositions were public displays of people usually in a so called natural or primitive state They were most prominent during the th and th centuries These displays sometimes emphasized the supposed inferiority of the exhibits culture and implied the superiority of Western society through tropes that purported marginalized groups as savage They then developed into independent displays emphasizing the exhibits inferiority to western culture and providing further justification for their subjugation Such displays featured in multiple colonial exhibitions and at temporary exhibitions in animal zoos br br br Circuses and freak shows br br The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as colonialism In the Western Hemisphere one of the earliest known zoos that of Moctezuma in Mexico consisted not only of a vast collection of animals but also exhibited humans for example dwarves albinos and hunchbacks br During the Renaissance the Medici developed a large menagerie in the Vatican In the th century Cardinal Hippolytus Medici had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals He is reported as having a troupe of so called Savages speaking over twenty languages there were also Moors Tartars Indians Turks and Africans In Englishman William Dampier exhibited a tattooed native of Miangas whom he bought when he was in Mindanao He also intended to exhibit the man s mother to earn more profit but the mother died at sea The man was named Jeoly falsely branded as Prince Giolo to attract more audience and was exhibited for three months straight until he died of smallpox in London br br One of the first modern public human exhibitions was P T Barnum s exhibition of Joice Heth on February and subsequently the Siamese twins Chang and Eng Bunker These exhibitions were common in freak shows Another famous example was that of Saartjie Baartman of the Namaqua often referred to as the Hottentot Venus who was displayed in London and France until her death in br During the s Maximo and Bartola two microcephalic children from El Salvador were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians However human zoos would become common only in the s in the midst of the New Imperialism period br From to the Canadian province of Ontario displayed White French Canadian quintuplets whom the provincial government had removed from their birth family in a human zoo called Quintland br br br Start of human exhibits br br In the s exhibitions of so called exotic populations became popular throughout the western world Human zoos could be seen in many of Europe s largest cities such as Paris Hamburg London and Milan as well as American cities such as New York City and Chicago Carl Hagenbeck an animal trader was one of the early proponents of this trend when in at the suggestion of Heinrich Leutemann he decided to exhibit Sami people with the Laplander Exhibition What differentiated Hagenbeck s exhibit from others was the fact that he showed these people with animals and plants to re create their natural environment He sold people the feeling of having travelled to these areas by witnessing his exhibits These exhibits were a massive success and only became larger and more elaborate From this point forward human exhibitions would lean towards stereotyping and projecting western superiority Greater feeding into the Imperialist narrative that these people s culture merited subjugation It also promoted scientific racism where they were classified as more or less civilized on a scale from great apes to western Europeans br Hagenbeck would go on to launch a Nubian Exhibit in and an Inuit exhibit in These were also massively successful br Aside from Hagenbeck the Jardin d Acclimatation was also a hotspot of ethnological exhibits Geoffroy de Saint Hilaire director of the Jardin d Acclimatation decided in to organize two ethnological exhibits that also presented Nubians and Inuit That year the audience of the Jardin d acclimatation doubled to one million Between and approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the Jardin zoologique d acclimatation br These displays were so successful they were incorporated into both the and the Parisian World s Fair which presented a Negro Village Visited by million people the World s Fair displayed indigenous people as the major attraction br In Amsterdam the International Colonial and Export Exhibition had a display of people native to Suriname in br In the Spanish displayed natives of the Philippines in an exhibition as people whom they civilized This event added flame to the Philippine revolution Queen Consort of Spain Maria Cristina of Austria afterwards institutionalized the business of human zoos By indigenous Igorot people animals were sent to Madrid and were exhibited in a human zoo at the newly constructed Palacio de Cristal del Retiro br At both the World s Columbian Exposition and the Pan American Exposition Little Egypt a bellydancer was photographed as a catalogued type by Charles Dudley Arnold and Harlow Higginbotha br At the African Exhibition in The Crystal Palace around eighty people from Somalia were displayed in an exotic setting br The Brussels International Exposition in Tervuren featured a Congolese Village that displayed African people in ersatz interpretations of native settings br br br German ethnographs br Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the s as human displays were incorporated into zoos These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community Very quickly the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life br In the late th century German ethnographic museums were seen as an empirical study of human culture They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas br br br Objectification in human zoos br Within the history of human zoos there are patterns of overt sexual representation of displayed peoples most frequently women These objectifications often lead to treatment that reflect a lack of privacy and respect including the dissection and display of bodies after death without consent br An example of the sexualization of ethnically diverse women in Europe is Saartje Baartman often referred to as her anglicized name Sarah Bartmann Bartmann was displayed both when she was alive throughout England and Ireland and after her death in The Mus e de l Homme While alive she participated in a traveling show depicting her as a savage female with a large focus on her body The clothes she was put in were tight and close to her skin color and spectators were encouraged to see for themselves if Bartmann s body particularly her buttocks were real through poking and pushing Her living display was financially compensated but there is no record of her consenting to be examined and displayed after death br Dominika Czarnecka theorizes of the relationship between the radicalization and sexualization of black female bodies in her journal article Black Female Bodies and the White View Czarnecka focuses on ethnographic shows that were prominent in Polish territory in the late th century She argues that an essential part of why these shows were so popular is the display of the black female body Although the women in the shows were meant to be depicting Amazon warriors their wardrobe was not similar to amazonian dress and there are several documentations of comments from spectators about their revealing clothes and their bodies br Although women were most frequently objectified there are a few instances of exotic men being displayed due to their favorable appearance Angelo Solimann was brought to Italy as a slave from Central Africa in the th century but ended up gaining a reputation in Viennese society for his fighting skills and vast knowledge about language and history Upon his death in this positive association did not prevent his body being stuffed and exhibited in the Viennese Natural History Museum for almost a decade br br br Around the turn of the century br In to increase the number of visitors the Cincinnati Zoo invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months br The World s Fair presented the famous diorama living in Madagascar while the Colonial exhibitions in Marseilles and and in Paris and also displayed humans in cages often nude or semi nude The exhibition in Paris was so successful that million people attended it in six months while a smaller counter exhibition entitled The Truth on the Colonies organized by the Communist Party attracted very few visitors in the first room it recalled Albert Londres and Andr Gide s critiques of forced labour in the colonies Nomadic Senegalese Villages were also presented br br In Madison Grant socialite eugenicist amateur anthropologist and head of the New York Zoological Society had Congolese pygmy Ota Benga put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside apes and other animals At the behest of Grant the zoo director William Hornaday placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees then with an orangutan named Dohong and a parrot and labeled him The Missing Link suggesting that in evolutionary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans It triggered protests from the city s clergymen but the public reportedly flocked to see it br On Monday September after just two days Hornaday decided to close the exhibition and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds often followed by a crowd howling jeering and yelling br br br First organized backlash br According to The New York Times although few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense Our race we think is depressed enough without exhibiting one of us with the apes said the Reverend James H Gordon superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn We think we are worthy of being considered human beings with souls br New York City Mayor George B McClellan Jr refused to meet with the clergymen drawing the praise of Hornaday who wrote to him When the history of the Zoological Park is written this incident will form its most amusing passage br As the controversy continued Hornaday remained unapologetic insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition In another letter he said that he and Grant who ten years later would publish the racist tract The Passing of the Great Race considered it imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to by the black clergymen br br saw one of the first widespread protests against human zoos at the Human Pavilion of an exposition in Osaka Japan The exhibition of Koreans and Okinawans in primitive housing incurred protests from the governments of Korea and Okinawa and a Formosan woman wearing Chinese dress angered a group of Chinese students studying abroad in Tokyo An Ainu schoolteacher was made to exhibit himself in the zoo to raise money for his schoolhouse as the Japanese government refused to pay The fact that the schoolteacher made eloquent speeches and fundraised for his school while wearing traditional dress confused the spectators An anonymous front page column in a Japanese magazine condemned these examples and the Human Pavilion in total calling it inhumane to exhibit people as spectacles br br br St Louis World s Fair br In over Filipinos were displayed at the St Louis World s Fair in association with the Summer Olympics Following the Spanish American War the United States had just acquired new territories such as Guam the Philippines and Puerto Rico The organizers of the World s Fair held Anthropology Days on August and Since the Paris Exposition human zoos as a key feature of world s fairs functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race progress and civilization These goals were followed also at the World s Fair Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia the Pacific Islands East Asia Africa the Middle East South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats Another indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition LPE including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School where American Indian boarding schools students demonstrated their successful assimilation The sporting event itself took place with the participation of about paid indigenous men no women participated in Anthropology Days though some notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team did compete in other athletic events at the LPE Contests included baseball throwing shot put running broad jumping weight lifting pole climbing and tugs of war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand According to theorist Susan Brownell world s fairs with their inclusion of human zoos and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time as they were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity Also one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events br While Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program they were closely associated with each other at the time and in history Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the real Olympic Games Additionally almost all of the athletic events were referred to as Olympian and the opening ceremony was held in May with dignitaries in attendance though the official Olympic program did not begin until July Also as previously noted one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events br Anthropology Days took place on August and with about paid indigenous men no women participated in Anthropology Days though some notably the Fort Shaw Indian School girls basketball team did compete in other athletic events at the LPE Contests included baseball throwing shot put running broad jumping weight lifting pole climbing and tugs of war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand br The exhibitions of the World s Fair inspired US military officer Truman Hunt to start his own human zoo of Head Hunting Igorrotes in Brooklyn Reports of questionable living conditions for its Filipino performers led the US Federal government to investigate Hunt s exhibition and eventually shut it down after Hunt was found guilty of wage theft from the performers br br br United Kingdom and France br Between May and October the Scottish National Exhibition opened by one of Queen Victoria s grandsons Prince Arthur of Connaught was held in Saughton Park Edinburgh One of the attractions was the Senegal Village with its French speaking Senegalese residents on show demonstrating their way of life art and craft while living in beehive huts br In the infrastructure of the Scottish National Exhibition in Edinburgh was used to construct the new Marine Gardens to the coast near Edinburgh at Portobello A group of Somali men women and children were shipped over to be part of the exhibition living in thatched huts br In a display at Belle Vue Zoo in Manchester England was entitled Cannibals and featured black Africans in supposedly native dress br In around other New Caledonian Kanaks were put on display at the Jardin d Acclimatation in Paris br br br Spain br br Between the end of the th century and the beginning of the th several exhibitions of non Western people were held in Spain following those held in other metropoli like the United Kingdom The first of them was held in by the Ministry of Overseas which exhibited a group of between forty and fifty Filipino people then a Spanish territory together with local products and plants in the Retiro Park in Madrid For this exhibition the Palacio de Cristal del Retiro was built as well as its pond which sought to recreate the natural habitat of the exposed people At least four people died during the exhibition In the following years private companies organized similar exhibitions in Barcelona and Madrid including of people who were not from Spanish territories like the Ashanti or the Inuit Until exhibitions of African people were held in the Ronda de la Universitat in Barcelona which were later taken to other European countries There are also records of another exhibition in the Ibero American Exposition of Seville in and an additional one of Fang people from Equatorial Guinea in Valencia in Until the Negro of Banyoles an embalmed African man was exhibited in the Darder Museum in Girona br br br United States s br By the s a new kind of human zoo appeared in America nude shows masquerading as education These included the Zoro Garden Nudist Colony at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego California and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco The former was supposedly a real nudist colony which used hired performers instead of actual nudists The latter featured women wearing cowboy hats gunbelts and boots and little else The Golden Gate fair also featured a Greenwich Village show described in the Official Guide Book as Model artists colony and revue theatre br br br Ethnological expositions during Nazi Germany br As ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around there were many repercussions for the performers Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany and there were many children that had been born in Germany Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against During the rise of the Nazi party the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat Although they were able to avoid concentration camps they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could The Hitler Youth did not allow children of foreign parents to participate and adults were rejected as German soldiers Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps br Hans Massaquoi in his book Destined to Witness observed a human zoo within the Hamburg zoo Tierpark Hagenbeck during the pre Nazi Germany period in which an African family was placed with the animals openly laughed at and otherwise treated rudely by the public crowd And then they turned upon him a fellow spectator due to his mixed appearance The date according to his book Destined to Witness was approximately br br br Exhibitions after br br As part of the Portuguese World Exhibition in members of a tribe from the Bissagos Islands of Guinea Bissau were displayed on an island in a lake in the Lisbon Tropical Botanical Garden br A Congolese village was displayed at the Brussels World s Fair The Congolese on display were among people including men women and children a total of families Eight month old baby Juste Bonaventure Langa died during Expo he rests in the Tervuren cemetery In mid July the Congolese protested the condescending treatment they were receiving from spectators and demanded to be sent home abruptly ending the exhibit and eliciting some sympathy from European newspapers br In April an example of an Ivory Coast village was presented as part of an African safari in Port Saint P re near Nantes in France later called Plan te Sauvage br In July the Augsburg Zoo in Germany hosted an African village featuring African crafts and African cultural performances The event was subject to widespread criticism Defenders of the event argued that it was not racist since it did not involve exhibiting Africans in a debasing way as had been done at zoos in the past Critics argued that presenting African culture in the context of a zoo contributed to exoticizing and stereotyping Africans thus laying the ground work for racial discrimination and that solidarity and mutual understanding with African people were not primary aims of the event br In August London Zoo displayed four human volunteers wearing fig leaves and bathing suits for four days br In Adelaide Zoo ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who as part of a study exercise had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day but then returned home by night The inhabitants took part in several exercises and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure br Also in pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan African Music Fespam were housed at a zoo in Brazzaville Congo Although members of the group of people among them an infant age three months were not officially on display it was necessary for them to collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food and they were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers by br In August as part of the Edinburgh International Festival South African theatre maker Brett Bailey s show Exhibit B was performed in the Playfair Library Hall University of Edinburgh then in September at The Barbican in London This explored the nature of Human Zoos and raised much controversy both amongst the performers and the audiences br With a view to tackling the morality of Human Zoo exhibits saw the poster exhibition Putting People on Display tour Glasgow School of Art the University of Edinburgh the University of Stirling the University of St Andrews and the University of Aberdeen Additional posters were added to a selection from the French ACHAC s exhibition Human Zoos the Invention of the Savage in relation to the Scottish dimension in hosting such shows br Tourism has been a prevalent problem particularly for indigenous peoples in voluntary
