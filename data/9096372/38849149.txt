title: Cattle slaughter in India
id: 38849149
Cattle slaughter in India especially cow slaughter is controversial because of cattle s status as endeared and respected living beings to adherents of Dharmic religions like Hinduism Buddhism Sikhism and Jainism Also many of the Zoroastrians Parsis living in India stopped eating beef out of respect as it is sacred for the people of Dharmic religions while it is an acceptable source of meat in Abrahamic religions like Islam Christianity and Judaism Cow slaughter has been shunned for a number of reasons specifically because of cow s association with Lord Krishna in Hinduism and because cattle have been an integral part of rural livelihoods as an economic necessity Cattle slaughter has also been opposed by various Indian religions because of the ethical principle of Ahimsa non violence and the belief in the unity of all life br Legislation against cattle slaughter is in place throughout most states and territories of India br On October the Supreme Court of India in a landmark judgement upheld the constitutional validity of anti cow slaughter laws enacted by various state governments of India out of states in India had various laws regulating the act of slaughtered cow prohibiting the slaughter or sale of cows Arunachal Pradesh Goa Kerala Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Tripura West Bengal Dadra and Nagar Haveli Daman and Diu and Puducherry are the places where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter The ban in Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh was lifted in As per existing meat export policy in India the export of beef meat of cow oxen and calf is prohibited Bone in meat carcass half carcass of buffalo is also prohibited and is not permitted to be exported Only the boneless meats of buffalo goat sheep and birds are permitted for export India feels that the restriction on export to only boneless meat with a ban on meat with bones will add to the brand image of Indian meat Animal carcasses are subjected to maturation for at least hours before deboning Subsequent heat processing during the bone removal operation is believed to be sufficient to kill the virus causing foot and mouth disease br The laws governing cattle slaughter in India vary greatly from state to state The Preservation protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases veterinary training and practice is Entry of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution meaning that State legislatures have exclusive powers to legislate the prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle Some states permit the slaughter of cattle with restrictions like a fit for slaughter certificate which may be issued depending on factors like age and sex of cattle continued economic viability etc Others completely ban cattle slaughter while there is no restriction in a few states On May the Ministry of Environment of the Government of India led by Bharatiya Janata Party imposed a ban on the sale and purchase of cattle for slaughter at animal markets across India under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals statutes although Supreme Court of India suspended the ban on sale of cattle in its judgement in July giving relief to beef and leather industries br According to a United States Department of Agriculture review India has rapidly grown to become the world s largest beef exporter accounting for of world s beef trade based on its large water buffalo meat processing industry Surveys of cattle slaughter operations in India have reported hygiene and ethics concerns According to United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and European Union India beef consumption per capita per year is the world s lowest amongst the countries it surveyed India produced million metric tons of beef in of which million metric tons was consumed domestically and million metric tons was exported According to a report India ranks fifth in the world in beef production and seventh in domestic consumption The Indian government requires mandatory microbiological and other testing of exported beef br br br History br br br Indian religions br The majority of scholars explain the veneration for cattle among Hindus in economic terms which includes the importance of dairy in the diet use of cow dung as fuel and fertilizer and the importance that cattle have historically played in agriculture Ancient texts such as Rig Veda Puranas highlight the importance of the cattle The scope extent and status of cows throughout during ancient India is a subject of debate According to D N Jha s work The Myth of the Holy Cow for example cows and other cattle were neither inviolable nor revered in the ancient times as they were later Grihya sutra recommends that beef be eaten by the mourners after a funeral ceremony as a ritual rite of passage According to Marvin Harris the Vedic literature is contradictory with some suggesting ritual slaughter and meat consumption while others suggesting a taboo on meat eating br br The protection of animal life was championed by Jainism on the grounds that violence against life forms is a source of suffering in the universe and a human being creates bad karma by violence against any living being The Chandogya Upanishad mentions the ethical value of Ahimsa or non violence towards all beings By mid st millennium BCE all three major Indian religions Hinduism Jainism and Buddhism were championing non violence as an ethical value and something that affected one s rebirth According to Harris by about CE food and feasting on animal slaughter were widely considered as a form of violence against life forms and became a religious and social taboo Ralph Fitch a gentleman merchant of London and one of the earliest English travellers to India wrote a letter home in stating They have a very strange order among them they worship a cow and esteem much of the cow s dung to paint the walls of their houses They eat no flesh but live by roots and rice and milk br The cow has been a symbol of wealth in India since ancient times br br br Hinduism br br According to Nanditha Krishna the cow veneration in ancient India during the Vedic era the religious texts written during this period called for non violence towards all bipeds and quadrupeds and often equated killing of a cow with the killing of a human being specifically a Brahmin Nanditha Krishna stated that the hymn of the Hindu scripture Atharvaveda BCE condemns all killings of men cattle and horses and prays to god Agni to punish those who kill br br According to Harris the literature relating to cow veneration became common in st millennium CE and by about CE vegetarianism along with a taboo against beef became a well accepted mainstream Hindu tradition This practice was inspired by the belief in Hinduism that a soul is present in all living beings life in all its forms is interconnected and non violence towards all creatures is the highest ethical value Vegetarianism is a part of the Hindu culture God Krishna one of the incarnations Avatar of Vishnu is associated with cows adding to its endearment br Study shows ancient Hindus ate meat heavy food Many ancient and medieval Hindu texts debate the rationale for a voluntary stop to cow slaughter and the pursuit of vegetarianism as a part of a general abstention from violence against others and all killing of animals Some significant debates between pro non vegetarianism and pro vegetarianism with mention of cattle meat as food is found in several books of the Hindu epic the Mahabharata particularly its Book III XII XIII and XIV It is also found in the Ramayana These two epics are not only literary classics but they have also been popular religious classics br The Mahabharata debate presents one meat producing hunter who defends his profession as dharmic The hunter in this ancient Sanskrit text states that meat consumption should be okay because animal sacrifice was practiced in the Vedic age that the flesh nourishes people that man must eat to live and plants like animals are alive too that the nature of life is such every life form eats the other that no profession is totally non violent because even agriculture destroys numerous living beings when the plough digs the land The hunter s arguments are states Alsdorf followed by stanzas that present support for restricted meat eating on specific occasions br The pro vegetarianism sections of these Hindu texts counter these views One section acknowledges that the Vedas do mention sacrifice but not killing the animal The proponents of vegetarianism state that Vedic teachings explicitly teach against killing its verses can be interpreted in many ways that the correct interpretation is of the sacrifice as the interiorized spiritual sacrifice one where it is an offering of truth satya and self restraint damah with the proper sacrifice being one with reverence as the sacrificial meal and Veda study as the herbal juices The sections that appeal for vegetarianism including abstention from cow slaughter state that life forms exist in different levels of development some life forms have more developed sensory organs that non violence towards fellow man and animals who experience pain and suffering is an appropriate ethical value It states that one s guiding principle should be conscientious atmaupamya literally to respect others as oneself br According to Ludwig Alsdorf Indian vegetarianism is unequivocally based on ahimsa non violence as evidenced by ancient smritis and other ancient texts of Hinduism He adds that the endearment and respect for cattle in Hinduism is more than a commitment to vegetarianism it has become integral to its theology According to Juli Gittinger it is often argued that cow sacredness and protection is a fundamental quality of Hinduism but she considers this to be a false claim This states Gittinger could be understood more as an example of sanskritization or presentation of certain traditions followed by its upper castes as purer informed form of Hinduism and possibly an influence of Jainism on Hinduism The respect for cattle is widespread but not universal Some Hindus Shaktism practice animal sacrifice and eat meat certain festivals According to Christopher Fuller animal sacrifices have been rare among the Hindus outside a few eastern states and Himalayan regions of the Indian subcontinent To the majority of modern Indians states Alsdorf respect for cattle and disrespect for slaughter is a part of their ethos and there is no ahimsa without renunciation of meat consumption br br br Jainism br Jainism is against violence to all living beings including cattle According to the Jaina sutras humans must avoid all killing and slaughter because all living beings are fond of life they suffer they feel pain they like to live and long to live All beings should help each other live and prosper according to Jainism not kill and slaughter each other br In the Jain tradition neither monks nor laypersons should cause others or allow others to work in a slaughterhouse Jains believe that vegetarian sources can provide adequate nutrition without creating suffering for animals such as cattle According to some Jain scholars slaughtering cattle increases ecological burden from human food demands since the production of meat entails intensified grain demands and reducing cattle slaughter by percent would free up enough land and ecological resources to solve all malnutrition and hunger worldwide The Jain community leaders states Christopher Chapple has actively campaigned to stop all forms of animal slaughter including cattle br Jains have led a historic campaign to ban the slaughter of cows and all other animals particularly during their annual festival of Paryushana also called Daslakshana by the Digambara Historical records for example state that the Jain leaders lobbied Mughal emperors to ban slaughter of cattles and other animals during this to day period In some cases such as during the th century rule of Akbar they were granted their request and an edict was issued by Akbar Jahangir revoked the ban upon coronation reinstated it in when Jain community approached and appealed to him then later reversed the ban with a new edict br br br Buddhism br The texts of Buddhism state ahimsa to be one of five ethical precepts which requires a practicing Buddhist to refrain from killing living beings Slaughtering cow has been a taboo with some texts suggest taking care of a cow is a means of taking care of all living beings Cattle is seen as a form of reborn human beings in the endless rebirth cycles in samsara protecting animal life and being kind to cattle and other animals is good karma The Buddhist texts state that killing or eating meat is wrong and they urge Buddhist laypersons to not operate slaughterhouses nor trade in meat Indian Buddhist texts encourage a plant based diet br Saving animals from slaughter for meat is believed in Buddhism to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth According to Richard Gombrich there has been a gap between Buddhist precepts and practice Vegetarianism is admired states Gombrich but often it is not practiced Nevertheless adds Gombrich there is a general belief among Theravada Buddhists that eating beef is worse than other meat and the ownership of cattle slaughterhouses by Buddhists is relatively rare br br br Islam br br With the arrival of Islamic rule as the Delhi Sultanate in the th century Islamic dietary practices entered India According to the verses of the Quran such as and God created cattle to benefit man and recommends Muslims to eat cattle meat but forbids pork Cattle slaughter had been and continued to be a religiously approved practice among the Muslim rulers and the followers of Islam particularly on festive occasions such as the Eid al Adha br The earliest texts on the invasion of the Indian subcontinent mention the cow slaughter taboo and its use by Muslim army commanders as a political message by committing the taboo inside temples For example in the early th century narrative of Al Biruni the story of th century Muhammad bin Qasim conquest of Multan is mentioned In this Al Biruni narrative according to Manan Ahmed Asif a historian of Islam in South and Southeast Asia Qasim first asserts the superiority of Islam over the polytheists by committing a taboo killing a cow and publicly soiling the idol giving the cow meat as an offering before allowing the temple to continue as a place of worship In the early th century Persian text of Chach Nama the defending fort residents call the attacking Muslims in rage as Chandalas and cow eaters but adds Andr Wink the text is silent about cow worship In the texts of court historians of the Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire cow slaughter taboo in India is mentioned as well as cow slaughter as a means of political message desecration as well as its prohibition by Sultans and Muslim Emperors as a means of accommodation of public sentiments in the Indian subcontinent br In in what was his fourth invasion of India the founder of the Durrani Empire Ahmad Sh h Durr n sacked Delhi and plundered Agra Mathura and Vrindavan On his way back to Afghanistan he attacked the Golden Temple in Amritsar and filled its sacred pool with the blood of slaughtered cows br While most Muslims consider cattle to be a source of religiously acceptable meat some Muslim Sufi sects of India practiced vegetarianism br br br Christianity br br Christianity is one of India s largest religions after Hinduism and Islam with approximately million followers constituting percent of India s population census According to legend the Christian faith was introduced to India by Thomas the Apostle who supposedly reached the Malabar Coast Kerala in AD Later Christianity also arrived on the Indian sea coast with Christian travelers and merchants br Christians are a significant minority and a major religious group in three states of India Meghalaya Mizoram and Nagaland and a plurality of Christians exists in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh Other states with significant Christian populations include Coastal Andhra Tamil Nadu Kerala Kanara the southern shore and northeast India Christians in India especially the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala follow Hindu practices to an extent Moreover a significant number of Indians profess personal Christian faith outside the domain of traditional and institutionalized Christianity and do not associate with any Church or its conventional code of belief In Christianity no dietary restrictions apply to any kind of meats which have been eaten by Christians in across of India for centuries br br br Mughal Empire br br Cattle slaughter in accordance with the Islamic custom was practiced in the Mughal Empire under its Sunni rulers Despite the legality of bovine slaughter Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman stated that no one dared publicly to slaughter cows particularly in Hindu dominated areas as people could instantly punish the culprit br The Mughal emperor Humayun opposed cow slaughter and refused to eat beef in an incident as cited by Jouher after the killing of cows in a Hindu territory by his soldiers led to clashes in the Tezkereh al Vakiat Though historians doubt translation capabilities of Tezkereh al Vakiat by a British officer Major Charles Stewart there is enough hint that the early Mughal emperors were averse to cow slaughter for beef During Akbar s reign there was a strict ban on cow slaughter This was followed by his son Jehangir and then Shah Jahan as well br It is well known that emperor Aurangzeb followed a hard line against Hindus In soon after being appointed Governor of Gujarat by Shah Jahan Aurangzeb desecrated the Chintamani Parshvanath Jain temple near Sarashpur Gujarat by killing a cow inside the Jain temple and lopping off the noses of the statues and converting it into a mosque calling it the Might of Islam In present day Punjab a Hindu delegation to the th Sikh guru Guru Tegh Bahadur requested him to ban cow slaughter and told him Cows are everywhere being slaughtered If any cow or buffalo belonging to a Hindu is mortally ill the Qazi comes and kills it on the spot Muslims then flay it cut it in pieces and carry it away This causes us much distress If we fail to inform the Qazi when a beast is dying he punishes us saying Why did you not tell me Now its spirit has gone to hell whereas had it been killed in the approved Muslim manner its spirit would have gone to paradise br Experts however doubt that Aurangzeb would have lifted the ban on cow slaughter enforced by his predecessors Even during later Mughal period there are documented references about the ban During Emperor Farrukhsiyar s rule for instance there is documentary evidence of a royal trial over accusations of cow slaughter There are references though that the ban would be relaxed during Bakr Id br br br Maratha Empire br According to Ian Copland and other scholars the Maratha Empire which led a Hindu rebellion against the Muslim Mughal Empire and created a Hindu state in the th and th centuries respected mosques mausoleums and Sufi pirs However the Maratha polity sharply enforced the Hindu sentiments for cow protection This may be linked to the Bhakti movement that developed before the rise of the Maratha Empire states Copland where legends and a theology based on the compassion and love stories of Hindu god Krishna himself a cowherd became integral to regional religiosity br The Mahratha confederacy adopted the same approach with Portuguese Christians in the Western Ghats and the peninsular coastal regions Marathas were liberal state Copland and others they respected Christian priests allowed the building of churches and gave state land to Christian causes However cattle protection expected by the Hindu majority was the state norm which Portuguese Christians were required to respect br br br Sikh Empire br Cow slaughter was banned by Maharajah Ranjit Singh the founder of the Sikh Empire in Punjab Many butcher houses were banned and restrictions were put on the slaughter of cow and sale of beef in the Sikh Empire as following the traditions cow was as sacred to the Hindus During the Sikh reign cow slaughter was a capital offence for which perpetrators were even executed br br br British rule br br With the advent of British rule in India eating beef along with drinking whiskey as it was part of their food culture in English language colleges in Bengal became a method of fitting in into the British culture Some Hindus in the s consumed beef to show how they derided irrational Hindu customs according to Barbara Metcalf and Thomas Metcalf br The reverence for the cow played a role in the Indian Rebellion of against the British East India Company Hindu and Muslim sepoys in the army of the East India Company came to believe that their paper cartridges which held a measured amount of gunpowder were greased with cow and pig fat as it was the best and easily accessible method available at that time for greasing weapons since cattle and pigs had a good amount of fat in them br Historians argue that the symbol of the cow was used as a means of mobilizing Hindus In the Namdhari Sikhs started the Kuka Revolution revolting against the British and seeking to protect the cows from slaughter A few years later Swami Dayananda Saraswati called for the stoppage of cow slaughter by the British and suggested the formation of Go samvardhani Sabhas In the s cow protection movements spread rapidly in Punjab North West Frontier Province Oudh State now Awadh and Rohilkhand The Arya Samaj had a tremendous role in skillfully converting this sentiment into a national movement br The first Gaurakshini sabha cow protection society was established in the Punjab in The movement spread rapidly all over North India and to Bengal Bombay Madras presidencies and Central Provinces The organization rescued wandering cows and reclaimed them to groom them in places called gaushalas cow refuges Charitable networks developed all through North India to collect rice from individuals pool the contributions and re sell them to fund the gaushalas Signatures up to in some places were collected to demand a ban on cow sacrifice Between and hundreds of gaushalas were opened br br Cow protection sentiment reached its peak in Large public meetings were held in Nagpur Haridwar and Benares to denounce beef eaters Melodramas were conducted to display the plight of cows and pamphlets were distributed to create awareness among those who sacrificed and ate them Riots broke out between Hindus and Muslims in Mau in the Azamgarh district it took days for the government to regain control However Muslims had interpreted this as a promise of protection for those who wanted to perform sacrifices br The series of violent incidences also resulted in a riot in Bombay involving the working classes and unrest occurred in places as far away as Rangoon Burma An estimated thirty one to forty five communal riots broke out over six months and a total of people were killed br Queen Victoria mentioned the cow protection movement in a letter dated December to then Viceroy Lansdowne writing The Queen greatly admired the Viceroy s speech on the Cow killing agitation While she quite agrees in the necessity of perfect fairness she thinks the Muhammadans do require more protection than Hindus and they are decidedly by far the more loyal Though the Muhammadan s cow killing is made the pretext for the agitation it is in fact directed against us who kill far more cows for our army c than the Muhammadans br Cow slaughter was opposed by some prominent leaders of the independence movement such as Mahatma Gandhi Bal Gangadhar Tilak Lala Lajpat Rai Madan Mohan Malviya Rajendra Prasad and Purushottam Das Tandon They supported a ban on cattle slaughter once India gained its independence from the colonial British br Gandhi supported cow protection and opposed cow slaughter explaining the reverence for cow in March Gandhi supported the leather industry but stated that slaughter is unnecessary because the skin can be sourced from cattle after its natural death br Gandhi said I worship it cow and I shall defend its worship against the whole world and that the cow is a poem of pity One reads pity in the gentle animal She is the mother to millions of Indian mankind Protection of the cow means protection of the whole dumb creation of God Gandhi considered cow protection as integral to Hindu beliefs and called cow protection to me is one of the most wonderful phenomena in human evolution and cow protection is the gift of Hinduism to the world that it is not Tilak or mantra or caste rules that judge Hindus but their ability to protect the cow According to Gandhi cow protection means protection of lives that are helpless and weak in the world I would not kill a human being for protection a cow added Gandhi and I will not kill a cow for saving a human life be it ever so precious br On July in a prayer meeting Gandhi opposed laws that were derived from religion He said In India no law can be made to ban cow slaughter I do not doubt that Hindus are forbidden the slaughter of cows I have been long pledged to serve the cow but how can my religion also be the religion of the rest of the Indians It will mean coercion against those Indians who are not Hindus According to Gandhi Hindus should not demand cow slaughter laws based on their religious texts or sentiments in the same way that Muslims should not demand laws based on Shariat Quran Hadith in India or Pakistan br In one of the Special Committees of the Indian National Congress stated that slaughter of cow and its progeny must be totally prohibited However another Committee of the Congress opposed cow slaughter prohibition stating that the skin and leather of cow and its progeny which is fresh by slaughter should be sold and exported to earn foreign exchange br In the British placed restrictions on cattle slaughter in India on the grounds that the shortage of cattle was causing anxiety to the Government The shortage itself was attributed to the increased demand for cattle for cultivation transport milk and other purposes It was decided that in respect of slaughter by the army authorities working cattle as well as cattle fit for bearing offspring should not be slaughtered Accordingly the slaughter of all cattle below years of age male cattle between and years female cattle between and years of age which are capable of producing milk as well as all cows which are pregnant or in milk was prohibited br During the British Raj there were several cases of communal riots caused by the slaughter of cows A historical survey of some major communal riots between and revealed that out of incidents of rioting between Hindus and Muslims that although in some cases the reasons for provocation of the riots was not given cases were attributable directly to cow slaughter br br br Post Independence br br The Central Government in a letter dated December directed the State Governments not to introduce total prohibition on slaughter stating Hides from slaughtered cattle are much superior to hides from the fallen cattle and fetch a higher price In the absence of slaughter the best type of hide which fetches good price in the export market will no longer be available A total ban on slaughter is thus detrimental to the export trade and work against the interest of the Tanning industry in the country br In a senior Congress member of parliament Seth Govind Das drafted a bill for India s parliament for a nationwide ban on cow slaughter stating that a large majority of the party was in favour India s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru opposed this national ban on cow slaughter and threatened to resign if the elected representatives passed the bill in India s parliament The bill failed by a vote of to Nehru declared that it was individual states to decide their laws on cow slaughter states Donald Smith and criticized the ban on cow slaughter as a wrong step However Nehru s opposition was largely irrelevant states Steven Wilkinson because under India s Constitution and federal structure laws such as those on cattle slaughter has been an exclusive State subject rather than being a Central subject State legislatures such as those of Uttar Pradesh Bihar Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh enacted their own laws in the s br br In a lawsuit was instigated in the Supreme Court of India regarding the constitutionality of the slaughter ban laws in the state where Qureshi petitioned that the laws infringed on Muslim rights to freely practice their religion such as sacrificing cows on Bakr Id day The Court determined that neither the Quran nor the Hidaya mandates cow slaughter and the Islamic texts allow a goat or camel be sacrificed instead Therefore according to the Court a total ban on cow slaughter did not infringe on the religious freedom of Muslims under Articles or of its Constitution br In Indian independence activist Jayaprakash Narayan wrote a letter to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi calling for a ban on cow slaughter Narayan wrote For myself I cannot understand why in a Hindu majority country like India where rightly or wrongly there is such a strong feeling about cow slaughter there cannot be a legal ban In the same year the Hindu organisations started an agitation demanding a ban on the slaughter of cows But Indira Gandhi did not accede to the demand br In July the Government of India stated before the Supreme Court that It is obvious that the Central Government as a whole is encouraging scientific and sustainable development of livestock resources and their efficient utilization which inter alia includes production of quality meat for export as well as for domestic market This is being done with a view of increasing the national wealth as well as better returns to the farmer In recent decades the Government has started releasing grants and loans for setting up of modern slaughter houses br br br Contemporary issues br br br Hygiene br Poor hygiene and prevalence of meat borne disease has been reported in studies of Indian cattle slaughter houses For example in a survey of slaughtered cattle in Kerala slaughter houses Prabhakaran and other scholars reported cases of echinococcosis and cases of cysticercosis the former affecting livers and lungs The cattle liver was affected by disease in of cattle and the lung in br A study by Sumanth and other scholars on cattle slaughtered in Karnataka reported more than of the carcasses were infected with schistosoma eggs and worms A report by Ravindran indicated over of cattle slaughtered in Wayanad were infected However the population size was very limited and usually restricted to a single slaughter house skewing the results br br br Illegal slaughterhouses and cattle theft br br According to media reports India has numerous illegal slaughterhouses For example in the state of Andhra Pradesh the officials in reported over illegal slaughterhouses Cattle are traditionally left to freely roam streets and graze in India These are easy prey to thieves state Rosanna Masiola and Renato Tomei According to The New York Times the organized mafia gangs pick up the cattle they can find and sell them to these illegal slaughterhouses These crimes are locally called cattle rustling or cattle lifting In many cases the cows belong to poor dairy farmers who lack the facility or infrastructure to feed and maintain the cows and they don t traditionally keep them penned According to Masiola and Tomei the increasing meat consumption has led to cows becoming a target for theft br The theft of cattle for slaughter and beef production is economically attractive to the mafias in India In states Gardiner Harris a truck can fit cows each fetching about rupees about US in or over US per cattle stealing night operation In a country where some million people live on less than US per day such theft based mafia operations are financially attractive According to Andrew Buncombe when smuggled across its border the price per cattle is nearly threefold higher and the crime is financially more attractive Many states have reported rising thefts of cattle and associated violence according to The Indian Express br According to T N Madan Muslim groups have been accused of stealing cattle as a part of their larger violence against non Muslims Cattle theft states David Gilmartin and other scholars was a common crime in British India and has been a trigger for riots br According to the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star some of cattle theft operations move the cattle stolen in India across the border into Bangladesh ahead of festivals such as Eid ul Azha when the demand for meat increases The criminals dye the white or red cows into black to make identifying the stolen cow difficult The Border Guard Bangladesh in reported of confiscating stolen cattle where some of cattle s original skin color had been tampered with Hundreds of thousands of cows states the British newspaper The Independent are illegally smuggled from India into Bangladesh every year to be slaughtered Gangs from both sides of the border are involved in this illegal smuggling involving an estimated million lakhs cattle a year and cattle theft is a source of the supply states Andrew Buncombe According to Zahoor Rather trade in stolen cattle is one of the important crime related border issues between India and Bangladesh br br br Castes and religions br br Hindu views on cattle slaughter and beef eating is caste based while other scholars disagree Dalit Hindus who eat beef state the former while those who don t state that the position of Dalit Hindus on cattle slaughter is ambiguous br Deryck Lodrick states for example beef eating is common among low caste Hindus and vegetarianism is an upper caste phenomenon In contrast cow cherishing Krishna worshipping rustic piety state Susan Bayly and others has been popular among agriculture driven cattle husbandry farm laboring and merchant castes These have typically been considered the low castes in Hinduism According to Bayly reverence for the cow is widely shared in India across castes The traditional belief has also associated death or the dead with being unclean polluting or defiling such as those who handle corpse carrion and animal remains However the tradition differentiates between natural or accidental death and intentional slaughter According to Frederick J Simoons many members of low castes and tribal groups in India reject cow slaughter and beef eating some of them quite strongly while others support beef eating and cattle slaughter br According to Simoons and Lodrick the reverence for cattle among Hindus and Indians in general is more comprehensively understood by considering both the religious dimensions and the daily lives in rural India The veneration of cow across various Hindu castes states Lodrick emerged with the fifteenth century revival of Vaishnavism when god Krishna along with his cows became a popular object of bhakti devotional worship In contrast other scholars such as J A B van Buitenen and Daniel Sheridan state that the theology and the most popular texts related to Krishna such as the Bhagavad Gita was composed by about nd century BCE and the Bhagavata Purana was composed between and CE br According to People s Union for Democratic Rights PUDR some Dalits work in leather which includes cow skin and they rely on it for their livelihood The position of Dalits to cow protection is highly ambivalent states PUDR given their Hindu identity and the endemic contradiction between the Hindu ethos of protecting the cow and a trade dependent fundamentally on the skin of cows The selling of old cattle for skin according to them is supported by members of both dominant and subordinate castes for the leather related economy Dominant groups officials and even some Dalits state that Dalits are cow protectors The inclusion of Dalits in cow protection ideology according to PUDR is accompanied by avowal of loyalty to cow protection exposing the fragility of the cow protection ideology across castes br Some Dalit student associations in the Hyderabad region state that beef preparations such as beef biryani is the traditional food of low castes Historical evidence does not support this claim state Claude Levy Straus and Brigitte Sebastia Beef as the traditional food of impoverished Dalits is a reconstruction of history and Indian beef dishes are a Mughal era innovation and more recently invented tradition It is the nineteenth century politics that has associated beef and cattle slaughter with Muslim and Dalit identity states Sebastia br br br Economic imperative br According to anthropologist Marvin Harris the importance of cattle to Hindus and other religious groups is beyond religion because the cattle has been and remains an important pillar of rural economy In the traditional economy states Harris a team of oxen is Indian peasant s tractor thresher and family car combined and the cow is the factory that produces those oxen The cattle produce nutritious milk their dung when dried serves as a major cooking fuel and for the poor the cattle is an essential partner in many stages of agriculture When cattle fall sick the family worries over them like Westerners do over their pets or family members A natural loss of a cattle from untimely death can cripple a poor family and thus slaughtering a creature so useful and essential is unthinkable According to Harris India s unpredictable monsoons and famines over its history meant even greater importance of cattle because Indian breeds of cattle can survive with little food and water for extended periods of time br According to Britha Mikkelsen and other scholars cow dung produced by young and old cattle is the traditional cooking fuel as dung cakes and fertilizer in India The recycling substitutes over million tons of fossil fuels or million tons of wood every year providing the majority of cooking fuel needs in rural India In addition to being essential fuel for rural family cattle manure is a significant source of fertilizer in Indian agriculture br The Indian religions adapted to the rural economic constraints states Harris Preserving cattle by opposing slaughter has been and remains an economic necessity and an insurance for the impoverished The cow is sacred in India states Harris not because of superstitious capricious and ignorant beliefs but because of real economic imperatives and cattle s role in the Indian tradition of integrated living Cattle became essential in India just like dogs or cars became essential in other human cultures states Harris br br br Animal cruelty br The slaughterhouses in India have been accused of cruelty against animals by PETA and other humane treatment of animals groups According to PETA and these groups the slaughterhouse workers slit animals throats with dull blades and let them bleed to death Cattle are skinned and dismembered while they are still alive and in full view of other animals br The Supreme Court of India in February ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather The Court has also ruled that the Indian Constitution requires Indian citizens to show compassion to the animal kingdom respect the fundamental rights of animals and asked the states to prevent cruelty to animals br br br Vigilantism br br According to Judith Walsh widespread cow protection riots occurred repeatedly in British India in the s and s These were observed in regions of Punjab United Provinces Bihar Bengal Bombay Presidency and in parts of South Burma Rangoon The anti Cow Killing riots of in Punjab caused the death of at least people The cow killing riots started during the Muslim festival of Bakr Id the riot repeated in and they were the largest riots in British India after the revolt One of the issues states Walsh in these riots was the Muslim slaughter of cows for meat particularly as part of religious festivals such as Bakr Id br According to Mark Doyle the first cow protection societies on the Indian subcontinent were started by Kukas of Sikhism also called Namdharis The Sikh Kukas or Namdharis were agitating for cow protection after the British annexed Punjab In states Peter van der Veer Sikhs killed Muslim butchers of cows in Amritsar and Ludhiana and viewed cow protection as a sign of the moral quality of the state According to Barbara Metcalf and Thomas Metcalf Sikhs were agitating for the well being of cows in the s and their ideas spread to Hindu reform movements Cattle protection related violence continued at numerous occasions often over the Muslim festival of Bakri Id in the first half of the th century br Cow slaughter in contemporary India has triggered riots and violent vigilante groups br According to PUDR the Vishwa Hindu Parishad a Hindu group and the Gauraksha Samiti have defended violent vigilantism around cow protection as sentiments against the sin of cow slaughter and not related to the social identity of the victims Various groups such as the families of Dalits who were victims of a mob violence linked to cow slaughter in did not question the legitimacy of cow protection br According to a Reuters report citing IndiaSpend analysis a total of Indians of them Muslims have been killed and injured between and June in cow related violence br br br Stray cattle br br Fear of arrest persecution and of lynching by cow vigilantes has reduced the trading of cattle Once a cow stops giving milk feeding and maintenance of the cow becomes a financial burden on the farmer who cannot afford their upkeep Cattle that farmers are unable to sell are eventually abandoned br India has over million stray cattle according to the livestock census data released in January The stray cow attacks on humans and crops in both urban and rural areas is an issue for the residents Stray cattle are a nuisance to traffic in urban areas and frequently cause road accidents The problem of solid waste pollution especially plastic pollution and garbage dumped at public places poses a risk to stray cattle which feed on garbage br br br Legislation br br The Preservation protection and improvement of stock and prevention of animal diseases veterinary training and practice is Entry of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution meaning that State Legislatures have exclusive powers to legislate the prevention of slaughter and preservation of cattle br The prohibition of cow slaughter is also one of the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Article of the Constitution It reads The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds and prohibiting the slaughter of cows and calves and other milch and draught cattle br Several State Governments and Union Territories UTs have enacted cattle preservation laws in one form or the other Arunachal Pradesh Kerala Meghalaya Mizoram Nagaland Tripura Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have no legislation All other states UTs have enacted legislation to prevent the slaughter of cow and its progeny Kerala is a major consumer of beef and has no regulation on the slaughter of cow and its progeny As a result cattle is regularly smuggled into Kerala from the neighbouring States of Tamil Nadu Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for the purpose of slaughter There have been several attacks on cow transporters on the suspicion of carrying cows for slaughter Between May and May at least ten Muslims were killed in these attacks br In Muslims of Bihar petitioned the Supreme Court of India that the ban on cow slaughter violated their religious right The Court unanimously rejected their claim br In several cases such as Mohd Hanif Qureshi v State of Bihar AIR SCR Hashumatullah v State of Madhya Pradesh Abdul Hakim and others v State of Bihar AIR SC and Mohd Faruk v State of Madhya Pradesh the Supreme Court has held that A total ban on cattle slaughter was not permissible if under economic conditions keeping useless bull or bullock be a burden on the society and therefore not in the public interest The clause under economic conditions keeping useless has been studied by the Animal Welfare Board of India which determined that the fuel made from cow dung for household cooking purposes in the Indian society suggests that the cattle is never useless while it produces dung br In May Bombay High Court gave the judgement that consumption or possession of beef is legal under Article of Constitution of India but upheld the ban on cow slaughter in the state of Maharashtra br The Supreme Court of India heard a case between and The case petitioned the Court to order a ban on the common illegal treatment of animals during transport and slaughter In February the Court ordered a state governments to stop the illegal slaughterhouses and set up enforcement committees to monitor the treatment of animals used for meat and leather The Court has also ruled according to a Times of India report that it was evident from the combined reading of Articles and A g of the Indian Constitution that citizens must show compassion to the animal kingdom The animals have their own fundamental rights Article specifically lays down that the state shall endeavour to prohibit the slaughter of cows and calves other milch and draught cattle br br br Non uniformity br No state law explicitly bans the consumption of beef There is a lack of uniformity among State laws governing cattle slaughter The strictest laws are in Delhi Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Jammu and Kashmir Ladakh Punjab Rajasthan and Uttarakhand where the slaughter of cow and its progeny including bulls and bullocks of all ages is completely banned However in Uttarakhand slaughter of cows and bulls which are deemed to be injured or otherwise useless is permitted with necessary permission Most States prohibit the slaughter of cows of all ages However Assam and West Bengal permit the slaughter of cows of over the ages of and years respectively Most States prohibit the slaughter of calves whether male or female With the exception of Bihar and Rajasthan where age of a calf is given as below years the other States have not defined the age of a calf According to the National Commission on Cattle the definition of a calf being followed in Maharashtra by some executive instructions was below the age of year br In Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu Delhi Goa Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Puducherry Punjab Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand violation of State laws on cattle slaughter are both cognizable and non bailable offences Most of other states specify that offences would be cognizable only The maximum term of imprisonment varies from months to years life term and the fine from to Delhi and Madhya Pradesh have fixed a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment at months br Cows are routinely shipped to states with lower or no requirement for slaughter even though it is illegal in most states to ship animals across state borders to be slaughtered Many illegal slaughterhouses operate in large cities such as Chennai and Mumbai As of there were legal and illegal slaughterhouses in India Efforts to close them down have so far been largely unsuccessful In Andhra Pradesh estimated that there were illegal and licensed slaughterhouses in the State br br br Legislative history br br br Constituent Assembly br After India attained Independence the members of the Constituent Assembly a body consisting of indirectly elected representatives set up for the purpose of drafting a constitution for India debated the question of making a provision for the protection and preservation of the cow in the Constitution of India An amendment for including a provision in the Directive Principles of State Policy as Article A was introduced by Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava The amendment read The State shall endeavour to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and shall in particular take steps for preserving and improving the breeds of cattle and prohibit the slaughter of cow and other useful cattle specially milch and draught cattle and their young stock br Another amendment motion was moved by Seth Govind Das who sought to extend the scope of the provisions for prohibiting slaughter to cover cow and its progeny by adding the following words at the end of Bhargava s amendment The word cow includes bulls bullocks young stock of genus cow Bhargava s amendment was passed by the Constituent Assembly but Das was rejected br Pandit Thakur Dass Bhargava East Punjab Seth Govind Das Central Provinces and Berar Shibban Lal Saksena United Provinces Ram Sahai United State of Gwalior Indore Malwa Madhya Bharat Raghu Vira Central Provinces and Berar and Raghunath Vinayak Dhulekar United Provinces strongly pleaded for the inclusion of a provision in the Constitution for prohibiting the slaughter of cows Although some members were keen on including the provision in the chapter on Fundamental Rights but later as a compromise and on the basis of an assurance given by B R Ambedkar the amendment was moved for inclusion as a Directive Principle of State Policy br Bhargava stated that While moving this amendment I have hesitation in stating that for people like me and those that do not agree with the point of view of Ambedkar and others this entails in a way a sort of sacrifice Seth Govind Das had sent one such amendment to be included in the Fundamental Rights and other members also had sent similar amendments To my mind it would have been much better if this could have been incorporated in the Fundamental Rights but some of my Assembly friends differed and it is the desire of Ambedkar that this matter instead of being included in Fundamental Rights should be incorporated in the Directive Principles As a matter of fact it is the agreed opinion of the Assembly that this problem should be solved in such a manner that the objective is gained without using any sort of coercion I have purposely adopted this course as to my mind the amendment fulfills our object and is midway between the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights Bhargava also observed that I do not want that due to its inclusion in the Fundamental Rights non Hindus should complain that they have been forced to accept a certain thing against their will The result of the debate in the Constituent Assembly was that the Bhargava s amendment was carried and the Article in its present form exists as Article of the Constitution as one of the Directive Principles of State Policy br br br Parliament br A number of Private Member s Bills and Resolutions regarding the prevention of cow slaughter have been introduced in both Houses of Parliament from time to time However none have been successful in obtaining a complete nationwide ban on cow slaughter Attempts to address the issue through a central legislation or otherwise are described below br Vinoba Bhave went on an indefinite fast from April demanding that the Governments of West Bengal and Kerala agree to enact legislation banning cow slaughter On April a Private Members Resolution was passed in the Lok Sabha by votes to with absentees It read This House directs the Government to ensure total ban on the slaughter of cows of all ages and calves in consonance with the Directive Principles laid down in Article of the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court as well as necessitated by strong economic considerations based on the recommendations of the Cattle Preservation and Development Committee and the reported fast by Acharya Vinoba Bhave from st April br Then Prime Minister Morarji Desai later announced in Parliament that the government would initiate action for amending the Constitution with a view to conferring legislative competence on the Union Parliament for legislating on the subject of cow protection Accordingly a Constitution Amendment Bill seeking to bring the subject of prevention of cow slaughter on to the Concurrent List was introduced in the Lok Sabha on May The Bill however lapsed on account of dissolution of the Sixth Lok Sabha Bhave reiterated his demand for a total ban on cow slaughter in July while addressing the All India Goseva Sammelan He also requested that cows should not be taken from one State to another br In the question of amending the Constitution by introducing a Bill was again examined by the Government but in view of the sensitive nature of the issue and owing to political compulsions a wait and watch policy was adopted A number of complaints were received from time to time that despite the ban on the slaughter of cow and its progeny healthy bullocks were being slaughtered under one pretext or the other and calves were being maimed so that they could be declared useless and ultimately slaughtered br Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her letter dated February wrote to the Chief Ministers of States viz Andhra Pradesh Assam Bihar Gujarat Haryana Himachal Pradesh Karnataka Madhya Pradesh Maharashtra Orissa Punjab Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir in which she desired that the ban be enforced in letter and spirit that the ban on cow slaughter is not allowed to be circumvented by devious methods and that Committees to inspect cattle before they are admitted to slaughter houses be adopted br Recognizing that the problem basically arose on account of inaction or obstruction on the part of a few States and large scale smuggling of cows and calves from a prohibition State to a non prohibition State like Kerala was taking place a suggestion was made that this problem be brought to the notice of the Sarkaria Commission which was making recommendations regarding Centre State relations but this idea was dropped as the commission was then in the final stages of report writing br br br Legislation by State or

upon obtaining a fit for slaughter certificate to be issued only if the animal is not economical or is not likely to become economical for the purpose of breeding or draught agricultural operations The certificate can be issued by any veterinary doctor and is a source of much corruption and misuse The law also prohibits the slaughter of calves whether male or female The age limit of calf is not defined br In the case of buffaloes the law firstly forbids in absolute terms the slaughter of calves whether male or female Again the age limit of calf is not defined and therefore there is much misuse resulting in the slaughter of many young male animals who are only a few months old Secondly the law forbids the slaughter of adult buffaloes unless a fit for slaughter certificate is issued by a veterinarian The certificate can be issued if the animal is deemed uneconomical for purposes of milking breeding or draught agricultural operations Thus the law permits the slaughter of all adult male buffaloes and of all old and spent female buffaloes whose milk yield is not economical For this reason the slaughter of buffaloes both male and female is rampant in Andhra Pradesh br Anyone
