id: 30075
The tiger Panthera tigris is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera native to Asia It has a powerful muscular body with a large head and paws a long tail and orange fur with black mostly vertical stripes It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies though some recognise only two subspecies mainland Asian tigers and island tigers of the Sunda Islands br Throughout the tiger s range it inhabits mainly forests from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such as deer and wild boar which it takes by ambush It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges which it defends from individuals of the same sex The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he mates Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years When becoming independent they leave their mother s home range and establish their own br Since the early th century tiger populations have lost at least of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali Today the tiger s range is severely fragmented It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as its range is thought to have declined by to since the late s Major reasons for this decline are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation poaching for fur and the illegal trade of tiger body parts for medicinal purposes Tigers are also victims of human wildlife conflict for attacking and preying on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce The species is legally protected in all range countries which have ratified conservation action plans established anti poaching patrols and schemes for monitoring tiger populations br The tiger is among the most popular of the world s charismatic megafauna It has been kept in captivity since ancient times and has been trained to perform in circuses and other entertainment shows The tiger featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range and has continued to appear in culture worldwide br br br Etymology br The Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre from Latin tigris which was a borrowing from Classical Greek tigris br Since ancient times the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian or Persian word for arrow which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris However today the connection between the animal and the river is doubted and they are likely to be homonyms br br br Taxonomy br In Carl Linnaeus described the tiger in his work Systema Naturae and gave it the scientific name Felis tigris as the genus Felis was being used for all cats at the time His scientific description was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi In Reginald Innes Pocock subordinated the species under the genus Panthera using the scientific name Panthera tigris br br br Subspecies br br Nine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early th and early st centuries the Bengal Malayan Indochinese South China Siberian Caspian Javan Bali and Sumatran tigers The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in as most putative subspecies were distinguished on the basis of fur length and colouration striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum collections since fur characteristics vary widely within populations it was proposed to recognise only two tiger subspecies as valid namely P t tigris in mainland Asia and the smaller P t sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands br This two subspecies proposal was reaffirmed in through a comprehensive analysis of morphological ecological and mitochondrial DNA mtDNA traits of all putative tiger subspecies The continental nominate subspecies P t tigris constitutes two clades a northern clade composed of the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations and a southern clade composed of all other mainland populations br In the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy in accordance with the two subspecies proposal and recognised only P t tigris and P t sondaica Results of a whole genome sequencing study of samples from the six living putative subspecies the Bengal Malayan Indochinese South China Siberian and Sumatran tiger found them to be distinct and separate clades These results were corroborated in and The Cat Specialist Group states that Given the varied interpretations of data the subspecific taxonomy of this species is currently under review by the IUCN SSC Cat Specialist Group br The following tables are based on the classification of the tiger as of and also reflect the classification recognised by the Cat Classification Task Force in br br br Evolution br br The tiger shares the genus Panthera with the lion leopard jaguar and snow leopard Results of genetic analyses indicate that the tiger and snow leopard are sister species whose lineages split from each other between and million years ago The tiger s whole genome sequencing shows repeated sequences that parallel those in other cat genomes br The fossil species Panthera palaeosinensis of early Pleistocene northern China was described as a possible tiger ancestor when it was discovered in but modern cladistics places it as basal to modern Panthera Panthera zdanskyi which lived around the same time and place was suggested to be a sister species of the modern tiger when it was examined in However as of at least two subsequent studies considered P zdanskyi likely to be a synonym of P palaeosinensis noting that its proposed differences from that species fell within the range of individual variation The earliest appearance of the modern tiger species in the fossil record are jaw fragments from Lantion in China that are dated to the early Pleistocene br Middle to late Pleistocene tiger fossils have been found throughout China Sumatra and Java Prehistoric subspecies include Panthera tigris trinilensis and P t soloensis of Java and Sumatra and P t acutidens of China late Pleistocene and early Holocene fossils of tigers have also been found in Borneo and Palawan Philippines Results of a phylogeographic study indicate that all living tigers have a common ancestor that lived between and years ago Genetic studies suggest that the tiger population contracted around years ago due to glaciation Modern tiger populations originated from a refugium in Indochina and spread across Asia after the Last Glacial Maximum As they colonised northeastern China the ancestors of the South China tiger intermixed with a relict tiger population br br br Hybrids br br Captive tigers have been bred with lions to create hybrids that share physical and behavioural qualities of both parent species the liger is the offspring of a female tiger and a male lion and the tigon the offspring of a male tiger and a female lion The lion sire passes on a growth promoting gene but the corresponding growth inhibiting gene from the female tiger is absent so that ligers grow far larger than either parent species By contrast the male tiger does not pass on a growth promoting gene and the lioness passes on a growth inhibiting gene hence tigons are around the same size as their parents Since they often develop life threatening birth defects and can easily become obese breeding these hybrids is regarded as unethical br br br Characteristics br br The tiger has a typical felid morphology with a muscular body shortened legs strong forelimbs broad paws a large head and a tail that is about half the length of the rest of its body It has five digits on the front feet and four on the back all of which have retractile claws that are compact and curved The ears are rounded and the eyes have a round pupil The nose ends in a triangular pink tip with small black dots the number of which increase with age The tiger s skull is robust with a constricted front region proportionally small elliptical orbits long nasal bones a lengthened cranium with a large sagittal crest It resembles a lion s skull but differs from it in the concave or flattened as opposed to convex underside of the lower jaw and in its longer nasals The tiger has thirty fairly robust teeth and its somewhat curved canines are the longest in the cat family at cm in br The tiger is considered to be the largest living felid species However there is some debate over averages compared to the lion Since tiger populations vary greatly in size the average size for a tiger may be less than a lion while the biggest tigers are bigger than their lion counterparts The tiger has a head body length of m ft with a m ft tail and standing m ft at the shoulder The Siberian and Bengal tigers are the largest Male Bengal tigers weigh kg lb and females weigh kg lb Island tigers are the smallest likely due to insular dwarfism The Sumatran tiger has a weight of kg lb for males and kg lb for females The extinct Bali tiger was even smaller br br br Coat br br The tiger s coat usually has short hairs reach up to mm in though the hairs of the northern living Siberian tiger can reach mm in Belly hairs tend to be longer than back hairs The density of their fur is usually thin though the Siberian tiger develops a particularly thick winter coat The tiger has a mane like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers especially in males It has an orange colouration that varies from yellowish to reddish White fur covers the ventral surface along with parts of the face On the back of the ears it has a prominent white spot which is surrounded by black The tiger is marked with distinctive black or dark brown stripes which are uniquely shaped in each individual The stripes are mostly vertical but those on the limbs and forehead are horizontal They are more concentrated towards the back and those on the trunk may reach under the belly The tips of stripes are generally sharp and some may split up or split and fuse again Tail stripes are thick bands and a black tip marks the end br The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species Stripes are advantageous for camouflage in vegetation with vertical patterns of light and shade such as trees reeds and tall grass This is supported by a Fourier analysis study showing that the striping patterns line up with their environment br The orange colour may also aid in concealment as the tiger s prey is colour blind and possibly perceives the tiger as green and blended in with the vegetation br br br Colour variations br br The three colour variants nearly stripeless snow white white and golden are now virtually non existent in the wild due to the reduction of wild tiger populations but continue in captive populations The white tiger has a white background colour with sepia brown stripes The golden tiger is pale golden with reddish brown stripes The snow white tiger is a morph with extremely faint stripes and a pale reddish brown ringed tail White and golden morphs are the result of an autosomal recessive trait with a white locus and a wideband locus respectively The snow white variation is caused by polygenes with both white and wideband loci The breeding of white tigers is controversial as they have no use for conservation Only of wild tigers have the genes for this colour morph and the overrepresentation of white tigers in captivity is the result of inbreeding Hence their continued breeding will risk both inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability in captive tigers br Pseudo melanistic tigers with thick merged stripes have been recorded in Simlipal National Park and three Indian zoos a population genetic analysis of Indian tiger samples revealed that this phenotype is caused by a mutation of a transmembrane aminopeptidase gene Around of the Simlipal tiger population has this feature which has been linked to genetic isolation br br br Distribution and habitat br br The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia Sumatra Java and Bali As of it inhabits less than of its historical distribution and has a scattered range in the Indian subcontinent the Indochinese Peninsula Sumatra northeastern China and the Russian Far East As of India had the largest extent of global tiger habitat with km sq mi followed by Russia with km sq mi br The tiger mainly lives in forest habitats and is highly adaptable Records in Central Asia indicate that it primarily inhabited Tugay riverine forests and hilly and lowland forests in the Caucasus In the Amur Ussuri region of Russia and China it inhabits Korean pine and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests riparian forests serve as dispersal corridors providing food and water for both tigers and ungulates On the Indian subcontinent it inhabits mainly tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests moist evergreen forests tropical dry forests alluvial plains and the mangrove forests of the Sundarbans In the Eastern Himalayas it was documented in temperate forest up to an elevation of m ft in Bhutan of m ft in the Mishmi Hills and of m ft in M dog County southeastern Tibet In Thailand it lives in deciduous and evergreen forests In Sumatra it inhabits lowland peat swamp forests and rugged montane forests br br br Population density br Camera trapping during in the deciduous and subtropical pine forest of Jim Corbett National Park northern India revealed a stable tiger population density of individuals per km sq mi in an area of km sq mi br In northern Myanmar the population density in a sampled area of roughly km sq mi in a mosaic of tropical broadleaf forest and grassland was estimated to be tigers per km sq mi as of br Population density in mixed deciduous and semi evergreen forests of Thailand s Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at tigers per km sq mi during the s and s logging and poaching had occurred in the adjacent Mae Wong and Khlong Lan National Parks where population density was much lower estimated at only tigers per km sq mi as of br Population density in dipterocarp and montane forests in northern Malaysia was estimated at adult tigers per km sq mi in Royal Belum State Park but adult tigers per km sq mi in the unprotected selectively logged Temengor Forest Reserve br br br Behaviour and ecology br br Camera trap data show that tigers in Chitwan National Park avoided locations frequented by people and were more active at night than during day br In Sundarbans National Park six radio collared tigers were most active in the early morning with a peak around dawn br A three year long camera trap survey in Shuklaphanta National Park revealed that tigers were most active from dusk until midnight br In northeastern China tigers were crepuscular and active at night with activity peaking at dawn and dusk they were largely active at the same time as ungulate species br The tiger is a powerful swimmer and easily transverses rivers as wide as km mi it emerges in water particularly on hot days In general it is less capable to climb trees than many other cats due to its size but cubs under months old may routinely do so An adult has was recorded climbing m ft up a smooth pipal tree br br br Social spacing br Adult tigers lead largely solitary lives within home ranges or territories the size of which mainly depends on prey abundance geographic area and sex of the individual Males and females defend their home ranges from those of the same sex and the home range of a male encompasses that of multiple females Two females in the Sundarbans had home ranges of and km and sq mi br In Panna Tiger Reserve the home ranges of five reintroduced females varied from km sq mi in winter to km sq mi in summer and to km sq mi during the monsoon three males had km sq mi large home ranges in winter km sq mi in summer and km sq mi during monsoon seasons br In Sikhote Alin Biosphere Reserve females had home ranges km sq mi and five resident males of km sq mi that overlapped with those of up to five females When tigresses in the same reserve had cubs of up to four months of age they reduced their home ranges and steadily enlarged them until their offspring were months old br br The tiger is a long ranging species and individuals disperse over distances of up to km mi to reach tiger populations in other areas Young tigresses establish their first home ranges close to their mother s Males however migrate further than their female counterparts and set out at a younger age to mark out their own area Four radio collared females in Chitwan dispersed between and km and mi and males between and km and mi Tigers mark their home ranges by spraying urine on vegetation and rocks clawing or scent rubbing trees and marking trails with faeces anal gland secretions and ground scrapings Scent markings also allow an individual to pick up information on another s identity Unclaimed home ranges particularly those that belonged to a deceased individual can be taken over in days or weeks br Male tigers are generally less tolerant of other males within their home ranges than females are of other females Disputes are usually solved by intimidation rather than fighting Once dominance has been established a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range as long as they do not come near him The most serious disputes tend to occur between two males competing for a female in oestrus Though tigers mostly live alone relationships between individuals can be complex Tigers are particularly social at kills and a male tiger will share a carcass with the females and cubs within this home range and unlike male lions will allow them to feed on the kill before he is finished with it However a female is more tense when encountering another female at a kill br br br Communication br br During friendly encounters and bonding tigers rub against each other s bodies Facial expressions include the defence threat which involves a wrinkled face bared teeth pulled back ears and widened pupils Both males and females show a flehmen response a characteristic grimace when sniffing urine markings Males also use the flehmen to detect the markings made by tigresses in oestrus Tigers will move around their ears to display the white spots particularly during aggressive encounters and between mothers and cubs They also use their tails to signal their mood To show cordiality the tail sticks up and sways slowly while an apprehensive tiger lowers its tail or wags it side to side When calm the tail hangs low br Tigers are normally silent but can produce numerous vocalisations They roar to signal their presence to other individuals over long distances This vocalisation is forced through an open mouth as it closes and can be heard km mi away They roar multiple times in a row and others respond in kind Tigers also roar during mating and a mother will roar to call her cubs to her When tense tigers moan a sound similar to a roar but softer and made when the mouth is at least partially closed Moaning can be heard m ft away Aggressive encounters involve growling snarling and hissing An explosive coughing roar or coughing snarl is emitted through an open mouth and exposed teeth In friendlier situations tigers prusten a soft low frequency snorting sound similar to purring in smaller cats Tiger mothers communicate with their cubs by grunting while cubs call back with miaows When startled they emit a woof sound They produce a deer like pok sound for unknown reasons but most often at kills br br br Hunting and diet br br The tiger is a carnivore and an apex predator feeding mainly on ungulates with a particular preference for sambar deer Manchurian wapiti barasingha and wild boar Tigers kill large ungulates like gaur and opportunistically smaller prey like monkeys peafowl and other ground based birds porcupines and fish Occasional attacks on Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros have also been reported br More often tigers take the more vulnerable small calves They sometimes prey on livestock and dogs in close proximity to settlements They occasionally consume vegetation fruit and minerals for dietary fibre br Tigers learn to hunt from their mothers which is important but not necessary for their success Depending on the prey they typically kill weekly though mothers must kill more often They usually hunt alone but families hunt together when cubs are old enough They search for prey using vision and hearing A tiger will also wait at a watering hole for prey to come by particularly during hot summer days It is an ambush predator and when approaching potential prey it crouches with the head lowered and hides in foliage It switches between creeping forward and staying still A tiger may even doze off and can stay in the same spot for as long as a day waiting for prey and launch an attack when the prey is close enough usually within m ft If the prey spots it before then the cat does not pursue further A tiger can sprint km h mph and leap m ft it is not a long distance runner and gives up a chase if prey outpaces it over a certain distance br br The tiger attacks from behind or at the sides and tries to knock the target off balance It latches onto prey with its forelimbs twisting and turning during the struggle and tries to pull it to the ground The tiger generally applies a bite to the throat until its victim dies of strangulation It has an average bite force at the canine tips of newtons Holding onto the throat puts the cat out of reach of horns antlers tusks and hooves Tigers are adaptable killers and may use other methods including ripping the throat or breaking the neck Large prey may be disabled by a bite to the back of the hock severing the tendon Swipes from the large paws are capable of stunning or breaking the skull of a water buffalo They kill small prey with a bite to the back of the neck or skull Estimates of the success rate for hunting tigers range from a of low to a high of They are sometimes killed or injured by large or dangerous prey like gaur buffalo and boar br Tigers typically move kills to a private usually vegetated spot no further than m ft though they have been recorded dragging them m ft They are strong enough to drag the carcass of a fully grown buffalo for some distance They rest for a while before eating and can consume as much as kg lb of meat in one session but feed on a carcass for several days leaving little for scavengers br br br Enemies and competitors br br Tigers sometimes kill other predators In much of their range tigers share habitat with leopards and dholes They typically dominate both of them though with dholes it depends on their pack size Large dhole packs may kill tigers Tigers appear to inhabit the deep parts of a forest while these smaller predators are pushed closer to the fringes The three predators coexist by hunting different prey In Nagarhole National Park tigers were found to have killed prey that weighed an average of kg lb in contrast to kg lb for leopards and kg lb for dholes Leopards can live successfully in tiger habitat when there is abundant food and vegetation cover Nevertheless leopards avoid areas where tigers roam and are less common where tigers are numerous br Tigers tend to be wary of sloth bears with their sharp claws quickness and ability to stand on two legs Tigers sometimes prey on sloth bears by ambushing them when they are feeding at termite mounds Siberian tigers attack kill and prey on Ussuri brown and black bears Brown bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger br br br Reproduction and life cycle br br The tiger generally mates all year round particularly between November and April A tigress is in oestrus for three to six days in between three and nine week intervals A resident male mates with all the females within his home range who signal their receptiveness by roaring and marking Younger transient males are also attracted leading to a fight in which the more dominant male drives the usurper off During courtship the male is cautious with the female as he waits for her to show signs she is ready to mate She signals to him by positioning herself in lordosis with her tail to the side Copulation is generally to seconds long with the male biting the female by the scruff of her neck After it is finished the male quickly pulls away as the female may turn and slap him Tiger pairs may stay together for up to four days and mate multiple times Gestation lasts around or over three months br A tigress gives birth in a secluded location be it in dense vegetation in a cave or under a rocky shelter Litters consist of as many as seven cubs but two or three are more typical Newborn cubs weigh g oz and are blind and altricial The mother licks and cleans her cubs suckles them and viciously defends them from any potential threat Young open their eyes in a week can leave the denning site in two months and around the same time they start eating meat The mother only leaves them alone to hunt and even then she does not travel far When she suspects an area is no longer safe she moves her cubs to a new spot transporting them one by one by grabbing them by the scruff of the neck with her mouth Cubs may die at a rate of during these early months sources of morality include predators floods and fires br br After around two months the cubs are able to follow their mother They still hide in vegetation when she goes hunting and she will guide them to the kill Cubs bond through play fighting and practice stalking A hierarchy develops in the litter with the biggest cub often a male being the most dominant and the first to eat its fill at a kill Around the age of six months cubs are fully weaned and have more freedom to explore their environment Between eight and ten months they accompany their mother on hunts A cub can make a kill as early as months and reach independence around to months of age males become independent earlier than females Radio collared tigers in Chitwan started dispersing from their natal areas at the age of months Young females are sexually mature at three to four years whereas males are at four to five years Generation length of the tiger is about years br Wild Bengal tigers live years Data from the International Tiger Studbook indicate that captive tigers lived up to years br The father does not play a role in raising the young but he encounters and interacts with them The resident male appears to visit the female cub families within his home range They socialise and even share kills One male was recorded looking after orphaned cubs whose mother had died By defending his home range the male protects the females and cubs from other males When a new male takes over dependent cubs are at risk of being killed as the male attempts to sire his own young with the females Older female cubs are tolerated but males are treated as potential competitors br A young male lives as a transient in another male s home range until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male Young males have an annual mortality rate of up to percent By contrast young female tigers die at a rate of only around percent as they live closer to their mothers and can inherit parts their home ranges br br br Health and diseases br Tigers are recorded as hosts for various parasites including Diphyllobothrium erinacei Taenia pisiformis and Toxocara species in India and Physaloptera preputialis Dirofilaria ursi and Uiteinarta species in Siberia Canine distemper is known to occur in Siberian tigers A morbillivirus infection was the likely cause of death of a tigress in the Russian Far East that was also tested positive for feline panleukopenia and feline coronavirus br Blood samples from adult tigers in Nepal showed antibodies for canine parvovirus feline herpesvirus feline coronavirus leptospirosis and Toxoplasma gondii br br br Threats br The tiger has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since as the global tiger population is thought to have continuously declined from an estimated population of tigers in the late s to individuals estimated as of During landscapes where tigers live declined from km sq mi to km sq mi Habitat destruction habitat fragmentation and poaching for fur and body parts are the major threats that contributed to the decrease of tiger populations in all range countries br Protected areas in central India are highly fragmented due to linear infrastructure like roads railway lines transmission lines irrigation channels and mining activities in their vicinity br In the Tanintharyi Region of southern Myanmar deforestation coupled with mining activities and high hunting pressure threatens the tiger population in the area br In Thailand nine of protected areas hosting tigers are isolated and fragmented offering a low probability for dispersal between them and four of these have no longer harboured tigers since at least br In Peninsular Malaysia km sq mi of tiger habitat was cleared during most of it for industrial plantations br Large scale land acquisitions of about km sq mi for commercial agriculture and timber extraction in Cambodia contributed to the fragmentation of potential tiger habitat especially in the Eastern Plains br Inbreeding depression coupled with habitat destruction insufficient prey resources and poaching is a threat to the small and isolated tiger population in the Changbai Mountains along the China Russia border br In China tigers became the target of large scale anti pest campaigns in the early s where suitable habitats were fragmented following deforestation and resettlement of people to rural areas who hunted tigers and prey species Though tiger hunting was prohibited in the population continued to decline and is considered extinct in South China since br br Tiger populations in India have been targeted by poachers since the s and were extirpated in two tiger reserves in and br Between March and January activities of hunters using snares drift nets hunting platforms and hunting dogs were discovered in a reserve forest of about km sq mi in southern Myanmar Nam Et Phou Louey National Park was considered the last important site for the tiger in Laos but it has not been recorded there at least since this population likely fell victim to indiscriminate snaring Anti poaching units in Sumatra s Kerinci Seblat landscape removed tiger snare traps and seized tiger skins during annual poaching rates increased with rising skin prices br Poaching is also the main threat to the tiger population in far eastern Russia where logging roads facilitate access for poachers and people harvesting forest products that are vital for prey species to survive in winter br Body parts of tigers were detected during surveys in in two wildlife markets in Myanmar catering to customers in Thailand and China br During the years at least tigers were confiscated in seizures in countries seizures encompassed live and dead individuals whole tiger skins body parts like bones teeth paws claws whiskers and t long tons short tons of meat seizures in India encompassed body parts of tigers and seizures in Thailand involved mostly captive bred tigers br Seizures in Nepal between January and December included pieces of tiger body parts and two whole bodies in districts br Seizure data from India during indicate that tiger skins were the most often traded body parts followed by claws bones and teeth trafficking routes mainly passed through the states of Maharashtra Karnataka Tamil Nadu and Assam br A total of illegal tiger parts were confiscated at US ports of entry from personal baggage air cargo and mail between and br Demand for tiger parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine has also been cited as a major threat to tiger populations br Interviews with local people in the Bangladeshi Sundarbans revealed that they kill tigers for local consumption and trade of skins bones and meat in retaliation for attacks by tigers and for excitement br Tiger body parts like skins bones teeth and hair are consumed locally by wealthy Bangladeshis and are illegally trafficked from Bangladesh to countries including India China Malaysia Korea Vietnam Cambodia Japan and the United Kingdom via land borders airports and seaports br Tiger bone glue is the prevailing tiger product purchased for medicinal purposes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City Tiger farm facilities in China and Southeast Asia breed tigers for their parts but these appear to make the threat to wild populations worse by increasing the demand for tiger products br Local people killing tigers in retaliation for attacking and preying on livestock is a threat in several tiger range countries as this consequence of human wildlife conflict also contributes to the decline of the population br br br Conservation br br Internationally the tiger is protected under CITES Appendix I banning trade of live tigers and their body parts br In Russia hunting the tiger has been banned since br In Bhutan it has been protected since and enlisted as totally protected since

Forest Complex and reestablish populations in three potential landscapes until br The Indonesian National Tiger Recovery Program ratified in aimed at increasing the Sumatran tiger population by The third strategic and action plan for the conservation of the Sumatran tiger for the years revolves around strengthening management of small tiger population units of less than mature individuals and connectivity between forest patches in North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces br In representatives of the tiger range countries agreed to double tiger populations The Thai Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act was enacted in to combat poaching and trading of body parts In Malaysia passed the Wildlife Conservation Act which increased punishments for wildlife related crimes and has used its army and police for help in patrolling Nearly all tiger habitat in the country are managed as one unit under the Central Forest Spine initiative br br Increases in anti poaching patrol efforts in four Russian protected areas during contributed to reducing poaching stabilising the tiger population and improving protection of ungulate populations Poaching and trafficking were declared to be moderate and serious crimes in br Anti poaching operations were also established in Nepal in with increased cooperation and intelligence sharing between agencies These policies have led to many years of zero poaching and the country s tiger population has doubled in a decade br Anti poaching patrols in the km sq mi large core area of Taman Negara lead to a decrease of poaching frequency from detected incidents in to incidents during the arrest of seven poaching teams and removal of snares facilitated the survival of three resident female tigers and at least cubs br Wildlife corridors are also important for tiger conservation as they allow for connectivity between populations outside protected areas Tigers were found to use at least nine corridors that were established between protected areas in the Terai Arc Landscape and Sivalik Hills in both Nepal and India br Corridors in forested areas with low human encroachment are highly suitable br In West Sumatra wildlife corridors were identified as high priority for mitigating human wildlife conflicts br In China and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding for transboundary cooperation between two protected areas Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park and Land of the Leopard National Park that includes the creation of wildlife corridors and bilateral monitoring and patrolling along the Sino Russian border br Rescued and rehabilitated problem tigers and orphaned tiger cubs have been released into the wild and monitored in India Sumatra and Russia br In Kazakhstan habitat restoration and reintroduction of

areas is improved and forest loss stabilized South China tigers are kept and bred in Chinese zoos with plans to reintroduce their offspring into remote protected areas br br br Relationship with humans br br br Hunting br br A tiger hunt painted on the Bhimbetka rock shelters in India is dated to years ago The emperor Samudragupta was depicted on coins slaying tigers During the Mughal Empire tigers were chased on horseback and killed with spears Emperor Akbar participated in such activities and one of his hunts is the subject of a painting from the Akbarnama Emperor Jahangir introduced firearms to tiger hunts The British East India Company paid bounties for tigers since and tiger hunting continued under the British Raj An estimated tigers were killed between and King George V on his visit to colonial India in killed tigers in days br br br Attacks br br Tigers are said to have directly killed more people than any other wild mammal In most areas they avoid humans but attacks are a risk wherever people coexist with them Dangerous encounters are more likely to occur in edge habitats between wild and agricultural areas Most attacks on humans are defensive including protection of young however tigers do sometimes see people as prey Man eating tigers tend to be old and disabled Tigers driven from their home ranges are also at risk of turning to man eating br At the beginning of the th century the Champawat Tiger was responsible for over human deaths in Nepal and India before she was shot by Jim Corbett This tigress suffered from broken teeth and was unable to kill normal prey Modern authors speculate that feeding on meagre human flesh forced the cat to kill more and more Tiger attacks were particularly high in Singapore during the mid th century when plantations expanded into the tiger s habitat In the s the number of deaths ranged from to annually br Tiger attacks in the Sundarbans caused human deaths in the period according to official records of the Bangladesh Forest Department Victims of attacks are local villagers who enter the tiger s domain to collect resources like wood and honey Fishermen have been particularly common targets Methods to counter tiger attacks have included face masks worn backwards protective clothes sticks and carefully stationed electric dummies br br br Captivity br br Tigers have been kept in captivity since ancient times In ancient Rome tigers were displayed in amphitheatres they were slaughtered in venatio hunts and used to kill criminals The Mongol ruler Kublai Khan is reported to have kept tigers in the th century Starting in the Middle Ages tigers were being kept in European menageries In two tigers and a lion were accidentally put in the same exhibit at the Tower of London This led to a fight between them and after they were separated the lion died of its wounds Tigers and other exotic animals were mainly used for the entertainment of elites but from the th century onward they were exhibited more to the public Tigers were particularly big attractions and their captive population soared In there were over captive tigers in Asia over in the US and no less than in Europe Captive tigers may display stereotypical behaviours such as pacing or inactivity Zoos are able to reduce such behaviours with exhibits designed so the animals can move between separate but connected enclosures Enrichment items are also important for the cat s welfare and the stimulation of its natural behaviours br Tigers have played prominent roles in circuses and other live performances Ringling Bros included many tiger tamers in the th century including Mabel Stark who became a big draw and had a long career She was well known for being able to control the tigers despite being a small woman using manly tools like whips and guns Another trainer was Clyde Beatty who used chairs whips and guns to provoke tigers and other beasts into acting fierce and allowed him to appear courageous He would perform with as many as tigers and lions in one act From the s onward trainers like Gunther Gebel Williams would use gentler methods to control their animals Sara Houcke was dubbed the Tiger Whisperer as she trained the cats to obey her by whispering to them Siegfried Roy became famous for performing with white tigers in Las Vegas The act ended in when a tiger attacked Roy during a performance In tigers were the most traded circus animals The use of tigers and other animals in shows would eventually decline in many countries due to pressure from animal rights groups and
