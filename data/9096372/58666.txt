id: 58666
The Environmental Protection Agency EPA is an independent agency of the United States government tasked with environmental protection matters President Richard Nixon proposed the establishment of EPA on July it began operation on December after Nixon signed an executive order The order establishing the EPA was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate br The agency is led by its administrator who is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate The current administrator is Michael S Regan The EPA is not a Cabinet department but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank The EPA has its headquarters in Washington D C There are regional offices for each of the agency s ten regions as well as laboratories around the country br The agency conducts environmental assessment research and education It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws in consultation with state tribal and local governments EPA enforcement powers include fines sanctions and other measures br It delegates some permitting monitoring and enforcement responsibility to U S states and the federally recognized tribes The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts br The agency s budgeted employee level in is full time equivalent FTE More than half of EPA s employees are engineers scientists and environmental protection specialists other employees include legal public affairs financial and information technologists br br br History br br br Background br br Beginning in the late s and through the s Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment Senator James E Murray introduced a bill the Resources and Conservation Act RCA of in the th Congress The bill would have established a Council on Environmental Quality in the Executive Office of the President declared a national environmental policy and required the preparation of an annual environmental report The conservation movement was weak at the time and the bill did not pass Congress but some of its ideas were used in the NEPA law of discussed below br The publication of Silent Spring a best selling book by Rachel Carson alerted the public about the detrimental effects on animals and humans of the indiscriminate use of pesticide chemicals br In the years following Congress discussed possible solutions In a joint House Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs Senator Henry M Jackson and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics Representative George P Miller to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy br Finally the Nixon administration made the environment a priority in and set up a series of major agencies headed by the new EPA The National Environmental Policy Act of NEPA President Nixon signed NEPA into law on January The law created the Council on Environmental Quality CEQ in the Executive Office of the President NEPA required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment The detailed statement would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement EIS br br br Establishment br br On July Nixon proposed an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency a new Environmental Protection Agency This proposal included merging pollution control programs from a number of departments such as the combination of pesticide programs from the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of the Interior After conducting hearings during that summer the House and Senate approved the proposal The EPA was created days before it had to operate and officially opened its doors on December The agency s first administrator William Ruckelshaus took the oath of office on December br EPA s primary predecessor was the former Environmental Health Divisions of the U S Public Health Service PHS and its creation caused one of a series of reorganizations of PHS that occurred during From PHS EPA absorbed the entire National Air Pollution Control Administration as well as the Environmental Control Administration s Bureau of Solid Waste Management Bureau of Water Hygiene and part of its Bureau of Radiological Health It also absorbed the Federal Water Quality Administration which had previously been transferred from PHS to the Department of the Interior in A few functions from other agencies were also incorporated into EPA the formerly independent Federal Radiation Council was merged into it pesticides programs were transferred from the Department of the Interior Food and Drug Administration and Agricultural Research Service and some functions were transferred from the Council on Environmental Quality and Atomic Energy Commission br Upon its creation EPA inherited sites spread across states of which sites were laboratories The EPA consolidated these laboratories into sites br br br s br In its first year the EPA had a budget of billion and employees At its start the EPA was primarily a technical assistance agency that set goals and standards Soon new acts and amendments passed by Congress gave the agency its regulatory authority A major expansion of the Clean Air Act was approved in December br EPA staff recall that in the early days there was an enormous sense of purpose and excitement and the expectation that there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America s environment br When EPA first began operation members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government s effectiveness that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution br The burning Cuyahoga River in Cleveland Ohio in led to a national outcry and criminal charges against major steel companies The US Justice Department in late began pollution control litigation in cooperation with the new EPA Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of better known as the Clean Water Act CWA The CWA established a national framework for addressing water quality including mandatory pollution control standards to be implemented by the agency in partnership with the states Congress amended the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA in requiring EPA to measure every pesticide s risks against its potential benefits br In President Nixon appointed Russell E Train to be the next EPA Administrator In Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act requiring EPA to develop mandatory federal standards for all public water systems which serve of the US population The law required EPA to enforce the standards with the cooperation of state agencies br In October Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act TSCA which like FIFRA related to the manufacture labeling and usage of commercial products rather than pollution This act gave the EPA the authority to gather information on chemicals and require producers to test them gave it the ability to regulate chemical production and use with specific mention of PCBs and required the agency to create the National Inventory listing of chemicals br Congress also enacted the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA in significantly amending the Solid Waste Disposal Act of It tasked the EPA with setting national goals for waste disposal conserving energy and natural resources reducing waste and ensuring environmentally sound management of waste Accordingly the agency developed regulations for solid and hazardous waste that were to be implemented in collaboration with states br President Jimmy Carter appointed Douglas M Costle as EPA administrator in To manage the agency s expanding legal mandates and workload by the end of the budget grew to billion and the workforce size increased to br br br s br In following the discovery of many abandoned or mismanaged hazardous waste sites such as Love Canal Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act nicknamed Superfund The new law authorized EPA to cast a wider net for parties responsible for sites contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal and established a funding mechanism for assessment and cleanup br In a dramatic move to the right President Ronald Reagan in appointed Anne Gorsuch as EPA administrator Gorsuch based her administration of EPA on the New Federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states She believed that EPA was over regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost effective During her months as agency head she cut the budget of the EPA by reduced the number of cases filed against polluters relaxed Clean Air Act regulations and facilitated the spraying of restricted use pesticides She cut the total number of agency employees and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating Environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency br Assistant Administrator Rita Lavelle was fired by Reagan in February because of her mismanagement of the Superfund program Gorsuch had increasing confrontations with Congress over Superfund and other programs including her refusal to submit subpoenaed documents Gorsuch was cited for contempt of Congress and the White House directed EPA to submit the documents to Congress Gorsuch and most of her senior staff resigned in March Reagan then appointed William Ruckelshaus as EPA Administrator for a second term As a condition for accepting his appointment Ruckleshaus obtained autonomy from the White House in appointing his senior management team He then appointed experienced competent professionals to the top management positions and worked to restore public confidence in the agency br Lee M Thomas succeeded Ruckelshaus as administrator in In Congress passed the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act which authorized the EPA to gather data on toxic chemicals and share this information with the public EPA also researched the implications of stratospheric ozone depletion Under Administrator Thomas EPA joined with several international organizations to perform a risk assessment of stratospheric ozone which helped provide motivation for the Montreal Protocol which was agreed to in August br In during his first presidential campaign George H W Bush was vocal about environmental issues Following his election victory he appointed William K Reilly an environmentalist as EPA Administrator in Under Reilly s leadership the EPA implemented voluntary programs and initiated the development of a cluster rule for multimedia regulation of the pulp and paper industry At the time there was increasing awareness that some environmental issues were regional or localized in nature and were more appropriately addressed with sub national approaches and solutions This understanding was reflected in the amendments to the Clean Air Act and in new approaches by the agency such as a greater emphasis on watershed based approaches in Clean Water Act programs br br br s br In EPA and the Department of Energy launched the Energy Star program a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency br Carol Browner was appointed EPA administrator by President Bill Clinton and served from to Major projects during Browner s term included br br Initiation of the Brownfields pilot program in br Initial hazardous air pollution standards for petroleum refineries in br Initial lead paint abatement regulations under TSCA in br Update of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter and ozone in br Since the passage of the Superfund law in an excise tax had been levied on the chemical and petroleum industries to support the cleanup trust fund Congressional authorization of the tax was due to expire in Although Browner and the Clinton Administration supported continuation of the tax Congress declined to reauthorize it Subsequently the Superfund program has been supported only by annual appropriations greatly reducing the number of waste sites that are remediated in a given year In Congress reauthorized an excise tax on chemical manufacturers br Major legislative updates during the Clinton Administration were the Food Quality Protection Act and the amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act br br br s br President George W Bush appointed Christine Todd Whitman as EPA administrator in Whitman was succeeded by Mike Leavitt in and Stephen L Johnson in br In March nine states California New York New Jersey New Hampshire Massachusetts Maine Connecticut New Mexico and Vermont sued the EPA The EPA s inspector general had determined that the EPA s regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by Harvard University which contradicted its position on mercury controls The suit alleged that the EPA s rule exempting coal fired power plants from maximum available control technology was illegal and additionally charged that the EPA s system of cap and trade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations Illinois s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of by In by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit the U S Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act In response EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule and did so on March br In July an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel efficient cars was delayed The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute br EPA initiated its voluntary WaterSense program in to encourage water efficiency through the use of a special label on consumer products br In the state of California sued the EPA for its refusal to allow California and other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson claimed that the EPA was working on its own standards but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level which would then preempt state laws California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger along with governors from other states stated that the EPA s actions ignored federal law and that existing California standards adopted by many states in addition to California were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards It was reported that Johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision br In it was reported that EPA research was suppressed by career managers Supervisors at EPA s National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer reviewed journal article about EPA s integrated risk information system which led two co authors to have their names removed from the publication and the corresponding author Ching Hung Hsu to leave EPA because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing The report stated that EPA subjected employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint even if those papers are written on personal time br br In December EPA administrator Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global warming regulations Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e mailed the draft to the White House White House aides who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change knew the gist of what Johnson s finding would be Burnett said They also knew that once they opened the attachment it would become a public record making it controversial and difficult to rescind So they did not open it rather they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft Johnson rescinded the draft in July he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare Burnett resigned in protest br In April the Union of Concerned Scientists said that more than half of the nearly EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work The survey included chemists toxicologists engineers geologists and experts in other fields of science About of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years br President Barack Obama appointed Lisa P Jackson as EPA administrator in br br br s br In it was reported that a million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama administrations and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps br Between and some EPA employees reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure and were concerned about the censorship of environmental reports br President Obama appointed Gina McCarthy as EPA administrator in br In the EPA published its Tier standards for cars trucks and other motor vehicles which tightened air pollution emission requirements and lowered the sulfur content in gasoline br In the EPA discovered extensive violations by Volkswagen Group in its manufacture of Volkswagen and Audi diesel engine cars for the through model years Following notice of violations and potential criminal sanctions Volkswagen later agreed to a legal settlement and paid billions of US dollars in criminal penalties and was required to initiate a vehicle buyback program and modify the engines of the vehicles to reduce illegal air emissions br In August the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan to regulate emissions from power plants projecting a year cut of or million metric tons of carbon dioxide In it was voided and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy rule under the Trump administration and in its constitutionality was ruled out by the Supreme Court br In August the Gold King Mine waste water spill occurred when EPA contractors examined the level of pollutants such as lead and arsenic in a Colorado mine and accidentally released over three million gallons of waste water into Cement Creek and the Animas River br In the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC a branch of the World Health Organization cited research linking glyphosate an ingredient of the weed killer Roundup manufactured by the chemical company Monsanto to non Hodgkin s lymphoma In March the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate related non Hodgkin s lymphoma opened Monsanto emails and other documents related to the case including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators According to The New York Times the records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup s main ingredient glyphosate that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services The records show that Monsanto was able to prepare a public relations assault on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by Jess Rowland the head of the EPA s cancer assessment review committee at that time months in advance Emails also showed that Rowland had promised to beat back an effort by the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct its own review br On February President Donald Trump appointed Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator The Democratic Party saw the appointment as a controversial move as Pruitt had spent most of his career challenging environmental regulations and policies He did not have previous experience in the environmental protection field and had received financial support from the fossil fuel industry In the Trump administration proposed a cut to the EPA s budget to billion from billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs However this cut was not approved by Congress Pruitt resigned from the position on July citing unrelenting attacks due to ongoing ethics controversies br President Trump appointed Andrew R Wheeler as EPA Administrator in br On July EPA management prohibited the agency s Scientific Integrity Official Francesca Grifo from testifying at a House committee hearing EPA offered to send a different representative in place of Grifo and accused the committee of dictating to the agency who they believe was qualified to speak The hearing was to discuss the importance of allowing federal scientists and other employees to speak freely when and to whom they want to about their research without having to worry about any political consequences br In September air pollution standards in California were once again under attack as the Trump administration attempted to revoke a waiver issued to the state which allowed more stringent standards for auto and truck emissions than the federal standards br br br s br President Joe Biden appointed Michael S Regan to be administrator in Regan began serving on March br In October EPA announced its PFAS Strategic Roadmap PFASs are organofluorine chemical compounds referred to as forever chemicals The roadmap is a whole of EPA strategy and the agency will consider the full life cycle of PFAS including preventing PFAS from entering the environment holding polluters accountable and remediation of contaminated sites It also will include drinking water monitoring and risk assessment for PFOA and PFOS in biosolids processed sewage sludge used as fertilizer br In December EPA issued new greenhouse gas standards for passenger cars and light trucks The standards which will reduce climate pollution and improve public health became effective for the vehicle model year br In March the Biden administration allowed California to again set stricter auto emissions standards br In August the EPA was allotted a listed billion in funding pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act IRA The EPA listed total initiatives the most notable among them being greenhouse gas reduction and monitoring a superfund petroleum tax replacing current heavy duty vehicles with zero emission vehicles and a methane incentive program br On February more than train cars were derailed in East Palestine and around half of those cars containing chemicals like butyl acrylate vinyl chloride and ethylhexyl acrylate Subsequently the chemicals combusted into a flame being seen from miles around and the fumes filled the air with residents reporting animals falling ill and a burning sensation in their eyes and nose The EPA is monitoring the situation and experts recommend that local residents take part in the EPA s at home air screening br On April EPA proposed new federal vehicle tailpipe emissions standards that would accelerate the transition to electric vehicles EVs The standards would require at least two thirds of all new cars sold in the United States to be zero emissions vehicles by The rules seek to reduce air pollution and climate change The EPA sought public comment by July If the rules were approved it would have a significant impact on the transportation sector and public health In March EPA finalized the new rules and projected they would cut emissions by billion metric tons or of levels by br In April EPA finalized new standards for power plant carbon emissions projecting cuts of tons by and billion tons by The agency also issued final drinking water standards for six PFAS compounds br br br Organization br br The EPA is led by the administrator appointed following nomination by the president and approval from Congress br br br Offices br Office of the Administrator OA

regulations A regulation interprets a statute and EPA applies its regulations to various environmental situations and enforces the requirements The agency must include a rationale of why a regulation is needed See Administrative Procedure Act Regulations can be challenged in federal courts either district court or appellate court depending on the particular statutory provision br br br Related

Environmental Policy Act br Oil Pollution Act br Pollution Prevention Act br br br Programs br br EPA established its major programs pursuant to the primary missions originally articulated in the laws passed by Congress Additional programs have been developed to interpret the primary missions Some of the newer programs have been specifically authorized by Congress Former administrator William Ruckelshaus observed in that a danger for EPA was that air water waste and other programs would be unconnected placed in silos a problem that persists more than years later albeit less so than at the start br br br Core programs br br br Air quality and radiation protection br The Office of Air and Radiation OAR describes itself as the official authority in charge of developing national programs

Radiation Protection br br br Water quality br br br Science and regulatory standards br The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System NPDES permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources which discharge to US waters Created in by the Clean Water Act the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting administrative and enforcement aspects As of the EPA has approved states to administer all or portions of the permit program EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country The Water Quality Act of extended NPDES permit coverage to industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems In there were major point source NPDES permits in place and municipal and industrial point sources with general or individual permits br br Effluent guidelines technology based standards for industrial point sources and Water quality standards risk based standards for water bodies under Title III of the CWA br Nonpoint source pollution programs br The CWA Section Program regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States Permits are issued by the U S Army Corps of Engineers and reviewed by EPA and may be denied if they would cause unacceptable degradation or if an alternative does not exist that does not also have adverse impacts on waters Permit holders are typically required to restore or create wetlands or other waters to offset losses that cannot be avoided br EPA ensures safe drinking water for the public by setting standards for more than public water systems nationwide EPA oversees states local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act The program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water br br br Infrastructure financing br The Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides grants to states which along with matching state funds are loaned to municipalities for wastewater and green infrastructure at below market interest rates These loans are expected to be paid back creating revolving loan funds Cumulative assistance from the revolving fund has surpassed US billion As of The revolving fund replaced the Construction Grants Program which was phased out in br The Drinking Water State Revolving Fund provides financial assistance to local drinking water utilities br br br Land waste and cleanup br Regulation of solid waste non hazardous and hazardous waste under RCRA To implement the law EPA published standards in for sanitary landfills that receive municipal solid waste The agency published national hazardous waste regulations and established a nationwide permit and tracking system for managing hazardous waste The system is largely managed by state agencies under EPA authorization Standards were issued for waste treatment storage and disposal facilities TSDFs and ocean dumping of waste was prohibited In Congress passed the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments HSWA which expanded several aspects of the RCRA program br The Land Disposal Restrictions Program sets treatment requirements for hazardous waste before it may be disposed on land EPA began issuing treatment methods and levels of requirements in and these are continually adapted to new hazardous wastes and treatment technologies The stringent requirements it sets and its emphasis on waste minimization practices encourage businesses to plan to minimize waste generation and prioritize reuse and recycling From the start of the program in to the volume of hazardous waste disposed in landfills had decreased and the volume of hazardous waste disposed of by underground injection had decreased br The RCRA Corrective Action Program requires TSDFs to investigate and clean up hazardous releases at their own expense In the s EPA estimated that the number of sites needing cleanup was three times more than the number of sites on the national Superfund list The program is largely implemented through permits and orders As of the program has led to the cleanup of million acres of land of which facilities were primarily responsible for cleanup costs The goal of EPA and states is to complete final remedies by at priority facilities out of that need to be cleaned up according to EPA br Beginning in the mid s EPA developed standards for small quantity generators of hazardous waste pursuant to HSWA br EPA was mandated to conduct a review of landfill conditions nationwide The agency reported in that the effectiveness of environmental controls at landfills varied nationwide which could lead to serious contamination of groundwater and surface waters EPA published a national plan in calling for state and local governments to better integrate their municipal solid waste management practices with source reduction and recycling programs br Regulation of Underground Storage Tanks The Underground Storage Tank UST Program was launched in and covers about active USTs containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals Since million USTs have been closed in compliance with regulations states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico manage UST programs with EPA authorization When the program began EPA had only staff to develop a system to regulate more than million tanks and work with owners and operators The program relies more on local operations and enforcement than other EPA programs Today the program supports the inspection of all federally regulated tanks cleans up old and new leaks minimizes potential leaks and encourages sustainable reuse of abandoned gas stations br Hazardous site cleanup In the late s the need to clean up sites such as Love Canal that had been highly contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal became apparent However the existing regulatory environment depended on owners or operators to perform environmental control While the EPA attempted to use RCRA s section to perform this cleanup it was clear a new law was needed In Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA commonly known as Superfund This law enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for responsible parties including past or present generators and transporters as well as current and past owners of the site to find funding The act also established some funding and a tax mechanism on certain industries to help fund such cleanup Congress did not renew the Superfund tax in the s and subsequently funding for cleanup actions was supported only by general appropriations Congress restored an excise tax on chemical manufacturers in which will eventually increase the available budget for site cleanups Today due to restricted funding most cleanup activities are performed by responsible parties under the oversight of the EPA and states As of more than sites had been put on the cleanup list since the creation of the program Of these sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list cleanup is underway at cleanup facilities have been constructed at but need to be operated in the future and are not yet in cleanup stage br EPA s oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure SPCC and the Facility Response Plan FRP rules The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store handle process gather transfer refine distribute use or consume oil or oil products Oil products includes petroleum and non petroleum oils as well as animal fats oils and greases fish and marine mammal oils and vegetable oils It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than gallons of fuel above ground or more than gallons below ground and which might discharge to navigable waters as defined in the Clean Water Act or adjoining shorelines Secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites br br br Chemical manufacture and usage br EPA regulates pesticides under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA and the Food Quality Protection Act The agency assesses registers regulates and regularly reevaluates all pesticides legally sold in the United States A few challenges this program faces are transforming toxicity testing screening pesticides for endocrine disruptors and regulating biotechnology and nanotechnology br TSCA required EPA to create and maintain a national inventory of all existing chemicals in U S commerce When the act was passed in there were more than chemicals on the market that had never been comprehensively cataloged To do so the EPA developed and implemented procedures that have served as a model for Canada Japan and the European Union For the inventory the EPA also established a baseline for new chemicals that the agency should be notified about before being commercially manufactured Today this rule keeps the EPA updated on volumes uses and exposures of around of the highest volume chemicals via industry reporting br The Toxics Release Inventory TRI is a resource established by the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act specifically for the public to learn about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities TRI data support informed decision making by communities government agencies companies and others Annually the agency collects data from more than facilities The EPA has generated a range of tools to support the use of this inventory including interactive maps and online databases such as ChemView br br br Enforcement br br Civil enforcement and criminal enforcement programs EPA develops and prosecutes administrative civil and judicial cases and provides legal support for cases and investigations initiated in its regional offices Federal judicial actions formal lawsuits are filed by the U S Department of Justice on behalf of EPA br Compliance assistance EPA identifies prevents and reduces noncompliance and environmental risks by establishing enforcement initiatives and ensuring effective monitoring and assessment of compliance br Federal facilities enforcement br Environmental Justice program br In the Environmental Data Governance Initiative a network of academics developers and non profit professionals published a report which compared EPA enforcement statistics over time The number of civil cases filed by EPA have gradually decreased and in the criminal and civil penalties from EPA claims dropped over four times their amounts in and In EPA issued in penalties due to violations of agency requirements and in the agency issued in penalties EPA s inspections and evaluations have steadily decreased from to Enforcement activity has decreased partially due to budget cuts within the agency br br br Additional programs br The EPA Safer Choice label previously known as the Design for the Environment DfE label helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients without sacrificing quality or performance When a product has the Safer Choice label it means that every intentionally added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label br Through the Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative EPA s Design for the Environment DfE recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water Nonylphenol ethoxylates commonly referred to as NPEs are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant The Safer Choice program identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates These alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available The CleanGredients website is an information source about safer surfactants br The Energy Star program initiated in motivated major companies to retrofit millions of square feet of building space with more efficient lighting As of more than Energy Star products were available including major appliances office equipment lighting home electronics and more In addition the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings In about percent of new housing in the US displayed an Energy Star label EPA estimates that the program saved about billion in energy costs in alone The program has helped spread the use of LED traffic lights efficient fluorescent lighting power management systems for office equipment and low standby energy use br EPA s Smart Growth Program began in and was created to help communities improve their land development practices and get the type of development they want Together with local state and national experts EPA encourages development strategies that protect human health and the environment create economic opportunities and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels br The Brownfields Program started as a pilot program in the s and was authorized by law in The program provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment cleanup and revitalization of brownfields As of September the EPA estimates that program grants have resulted in acres of land readied for reuse and leveraged jobs and billion to do so Agency studies also found that property values around assessed or cleaned up brownfields have increased to percent br EPA s Indoor air quality Tools for Schools
