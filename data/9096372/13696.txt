important tourist cities Due to the large number of sea passengers per year Helsinki is classified as a major port city and in it was rated the world s busiest passenger port br br br Etymology br According to a theory put forward in the s at the time of Swedish colonisation of the Finnish coast colonists from H lsingland in central Sweden arrived at what is now the Vantaa River and called it Helsing Helsinge River giving rise to the names of the village and church of Helsinge in the s This theory is questionable as dialect research suggests that the settlers came from Uppland and the surrounding areas Others have suggested that the name derives from the Swedish word helsing an archaic form of the word hals neck which refers to the narrowest part of a river the rapids Other Scandinavian towns in similar geographical locations were given similar names at the time such as Helsing r in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden br When a town was founded in the village of Forsby later Koskela in it was called Helsinge fors Helsinge rapids The name refers to the Vanhankaupunginkoski rapids at the mouth of the river The town was commonly known as Helsinge or Helsing from which the modern Finnish name is derived br Official Finnish government documents and Finnish language newspapers have used the name Helsinki since when the Senate of Finland moved to the city from Turku the former capital of Finland Decrees issued in Helsinki were dated with Helsinki as the place of issue This is how the form Helsinki came to be used in written Finnish When Finland became a Grand Duchy of Finland an autonomous state under the rule of the Russian Empire Helsinki was known as Gel singfors in Russian because the main and official language of Grand Duchy of Finland was Swedish br In Helsinki slang the city is called Stadi from the Swedish word stad meaning city Abbreviated form Hesa is equally common but its use is associated with people of rural origin junantuomat lit brought by a train and frowned upon by locals Helsset is the Northern Sami name for Helsinki br br br History br br br Early history br After the end of the Ice Age and the retreat of the ice sheet the first settlers arrived in the Helsinki area around BC Their presence has been documented by archaeologists in Vantaa Pit j nm ki and Kaarela Permanent settlements did not appear until the beginning of the st millennium AD during the Iron Age when the area was inhabited by the Tavastians They used the area for fishing and hunting but due to the lack of archaeological finds it is difficult to say how extensive their settlements were Pollen analysis has shown that there were agricultural settlements in the area in the th century and surviving historical records from the th century describe Tavastian settlements in the area br Christianity does not gain a significant foothold in Finland before the th century After that a number of crosses and other objects related to Christianity can be found in archaeological material According to the traditional view the Kingdom of Sweden made three crusades to Finland thanks to which the region was incorporated into both Christianity and the Swedish Empire Recent research has shown that these expeditions to the extent that there were even three of them were not the crusades that had been imagined Later the conquest of Finland was justified in terms of civilisation and christianisation and the myth of the Crusades was developed It is more likely that it was a multidimensional combination of economic cultural and political power ambitions br The early settlements were raided by Vikings until and the Battle at Herdaler was a battle between the Norse Viking leader Olav Haraldsson later King Olaf II of Norway also known as Saint Olaf and local Finns at Herdaler now Ing not far from Helsinga around The Saga of Olaf Haraldson tells how Olav raided the coasts of Finland and was almost killed in battle He ran away in fear and after that the Vikings did not raid the coasts of Finland br Later the area was settled by Christians from Sweden They came mainly from the Swedish coastal regions of Norrland and H lsingland and their migration intensified around The Swedes permanently colonised the Helsinki region s coastline in the late th century after the successful crusade to Finland that led to the defeat of the Tavastians br In the Middle Ages the Helsinki area was a landscape of small villages Some of the old villages from the s in the area of present day Helsinki such as Koskela and T l are now Helsinki districts as are the rest of the medieval villages The area gradually became part of the Kingdom of Sweden and Christianity Suuri Rantatie or the King s Road ran through the area and two interesting medieval buildings were built here Vartiokyl hillfort in the s and the Church of St Lawrence in In the Middle Ages several thousand people lived in Helsinki s keep br There was a lot of trade across the Baltic Sea The shipping route to the coast and especially to Reval meant that by the end of the Middle Ages the Helsinki region had become an important trading centre for wealthy peasants priests and nobles in Finland after Vyborg and Pohja Furs wood tar fish and animals were exported from Helsinki and salt and grain were brought to the fortress Helsinki was also the most important cattle breeding area in Uusimaa With the help of trade Helsinki became one of the wealthiest cities in Finland and Uusimaa Thanks to trade and travel e g to Reval people could speak several languages at least helpfully Depending on the situation Finnish Swedish Latin or Low German could be heard in the Helsinki area br Written chronicles from mention the village of Koskela near the rapids at the mouth of the River Vantaa where Helsinki was to be founded br br br Founding of Helsinki br br Helsinki was founded by King Gustav I of Sweden on June as a trading town called Helsingfors to rival the Hanseatic city of Reval now Tallinn on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland To populate the new town at the mouth of the Vantaa River the king ordered the bourgeoisie of Porvoo Raseborg Rauma and Ulvila to move there The shallowness of the bay made it impossible to build a harbour and the king allowed the settlers to leave the unfortunate location In Count Per Brahe the Younger together with some descendants of the original settlers moved the centre of the city to the Vironniemi peninsula by the sea today s Kruununhaka district where the Senate Square and Helsinki Cathedral are located br During the second half of the th century Helsinki as a wooden city suffered from regular fires and by the beginning of the th century the population had fallen below For a long time Helsinki was mainly a small administrative town for the governors of Nyland and Tavastehus County but its importance began to grow in the th century when plans were made to build a more solid naval defence in front of the city Little came of these plans however as Helsinki remained a small town plagued by poverty war and disease The plague of killed most of Helsinki s population After the Russians captured Helsinki in May during the Great Northern War the retreating Swedish administration set fire to parts of the city Despite this the city s population grew to by the beginning of the th century The construction of the naval fortress of Sveaborg Viapori in Finnish now also called Suomenlinna in the th century helped to improve Helsinki s status However it wasn t until Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in that the city began to develop into a substantial city The Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress during the war and about a quarter of the city was destroyed in a fire in br Emperor Alexander I of Russia moved the capital of Finland from Turku to Helsinki on April to reduce Swedish influence in Finland and bring the capital closer to St Petersburg After the Great Fire of Turku in the Royal Academy of Turku the only university in the country at the time was also moved to Helsinki and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki The move consolidated the city s new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth This transformation is most evident in the city centre which was rebuilt in the neoclassical style to resemble St Petersburg largely according to a plan by the German born architect C L Engel As elsewhere technological advances such as the railway and industrialisation were key factors in the city s growth br br br Twentieth century br By the s Helsinki s population was already over and despite the turbulence of Finnish history in the first half of the th century Helsinki

Finnish and Swedish speakers in Helsinki the majority of workers were Finnish speaking The local Helsinki slang or stadin slangi developed among Finnish children and young people from the s as a mixed Finnish Swedish language with influences from German and Russian and from the s the slang began to become more Finnish A landmark event was the Olympic Games which were held in Helsinki Finland s
