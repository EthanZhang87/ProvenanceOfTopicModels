King Wen of Zhou Chinese pinyin Zh u W n W ng BC the Cultured King was the posthumous title given to Ji Chang Chinese the patriarch of the Zhou state during the final years of Shang dynasty in ancient China Ji Chang himself died before the end of the Zhou Shang War and his second son Ji Fa completed the conquest of Shang following the Battle of Muye and posthumously honored him as the founder of the Zhou dynasty Many of the hymns of the Classic of Poetry are praises to the legacy of King Wen Some consider him the first epic hero of Chinese history br Although frequently confused with his fourth son Duke of Zhou also known as Lord Zhou they are different historical persons br br br Archaeology br Chinese scholars e g Wang Yunwu Li Xueqin etc identified King Wen with a Zh uf ng b Elder of Zhou region mentioned in inscriptions H H among oracle bones excavated at Zhouyuan Qishan County br br br Biography br br Born Ji Chang Wen was the son of Tairen and Ji Jili the Elder of Zhou a vassal clan of the Kingdom of Shang along the Wei River in present day Shaanxi Jili was betrayed and executed by the Shang king Wen Ding in the late th century BC leaving the young Chang as the Elder of the Zhou lineage br Wen married Taisi and fathered ten sons and one daughter by her plus at least another eight sons with concubines br At one point King Zhou of Shang fearing Wen s growing power imprisoned him in Youli present day Tangyin in Henan after he was slandered by the Marquis of Chong His eldest son Bo Yikao went to King Zhou to plead for his freedom but was executed in a rage by lingchi and made into meat cakes which were fed to his father in Youli However many officials in particular San Yisheng and Hong Yao respected Wen for his honorable governance and gave King Zhou so many gifts including gold horses and women that he released Wen and also bestowed upon him his personal weapons and invested him with the special rank of Overlord of the West Western Shang Wen offered a piece of his land in Western Luo to King Zhou who in turn allowed Wen to make one last request He requested that the Burning Pillar punishment be abolished and so it was br Subsequently upon returning home Wen secretly began to plot to overthrow King Zhou In his first year as Overlord of the West he settled a land dispute between the states of Yu and Rui earning greater recognition among the nobles It is by this point that some nobles began calling him king The following year Wen found Jiang Ziya fishing in the Pan River and hired him as a military counselor He also repelled an invasion of the Quanrong barbarians and occupied a portion of their land The following year he campaigned against Mixu a state whose chief had been harassing the smaller states of Ruan and Gong thus annexing the three of them The following year he attacked Li a puppet of Shang and the next year he attacked E a rebel state opposed to Shang conquering both One year later he attacked Chong home of Hu Marquis of Chong his arch enemy and defeated it gaining access to the Ford of Meng through which he could cross his army to attack Shang By then he had obtained about two thirds of the whole kingdom either as direct possessions or sworn allies That same year he moved his administrative capital city one hundred kilometers east from Mount Qi to Feng placing the Shang under imminent threat The following year however the Overlord of the West died before he could cross the Ford Nonetheless that other sources suggest he died in battle during the Zhou campaign against the Shang br Four years after his death his second son known as King Wu followed his footsteps and crushed the Shang at Muye founding the Zhou dynasty The name Wen now means the Cultured or the Civilizing and was made into an official royal name by King Wu in honor of his father He was the only noble to bear the posthumous name Wen for almost the entire first half of the Zhou dynasty despite its common usage as an epithet of eulogy suggesting a special privilege br br br Mandate of Heaven br br The theory of political legitimacy that prevailed during the Zhou dynasty and found adherents throughout the following millennia was known as the Mandate of Heaven According to this theory Heaven established the sovereign lexically the same way a sovereign would establish a vassal legitimacy flowed from Heaven s will through the person of the ruler to his lords and his family The sovereign was held to be Heaven s eldest son in a manner analogous to the patrilineal kin based society of Predynastic Zhou If the sovereign was insufficiently virtuous Heaven would choose a new successor portended by various omens or disasters King Wen was said to be mandated by Heaven because the virtue of the Shang kings had declined too greatly While this political theory gained a great deal of sophistication over time it seems to have begun with King Wen reading the skies br In BCE two unusual celestial phenomena took place In May the densest clustering in five hundred years time of the five planets visible to the naked eye could be seen in the constellation of Cancer followed a few seasons later by an apparition of Comet P Halley One or more of these was interpreted by King Wen as a visible sign indicating his divine appointment Early records such as the inscription on the Da Yu ding describe Heaven s Mandate in terms of an actual astronomic event the great command in the sky br The transmitted record does not place King Wen s receipt of the Mandate in his biography although the widespread traditions that hold the idea of its existence to be true universally agree that he did receive it at some point during his career While his conquests imprisonment establishments and rebellion form a traditional relative chronology the absolute date calculated by modern scholars of the celestial phenomena that formed the seed of what has been called the Zhou dynasty s most important contribution to Chinese political thought cannot be securely slotted into King Wen s timeline br br br Legacy br br Many of the older odes from the Classic of Poetry Shijing are hymns in praise of King Wen He was additionally a great hero of Confucius whose followers played a significant role in shaping Chinese culture br br br Divination br King Wen is also credited with having stacked the eight trigrams in their various permutations to create the sixty four hexagrams of the I Ching He is also said to have written the judgments which are appended to each hexagram The most commonly used sequence of the hexagrams is attributed to him and is usually referred to as the King Wen sequence br br br Posthumous honors br In BC Han Gaozu gave King Wen the title Greatest of All Kings br br br Family br Wives
