Abul Abbas c s or s was an Asian elephant brought back to the Carolingian emperor Charlemagne by his diplomat Isaac the Jew The gift was from the Abbasid caliph Harun al Rashid and symbolizes the beginning of Abbasid Carolingian relations The elephant s name and events from his life are recorded in the Carolingian Annales regni Francorum and he is mentioned in Einhard s Vita Karoli Magni However no references to the gift or to interactions with Charlemagne have been found in Abbasid records br br br Contemporary accounts br br br From the Orient to Europe br Abul Abbas was probably born during the s or s based on the average age of Asian elephant maturity and was brought from Baghdad the capital city of the Abbasid Caliphate by Charlemagne s diplomat Isaac the Jew who along with two other emissaries Lantfrid and Sigimund had been sent to the caliph on Charlemagne s orders That the only surviving member of the group of three Isaac was being sent back with the elephant was heralded as advance news to Charlemagne from two emissaries he met in one was sent by the caliph Harun al Rashid himself another by Abraham Ibrahim ibn al Aghlab who was governor of Africa Charlemagne then ordered a man to Liguria the province around Genoa to commission a fleet of ships to carry the elephant and other goods br Researchers have speculated on Isaac and the elephant s route through Africa Isaac and the elephant began the trek back by following the Egyptian coast into Ifriqiya ruled by Ibrahim ibn al Aghlab who had bought the land from al Rashid for dinars annually Possibly with the help of Ibrahim in the capital city of Kairouan now in Tunisia Isaac set sail from port possibly Carthage now in Tunisia with Abul Abbas and traveled the remaining distance to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea br At any rate the strict reading of the historic text Annales regni Francorum is that Isaac the Jew returned from Africa with the elephant Isaac Iudeus de Africa cum elefanto and landed in Porto Venere near Genoa in October The two spent the winter in Vercelli and in the spring they started the march over the Alps to the Emperor s residence in Aachen arriving on July Abul Abbas was a full grown adult elephant br br br Death br In the year Charlemagne left his palace and mounted a campaign intending to engage with King Godofrid of Denmark and his fleet that invaded and plundered Friesland Charlemagne had crossed the Rhine River and tarried at a place called Lippeham awaiting troops for three days when his elephant suddenly died On the tacit assumption that the Abul Abbas was with Charlemagne when he died some modern commentators venture that the beast had been brought to serve as a war elephant br br br Place of death br The location of Lippeham is a matter of conjecture but has been placed at the mouth of the Lippe River its confluence with the Rhine in other words somewhere near the city of Wesel The claim dates at least as far back as or when J H N nning Nunningus and a colleague had published a notice that Lippeham was to be identified with Wesel and that a colossal bone unearthed from the area in the possession of their affiliated museum was plausibly a part of the remains of the elephant Abul Abbas Another gigantic bone was found in the Lippe River among a catch of fish in the herrschaft of Gartrop in early and it too was claimed to be a piece of Abul Abbas br One detractor to the claim is Richard Hodges who places it in L neburg Heath which is nowhere near the Rhine br br br Modern embellished accounts br br br Details of exhibition and death br The Annales regni Francorum contain only short reports about the transport of Abul Abbas his delivery to the Emperor and his death But modern writers have given various embellished accounts Some indicate that when Abul Abbas arrived he was marched through various towns in Germany to the astonishment of onlookers that he was shown in Speyer Strassburg Verdun Augsburg and Paderborn as ostentatious display of the emperor s might and was eventually housed in Augsburg in what is now southern Bavaria br Some added details about the elephant s death stating he was in his forties and already suffering from rheumatism when it accompanied Charlemagne in the campaign across the Rhine heading to Friesland According to these sources in a spell of cool rainy weather Abul Abbas developed a case of pneumonia His keepers were able to transport the beast as far as M nster where he collapsed and died br br br White elephant br Some modern works indicate that Abul Abbas was albino literally a white elephant but the basis for the claim is wanting An early example claiming that Abul Abbas was a white elephant occurs in a title authored by Willis Mason West In Peter Munz wrote a book intended for popular readership which repeated the same white elephant claim but a reviewer flagged this as a slip given there was no evidence known to him to substantiate it Mention of white elephant also misleadingly occurs in the title of the published catalog from the Aachen exhibition of Ex oriente Isaak und der weisse Elefant however in this publication is a contributing article by Grewe and Pohle that appends a question mark on it Among the famous gifts to Charlemagne was a white elephant br br br Abul Abbas species br br A number of authors assert that Abul Abbas was an Indian elephant though others cast this as an open question with the African elephant being a distinct possibility No primary source identifies his species directly br Arguments for Abul Abbas having been an Indian elephant include that Abbasid sources such as al Jahiz and al Masudi record a belief that African elephants were not tamable Another clue comes from the Irish monk Dicuil who mentions Abul Abbas in his description of India in his geographic work De mensura orbis terrae Concerning the Measurement of the World in An inhabited initial B from a copy of Cassiodorus Commentary on the Psalms made at the Abbey of Saint Denis in the first quarter of the ninth century now Paris BnF lat incorporates an elephant s head The realistic portrayal of an Asian elephant suggests that the artist had seen Abul Abbas br Evidence put forward for Abul Abbas having been an African elephant includes the route by which he arrived in Europe which was via Tunisia Also a Carolingian plaque survives which was manufactured from ivory from an African elephant and was from a contemporary source Ivory was widely used in Carolingian art but most of this material was re purposed from Roman sources This particular plaque a depiction of the Virgin Mary is too large to have come from the tusk of an Indian elephant measuring cm in along its longest side Radio carbon dating shows that the ivory in the plaque is not of ancient origin For Carolingian artists to have access to new ivory is so unusual that it makes Abul Abbas a possible source of the material br A short story by the German
