title: Speciesism
id: 29045
Speciesism is a term used in philosophy regarding the treatment of individuals of different species The term has several different definitions within the relevant literature Some sources specifically define speciesism as discrimination or unjustified treatment based on an individual s species membership while other sources define it as differential treatment without regard to whether the treatment is justified or not Richard D Ryder who coined the term defined it as a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one s own species and against those of members of other species Speciesism results in the belief that humans have the right to use non human animals which scholars say is pervasive in the modern society Studies from and suggest that people who support animal exploitation also tend to have intersectional bias that encapsulates and endorses racist sexist and other prejudicial views which furthers the beliefs in human supremacy and group dominance to justify systems of inequality and oppression br As a term speciesism first appeared during a protest against animal experimentation in Philosophers and animal rights advocates state that speciesism plays a role in the animal industrial complex including in the practice of factory farming animal slaughter blood sports such as bullfighting and rodeos the taking of animals fur and skin and experimentation on animals as well as the refusal to help animals suffering in the wild due to natural processes and the categorization of certain animals as invasive then killing them based on that classification br Notable proponents of the concept include Peter Singer Oscar Horta Steven M Wise Gary L Francione Melanie Joy David Nibert Steven Best and Ingrid Newkirk Among academics the ethics morality and concept of speciesism has been the subject of substantial philosophical debate Carl Cohen Nel Noddings Bernard Williams Peter Staudenmaier Christopher Grau Douglas Maclean Roger Scruton Thomas Wells and Robert Nozick have criticized the term or elements of it br br br History br br br Preceding ideas br Buffon a French naturalist writing in Histoire Naturelle published in questioned whether it could be doubted that animals whose organization is similar to ours must experience similar sensations and that those sensations must be proportioned to the activity and perfection of their senses Despite these assertions he insisted that there exists a gap between humans and other animals In the poem Po me sur le d sastre de Lisbonne Voltaire described a kinship between sentient beings humans and other animals included stating All sentient things born by the same stern law Suffer like me and like me also die br In Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes published in the English writer and advocate for animal rights Lewis Gompertz argued for egalitarianism and detailed how it could be applied to nonhuman animals He asserted that the feelings and sensations experienced by humans and other animals are highly similar stating Things which affect us generally seem to affect them in the same way and at least the following sensations and passions are common to both viz hunger desire emulation love of liberty playfulness fear shame anger and many other affections He also argued that humans and other animals share many physiological characteristics and that this implied similitude of sensation Gompertz was critical of the human use of nonhuman animals arguing that they are used without the slightest regard to their feelings their wants and their desires br br English naturalist Charles Darwin writing in his notebook in asserted that man thinks of himself as a masterpiece produced by a deity but that he thought it truer to consider him created from animals In his book The Descent of Man Darwin argued There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties t he difference in mind between man and the higher animals great as it is certainly is one of degree and not of kind We have seen that the senses and intuitions the various emotions and faculties such as love memory attention curiosity imitation reason etc of which man boasts may be found in an incipient or even sometimes in a well developed condition in the lower animals br German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer asserted that anthropocentrism was a fundamental defect of Christianity and Judaism arguing that these religions have been a source of immense suffering for sentient beings because they separate man from the world of animals leading to the treatment of animals as only things Schopenhauer praised Brahmanism and Buddhism for their focus on kinship between humans and other animals as well as their emphasis on the connection between them through metempsychosis br br English writer and animal rights advocate Henry S Salt in his book Animals Rights argued that for humans to do justice to other animals they must look beyond the conception of a great gulf between them claiming instead that we should recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood br Edward Payson Evans an American scholar and animal rights advocate in Evolutional Ethics and Animal Psychology published in was critical of anthropocentric psychology and ethics which he argued treat man as a being essentially different and inseparably set apart from all other sentient creatures to which he is bound by no ties of mental affinity or moral obligation Evans argued that Darwin s theory of evolution implied moral obligations towards enslaved humans and nonhuman animals asserting that these obligations not only implied that cruelty to slaves must be mitigated and that slavery be abolished but also that nonhuman animals need more than just kind treatment they require rights to protect them and that would be enforced if violated Evans also contended that widespread recognition of the kinship between humans and even the most insignificant sentient beings would necessarily mean that it would be impossible to neglect or mistreat them br An article published in The Zoophilist entitled Anthropocentric Ethics argued that the earliest civilizations before Christianity considered tenderness and mercy towards sentient organisms to be a law It asserted that Zarathustra and the Buddha espoused this philosophy and that early Greek philosophers similarly to Brahmins and Buddhists followed the doctrine of metempsychosis which led eventually to the adoption of vegetarianism The article also contended that this unquestioned truth of psychical homogeneity between humans and animals was carried into the early Christian era with the Greek philosopher Celsus making its denial a serious criticism of Christianity The article argued that early Christian writers such as Origen considered animals to be mere automata created for the benefit of humans and that this belief persists to the present day It concluded that Animal Psychology and its relation to Evolutionary Ethics is a subject which is attracting the attention of scientists and moralists alike and can no longer be treated with indifference much less with contempt We must enlarge our conceptions of the intention than that the whole animal world exists merely to minister to our wants br Writing in the American zoologist philosopher and animal rights advocate J Howard Moore described vegetarianism as the ethical conclusion of the evolutionary kinship of all creatures calling it the expansion of ethics to suit the biological revelations of Charles Darwin He went on to argue that ethics still relied on a pre Darwinian delusion that all nonhuman animals and the world were created specifically for humans In his book Better World Philosophy Moore contended that human ethics is in an anthropocentric stage of evolution having developed from individual to tribe and from tribe to race and from race to sex and from sex to species until to day the ethical conception of many minds includes with greater or less vividness and sincerity all sexes colors and conditions of men He argued that the next stage of ethical evolution was zoocentricism the ethical consideration of the entire sentient universe br In his book The Universal Kinship Moore asserted that a provincialist attitude towards other animals leads humans to mistreat them and compared the denial of an ethical connection between humans and animals to the denial of ethical relations by a tribe people or race of human beings to the rest of the human world He went on to criticize the anthropocentric perspective of humans who think of our acts toward non human peoples entirely from the human point of view We never take the time to put ourselves in the places of our victims In his conclusion Moore argued that the Golden Rule should be applied to all sentient beings stating do as you would be done by and not to the dark man and the white woman alone but to the sorrel horse and the gray squirrel as well not to creatures of your own anatomy only but to all creatures br br br Etymology br br The term speciesism and the argument that it is a prejudice first appeared in in a privately printed pamphlet written by British psychologist Richard D Ryder Ryder was a member of a group of academics in Oxford England the nascent animal rights community now known as the Oxford Group One of the group s activities was distributing pamphlets about areas of concern the pamphlet titled Speciesism was written to protest against animal experimentation The term was intended by its proponents to create a rhetorical and categorical link to racism and sexism br Ryder stated in the pamphlet that s ince Darwin scientists have agreed that there is no magical essential difference between humans and other animals biologically speaking Why then do we make an almost total distinction morally If all organisms are on one physical continuum then we should also be on the same moral continuum He wrote that at that time in the United Kingdom animals were being used each year in experiments and that attempting to gain benefits for our own species through the mistreatment of others was just speciesism and as such it is a selfish emotional argument rather than a reasoned one Ryder used the term again in an essay Experiments on Animals in Animals Men and Morals a collection of essays on animal rights edited by philosophy graduate students Stanley and Roslind Godlovitch and John Harris who were also members of the Oxford Group Ryder wrote br br In as much as both race and species are vague terms used in the classification of living creatures according largely to physical appearance an analogy can be made between them Discrimination on grounds of race although most universally condoned two centuries ago is now widely condemned Similarly it may come to pass that enlightened minds may one day abhor speciesism as much as they now detest racism The illogicality in both forms of prejudice is of an identical sort If it is accepted as morally wrong to deliberately inflict suffering upon innocent human creatures then it is only logical to also regard it as wrong to inflict suffering on innocent individuals of other species The time has come to act upon this logic br br br Spread of the idea br br The term was popularized by the Australian philosopher Peter Singer in his book Animal Liberation Singer had known Ryder from his own time as a graduate philosophy student at Oxford He credited Ryder with having coined the term and used it in the title of his book s fifth chapter Man s Dominion a short history of speciesism defining it as a prejudice or attitude of bias in favour of the interests of members of one s own species and against those of members of other species br br Racists violate the principle of equality by giving greater weight to the interests of members of their own race when there is a clash between their interests and the interests of those of another race Sexists violate the principle of equality by favouring the interests of their own sex Similarly speciesists allow the interests of their own species to override the greater interests of members of other species The pattern is identical in each case br Singer stated from a preference utilitarian perspective writing that speciesism violates the principle of equal consideration of interests the idea based on Jeremy Bentham s principle each to count for one and none for more than one Singer stated that although there may be differences between humans and nonhumans they share the capacity to suffer and we must give equal consideration to that suffering Any position that allows similar cases to be treated in a dissimilar fashion fails to qualify as an acceptable moral theory The term caught on Singer wrote that it was an awkward word but that he could not think of a better one It became an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in defined as discrimination against or exploitation of animal species by human beings based on an assumption of mankind s superiority In the Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy offered a wider definition By analogy with racism and sexism the improper stance of refusing respect to the lives dignity or needs of animals of other than the human species br br br Anti speciesism movement br br The French language journal Cahiers antisp cistes Antispeciesist notebooks was founded in by David Olivier Yves Bonnardel and Fran oise Blanchon who were the first French activists to speak out against speciesism The aim of the journal was to disseminate anti speciesist ideas in France and to encourage debate on the topic of animal ethics specifically on the difference between animal liberation and ecology Estela D az and Oscar Horta assert that in Spanish speaking countries unlike English speaking countries anti speciesism has become the dominant approach for animal advocacy In Italy two distinct trends have been identified in the contemporary anti speciesist movement the first focusing on radical counter hegemonic positions and the second on mainstream neoliberal ones br In the st century animal rights groups such as the Farm Animal Rights Movement and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals have attempted to popularize the concept by promoting a World Day Against Speciesism on June The World Day for the End of Speciesism WoDES is a similar annual observance held at the end of August The WoDES has been held annually since br br br Social psychology and relationship with other prejudices br In the book Why We Love and Exploit Animals Kristof Dhont Gordon Hodson Ana C Leite and Alina Salmen reveal the psychological connections between speciesism and other prejudices such as racism and sexism Marjetka Gole Kau i connects racism and speciesism saying that discriminations based on race and species are strongly interrelated with human rights providing the legal ground for the development of the animal rights Kau i further argues that racism and speciesism are further connected to issues of freedom both collective and individual br In one study participants responded to questions on the Speciesism Scale and those who scored higher on this scale scored higher on racism sexism and homophobia scales Other studies suggest that those who support animal exploitation also tend to endorse racist and sexist views furthering the beliefs in human supremacy and group dominance in order to justify systems of inequality and oppression It is suggested that the connection rests in the ideology of social dominance br Psychologists have also considered examining speciesism as a specific psychological construct or attitude as opposed to speciesism as a philosophy which was achieved using a specifically designed Likert scale Studies have found that speciesism is a stable construct that differs amongst personalities and correlates with other variables For example speciesism has been found to have a weak positive correlation with homophobia and right wing authoritarianism as well as slightly stronger correlations with political conservatism racism and system justification Moderate positive correlations were found with social dominance orientation and sexism Social dominance orientation was theorised to be underpinning most of the correlations controlling for social dominance orientation reduces all correlations substantially and renders many statistically insignificant Speciesism likewise predicts levels of prosociality toward animals and behavioural food choices br Those who state that speciesism is unfair to individuals of nonhuman species have often invoked mammals and chickens in the context of research or farming There is not yet a clear definition or line agreed upon by a significant segment of the movement as to which species are to be treated equally with humans or in some ways additionally protected mammals birds reptiles arthropods insects bacteria etc This question is all the more complex since a study by Miralles et al has brought to light the evolutionary component of human empathic and compassionate reactions and the influence of anthropomorphic mechanisms in our affective relationship with the living world as a whole the more an organism is evolutionarily distant from us the less we recognize ourselves in it and the less we are moved by its fate br Some researchers have suggested that since speciesism could be considered in terms of social psychology a prejudice defined as any attitude emotion or behaviour toward members of a group which directly or indirectly implies some negativity or antipathy toward that group then laypeople may be aware of a connection between it and other forms of traditional prejudice Research suggests laypeople do indeed tend to infer similar personality traits and beliefs from a speciesist that they would from a racist sexist or homophobe However it is not clear if there is a link between speciesism and non traditional forms of prejudice such as negative attitudes towards the overweight or towards Christians br Psychological studies have furthermore argued that people tend to morally value individuals of certain species less than others even when beliefs about intelligence and sentience are accounted for One study identified that there are age related differences in moral views of animal worth with children holding less speciesist beliefs than adults the authors argue that such findings indicate that the development of speciesist beliefs is socially constructed over an individual s lifetime br br br Relationship with the animal industrial complex br br Piers Beirne considers speciesism as the ideological anchor of the intersecting networks of the animal industrial complex such as factory farms vivisection hunting and fishing zoos and aquaria wildlife trade and so forth Amy Fitzgerald and Nik Taylor argue that the animal industrial complex is both a consequence and cause of speciesism which according to them is a form of discrimination similar to racism or sexism They also argue that the obfuscation of meat s animal origins is a critical part of the animal industrial complex under capitalist and neoliberal regimes Speciesism results in the belief that humans have the right to use non human animals which is so pervasive in the modern society br Sociologist David Nibert states br br The profound cultural devaluation of other animals that permits the violence that underlies the animal industrial complex is produced by far reaching speciesist socialization For instance the system of primary and secondary education under the capitalist system largely indoctrinates young people into the dominant societal beliefs and values including a great deal of procapitalist and speciesist ideology The devalued status of other animals is deeply ingrained animals appear in schools merely as caged pets as dissection and vivisection subjects and as lunch On television and in movies the unworthiness of other animals is evidenced by their virtual invisibility when they do appear they generally are marginalized vilified or objectified Not surprisingly these and numerous other sources of speciesism are so ideologically profound that those who raise compelling moral objections to animal oppression largely are dismissed if not ridiculed br Some scholars have argued that all kinds of animal production are rooted in speciesism reducing animals to mere economic resources Built on the production and slaughter of animals the animal industrial complex is perceived as the materialization of the institution of speciesism with speciesism becoming a mode of production In his book Critical Theory and Animal Liberation J Sanbonmatsu argues that speciesism is not ignorance or the absence of a moral code towards animals but is a mode of production and material system imbricated with capitalism br br br Arguments in favor br br br Philosophical br br Philosopher Carl Cohen stated in Speciesism is not merely plausible it is essential for right conduct because those who will not make the morally relevant distinctions among species are almost certain in consequence to misapprehend their true obligations Cohen writes that racism and sexism are wrong because there are no relevant differences between the sexes or races Between people and animals he states there are significant differences his view is that animals do not qualify for Kantian personhood and as such have no rights br Nel Noddings the American feminist has criticized Singer s concept of speciesism for being simplistic and for failing to take into account the context of species preference as concepts of racism and sexism have taken into account the context of discrimination against humans Peter Staudenmaier has stated that comparisons between speciesism and racism or sexism are trivializing br br The central analogy to the civil rights movement and the women s movement is trivializing and ahistorical Both of those social movements were initiated and driven by members of the dispossessed and excluded groups themselves not by benevolent men or white people acting on their behalf Both movements were built precisely around the idea of reclaiming and reasserting a shared humanity in the face of a society that had deprived it and denied it No civil rights activist or feminist ever argued We re sentient beings too They argued We re fully human too Animal liberation doctrine far from extending this humanist impulse directly undermines it br A similar argument was made by Bernard Williams who observed that a difference between speciesism versus racism and sexism is that racists and sexists deny any input from those of a different race or sex when it comes to questioning how they should be treated Conversely when it comes to how animals should be treated by humans Williams observed that it is only possible for humans to discuss that question Williams observed that being a human being is often used as an argument against discrimination on the grounds of race or sex whereas racism and sexism are seldom deployed to counter discrimination br Williams also stated in favour of speciesism which he termed humanism arguing that Why are fancy properties which are grouped under the label of personhood morally relevant to issues of destroying a certain kind of animal while the property of being a human being is not Williams states that to respond by arguing that it is because these are properties considered valuable by human beings does not undermine speciesism as humans also consider human beings to be valuable thus justifying speciesism Williams then states that the only way to resolve this would be by arguing that these properties are simply better but in that case one would need to justify why these properties are better if not because of human attachment to them Christopher Grau supported Williams arguing that if one used properties like rationality sentience and moral agency as criteria for moral status as an alternative to species based moral status then it would need to be shown why these particular properties are to be used instead of others there must be something that gives them special status Grau states that to claim these are simply better properties would require the existence of an impartial observer an enchanted picture of the universe to state them to be so Thus Grau states that such properties have no greater justification as criteria for moral status than being a member of a species does Grau also states that even if such an impartial perspective existed it still would not necessarily be against speciesism since it is entirely possible that there could be reasons given by an impartial observer for humans to care about humanity Grau then further observes that if an impartial observer existed and valued only minimalizing suffering it would likely be overcome with horror at the suffering of all individuals and would rather have humanity annihilate the planet than allow it to continue Grau thus concludes that those endorsing the idea of deriving values from an impartial observer do not seem to have seriously considered the conclusions of such an idea br Douglas Maclean agreed that Singer raised important questions and challenges particularly with his argument from marginal cases However Maclean questioned if different species can be fitted with human morality observing that animals were generally held exempt from morality Maclean notes that most people would try to stop a man kidnapping and killing a woman but would regard a hawk capturing and killing a marmot with awe and criticise anyone who tried to intervene Maclean thus suggests that morality only makes sense under human relations with the further one gets from it the less it can be applied br The British philosopher Roger Scruton regards the emergence of the animal rights and anti speciesism movement as the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview because the idea of rights and responsibilities is he states distinctive to the human condition and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species Scruton argues that if animals have rights then they also have duties which animals would routinely violate such as by breaking laws or killing other animals He accuses anti speciesism advocates of pre scientific anthropomorphism attributing traits to animals that are he says Beatrix Potter like where only man is vile It is he states a fantasy a world of escape br Thomas Wells states that Singer s call for ending animal suffering would justify simply exterminating every animal on the planet in order to prevent the numerous ways in which they suffer as they could no longer feel any pain Wells also stated that by focusing on the suffering humans inflict on animals and ignoring suffering animals inflict upon themselves or that inflicted by nature Singer is creating a hierarchy where some suffering is more important than others despite claiming to be committed to equality of suffering Wells also states that the capacity to suffer Singer s criteria for moral status is one of degree rather than absolute categories Wells observes that Singer denies moral status to plants on the grounds they cannot subjectively feel anything even though they react to stimuli yet Wells alleges there is no indication that nonhuman animals feel pain and suffering the way humans do br Robert Nozick notes that if species membership is irrelevant then this would mean that endangered animals have no special claim br The Rev John Tuohey founder of the Providence Center for Health Care Ethics writes that the logic behind the anti speciesism critique is flawed and that although the animal rights movement in the United States has been influential in slowing animal experimentation and in some cases halting particular studies no one has offered a compelling argument for species equality br br br Arguments against br br br Moral community argument from marginal cases br br Paola Cavalieri writes that the current humanist paradigm is that only human beings are members of the moral community and that all are worthy of equal protection Species membership she writes is ipso facto moral membership The paradigm has an inclusive side all human beings deserve equal protection and an exclusive one only human beings have that status br Nonhumans do possess some moral status in many societies but it generally extends only to protection against what Cavalieri calls wanton cruelty Anti speciesists state that the extension of moral membership to all humanity regardless of individual properties such as intelligence while denying it to nonhumans also regardless of individual properties is internally inconsistent According to the argument from marginal cases if infants the senile the comatose and the cognitively disabled marginal case human beings have a certain moral status then nonhuman animals must be awarded that status too since there is no morally relevant ability that the marginal case humans have that nonhumans lack br American legal scholar Steven M Wise states that speciesism is a bias as arbitrary as any other He cites the philosopher R G Frey a leading animal rights critic who wrote in that if forced to choose between abandoning experiments on animals and allowing experiments on marginal case humans he would choose the latter not because I begin a monster and end up choosing the monstrous but because I cannot think of anything at all compelling that cedes all human life of any quality greater value than animal life of any quality br br br Discontinuous mind br br Richard Dawkins the evolutionary biologist wrote against speciesism in The Blind Watchmaker The Great Ape Project and The God Delusion elucidating the connection with evolutionary theory He compares former racist attitudes and assumptions to their present day speciesist counterparts In the chapter The one true tree of life in The Blind Watchmaker he states that it is not only zoological taxonomy that is saved from awkward ambiguity by the extinction of intermediate forms but also human ethics and law Dawkins states that what he calls the discontinuous mind is ubiquitous dividing the world into units that reflect nothing but our use of language and animals into discontinuous species br br The director of a zoo is entitled to put down a chimpanzee that is surplus to requirements while any suggestion that he might put down a redundant keeper or ticket seller would be greeted with howls of incredulous outrage The chimpanzee is the property of the zoo Humans are nowadays not supposed to be anybody s property yet the rationale for discriminating against chimpanzees is seldom spelled out and I doubt if there is a defensible rationale at all Such is the breathtaking speciesism of our Christian inspired attitudes the abortion of a single human zygote most of them are destined to be spontaneously aborted anyway can arouse more moral solicitude and righteous indignation than the vivisection of any number of intelligent adult chimpanzees The only reason we can be comfortable with such a double standard is that the intermediates between humans and chimps are all dead br Dawkins elaborated in a discussion with Singer at The Center for Inquiry in when asked whether he continues to eat meat It s a little bit like the position which many people would have held a couple of hundred years ago over slavery Where lots of people felt morally uneasy about slavery but went along with it because the whole economy of the South depended upon slavery br br br Centrality of consciousness br br Libertarian extension is the idea that the intrinsic value of nature can be extended beyond sentient beings This seeks to apply the principle of individual rights not only to all animals but also to objects without a nervous system such as trees plants and rocks Ryder rejects this argument writing that value cannot exist in the absence of consciousness or potential consciousness Thus rocks and rivers and houses have no interests and no rights of their own This does not mean of course that they are not of value to us and to many other beings who experience pain including those who need them as habitats and who would suffer without them br br br Comparisons to the Holocaust br br David Sztybel states in his paper Can the Treatment of Animals Be Compared to the Holocaust that the racism of the Nazis is comparable to the speciesism inherent in eating meat or using animal by products particularly those produced on factory farms Y Michael Barilan an Israeli physician states that speciesism is not the same thing as Nazi racism because the latter extolled the abuser and condemned the weaker and the abused He describes speciesism as the recognition of rights on the basis of group membership rather than solely on the basis of moral considerations br br br Law and policy br br br Law br br The first major statute addressing animal protection in the United States titled An Act for the More Effectual Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was enacted in It provided the right to incriminate and enforce protection with regards to animal cruelty The act which has since been revised to suit modern cases state by state originally addressed such things as animal neglect abandonment torture fighting transport impound standards and licensing standards Although an animal rights movement had already started as early as the late s some of the laws that would shape the way animals would be treated as industry grew were enacted around the same time that Richard Ryder was bringing the notion of Speciesism to the conversation Legislation was being proposed and passed in the U S that would reshape animal welfare in industry and science Bills such as Humane Slaughter Act which was created to alleviate some of the suffering felt by livestock during slaughter was passed in Later the Animal Welfare Act of passed by the th United States Congress and signed into law by President Lyndon B Johnson was designed to put much stricter regulations and supervisions on the handling of animals used in laboratory experimentation and exhibition but has since been amended and expanded These groundbreaking laws foreshadowed and influenced the shifting attitudes toward nonhuman animals in their rights to humane treatment which Richard D Ryder and Peter Singer would later popularize in the s and s br br br Great ape personhood br br Great ape personhood is the idea that the attributes of non human great apes are such that their sentience and personhood should be recognized by the law rather than simply protecting them as a group under animal cruelty legislation Awarding personhood to nonhuman primates would require that their individual interests be taken into account br br br Films and television series with themes around speciesism br br br See also br br br br br br Sources br Best Steven The Politics of Total Liberation
