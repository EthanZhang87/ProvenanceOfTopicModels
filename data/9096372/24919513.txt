The hectare SI symbol ha is a non SI metric unit of area equal to a square with metre sides hm that is square meters m and is primarily used in the measurement of land There are hectares in one square kilometre An acre is about hectares and one hectare contains about acres br br In when the metric system was introduced the are was defined as square metres or one square decametre and the hectare hecto are was thus ares or km square metres When the metric system was further rationalised in resulting in the International System of Units SI the are was not included as a recognised unit The hectare however remains as a non SI unit accepted for use with the SI and whose use is expected to continue indefinitely Though the dekare decare daa m and are m are not officially accepted for use they are still used in some contexts br br br Description br br The hectare although not a unit of SI is the only named unit of area that is accepted for use with SI units The name was coined in French from the Latin rea In practice the hectare is fully derived from the SI being equivalent to a square hectometre It is widely used throughout the world for the measurement of large areas of land and it is the legal unit of measure in domains concerned with land ownership planning and management including law land deeds agriculture forestry and town planning throughout the European Union New Zealand and br Australia since br However the United Kingdom the United States Myanmar Burma and to some extent Canada use the acre instead of the hectare for measuring surface or land area br Some countries that underwent a general conversion from traditional measurements to metric measurements e g Canada required a resurvey when units of measure in legal descriptions relating to land were converted to metric units Others such as South Africa published conversion factors which were to be used particularly when preparing consolidation diagrams by compilation br In many countries metrification redefined or clarified existing measures in terms of metric units The following legacy units of area have been redefined as being equal to one hectare br br Jerib Persian in Iran br Djerib Turkish cerip in Turkey br Gongqing traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin g ngq ng in China br Manzana in Argentina br Bunder in the Netherlands until br In Mexico land area measurements are commonly given as combinations of hectares ares and centiares These are commonly written separated by a dash for example ha would mean hectare ares and centiares m br br br History br The metric system of measurement was first given a legal basis in by the French Revolutionary government The law of Germinal Year III April defined five units of measure br br The metre for length br The are m for area of land br The st re m for volume of stacked firewood br The litre dm for volumes of liquid br The gram for mass br In when the metric system was updated as the International System of Units SI the are did not receive international recognition The International Committee for Weights and Measures CIPM makes no mention of the are in the edition of the SI brochure but classifies the hectare as a Non SI unit accepted for use with the International System of Units br In the European Economic Community EEC passed directive EEC which catalogued the units of measure that might be used within the Community The units that were catalogued replicated the recommendations of the CGPM supplemented by a few other units including the are and implicitly the hectare whose use was limited to the measurement of land br br br Unit family br br The names centiare deciare decare and hectare are derived by adding the standard metric prefixes to the original base unit of area the are br br br Decimilliare br The decimilliare dma sometimes seen in cadastre area evaluation of real estate plots is are or one square decimetre Such usage of a double prefix is non standard The decimilliare is roughly a four inch by four inch square br br br Centiare br The centiare is one square metre br br br Deciare br The deciare rarely used is ten square metres br br br Are br br The are or is a unit of area equal to square metres m m used for measuring land area It was defined by older forms of the metric system but is now outside the modern International System of Units SI It is still commonly used in speech to measure real estate in particular in Indonesia India and in various European countries br In Russian and some other languages of the former Soviet Union the are is called sotka Russian a hundred i e m or hectare It is used to describe the size of suburban dacha or allotment garden plots or small city parks where the hectare would be too large Many Russian dachas are ares in size in Russian br br br Decare br The decare or dekare is derived from deca and are and is equal to ares or square metres It is used in Norway and in the former Ottoman areas of the Middle East and Bulgaria as a measure of land area Instead of the name decare the names of traditional land measures are usually used redefined as one decare br br Stremma in Greece br Dunam dunum dulum donum or d n
