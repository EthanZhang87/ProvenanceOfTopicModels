Management br The public areas of Regent s Park are managed by The Royal Parks a charity The Crown Estate Paving Commission is responsible for managing certain aspects of the built environment of Regent s Park The park lies within the boundaries of the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Camden but those authorities have only peripheral input to the management of the park The Crown Estate owns the freehold of Regent s Park br br br History br br In the Middle Ages the land was part of the manor of Tyburn acquired by Barking Abbey The s Dissolution of the Monasteries meant Henry VIII appropriated it under that statutory forfeiture with minor compensation scheme It has been state property since It was set aside as a hunting and forestry park Marylebone Park from that Dissolution until after which it was let as small holdings for hay and dairy produce br br br Development by John Nash James Burton and Decimus Burton br Although the park was initially the idea of the Prince Regent and was named for him James Burton the pre eminent London property developer was responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of John Nash s London designs and for their construction Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style John Nash needed the son s aid as well as the father s Subsequent to the Crown Estate s refusal to finance them James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of John Nash at Regent s Park which he had already been commissioned to construct consequently in Burton purchased many of the leases of the proposed terraces around and proposed villas within Regent s Park and in Burton purchased the leases of five of the largest blocks on Regent Street The first property to be constructed in or around Regent s Park by Burton was his own mansion The Holme which was designed by his son Decimus Burton and completed in Burton s extensive financial involvement effectively guaranteed the success of the project In return Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton Such were James Burton s contributions to the project that the Commissioners of Woods described James not Nash as the architect of Regent s Park br Contrary to popular belief the dominant architectural influence in many of the Regent s Park projects including Cornwall Terrace York Terrace Chester Terrace Clarence Terrace and the villas of the Inner Circle all of which were constructed by James Burton s company was Decimus Burton not John Nash who was appointed architectural overseer for Decimus s projects To the chagrin of Nash Decimus largely disregarded his advice and developed the Terraces according to his own style to the extent that Nash sought the demolition and complete rebuilding of Chester Terrace but in vain Decimus s terraces were built by his father James br The Regent s Park scheme was integrated with other schemes built for the Prince Regent by the triplet of Nash James Burton and Decimus Burton these included Regent Street and Carlton House Terrace in a grand sweep of town planning stretching from St James s Park to Primrose Hill The scheme is considered one of the first examples of a garden suburb and continues to influence the design of suburbs The park was first opened to the general public in initially two days a week The diary of William Copeland Astbury describes in detail his daily walks in and around the park with references to the Zoo the canal and surrounding streets as well as features of daily life in the area br br br Subsequent history br On January forty people died when the ice cover on the boating lake collapsed and over people plunged into the lake The lake was subsequently drained and its depth reduced to four feet before being reopened to the public br br Late in the Home Postal Depot Royal Engineers moved to a purpose built wooden building sq ft on Chester Road Regent s Park This new facility contained the depot s administration offices a large parcel office and
