The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA is a regulatory agency of the United States Department of Labor that originally had federal visitorial powers to inspect and examine workplaces The United States Congress established the agency under the Occupational Safety and Health Act OSH Act which President Richard M Nixon signed into law on December OSHA s mission is to assure safe and healthy working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training outreach education and assistance The agency is also charged with enforcing a variety of whistleblower statutes and regulations OSHA s workplace safety inspections have been shown to reduce injury rates and injury costs without adverse effects on employment sales credit ratings or firm survival br br br History br The Bureau of Labor Standards of the Department of Labor has worked on some work safety issues since its creation in Economic boom and associated labor turnover during World War II worsened work safety in nearly all areas of the United States economy but after accidents again declined as long term forces reasserted themselves Additionally new and powerful labor unions played an increasingly important role in worker safety post World War II In the s increasing economic expansion again led to rising injury rates and the resulting political pressures led Congress to establish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA on April the date that the Occupational Health and Safety Act became effective The new agency incorporated much of what had been the original Bureau of Labor Standards George Guenther was appointed by Labor Secretary James D Hodgson as the agency s first director br OSHA has run a number of training compliance assistance and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history The OSHA Training Institute which trains government and private sector health and safety personnel began in In the agency began a grant making program now called the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program to train workers and employers in reducing workplace hazards OSHA started the Voluntary Protection Programs in which allow employers to apply as model workplaces to achieve special designation if they meet certain requirements br br br OSH Act coverage br The OSH Act covers most private sector employers and their workers in addition to some public sector employers and workers in the states and certain territories and jurisdictions under federal authority Those jurisdictions include the District of Columbia Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands American Samoa Guam Northern Mariana Islands Wake Island Johnston Island and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act br br br Private sector employers br The OSH Act covers most private sector employers in all states the District of Columbia and other U S jurisdictions either directly through federal OSHA or through an OSHA approved state plan br State plans are OSHA approved job safety and health programs operated by individual states instead of federal OSHA Federal OSHA approves and monitors all state plans and provides as much as fifty percent of the funding for each program State run safety and health programs are required to be at least as effective as the federal OSHA program br The following states or territories have OSHA approved state programs Alaska Arizona California Hawaii Indiana Iowa Kentucky Maryland Michigan Minnesota Nevada New Mexico North Carolina Oregon Puerto Rico South Carolina Tennessee Utah Vermont Virginia Washington and Wyoming br Federal OSHA provides coverage to certain workplaces specifically excluded from a state s plan such as work in maritime industries or on military bases br br br State and local governments br Workers at state and local government agencies are not covered by federal OSHA but have OSH Act protections if they work in those states that have an OSHA approved state program OSH Act rules also permit states and territories to develop plans that cover only public sector state and local government workers In these cases private sector workers and employers remain under federal OSHA jurisdiction Five additional states and one U S territory have OSHA approved state plans that cover public sector workers only Connecticut Illinois Maine New Jersey New York and the Virgin Islands br br br Federal government agencies br OSHA s protection applies to all federal agencies Section of the OSH Act makes federal agency heads responsible for providing safe and healthful working conditions for their workers OSHA conducts inspections of federal facilities in response to workers reports of hazards and under programs that target high hazard federal workplaces br Federal agencies must have a safety and health program that meets the same standards as private employers OSHA issues virtual fines to federal agencies following an inspection where violations are found OSHA issues a press release stating the size of the fine would be if the federal agency were a private sector employer Under a amendment the OSH Act covers the U S Postal Service the same as any private sector employer br br br Not covered under the OSH Act br The OSH Act does not cover the self employed immediate family members of farm employers or workplace hazards regulated by another federal agency for example the Mine Safety and Health Administration the Department of Energy or Coast Guard br br br Rights and responsibilities under OSH Act law br Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe workplace br By law employers must provide their workers with a workplace that does not have serious hazards and they must follow all OSH Act safety and health standards Employers are obligated to identify and rectify safety and health problems The OSH Act further requires that employers must first attempt to eliminate or reduce hazards by making feasible changes in working conditions rather than relying solely on personal protective equipment such as masks gloves or earplugs Examples of effective ways to eliminate or reduce risks include switching to safer chemicals enclosing processes to trap harmful fumes or using ventilation systems to clean the air br Employers must also br br Inform workers about chemical hazards through training labels alarms color coded systems chemical information sheets and other relevant methods br Provide safety training to workers in a language and vocabulary they can understand br Keep accurate records of work related injuries and illnesses br Perform tests in the workplace such as air sampling required by some OSH Act standards br Provide the required personal protective equipment at no cost to workers as employers must pay for most types of required personal protective equipment br Provide hearing exams or other medical tests when required by OSH Act standards br Post OSHA citations and annually post injury and illness summary data where workers can see them br Notify OSHA within eight hours of a workplace fatality and within hours of all work related inpatient hospitalizations br Prominently display the official OSHA Job Safety and Health It s the Law poster that describes rights and responsibilities under the OSH Act br Not retaliate or discriminate against workers for using their rights under the law including their right to report a work related injury or illness br Workers have the right to br br Working conditions that do not pose a risk of serious harm br File a confidential complaint with OSHA to have their workplace inspected br Receive information and training about hazards methods to prevent harm and the OSH Act standards that apply to their workplace The training must be conducted in a language and vocabulary that workers can understand br Receive copies of records of work related injuries and illnesses that occur in their workplace br Receive copies of the results from tests and monitoring conducted to identify and measure hazards in their workplace br Receive copies of their workplace medical records br Participate in an OSHA inspection and speak in private with the inspector br File a complaint with OSHA if they have faced retaliation or discrimination from their employer as a result of requesting an inspection or exercising any of their other rights under the OSH Act br File a complaint if punished or retaliated against for acting as a whistleblower under the additional federal laws for which OSHA has jurisdiction br Temporary workers must be treated like permanent employees Staffing agencies and host employers share joint accountability for temporary workers Both entities are therefore obligated to comply with workplace health and safety requirements and ensure worker safety and health OSHA could hold both the host and temporary employers responsible for any violations br br br Health and safety standards br The Occupational Safety and Health Act grants OSHA the authority to issue workplace health and safety regulations These regulations include limits on hazardous chemical exposure employee access to hazard information requirements for the use of personal protective equipment and requirements to prevent falls and hazards from operating dangerous equipment br The OSH Act s current Construction General Industry Maritime and Agriculture standards are designed to protect workers from a wide range of serious hazards Examples of OSHA standards include requirements for employers to provide fall protection such as a safety harness line or guardrails prevent trenching cave ins prevent exposure to some infectious diseases ensure the safety of workers who enter confined spaces prevent exposure to harmful chemicals put guards on dangerous machines provide respirators or other safety equipment and provide training for certain dangerous jobs in a language and vocabulary workers can understand br OSHA sets enforceable permissible exposure limits PELs to protect workers against the health effects of exposure to hazardous substances including limits on the airborne concentrations of hazardous chemicals in the air Most of OSHA s PELs were issued shortly after the adoption of the OSH Act in Attempts to issue more stringent PELs have been blocked by litigation from the industry thus the vast majority of PELs have not been updated since The agency has issued non binding alternate occupational exposure limits that may better protect workers br Employers must also comply with the General Duty Clause of the OSH Act This clause requires employers to keep their workplaces free of serious recognized hazards and is generally cited when no specific OSHA standard applies to the hazard br In its first year of operation OSHA was permitted to adopt regulations based on guidelines set by certain standards organizations such as the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists without going through all of the requirements of a typical rule making br OSHA is granted the authority to promulgate standards that prescribe the methods employers are legally required to follow to protect their workers from hazards Before OSHA can issue a standard it must go through a very extensive and lengthy process that includes substantial public engagement notice and comment The agency must show that a significant risk to workers exists and that there are feasible measures employers can take to protect their workers br In OSHA issued an ergonomics standard In March Congress voted to repeal the standard through the Congressional Review Act The repeal one of the first major pieces of legislation signed by President George W Bush is the first instance that Congress has successfully used the Congressional Review Act to block regulation br Since OSHA has issued the following standards br br Exit Routes Emergency Action Plans and Fire Prevention Plans br Commercial Diving Operations br Fire Protection in Shipyards br Occupational Exposure to Hexavalent Chromium br Assigned Protection Factors for Respiratory Protection Equipment br Electrical Installation Standard br Personal Protective Equipment Payment Clarification br Vertical Tandem Lifts br Cranes and Derricks in Construction br General Working Conditions in Shipyards br GHS Update to the Hazard Communication Standard br New Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements for Employers br Revision to Electric Power Generation Transmission and Distribution Electrical Protective Equipment br Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica br Update General Industry Walking Working Surfaces and Fall Protection Standards br br br Enforcement br OSHA is responsible for enforcing its standards on regulated entities Compliance Safety and Health Officers carry out inspections and assess fines for regulatory violations Inspections are planned for worksites in particularly hazardous industries Inspections can also be triggered by a workplace fatality multiple hospitalizations worker complaints or referrals br OSHA is a small agency given the size of its mission with its state partners OSHA has approximately inspectors covering more than million workplaces where million workers are employed In Fiscal Year ending Sept OSHA and its state partners conducted more than inspections of workplaces across the United States just a fraction of the nation s worksites According to a report by AFL CIO it would take OSHA years to inspect all workplaces under its jurisdiction br Enforcement plays an important part in OSHA s efforts to reduce workplace injuries illnesses and fatalities Inspections are initiated without advance notice conducted using on site or telephone and facsimile investigations performed by trained compliance officers and scheduled based on the following priorities highest to lowest imminent danger catastrophes fatalities or hospitalizations worker complaints and referrals targeted inspections particular hazards high injury rates and follow up inspections br Current workers or their representatives may file a complaint and ask OSHA to inspect their workplace if they believe that there is a serious hazard or that their employer is not following OSHA standards Workers and their representatives have the right to ask for an inspection without OSHA telling their employer who filed the complaint It is a violation of the OSH Act for an employer to fire demote transfer or in any way discriminate against a worker for filing a complaint or using other OSHA rights br When an inspector finds violations of OSHA standards or serious hazards OSHA may issue citations and fines A citation includes methods an employer may use to fix a problem and the date by which the corrective actions must be completed br OSHA s fines are very low compared with other government agencies They were raised for the first time since on August to comply with the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act passed by Congress to advance the effectiveness of civil monetary penalties and to maintain their deterrent effect The new law directs agencies to adjust their penalties for inflation each year The maximum OSHA fine for a serious violation is which can be assessed daily after a failure to abate the violation and the maximum fine for a repeat or willful violation is In determining the amount of the proposed penalty OSHA must take into account the gravity of the alleged violation and the employer s size of business good faith and history of previous violations Employers have the right to contest any part of the citation including whether a violation actually exists Workers only have the right to challenge the deadline by which a problem must be resolved Appeals of citations are heard by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission OSHRC br In the COVID pandemic caused about workers and their families to contract the virus with four deaths at the Smithfield Foods packing plant in Sioux Falls South Dakota The governor Kristi Noem resisted initiating and enforcing measures to protect workers and the community The plant was fined the maximum allowed at the time by OSHA for what was considered a single violation br OSHA carries out its enforcement activities through its regional offices and area offices OSHA s regional offices are located in Boston New York City Philadelphia Atlanta Chicago Dallas Kansas City Denver San Francisco and Seattle br br br Record keeping requirements br Tracking and investigating workplace injuries and illnesses play an important role in preventing future injuries and illnesses Under OSHA s Recordkeeping regulation certain covered employers in high hazard industries are required to prepare and maintain records of serious occupational injuries and illnesses This information is important for employers workers and OSHA in evaluating the safety of a workplace understanding industry hazards and implementing worker protections to reduce and eliminate hazards br Employers with more than ten employees and whose establishments are not classified as a partially exempt industry must record serious work related injuries and illnesses using OSHA Forms A and Recordkeeping forms requirements and exemption information are on OSHA s website br br br Whistleblower Protection Program br OSHA s Whistleblower Protection Program WPP enforces the whistleblower provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and other statutes protecting workers who report violations of various airline commercial motor carrier consumer product environmental financial reform food safety health care reform nuclear pipeline public transportation agency maritime and securities laws Unlike OSHA s Safety Enforcement complaints or referrals being completely anonymous OSHA s whistleblower investigations can not be anonymous as a Respondent is required to address all allegations of adverse actions taken against Complainant s employment Additionally these whistleblower investigations follow the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting framework WPP s Investigators conduct complex investigations pertaining to complaints of retaliation by an employer Respondent against an employee Complainant who reported a violation s covered under one of the statutes br WPP Investigators act as neutral fact finders they do not work for either the Complainant or Respondent A WPP Investigator s job is to impartially gather and analyze all relevant evidence to determine whether unlawful whistleblower retaliation has occurred Over the years OSHA s WPP has been responsible for enforcing these laws that protect the rights of workers to speak up without fear of retaliation regardless of the relationship of these laws to occupational safety and health matters br br br Compliance assistance br br OSHA has developed several training compliance assistance and health and safety recognition programs throughout its history br The OSHA Training Institute which trains government and private sector health and safety personnel began in In the agency began a grant making program now called the Susan Harwood Training Grant Program to train workers and employers in identifying and reducing workplace hazards br The Voluntary Protection Program VPP recognizes employers and workers in private industry and federal agencies who have implemented effective safety and health management programs and maintain injury and illness rates below the national average for their respective industries In VPP management labor and OSHA work cooperatively and proactively to prevent fatalities injuries and illnesses through a system focused on hazard prevention and control worksite analysis training and management commitment and worker involvement br OSHA s On site Consultation Program offers free and confidential advice to small and medium sized businesses in all states across the country with priority given to high hazard worksites Each year responding to requests from small employers looking to create or improve their safety and health management programs OSHA s On site Consultation Program conducts over visits to small business worksites covering over million workers across the nation On site consultation services are separate from enforcement and do not result in penalties or citations Consultants from state agencies or universities work with employers to identify workplace hazards provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards and assist in establishing safety and health management programs br Under the consultation program certain exemplary employers may request participation in OSHA s Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program SHARP Eligibility for participation includes but is not limited to receiving a full service comprehensive consultation visit correcting all identified hazards and developing an effective safety and health management program Worksites that receive SHARP recognition are exempt from programmed inspections during the period that the SHARP certification is valid br OSHA also provides compliance assistance through its national and area offices Through hundreds of publications in a variety of languages website safety and health topics pages and through compliance assistance staff OSHA provides information to employers and workers on specific hazards and OSHA rights and responsibilities br br br Efficacy br A study in Science found that OSHA s random workplace safety inspections caused a decline in injury rates and a reduction in injury cost for the inspected firms The study found no evidence that these improvements came at the expense of employment sales credit ratings or firm survival A study in the American Economic Review found that the decision by the Obama administration to issue press releases that named and shamed facilities that violated OSHA safety and health regulations led other facilities to increase their compliance and to experience fewer workplace injuries The study estimated that each press release had the same effect on compliance as inspections br Much of the debate about OSHA regulations and enforcement policies revolve around the cost of regulations and enforcement versus the actual benefit in reduced worker injury illness and death A study of several OSHA standards by the Office of Technology Assessment OTA found that OSHA relies generally on methods that provide a credible basis for the determinations essential to rulemaking Though it found that OSHA s findings and estimates are subject to vigorous review and challenge it stated that this is natural because interested parties and experts involved in rulemakings have differing visions br OSHA has come under considerable criticism for the ineffectiveness of its penalties particularly its criminal penalties The maximum penalty is a misdemeanor with a maximum of months in jail In response to the criticism OSHA in conjunction with the Department of Justice has pursued several high profile criminal prosecutions for violations under the Act and has announced a joint enforcement initiative between OSHA and the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA which has the ability to issue much higher fines than OSHA Meanwhile Congressional Democrats labor unions and community safety and health advocates are attempting to revise the OSH Act to make it a felony with much higher penalties to commit a willful violation that results in the death of a worker Some local prosecutors are charging company executives with manslaughter and other felonies when criminal negligence leads to the death of a worker br A New York Times investigation in showed that over the year period from to workers died in incidents in which OSHA investigators concluded that employers had willfully violated workplace safety laws In of these fatality cases arising from wilful violation OSHA made no referral to the U S Department of Justice for criminal prosecution The Times investigation found that OSHA had failed to pursue prosecution even when employers had been cited before for the very same safety violation and even in cases where multiple workers died In interviews current and former OSHA officials said that the low rates of criminal enforcement were the result of a bureaucracy that works at every level to thwart criminal referrals that fails to reward and sometimes penalizes those who push too hard for prosecution and that aggressive enforcement was suffocated by endless layers of review br OSHA has also been criticized for taking too long to develop new regulations For instance speaking about OSHA under the George W Bush presidency on the specific issue of combustible dust explosions Chemical Safety Board appointee Carolyn Merritt said The basic disappointment has been this attitude of no new regulation They don t want the industry to be pestered In some instances the industry has to be pestered in order to comply br br br Directors br The director of OSHA is the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health br br George Guenther April January br M Chain Robbins Acting January
