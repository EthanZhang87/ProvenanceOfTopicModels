designated by government institutions in some countries or by private landowners such as charities and research institutions Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws Normally it is more strictly protected than a nature park Various jurisdictions may use other terminology such as ecological protection area or private protected area in legislation and in official titles of the reserves br br br History br br Cultural practices that roughly equate to the establishment and maintenance of reserved areas for animals date back to

from Italy Waterton allowed local people access to his reserve and was described by David Attenborough as one of the first people anywhere to recognise not only that the natural world was of great importance but that it needed protection as humanity made more and more demands on it br Drachenfels was protected as the first state designated nature reserve in modern day Germany the site was

balance biological diversity and natural ecological processes Ecological stations are also allowed to change the environment within strictly defined limits e g affecting no more than three percent of the area or hectares acres whichever is less for the purpose of scientific research br A wildlife reserve in Brazil is also protected and hunting is not allowed but products and by products from research may be sold br Wildlife refuges in Brazil have as their objective the protection of natural flora and fauna where conditions are assured for the existence and reproduction of species or communities of the local flora and the resident or migratory fauna The refuges can consist of privately owned land as long as the objectives of the unit are compatible with the landowners usage of the
