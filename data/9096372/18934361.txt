building stands next to St Pancras station on Euston Road in Somers Town on the site of a former goods yard There is an additional storage building and reading room in the branch library near Boston Spa in Yorkshire The St Pancras building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on June and is classified as a Grade I listed building of exceptional interest for its architecture and history br br br Early foundations br The British Library was created on July as a result of the British Library Act Prior to this the national library was part of the British Museum which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library alongside smaller organisations which were folded in such as the National Central Library the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography In functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over in the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO Binderies became British Library responsibilities In the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive which holds many sound and video recordings with over a million discs and thousands of tapes br The core of the Library s historical collections is based on a series of donations and acquisitions from the th century br These are known as the foundation collections and they include the books and manuscripts br br in the possession of Sir Robert Cotton in the early th century now called the Cottonian Library br of Sir Hans Sloane d br of Robert Harley d br the King s Library of King George III and br the Old Royal Library donated by King George II br br For many years its collections were dispersed in various buildings around central London in places such as Bloomsbury within the British Museum Chancery Lane Bayswater and Holborn with an interlibrary lending centre at Boston Spa miles km east of Wetherby in West Yorkshire situated on Thorp Arch Trading Estate and the newspaper library at Colindale north west London br Initial plans for the British Library required demolition of an integral part of Bloomsbury a seven acre swathe of streets immediately in front of the Museum so that the Library could be situated directly opposite After a long and hard fought campaign led by Dr George Wagner this decision was overturned and the library was instead constructed by John Laing plc on a site at Euston Road next to St Pancras railway station br Following the closure of the Round Reading Room on October the library stock began to be moved into the St Pancras building Before the end of that year the first of eleven new reading rooms had opened and the moving of stock was continuing From to the main collection was housed in this single new building and the collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale In July the Library announced that it would be moving low use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site From January to April over km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service Construction work on the Additional Storage Building was completed in and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on November The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites The British Library Document Supply Service BLDSS and the Library s Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa Collections housed in Yorkshire comprising low use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections make up around of the total material the library holds The Library previously had a book storage depot in Woolwich south east London which is no longer in use br The new library was designed specially for the purpose by the architect Colin St John Wilson in collaboration with his wife MJ Long who came up with the plan that was subsequently developed and built Facing Euston Road is a large piazza that includes pieces of public art such as large sculptures by Eduardo Paolozzi a bronze statue based on William Blake s study of Isaac Newton and Antony Gormley It is the largest public building constructed in the United Kingdom in the th century br br In the middle of the building is a six storey glass tower inspired by a similar structure in the Beinecke Library containing the King s Library with printed volumes along with other pamphlets manuscripts and maps collected by King George III between and In December a new storage building at Boston Spa was opened by Rosie Winterton The new facility costing million has a capacity for seven million items stored in more than bar coded containers and which are retrieved by robots from the miles of temperature and humidity controlled storage space br On Friday April the Library announced that it would begin saving all sites with the suffix uk in a bid to preserve the nation s digital memory which as of then amounted to about million sites containing billion web pages The Library would make all the material publicly available to users by the end of and would ensure that through technological advancements all the material is preserved for future generations despite the fluidity of the Internet br The Euston Road building was Grade I listed on August It has plans to open a third location in Leeds potentially located in the Grade listed Temple Works br br br Legal deposit br br In England legal deposit can be traced back to at least The Copyright Act established the principle of the legal deposit ensuring that the British Library and five other libraries in Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to receive a free copy of every item published or distributed in Britain The other five libraries are the Bodleian Library at Oxford the University Library at Cambridge Trinity College Library in Dublin and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales The British Library is the only one that must automatically receive a copy of every item published in Britain the others are entitled to these items but must specifically request them from the publisher after learning that they have been or are about to be published a task done centrally by the Agency for the Legal Deposit Libraries br Further under the terms of Irish copyright law most recently the Copyright and Related Rights Act the British Library is entitled to automatically receive a free copy of every book published in Ireland alongside the National Library of Ireland Trinity College Library in Dublin the library of the University of Limerick the library of Dublin City University and the libraries of the four constituent universities of the National University of Ireland The Bodleian Library Cambridge University Library and the National Libraries of Scotland and Wales are also entitled to copies of material published in Ireland but again must formally make requests br The Legal Deposit Libraries Act extended United Kingdom legal deposit requirements to electronic documents such as CD ROMs and

restrictions In line with a government directive that the British Library must cover a percentage of its operating costs a fee is charged to the user However this service is no longer profitable and
