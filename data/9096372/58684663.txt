id: 58684663
Animal industrial complex AIC is a concept used by activists and scholars to describe what they contend is the systematic and institutionalized exploitation of animals It includes every economic activity involving animals such as the food industry e g meat dairy poultry apiculture animal testing e g academic industrial animals in space medicine e g bile and other animal products clothing e g leather silk wool fur labor and transport e g working animals animals in war remote control animals tourism and entertainment e g circus zoos blood sports trophy hunting animals held in captivity selective breeding e g pet industry artificial insemination and so forth Proponents of the term claim that activities described by the term differ from individual acts of animal cruelty in that they constitute institutionalized animal exploitation br Killing more than billion land and aquatic animals every year the AIC has been implicated in climate change ocean acidification biodiversity loss and the Holocene extinction It is also responsible for spreading of diseases from animals to humans including the COVID pandemic br br br Definitions br The expression animal industrial complex was coined by the Dutch cultural anthropologist and philosopher Barbara Noske in her book Humans and Other Animals saying that animals have become reduced to mere appendages of computers and machines The expression relates the practices organizations and overall industry that turns animals into food and other commodities to the military industrial complex xii br Richard Twine later refined the concept regarding it as the partly opaque and multiple set of networks and relationships between the corporate agricultural sector governments and public and private science With economic cultural social and affective dimensions it encompasses an extensive range of practices technologies images identities and markets Twine also discusses the overlap between the AIC and other industrial complexes such as the prison industrial complex entertainment industrial complex and pharmaceutical industrial complex Sociologist David Nibert defines the animal industrial complex as a massive network that includes grain producers ranching operations slaughterhouse and packaging firms fast food and chain restaurants and the state which he claims has deep roots in world history br The AIC essentially refers to the triple helix of influential powerful systems that control knowledge systems about meat production namely the government the corporate sphere and the academy br br br Origin and properties br Although the origin of the animal industrial complex can be traced back to the time when domestication of animals began it was only since that the complex began to grow significantly under contemporary capitalism Kim Stallwood claims that the animal industrial complex is an integral part of the neoliberal transnational order of increasing privatization and decreasing government intervention favouring transnational corporations and global capital According to Stallwood two milestones mark the shift in human attitudes toward animals that empowered the animal industrial complex namely Chicago and its stockyards and slaughterhouses from and the post World War II developments such as intensive factory farms industrial fishing and xenotransplantation In the words of Nibert the Chicago slaughterhouses were significant economic powers of the early th century and were famous for the cruel rapid paced killing and disassembly of enormous numbers of animals To elucidate animal industrial complex Stallwood cites Upton Sinclair s novel The Jungle which explicitly describes the mistreatment of animals during their lives until they end up at the slaughterhouse He also quotes Charles Patterson s Eternal Treblinka which compares treatment of animals with the Holocaust and explains how the disassembly of animals in the slaughterhouses inspired Henry Ford s assembling of cars in factories and how it further influenced Nazi Germany in building concentration camps and gas chambers br br According to Stallwood the animal industrial complex breeds animals in the billions in order to make products and services for human consumption and all these animals are considered legal property of the animal industrial complex The animal industrial complex is said to have transformed the already confused relationship between human and non human animals significantly increasing the consumption and threatening human survival and the pervasive nature of the animal industrial complex is such that it evades attention br Nibert argues that while it has its origins in the use of animals during the establishment of agricultural societies the animal industrial complex is ultimately a predictable insidious outgrowth of the capitalist system with its penchant for continuous expansion According to Nibert this complex is so destructive in its pursuit of resources such as land and water to rear all of these animals as a source of profit that it warrants comparisons to Attila the Hun As the human population grows to a projected billion by the middle of the century meat production is expected to increase by Nibert further states br br The profound cultural devaluation of other animals that permits the violence that underlies the animal industrial complex is produced by far reaching speciesist socialization For instance the system of primary and secondary education under the capitalist system largely indoctrinates young people into the dominant societal beliefs and values including a great deal of procapitalist and speciesist ideology The devalued status of other animals is deeply ingrained animals appear in schools merely as caged pets as dissection and vivisection subjects and as lunch On television and in movies the unworthiness of other animals is evidenced by their virtual invisibility when they do appear they generally are marginalized vilified or objectified Not surprisingly these and numerous other sources of speciesism are so ideologically profound that those who raise compelling moral objections to animal oppression largely are dismissed if not ridiculed br Contributors to the book Animals and War which linked critical animal studies and critical peace studies explored the connections between the animal industrial complex and the military industrial complex proposing and analysing the idea of a military animal industrial complex The exploitation of animals argues Colin Salter is not necessary to military industrial complexes but it is a foundational and central element of the military industrial complex as it actually exists One of the aims of the book as a whole was to argue for the abolition of the military animal industrial complex and all wars br br br Relationship with speciesism br br Piers Beirne considers speciesism as the ideological anchor of the intersecting networks of the animal industrial complex such as factory farms vivisection hunting and fishing zoos and aquaria wildlife trade and so forth Amy J Fitzgerald and Nik Taylor argue that the animal industrial complex is both a consequence and cause of speciesism which according to them is a form of discrimination similar to racism or sexism They also argue that the obfuscation of meat s animal origins is a critical part of the animal industrial complex under capitalist and neoliberal regimes Speciesism results in the belief that humans have the right to use non human animals which is so pervasive in the modern society br Scholars argue that all kinds of animal production is rooted in speciesism reducing animals to mere economic resources Built on the production and slaughter of animals the animal industrial complex is perceived as the materialization of the institution of speciesism with speciesism becoming a mode of production In his book Critical Theory and Animal Liberation J Sanbonmatsu argues that speciesism is not ignorance or the absence of a moral code towards animals but is a mode of production and material system imbricated with capitalism br br br Components br br The animal industrial complex involves commodification of animals under contemporary capitalism and includes every economic activity involving animals such as food animal research entertainment fashion companionship and so forth all of which are seen as consequences of animal exploitations The AIC is implicated in animal agribusiness and its networks or the agro industrial complex which includes animal agriculture the meat and dairy industries factory farms poultry apiculture aquaculture and the like intersecting with various other industrial complexes that involves exploitation of animals such as the pharmaceutical industrial complex medical industrial complex xvi xvii vivisection industrial complex cosmetic industrial complex entertainment industrial complex academic industrial complex xvi xvii security industrial complex xvi xvii prison industrial complex xvi xvii and so forth br Philosopher Steven Best explains that all these industrial complexes interrelate with and reinforce the AIC by exploiting the nonhuman animal slaves of the AIC xvi xvii For instance the academic industrial complex conducts research for the medical industrial complex and Big Pharma by exploiting animals of the AIC in universities military and private vivisection laboratories and producing questionable research financed by the pharmaceutical industrial complex for pharmaceutical capital xvi xvii These drugs which according to Best are dubiously researched are then patented fast tracked into market sales with the help of the Food and Drug Administration and advertised through the media industrial complex xvii Best estimates that up to million animals are killed globally every year to produce these drugs which force human victims to succumb to the medical industrial complex for profit by treating only the symptoms xvii Any dissent by animal rights activists is criminalized by the security industrial complex which incarcerates many of the dissenters in the prison industrial complex xvii Twine considers the AIC as a significant component of the broader global food system br br br Impact br br Referring to the animal industrial complex intersectionally both Noske and Twine acknowledge the complex s negative impact on human minorities and the environment According to Kathleen Stachowski the AIC naturalizes the human as a consumer of other animals The enormity of the AIC according to Stachowski includes its long reach into our lives and how well it has done its job normalizing brutality toward the animals whose very existence is forgotten She states that the corporate dairy industry the government and schools forms the animal industrial complex troika of immense influence which hides from the public s view the animal rights violations and cruelties happening within the dairy industry Scholars note that while critical animal theory acknowledges the universities position as centers of knowledge production it also states that the academy plays a problematic role of being a crucial mechanism within the AIC br Borrowing from Dwight D Eisenhower s military industrial complex warning Stachowski states that the vast and powerful AIC determines what children eat because people have failed to guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence and that Eisenhower s parallels are strikingly similar to the AIC in that the complex involves the very structure of our society and completely influences the society s economic political and even spiritual spheres Stachowski also states that the troika hijacks schoolchildren by promoting milk in the K nutrition education curriculum and making them eat the products of industrial animal production br A part of the AIC animal agriculture has been implicated in environmental harms including climate change ocean acidification biodiversity loss and the killing of more than billion non human land animals annually ultimately contributing to the Holocene extinction the only anthropogenic of all the mass extinctions in the planet s history This number excludes aquatic animals killed for food and non food uses which amounts to about billion annually and also male chicks killed in the egg industry marine animals killed as bycatch and dogs and cats eaten in Asia All told around to over billion land and aquatic animals are killed every year to provide humans with animal products for consumption which some vegans and animal rights activists among them Steven Best and journalist Chris Hedges have described as an animal holocaust In the US alone over million farm animals die during transport to slaughterhouses annually The extensive use of land and other resources for the production of meat instead of grain for human consumption is a leading cause of malnutrition hunger and famine around the world According to conservation biologists Rodolfo Dirzo Gerardo Ceballos and Paul R Ehrlich in order to reduce meat consumption which can translate not only into less heat but also more space for biodiversity the massive planetary monopoly of industrial meat production needs to be curbed They insist that this can be done while respecting the cultural traditions of indigenous peoples for whom meat is an important source of protein br br Animal research and vivisection another component of the AIC is responsible to the immense suffering of hundreds of millions of nonhuman animals annually and the deaths of at least million animals While the public is increasingly aware of this chiefly due to animal advocacy testaments of scientists and growing direct evidence the AIC lobbies against animal welfare regulation and animal rights activism br Scholars argue that the animal industrial complex is also responsible for spreading of diseases from animals to humans such as the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy mad cow disease owing to beef consumption and the ongoing COVID pandemic whose origin can be traced to the wet markets in China According to Charlotte Blattner et al the COVID crisis revealed the AIC as a vast and unstoppable machinery Carol J Adams considers responses to such crises as representing a search for anthropocentric solutions to an anthropocentric problem that is improve the supply of meat rather than examine the practice of meat eating and stresses a closer scrutiny of the problem and a possible rejection of meat eating br br br Commodification of nonhuman animals br br One of the primary impacts of the animal industrial complex is the commodification of nonhuman animals In the book Education for Total Liberation Meneka Repka cites Barbara Noski as saying that the commodification of nonhuman animals in food systems is directly linked to capitalist systems that prioritize monopolistically inclined financial interests over the well being of humans nonhumans and the environment Richard Twine furthers this stating that corporate influences have had a direct interest through marketing advertising and flavour manipulation in constructing the consumption of animal products as a sensual material pleasure br Writing about wild animals being imported into France in the th century historian Louise Robbins writes that a cultural biography of things would show animals sliding in and out of commodity status and taking on different values for different people as they make their way from their homes to the streets of Paris Sociologist Rhoda Wilkie has used the term sentient commodity to describe this view of how the conception of animals as commodities can shift depending on whether a human being forms a relationship with them Geographers Rosemary Claire Collard and Jessica Dempsey use the term lively commodities br Political scientist Sami Torssonen argues that animal welfare has itself been commodified since the s because of public concern for animals Scientifically certified welfare products which Torssonen calls sellfare are producible and salable at various points in the commodity chain subject to competition like any other commodity Social scientist Jacy Reese Anthis argues that while there is no immanent right for animals or humans to not be commodified there are strong practical reasons to oppose any commodification of animals not just that which is cruel or egregious br br br Exploitation of humans br Scholars state that throughout history the oppression of exploited animals supported the oppression and exploitation of humans and vice versa The resulting change from one form of the control of state power to another such as the older aristocracy being replaced by rising capitalism was every bit as violent and oppressive as the former The state supported profit driven capitalist expansion for instance was responsible for the killing and displacement of North America s indigenous peoples and animals The creation of ranching operations led to intrusions onto Native American lands and violent displacement of the people in them in order to accommodate the growing numbers of oppressed animals which in turn resulted in the creation of slaughterhouse operations These slaughterhouses grew by exploiting vulnerable workforces chiefly immigrants who were undernourished over worked poorly housed and frequently sick owing to the macabre nature of work as a result of the assembly line style carnage worsened by the deafening squeals bellows and bleating of terrified animals being slaughtered Starting in the s large food companies including Cargill Conagra Brands Tyson Foods moved most slaughterhouse operations to rural areas of the Southern United States which were more hostile to unionization efforts In the Brazilian Amazon around people are working as virtual slaves for cattle ranchers br In her book Noske discusses the issue of health risks to human workers in slaughterhouses Amy J Fitzgerald points out to prison inmates in the United States and Canada being employed as a source of cheap labor in slaughtering and processing of animals which scholars such as Robert R Higgins consider as environmental racism wherein animals and animalized humans are symbolically paired and as an economic rationale for the perpetuation of a specific prison population According to Fitzgerald this suggests a tendency toward psycho social brutalization in such labor which in turn jeopardize inmate rehabilitation br br br Negative effects on workers br br American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States On average one employee of Tyson Foods the largest meat producer in America is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years in the UK slaughter workers lost fingers parts of fingers or limbs more than workers had serious injuries and at least had to take more than three days off after accidents In a study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed A study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes all cancers and lung cancer in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry br br The worst thing worse than the physical danger is the emotional toll If you work in the stick pit where hogs are killed for any period of time that let s sic you kill things but doesn t let you care You may look a hog in the eye that s walking around in the blood pit with you and think God that really isn t a bad looking animal You may want to pet it Pigs down on the kill floor have come up to nuzzle me like a puppy Two minutes later I had to kill them beat them to death with a pipe I can t care br The act of slaughtering animals or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved A study in Organization indicates Regression analyses of data from Danish workers across occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior A study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates arrests for violent crimes arrests for rape and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries As authors from the PTSD Journal explain These employees are hired to kill animals such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence social withdrawal anxiety drug and alcohol abuse and PTSD br Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants In Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime In a report by Oxfam America slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks were often required to wear diapers and were paid below minimum wage br br br See also br Ag gag br Animal
