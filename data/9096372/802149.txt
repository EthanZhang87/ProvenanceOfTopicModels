The Indian rhinoceros Rhinoceros unicornis also known as the greater one horned rhinoceros great Indian rhinoceros or Indian rhino for short is a rhinoceros species native to the Indian subcontinent It is the second largest extant species of rhinoceros with adult males weighing tonnes and adult females tonnes The skin is thick and is grey brown in colour with pinkish skin folds They have a single horn on their snout that grows to a maximum of cm in Their upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart like bumps They are nearly hairless aside from the eyelashes ear fringes and tail brush br The Indian rhinoceros is a largely solitary animal only associating in the breeding season and when rearing calves They are grazers and their diet is mainly grass but may also include twigs leaves branches shrubs flowers br fruits and aquatic plants Females give birth to a single calf after a gestation of months the birth interval is to months Captive individuals can live up to years They are susceptible to diseases such as anthrax and those caused by parasites such as leeches ticks and nematodes br It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as populations are fragmented and restricted to less than km sq mi As of August the global population was estimated to comprise individuals Indian rhinos once ranged throughout the entire stretch of the Indo Gangetic Plain but excessive hunting and agricultural development reduced its range drastically to sites in northern India and southern Nepal In the early s between and Indian rhinos were estimated to have been alive Since then numbers have increased due to conservation measures taken by the government However poaching remains a continuous threat br br br Taxonomy br Rhinoceros unicornis was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in who described a rhinoceros with one horn As type locality he indicated Africa and India He described two species in India the other being Rhinoceros bicornis and stated that the Indian species had two horns while the African species had only one br The Indian rhinoceros is a single species Several specimens were described since the end of the th century under different scientific names which are all considered synonyms of Rhinoceros unicornis today br br R indicus by Cuvier br R asiaticus by Blumenbach br R stenocephalus by Gray br R jamrachi by Sclater br R bengalensis by Kourist br br br Etymology br The generic name rhinoceros is derived through Latin from the Ancient Greek which is composed of rhino of the nose and keras horn with a horn on the nose The name has been in use since the th century The Latin word nicornis means one horned br br br Evolution br br Ancestral rhinoceroses first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around million years ago The extant family the Rhinocerotidae first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene br Fossils of R unicornis appear in the Middle Pleistocene In the Pleistocene the genus Rhinoceros ranged throughout South and Southeast Asia with specimens located on Sri Lanka Into the Holocene some rhinoceros lived as far west as Gujarat and Pakistan until as recently as years ago br The Indian and Javan rhinoceroses the only members of the genus Rhinoceros first appear in the fossil record in Asia during the Early Pleistocene The Indian rhinoceros is known from Early Pleistocene localities in Java South China India and Pakistan Molecular estimates suggest the species may have diverged much earlier around million years ago Although belonging to the type genus the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species Different studies have hypothesised that they may be closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus the Sumatran rhinoceros Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos as long ago as million years br A cladogram showing the relationships of recent and Late Pleistocene rhinoceros species minus Stephanorhinus hemitoechus based on whole nuclear genomes after Liu et al br br br Characteristics br br Indian rhinos have a thick grey brown skin with pinkish skin folds and one horn on their snout Their upper legs and shoulders are covered in wart like bumps They have very little body hair aside from eyelashes ear fringes and tail brush Bulls have huge neck folds The skull is heavy with a basal length above cm in and an occiput above cm in The nasal horn is slightly back curved with a base of about cm in by cm in that rapidly narrows until a smooth even stem part begins about mm in above base In captive animals the horn is frequently worn down to a thick knob br The Indian rhino s single horn is present in both bulls and cows but not on newborn calves The horn is pure keratin like human fingernails and starts to show after about six years In most adults the horn reaches a length of about cm in but has been recorded up to cm in in length and kg lb in weight br Among terrestrial land mammals native to Asia Indian rhinos are second in size only to the Asian elephant They are also the second largest living rhinoceros behind only the white rhinoceros Bulls have a head and body length of cm ft with a shoulder height of cm ft while cows have a head and body length of cm ft and a shoulder height of cm ft The bull averaging about kg lb is heavier than the cow at an average of about kg lb br The rich presence of blood vessels underneath the tissues in folds gives them the pinkish colour The folds in the skin increase the surface area and help in regulating the body temperature The thick skin does not protect against bloodsucking Tabanus flies leeches and ticks br The largest individuals reportedly weigh up to kg lb br br br Distribution and habitat br br Indian rhinos once ranged across the entire northern part of the Indian subcontinent along the Indus Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins from Pakistan to the Indian Myanmar border including Bangladesh and the southern parts of Nepal and Bhutan They may have also occurred in Myanmar southern China and Indochina They inhabit the alluvial grasslands of the Terai and the Brahmaputra basin As a result of habitat destruction and climatic changes its range has gradually been reduced so that by the th century it only survived in the Terai grasslands of southern Nepal northern Uttar Pradesh northern Bihar northern West Bengal and in the Brahmaputra Valley of Assam br The species was present in northern Bihar and Oudh at least until as indicated in maps produced by Colonel Gentil On the former abundance of the species Thomas C Jerdon wrote in br br This huge rhinoceros is found in the Terai at the foot of the Himalayas from Bhutan to Nepal It is more common in the eastern portion of the Terai than the west and is most abundant in Assam and the Bhutan Dooars I have heard from sportsmen of its occurrence as far west as Rohilcund but it is certainly rare there now and indeed along the greater part of the Nepal Terai Jelpigoree a small military station near the Teesta River was a favourite locality whence to hunt the Rhinoceros and it was from that station Captain Fortescue got his skulls which were the first that Mr Blyth had seen of this species br Today its range has further shrunk to a few pockets in southern Nepal northern West Bengal and the Brahmaputra Valley Its habitat is surrounded by human dominated landscapes so that in many areas it occurs in cultivated areas pastures and secondary forests In the s Indian rhinos were frequently seen in the narrow plain area of Manas River and Royal Manas National Park in Bhutan br br br Populations br In the total Indian rhinoceros population was estimated to be individuals up from in Among them are in India and the remaining are in Nepal and Bhutan There is no permanent rhino population in Bhutan but small rhino populations are occasionally known to cross from the Manas National Park or Buxa Tiger Reserve in India br In India there are around individuals in Assam including in Kaziranga National Park in Orang National Park in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and in Manas National Park West Bengal has a population of individuals including in Jaldapara National Park and in Gorumara National Park Only individuals are found in Dudhwa National Park in Uttar Pradesh br By the population in Assam increased to Indian rhinos an increase of since although more than individuals were killed by poachers during these years br The population in Kaziranga National Park was estimated at individuals in By the population in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary had increased to individuals in an area of km sq mi br In Nepal had Indian rhinos living in Parsa National Park Chitwan National Park Bardia National Park Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve and respective buffer zones in the Terai Arc Landscape as recorded in a survey conducted from April to May The survey showed that the population of rhinos in Nepal from to increased or individuals br The Indian rhino population which once numbered as low as individuals in the early s has increased to more than in the year as per The International Rhino Foundation br br br Ecology and behaviour br br Bulls are usually solitary Groups consist of cows with calves or of up to six subadults Such groups congregate at wallows and grazing areas They are foremost active in early mornings late afternoons and at night but rest during hot days br They bathe regularly The folds in their skin trap water and hold it even when they exit wallows They are excellent swimmers and can run at speeds of up to km h mph for short periods They have excellent senses of hearing and smell but relatively poor eyesight Over distinct vocalisations have been recorded Males have home ranges of around to km to sq mi that overlap each other Dominant males tolerate other males passing through their territories except when they are in mating season when dangerous fights break out br Indian rhinos have few natural enemies except for tigers which sometimes kill unguarded calves but adult rhinos are less vulnerable due to their size Mynahs and egrets both eat invertebrates from the rhino s skin and around its feet Tabanus flies a type of horse fly are known to bite rhinos The rhinos are also vulnerable to diseases spread by parasites such as leeches ticks and nematodes like Bivitellobilharzia nairi Anthrax and the blood disease sepsis are known to occur br In March a group of four tigers consisting of an adult male tigress and two cubs killed a year old male Indian rhinoceros in Dudhwa Tiger Reserve Such cases are rare as Indian rhinoceroses like most megaherbivores are mostly invulnerable to predation br br br Diet br Indian rhinos are grazers Their diet consists almost entirely of grasses such as Arundo donax Bambusa tulda Cynodon dactylon and Oryza sativa but they also eat leaves twigs and branches of shrubs and trees such as Lagerstroemia indica flowers fruits such as Ficus religiosa and submerged and floating aquatic plants br They feed in the mornings and evenings They use their semi prehensile lips to grasp grass stems bend the stem down bite off the top and then eat the grass They tackle very tall grasses or saplings by walking over the plant with legs on both sides and using the weight of their bodies to push the end of the plant down to the level of the mouth Mothers also use this technique to make food edible for their calves They drink for a minute or two at a time often imbibing water filled with rhinoceros urine br br br Social life br br Indian rhinos form a variety of social groupings Bulls are generally solitary except for mating and fighting Cows are largely solitary when they are without calves Mothers will stay close to their calves for up to four years after their birth sometimes allowing an older calf to continue to accompany her once a newborn calf arrives Subadult bulls and cows form consistent groupings as well Groups of two or three young bulls often form on the edge of the home ranges of dominant bulls presumably for protection in numbers Young cows are slightly less social than the bulls Indian rhinos also form short term groupings particularly at forest wallows during the monsoon season and in grasslands during March and April Groups of up to rhinos typically a dominant male with females and calves gather in wallows br Indian rhinos make a wide variety of vocalisations At least distinct vocalisations have been identified snorting honking bleating roaring squeak panting moo grunting shrieking groaning rumbling and humphing In addition to noises the Indian rhino uses olfactory communication Adult bulls urinate backwards as far as m ft behind them often in response to being disturbed by observers Like all rhinos the Indian rhinoceros often defecates near other large dung piles The Indian rhino has pedal scent glands which are used to mark their presence at these rhino latrines Bulls have been observed walking with their heads to the ground as if sniffing presumably following the scent of cows br In aggregations Indian rhinos are often friendly They will often greet each other by waving or bobbing their heads mounting flanks nuzzling noses or licking Indian rhinos will playfully spar run around and play with twigs in their mouths Adult bulls are the primary instigators in fights Fights between dominant bulls are the most common cause of rhino mortality and bulls are also very aggressive toward cows during courtship Bulls chase cows over long distances and even attack them face to face Indian rhinos use their horns for fighting albeit less frequently than African rhinos that largely use the incisors of the lower jaw to inflict wounds br br br Reproduction br br Captive bulls breed at five years of age but wild bulls attain dominance much later when they are larger In one five year field study only one Indian rhino estimated to be younger than years mated successfully Captive cows breed as young as four years of age but in the wild they usually start breeding only when six years old which likely indicates they need to be large enough to avoid being killed by aggressive bulls The ovarian cycle lasts to weeks on average Their gestation period is around months and birth interval ranges from to months An estimated of calves will die before maturity This is mainly attributed to predatory attacks from tigers Panthera tigris In captivity four Indian rhinos lived over years the oldest living to be br br br Threats br Habitat degradation caused by human activities and climate change as well as the resulting increase in the floods has caused many Indian rhino deaths and has limited their ranging areas which is shrinking br Serious declines in quality of habitat have occurred in some areas due to severe invasion by alien plants into grasslands affecting some populations and demonstrated reductions in the extent of grasslands and wetland habitats due to woodland encroachment and silting up of beels swampy wetlands Grazing by domestic livestock is another cause br The Indian rhino species is inherently at risk because over of its population occurs at a single site Kaziranga National Park Any catastrophic event such as disease civil disorder poaching or habitat loss would have a devastating impact on the Indian rhino s status However small population of rhinos may be prone to inbreeding depression br br br Poaching br br Sport hunting became common in the late th and early th centuries and was the main cause for the decline of Indian rhinoceros populations Indian rhinos were hunted relentlessly and persistently Reports from the mid th century claim that some British military officers shot more than rhinos in Assam alone By the population in Kaziranga National Park had decreased to around individuals In the early s the Indian rhinoceros was almost extinct At present poaching for the use of horn in traditional Chinese Medicine is one of the main threats that has led to decreases in several important populations Poaching for the Indian rhino s horn became the single most important reason for the decline of the Indian rhinoceros after conservation measures were put in place from the beginning of the th century when legal hunting ended From to rhinos were poached in India including rhinos in India s Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in almost the entire population of the sanctuary By the mid s the Indian rhinoceros had been extirpated in this sanctuary Between and more than rhinos were poached in Assam Almost rhinos were poached in India between and br br In in Nepal the Chitwan s forest and grasslands extended over more than km sq mi and were home to about rhinos When poor farmers from the mid hills moved to the Chitwan Valley in search of arable land the area was subsequently opened for settlement and poaching of wildlife became rampant The Chitwan population has repeatedly been jeopardised by poaching in alone poachers killed animals to saw off and sell their valuable horns br br br Conservation br The Indian rhinoceros is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red list as of Globally R unicornis has been listed in CITES Appendix I since The Indian and Nepalese governments have taken major steps towards Indian rhinoceros conservation especially with the help of the World Wide Fund for Nature WWF and other non governmental organisations In all rhino hunting in India became prohibited br In the country s first conservation law ensured the protection of rhinos and their habitat In Edward Pritchard Gee undertook a survey of the Chitwan Valley and recommended the creation of a protected area north of the Rapti River and of a wildlife sanctuary south of the river for a trial period of years After his subsequent survey of Chitwan in he recommended extension of the sanctuary to the south By the end of the s only rhinos remained in the Chitwan Valley The dramatic decline of the rhino population and the extent of poaching prompted the government to institute the Gaida Gasti a rhino reconnaissance patrol of armed men and a network of guard posts all over Chitwan To prevent the extinction of rhinos the Chitwan National Park was gazetted in December with borders delineated the following year and established in initially encompassing an area of km sq mi To ensure the survival of rhinos in case of epidemics animals were translocated annually from Chitwan to Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta National Park since br The Indian rhinoceros population living in Chitwan and Parsa National Parks was estimated at mature individuals in br br br Reintroduction to new areas br Indian rhinos have been reintroduced to areas where they had previously inhabited but became extinct These efforts have produced mixed results mainly due to lack of proper planning and management sustained effort adequate security of the introduced animals br In five Indian rhinos were relocated to Dudhwa National Park four from the fields outside the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and one from Goalpara This has born results and the population has increased to rhinos by In early s Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam had more than Indian rhinos which were all killed by poachers In two Indian rhinos a mother and her daughter were reintroduced to the sanctuary from Kaziranga National Park as part of the Indian Rhino Vision IRV program but both animals died within months due to natural causes br Indian rhinos were once found as far west as the Peshawar Valley during the reign of Mughal Emperor Babur but are now extinct in Pakistan After rhinos became regionally extinct in Pakistan two rhinos from Nepal were introduced in to Lal Suhanra National Park which have not bred so far br br br In captivity br br Indian rhinoceroses were initially difficult to breed in captivity In the second half of the th century zoos became adept at breeding Indian rhinoceros By nearly babies had been born in captivity As of Indian rhinos were born at Switzerland s Zoo Basel alone meaning that most captive animals are related to the Basel population Due to the success of Zoo Basel s breeding program the International Studbook for the species has been kept there since Since the Indian rhino European Endangered Species Programme is also being coordinated there with the goal of maintaining genetic diversity in the global captive Indian rhinoceros population br The first recorded captive birth of an Indian rhinoceros was in Kathmandu in but another successful birth did not occur for nearly years In a rhino was born in Kolkata No rhinoceros was successfully bred in Europe until when first European breeding took place when baby rhino Rudra was born in Zoo Basel on September In June an Indian rhino was artificially inseminated using sperm collected four years previously and cryopreserved at the Cincinnati Zoo s CryoBioBank before being thawed and used She gave birth to a male calf in October In June the first successful live birth from an artificially inseminated rhino took place at the Buffalo Zoo in New York As in Cincinnati cryopreserved sperm was used to produce the female calf Monica br br br Cultural significance br br The Indian rhinoceros is one of the motifs on the Pashupati seal and many terracotta figurines that were excavated at archaeological sites of the Indus Valley civilisation br The Rhinoceros Sutra is an early text in the Buddhist tradition found in the Gandh ran Buddhist texts and the Pali Canon as well as a version incorporated into the Sanskrit Mahavastu It praises the solitary lifestyle and stoicism of the Indian rhinoceros and is associated with the eremitic lifestyle symbolized by the Pratyekabuddha br br br Europe br br In the rd century Philip the Arab exhibited an Indian rhinoceros in Rome In Manuel I of Portugal obtained an Indian rhinoceros as a gift which he passed on to Pope Leo X but which died in a shipwreck off the coast of Italy in early on the way from Lisbon to Rome Three artistic representations were prepared of this rhinoceros A woodcut by Hans Burgkmair a drawing and a woodcut D rer s Rhinoceros by Albrecht D rer all dated In Abada was a female Indian rhinoceros kept by the Portuguese kings Sebastian I and Henry I from to and by Philip II of Spain from about to She was the first rhinoceros seen in Europe after D rer s Rhinoceros In about the first presumably Indian rhinoceros arrived in England George Jeffreys st Baron Jeffreys spread the rumour that his chief rival Francis North st Baron Guilford had been seen riding on it br In Clara the rhinoceros c April was a female Indian rhinoceros who became famous during
