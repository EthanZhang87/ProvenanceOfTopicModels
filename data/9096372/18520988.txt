id: 18520988
The concept of moral rights for animals is believed to date as far back as Ancient India particularly early Jainist and Hindu history What follows is mainly the history of animal rights or more broadly animal protection in the Western world There is a rich history of animal protection in the ancient texts lives and stories of Eastern African and Indigenous peoples br Aristotle placed human beings at the top of nature s scale of being Because animals lack reason he said they are by nature instruments for human use But there were other philosophers in ancient Greece and Rome who were more sympathetic to animals some maintaining that animals do exercise a degree of reason and are owed gentle treatment Also from ancient times there can be found in all the world s major religious traditions expressed in varying ways injunctions against cruelty to animals br Key scholars in the history of animal ethics include Ren Descartes who in the th century maintained that animals are automata lacking any consciousness Immanuel Kant who argued that we have no duties directly to animals and Jeremy Bentham who insisted that animals capacity to suffer must be included in our moral reckoning Charles Darwin argued not only that there is an evolutionary biological continuity between humans and other animals but also that humans differ from animals mentally and emotionally in degree only br The late th and early th centuries saw the growth of the anti vivisection movement which advocated against the use and exploitation of live animals in scientific research Women within the movement played a prominent role in its growth and influence within the broader scientific community br Beginning in the s there was a surge of interest among philosophers and other scholars in the issue of the treatment of animals something that continues to this day This has been accompanied by and has to some extent influenced many forms of activism on behalf of animals This activism is intended to raise public awareness and to change laws in order to make a major even revolutionary practical difference in the lives of animals and in our relationships to them br br br In the East br br The belief in and promotion of animal rights has had a long history in East and South Asia It has its roots in traditional Eastern religious and philosophical beliefs and concepts such as ahimsa the doctrine of non violence The earliest reference to the idea of non violence to animals pashu ahimsa apparently in a moral sense is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda KapS written about the th century BCE br br br Ancient era br Parshwanatha the rd Tirthankara revived Jainism and ahimsa in the th century BCE which led to a radical animal rights movement in South Asia His successor Mahavira is best remembered in the Indian traditions for his teaching that ahimsa is the supreme moral virtue He taught that ahimsa covers all living beings and injuring any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one s rebirth future well being and suffering According to Mahatma Gandhi Mahavira was the greatest authority on ahimsa br Numerous works of the classical Indian literature that speaks against animal cruelties exist in many Indian languages For example the Tirukkural likely a Hindu or Jain work written between and CE dedicates verses and of its first volume to the virtue of ahimsa emphasizing on moral vegetarianism and non killing kollamai as personal virtues According to George Uglow Pope verses to of the Naladiyar another ancient Tamil work speak against cruelty to animals including feeding on them and imprisoning them in cages br Several kings in India built hospitals for animals and the emperor Ashoka BCE issued orders against hunting and animal slaughter in line with ahimsa the doctrine of non violence br In Japan in the Emperor Tenmu prohibited the killing and the eating of meat during the busy farming period between April and September but excluded the eating of wild birds and animals This ban and several others that followed over the centuries were overturned in the nineteenth century during the Meiji restoration br The th century Indian social reformer Basava insisted on ahimsa or non violence and vehemently condemned all forms of sacrifices human or animal br br br Modern era br Between late th century and early th century Swaminarayan brought a revival of central Hindu practices of dharma ahimsa and brahmacarya He was against among other vices the consumption of meat animal sacrifices and the appeasement of ghosts and tantric rituals Swaminarayan was successful in reinstating ahimsa performing non violent yaj as fire sacrifices on a large scale Through the mid th century Vallalar Ramalinga Swamigal promoted ahimsa and compassion emphasizing on non killing and meatless way of life br The Hindu reform movement of the Arya Samaj which was formed in condemned several evil practices of several different religions and communities including animal sacrifice and meat eating According to its founder Dayananda Saraswati all of these practices ran contrary to good sense and the wisdom of the Vedas br In the High Court in Kerala India used the language of rights in relation to circus animals ruling that they are beings entitled to dignified existence under Article of the Indian Constitution The ruling said that if human beings are entitled to these rights animals should be too The court went beyond the requirements of the Constitution that all living beings should be shown compassion and said It is not only our fundamental duty to show compassion to our animal friends but also to recognize and protect their rights Waldau wrote that other courts in India and one court in Sri Lanka have used similar language br In the Indian government issued a ban on the use of live animals in education and much research br In the Jain pilgrimage destination of Palitana City in India became the first city in the world to be legally lacto vegetarian It has outlawed or made illegal the buying and selling of meat fish and eggs and also related jobs or work such as fishing and penning food animals br br br In the West br br br Moral status and animals in the ancient world br br Aristotle stated that animals lacked reason logos and placed humans at the top of the natural world yet the respect for animals in ancient Greece was very high Some animals were considered divine e g dolphins br In the Book of Genesis th or th century BCE Adam is given dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth Dominion need not entail property rights but it has been interpreted by some over the centuries to imply ownership br The philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras c c BCE urged respect for animals believing that human and nonhuman souls were reincarnated from human to animal and vice versa Against this Aristotle BCE said that nonhuman animals had no interests of their own ranking them far below humans in the Great Chain of Being He was the first to create a taxonomy of animals he perceived some similarities between humans and other species but stated for the most part that animals lacked reason logos reasoning logismos thought dianoia nous and belief doxa br Theophrastus c c BCE one of Aristotle s pupils argued that animals also had reasoning logismos and opposed eating meat on the grounds that it robbed them of life and was therefore unjust Theophrastus did not prevail Richard Sorabji writes that current attitudes to animals can be traced to the heirs of the Western Christian tradition selecting the hierarchy that Aristotle sought to preserve br Plutarch st century CE in his Life of Cato the Elder comments that while law and justice are applicable strictly to men only beneficence and charity towards beasts is characteristic of a gentle heart This is intended as a correction and advance over the merely utilitarian treatment of animals and slaves by Cato himself The Moralia traditionally ascribed to Plutarch advances arguments for cognition in animals in the essays On the Cleverness of Animals and Beasts are Rational and advocates moral vegetarianism in On the Eating of Flesh br Tom Beauchamp writes that the most extensive account in antiquity of how animals should be treated was written by the Neoplatonist philosopher Porphyry c CE in his On Abstinence from Animal Food and On Abstinence from Killing Animals br br br th century Animals as automata br br br Early animal protection laws in Europe br According to Richard D Ryder the first known animal protection legislation in Europe was passed in Ireland in It prohibited pulling wool off sheep and the attaching of ploughs to horses tails referring to the cruelty used to beasts In the first legal code to protect domestic animals in North America was passed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony The colony s constitution was based on The Body of Liberties by the Reverend Nathaniel Ward an English lawyer Puritan clergyman and University of Cambridge graduate Ward s list of rites included rite No man shall exercise any Tirrany or Crueltie toward any brute Creature which are usually kept for man s use Historian Roderick Nash writes that at the height of Ren Descartes influence in Europe and his view that animals were simply automata it is significant that the New Englanders created a law that implied animals were not unfeeling machines br The Puritans passed animal protection legislation in England too Kathleen Kete writes that animal welfare laws were passed in as part of the ordinances of the Protectorate the government under Oliver Cromwell which lasted from to following the English Civil War Cromwell disliked blood sports which included cockfighting cock throwing dog fighting bull baiting and bull running said to tenderize the meat These could be seen in villages and fairgrounds and became associated with idleness drunkenness and gambling Kete writes that the Puritans interpreted the biblical dominion of man over animals to mean responsible stewardship rather than ownership The opposition to blood sports became part of what was seen as Puritan interference in people s lives and the animal protection laws were overturned during the Restoration when Charles II was returned to the throne in br br br Ren Descartes br The great influence of the th century was the French philosopher Ren Descartes whose Meditations informed attitudes about animals well into the th century Writing during the scientific revolution Descartes proposed a mechanistic theory of the universe the aim of which was to show that the world could be mapped out without allusion to subjective experience His mechanistic approach was extended to the issue of animal consciousness Mind for Descartes was a thing apart from the physical universe a separate substance linking human beings to the mind of God The nonhuman on the other hand were for Descartes nothing but complex automata with no souls minds or reason br br br Treatment of animals as man s duty towards himself br br br John Locke Immanuel Kant br Against Descartes the British philosopher John Locke commented in Some Thoughts Concerning Education that animals did have feelings and that unnecessary cruelty toward them was morally wrong but that the right not to be harmed adhered either to the animal s owner or to the human being who was being damaged by being cruel Discussing the importance of preventing children from tormenting animals he wrote For the custom of tormenting and killing of beasts will by degrees harden their minds even towards men br Locke s position echoed that of Thomas Aquinas Paul Waldau writes that the argument can be found at Corinthians when Paul asks Is it for oxen that God is concerned Does he not speak entirely for our sake It was written for our sake Christian philosophers interpreted this to mean that humans had no direct duty to nonhuman animals but had a duty only to protect them from the effects of engaging in cruelty br The German philosopher Immanuel Kant following Aquinas opposed the idea that humans have direct duties toward nonhumans For Kant cruelty to animals was wrong only because it was bad for humankind He argued in that cruelty to animals is contrary to man s duty to himself because it deadens in him the feeling of sympathy for their sufferings and thus a natural tendency that is very useful to morality in relation to other human beings is weakened br br br th century Centrality of sentience br br br Jean Jacques Rousseau br Jean Jacques Rousseau argued in Discourse on Inequality for the inclusion of animals in natural law on the grounds of sentience By this method also we put an end to the time honored disputes concerning the participation of animals in natural law for it is clear that being destitute of intelligence and liberty they cannot recognize that law as they partake however in some measure of our nature in consequence of the sensibility with which they are endowed they ought to partake of natural right so that mankind is subjected to a kind of obligation even toward the brutes It appears in fact that if I am bound to do no injury to my fellow creatures this is less because they are rational than because they are sentient beings and this quality being common both to men and beasts ought to entitle the latter at least to the privilege of not being wantonly ill treated by the former br In his treatise on education Emile or On Education he encouraged parents to raise their children on a vegetarian diet He believed that the food of the culture a child was raised eating played an important role in the character and disposition they would develop as adults For however one tries to explain the practice it is certain that great meat eaters are usually more cruel and ferocious than other men This has been recognized at all times and in all places The English are noted for their cruelty while the Gaures are the gentlest of men All savages are cruel and it is not their customs that tend in this direction their cruelty is the result of their food br br br Jeremy Bentham br br Four years later one of the founders of modern utilitarianism the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham although opposed to the concept of natural rights argued that it was the ability to suffer that should be the benchmark of how we treat other beings Bentham states that the capacity for suffering gives the right to equal consideration equal consideration is that the interests of any being affected by an action are to be considered and have the equal interest of any other being If rationality were the criterion he argued many humans including infants and the disabled would also have to be treated as though they were things He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance but argued that the latter s interests should be taken into account He wrote in just as African slaves were being freed by the French br br The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs the villosity of the skin or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate What else is it that should trace the insuperable line Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse But a full grown horse or dog is beyond comparison a more rational as well as a more conversable animal than an infant of a day or a week or even a month old But suppose the case were otherwise what would it avail the question is not Can they reason nor Can they talk but Can they suffer br br br th century Emergence of jus animalium br br The th century saw an explosion of interest in animal protection particularly in England Debbie Legge and Simon Brooman write that the educated classes became concerned about attitudes toward the old the needy children and the insane and that this concern was extended to nonhumans Before the th century there had been prosecutions for poor treatment of animals but only because of the damage to the animal as property In for example John Cornish was found not guilty of maiming a horse after pulling the animal s tongue out the judge ruled that Cornish could be found guilty only if there was evidence of malice toward the owner br From onwards there were several attempts in England to introduce animal protection legislation The first was a bill against bull baiting introduced in April by a Scottish MP Sir William Pulteney It was opposed inter alia on the grounds that it was anti working class and was defeated by two votes Another attempt was made in this time opposed by the Secretary at War William Windham who said the Bill was supported by Methodists and Jacobins who wished to destroy the Old English character by the abolition of all rural sports br In Lord Erskine introduced a bill to protect cattle and horses from malicious wounding wanton cruelty and beating He told the House of Lords that animals had protection only as property The animals themselves are without protection the law regards them not substantively they have no rights Erskine in his parliamentary speech combined the vocabulary of animal rights and trusteeship with a theological appeal included in the Bill s preamble to opposing cruelty The Bill was passed by the Lords but was opposed in the Commons by Windham who said it would be used against the lower orders when the real culprits would be their employers br br br Martin s Act br br In the Treatment of Horses bill was introduced by Colonel Richard Martin MP for Galway in Ireland but it was lost among laughter in the House of Commons that the next thing would be rights for asses dogs and cats Nicknamed Humanity Dick by George IV Martin finally succeeded in with his Ill Treatment of Horses and Cattle Bill or Martin s Act as it became known which was the world s first major piece of animal protection legislation It was given royal assent on June that year as An Act to prevent the cruel and improper Treatment of Cattle and made it an offence punishable by fines up to five pounds or two months imprisonment to beat abuse or ill treat any horse mare gelding mule ass ox cow heifer steer sheep or other cattle br Legge and Brooman argue that the success of the Bill lay in the personality of Humanity Dick who was able to shrug off the ridicule from the House of Commons and whose sense of humour managed to capture the House s attention It was Martin himself who brought the first prosecution under the Act when he had Bill Burns a costermonger a street seller of fruit arrested for beating a donkey and paraded the animal s injuries before a reportedly astonished court Burns was fined and newspapers and music halls were full of jokes about how Martin had relied on the testimony of a donkey br Other countries followed suit in passing legislation or making decisions that favoured animals In the courts in New York ruled that wanton cruelty to animals was a misdemeanor at common law In France in Jacques Philippe Delmas de Grammont succeeded in having the Loi Grammont passed outlawing cruelty against domestic animals and leading to years of arguments about whether bulls could be classed as domestic in order to ban bullfighting The state of Washington followed in New York in California in and Florida in In England a series of amendments extended the reach of the Act which became the Cruelty to Animals Act outlawing cockfighting baiting and dog fighting followed by another amendment in and again in br br br Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals br At a meeting of the Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals on the th day of June at Old Slaughter s Coffee House St Martin s Lane T F Buxton Esqr MP in the Chair br It was resolved br That a committee be appointed to superintend the Publication of Tracts Sermons and similar modes of influencing public opinion to consist of the following Gentlemen br Sir Jas Mackintosh MP A Warre Esqr MP Wm Wilberforce Esqr MP Basil Montagu Esqr Revd A Broome Revd G Bonner Revd G A Hatch A E Kendal Esqr Lewis Gompertz Esqr Wm Mudford Esqr Dr Henderson br Resolved also br That a Committee be appointed to adopt measures for Inspecting the Markets and Streets of the Metropolis the Slaughter Houses the conduct of Coachmen etc etc consisting of the following Gentlemen br T F Buxton Esqr MP Richard Martin Esqr MP Sir James Graham L B Allen Esqr C C Wilson Esqr Jno Brogden Esqr Alderman Brydges A E Kendal Esqr E Lodge Esqr J Martin Esqr T G Meymott Esqr br A Broome br br Honorary Secretary br br Richard Martin soon realized that magistrates did not take the Martin Act seriously and that it was not being reliably enforced Martin s Act was supported by various social reformers who were not parliamentarians and an informal network had gathered around the efforts of Reverend Arthur Broome to create a voluntary organisation that would promote kindness toward animals Broome canvassed opinions in letters that were published or summarised in various periodicals in After the passage of Richard Martin s anti cruelty to cattle bill in Broome attempted to form a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals that would bring together the patronage of persons who were of social rank and committed to social reforms Broome organised and chaired a meeting of sympathisers in November where it was agreed that a society should be created and at which Broome was named its secretary but the attempt was short lived In Broome arranged a new meeting in Old Slaughter s Coffee House in St Martin s Lane a London caf frequented by artists and actors The group met on June and included a number of MPs Richard Martin Sir James Mackintosh Sir Thomas Buxton William Wilberforce and Sir James Graham who had been an MP and who became one again in br They decided to form a Society instituted for the purpose of preventing cruelty to animals the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as it became known It determined to send men to inspect slaughterhouses Smithfield Market where livestock had been sold since the th century and to look into the treatment of horses by coachmen The society became the Royal Society in when it was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria herself strongly opposed to vivisection br From onwards several books were published analyzing animal rights issues rather than protection alone Lewis Gompertz one of the men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA published Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes arguing that every living creature human and nonhuman has more right to the use of its own body than anyone else has to use it and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings Edward Nicholson head of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford argued in Rights of an Animal that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do disregarding Descartes mechanistic view or what he called the Neo Cartesian snake that they lack consciousness Other writers of the time who explored whether animals might have natural or moral rights were Edward Payson Evans John Muir and J Howard Moore an American zoologist and author of The Universal Kinship and The New Ethics br br br Arthur Schopenhauer br br The development in England of the concept of animal rights was strongly supported by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer He wrote that Europeans were awakening more and more to a sense that beasts have rights in proportion as the strange notion is being gradually overcome and outgrown that the animal kingdom came into existence solely for the benefit and pleasure of man br He stopped short of advocating vegetarianism arguing that so long as an animal s death was quick men would suffer more by not eating meat than animals would suffer by being eaten Schopenhauer also theorized that the reason people succumbed to the unnatural diet of meat eating was because of the unnatural cold climate they emigrated to and the necessity of meat for survival in such a climate for fruits and vegetables could not be dependably cultivated at those times He applauded the animal protection movement in England To the honor then of the English be it said that they are the first people who have in downright earnest extended the protecting arm of the law to animals He also argued against the dominant Kantian idea that animal cruelty is wrong only insofar as it brutalizes humans br br Thus because Christian morality leaves animals out of account they are at once outlawed in philosophical morals they are mere things mere means to any ends whatsoever They can therefore be used for vivisection hunting coursing bullfights and horse racing and can be whipped to death as they struggle along with heavy carts of stone Shame on such a morality that is worthy of pariahs chandalas and mlechchhas and that fails to recognize the eternal essence that exists in every living thing br br br Percy Bysshe Shelley br The English poet and dramatist Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote two essays advocating a vegetarian diet for ethical and health reasons A Vindication of Natural Diet and On the Vegetable System of Diet posth br br br Isabella Beeton br Isabella Beeton the English reporter editor and author of Mrs Beeton s Book of Household Management was an early advocate against force fed poultry and caged hens About the former she wrote that force feeding was a process that may produce a handsome looking bird and it may weigh enough to satisfy the whim or avarice of its stuffer but when before the fire it will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected and will weep a drippingpan ful of fat tears You will never find heart enough to place such a grief worn guest at the head of your table br About the necessity for free range rather than caged hens she wrote br br We are no advocates for converting the domestic fowl into a cage bird We have known amateur fowl keepers coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary egg chest placed on its side and with the front closely barred with iron hooping This system will not do Every animal from man himself to the guinea pig must have what is vulgarly but truly known as elbow room and it must be self evident how emphatically this rule applies to winged animals It may be urged in the case of domestic fowls that from constant disuse and from clipping and plucking and other sorts of maltreatment their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of flight we maintain however that you may pluck a fowl s wing joints as bare as a pumpkin but you will not erase from his memory that he is a fowl and that his proper sphere is the open air If he likewise reflects that he is an ill used fowl a prison bird he will then come to the conclusion that there is not the least use under such circumstances for his existence and you must admit that the decision is only logical and natural br br br John Stuart Mill br John Stuart Mill the English philosopher also argued that utilitarianism must take animals into account writing in Nothing is more natural to human beings nor up to a certain point in cultivation more universal than to estimate the pleasures and pains of others as deserving of regard exactly in proportion to their likeness to ourselves Granted that any practice causes more pain to animals than it gives pleasure to man is that practice moral or immoral And if exactly in proportion as human beings raise their heads out of the slough of selfishness they do not with one voice answer immoral let the morality of the principle of utility be for ever condemned br br br Charles Darwin br br James Rachels writes that Charles Darwin s On the Origin of Species which presented the theory of evolution by natural selection revolutionized the way humans viewed their relationship with other species Not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals but the latter had social mental and moral lives too Darwin argued He wrote in his Notebooks Animals whom we have made our slaves we do not like to consider our equals Do not slave holders wish to make the black man other kind Later in The Descent of Man he argued that There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties attributing to animals the power of reason decision making memory sympathy and imagination br Rachels writes that Darwin noted the moral implications of the cognitive similarities arguing that humanity to the lower animals was one of the noblest virtues with which man is endowed He was strongly opposed to any kind of cruelty to animals including setting traps He wrote in a letter that he supported vivisection for real investigations on physiology but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity It is a subject which makes me sick with horror In he testified before a Royal Commission on Vivisection lobbying for a bill to protect both the animals used in vivisection and the study of physiology Rachels writes that the animal rights advocates of the day such as Frances Power Cobbe did not see Darwin as an ally br br br American SPCA Frances Power Cobbe Anna Kingsford br br An early proposal for legal rights for animals came from a group of citizens in Ashtabula County Ohio Around the group proposed an amendment to the U S Constitution stating that if slaves from slave states were receiving representation as of a person on the basis that they were animal property all the animal property of the free states should receive representation also br The first animal protection group in the United States the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ASPCA was founded by Henry Bergh in April Bergh had been appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic post in Russia and had been disturbed by the mistreatment of animals he witnessed there He consulted with the president of the RSPCA in London and returned to the United States to speak out against bullfights cockfights and the beating of horses He created a Declaration of the Rights of Animals and in persuaded the New York state legislature to pass anti cruelty legislation and to grant the ASPCA the authority to enforce it br In the Irish social reformer Frances Power Cobbe founded the Society for the Protection of Animals Liable to Vivisection the world s first organization opposed to animal research which became the National Anti Vivisection Society In the English feminist Anna Kingsford became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine after studying for her degree in Paris and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals She published The Perfect Way in Diet advocating vegetarianism and in the same year founded the Food Reform Society She was also vocal in her opposition to experimentation on animals In Cobbe set up the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection with which she campaigned against the use of dogs in research coming close to success with the Dogs Protection Bill which almost became law br Ryder writes that as the interest in animal protection grew in the late s attitudes toward animals among scientists began to harden They embraced the idea that what they saw as anthropomorphism the attribution of human qualities to nonhumans was unscientific Animals had to be approached as physiological entities only as Ivan Pavlov wrote in without any need to resort to fantastic speculations as to the existence of any possible subjective states It was a position that hearkened back to Descartes in the th century that nonhumans were purely mechanical with no rationality and perhaps even no consciousness br br br Friedrich Nietzsche br Avoiding utilitarianism Friedrich Nietzsche found other reasons to defend animals He wrote that The sight of blind suffering is the spring of the deepest emotion He once wrote For man is the cruelest animal At tragedies bull fights and crucifixions hath he hitherto been happiest on earth and when he invented his hell behold that was his heaven on earth Throughout his writings he speaks of the human being as an animal br br br Henry Salt br In Henry Salt a former master at Eton who had set up the Humanitarian League to lobby for a ban on hunting the year before published Animals Rights Considered in Relation to Social Progress He wrote that the object of the essay was to set the principle of animals rights on a consistent and intelligible footing Concessions to the demands for jus animalium had been made grudgingly to date he wrote with an eye on the interests of animals qua property rather than as rights bearers br br Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one the assertion that animals as well as men though of course to a far less extent than men are possessed of a distinctive individuality and therefore are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that restricted freedom to which Herbert Spencer alludes br He argued that there was no point in claiming rights for animals if those rights were subordinated to human desire and took issue with the idea that the life of a human might have more moral worth The notion of the life of an animal having no moral purpose belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day it is a purely arbitrary assumption at variance with our best instincts at variance with our best science and absolutely fatal if the subject be clearly thought out to any full realization of animals rights If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a great gulf fixed between them and mankind and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood br br br th century Animal rights movement br br br Brown Dog Affair Lizzy Lind af Hageby br br In Lizzy Lind af Hageby a Swedish feminist and a friend Lisa Shartau traveled to England to study medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women intending to learn enough to become authoritative anti vivisection campaigners In the course of their studies they witnessed several animal experiments and published the details as The Shambles of Science Extracts from the Diary of Two Students of Physiology Their allegations included that they had seen a brown terrier dog dissected while conscious which prompted angry denials from the researcher William Bayliss and his colleagues After Stephen Coleridge of the National Anti Vivisection Society accused Bayliss of having violated the Cruelty to Animals Act Bayliss sued and won convincing a court that the animal had been anesthetized as required by the Act br In response anti vivisection campaigners commissioned a statue of the dog to be erected in Battersea Park in with the plaque Men and Women of England how long shall these Things be The statue caused uproar among medical students leading to frequent vandalism of the statue and the need for a hour police guard The affair culminated in riots in when medical students clashed with police suffragettes and trade unionists in Trafalgar Square Battersea Council removed the statue from the park under cover of darkness two years later br Coral Lansbury and Hilda Kean write that the significance of the affair lay in the relationships that formed in support of the Brown Dog Done to Death which became a symbol of the oppression the women s suffrage movement felt at the hands of the male political and medical establishment Kean argues that both sides saw themselves as heirs to the future The students saw the women and trade unionists as representatives of anti science sentimentality and the women saw themselves as progressive with the students and their teachers belonging to a previous age br br br Development of mainstream veganism br br Members of the English Vegetarian Society who avoided the use of eggs and animal milk in the th and early th century were known as strict vegetarians The International Vegetarian Union cites an article informing readers of alternatives to shoe leather in the Vegetarian Society s magazine in as evidence of the existence of a group that sought to avoid animal products entirely There was increasing unease within the society from the start of the th century onwards with regards to egg and milk consumption and in its magazine wrote that the ideal position for vegetarians is complete abstinence from animal products br Mahatma Gandhi argued in before a meeting of the society in London that vegetarianism should be pursued in the interests of animals and not only as a human health issue He met both Henry Salt and Anna Kingsford and read Salt s A Plea for Vegetarianism Salt wrote in the pamphlet that a Vegetarian is still regarded in ordinary society as little better than a madman In several members led by Donald Watson decided to break from the Vegetarian Society over the issue of egg and milk use Watson coined the term vegan for those whose diet included no animal products and they formed the British Vegan Society on November that year br br br Tierschutzgesetz br br On coming to power in January the Nazi Party passed a comprehensive set of animal protection laws Arnold Arluke and Boria Sax wrote that the Nazis tried to abolish the distinction between humans and animals to the point where many people were regarded as less valuable than animals In April the Nazis passed laws regulating the slaughter of animals one of their targets was kosher slaughter In November the Tierschutzgesetz or animal protection law was introduced with Adolf Hitler announcing an end to animal cruelty Im neuen Reich darf es keine Tierqu lerei mehr geben In the new Reich no more animal cruelty will be allowed It was followed in July by the Reichsjagdgesetz prohibiting hunting in July by the Naturschutzgesetz environmental legislation in November by a law regulating animal transport in cars and in September by a similar law dealing with animals on trains Hitler was a vegetarian in the later years of his life several members of his inner circle including Rudolf Hess Joseph Goebbels and Heinrich Himmler adopted some form of vegetarianism By most accounts their vegetarianism was not as strict as Hitler s br br br Increase in animal use br br Despite the proliferation of animal protection legislation animals still had no legal rights Debbie Legge writes that existing legislation was very much tied to the idea of human interests whether protecting human sensibilities by outlawing cruelty or protecting property rights by making sure animals were not harmed The over exploitation of fishing stocks for example is viewed as harming the environment for people the hunting of animals to extinction means that humans in the future will derive no enjoyment from them poaching results in financial loss to the owner and so on br Notwithstanding the interest in animal welfare of the previous century the situation for animals deteriorated in the th century particularly after the Second World War This was in part because of the increase in the numbers used in animal research in the UK in in and million in million worldwide and a modern annual estimated range of million to upwards of million in the US but mostly because of the industrialization of farming which saw billions of animals raised and killed for food on a scale considered impossible before the war br br br Development of direct action br br In the early s in England support for animal rights began to coalesce around the issue of blood sports particularly hunting deer foxes and otters using dogs an aristocratic and middle class English practice stoutly defended in the name of protecting rural traditions The psychologist Richard D Ryder who became involved with the animal rights movement in the late s writes that the new chair of the League Against Cruel Sports tried in to steer it away from confronting members of the hunt which triggered the formation that year of a direct action breakaway group the Hunt Saboteurs Association This was set up by a journalist John Prestige who had witnessed a pregnant deer being chased into a village and killed by the Devon and Somerset Staghounds The practice of sabotaging hunts for example by misleading the dogs with scents or horns spread throughout south east England particularly around university towns leading to violent confrontations when the huntsmen attacked the sabs br The controversy spread to the RSPCA which had grown away from its radical roots to become a conservative group with charity status and royal patronage It had failed to speak out against hunting and indeed counted huntsmen among its members As with the League Against Cruel Sports this position gave rise to a splinter group the RSPCA Reform Group which sought to radicalize the organization leading to chaotic meetings of the group s ruling Council and successful though short lived efforts to change it from within by electing to the council members who would argue from an animal rights perspective and force the RSPCA to address issues such as hunting factory farming and animal experimentation Ryder himself was elected to the council in and served as its chair from to br br br Formation of the Oxford group br br The same period saw writers and academics begin to speak out again in favor of animal rights Ruth Harrison published Animal Machines an influential critique of factory farming and on October the novelist Brigid Brophy had an article The Rights of Animals published in The Sunday Times She wrote br br The relationship of Homo sapiens to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation We employ their work we eat and wear them We exploit them to serve our superstitions whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future we now sacrifice them to science and experiment on their entrails in the hope or on the mere off chance that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery Perhaps years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals br Robert Garner writes that Harrison s book and Brophy s article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans In particular Brophy s article was discovered in or around by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch husband and wife from Canada John Harris and David Wood now known as the Oxford Group They decided to put together a symposium to discuss the theory of animal rights br Around the same time Richard Ryder wrote several letters to The Daily Telegraph criticizing animal experimentation based on incidents he had witnessed in laboratories The letters published in April and May were seen by Brigid Brophy who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris Ryder also started distributing pamphlets in Oxford protesting against experiments on animals it was in one of these pamphlets in that he coined the term speciesism to describe the exclusion of nonhuman animals from the protections offered to humans He subsequently became a contributor to the Godlovitches symposium as did Harrison and Brophy and it was published in as Animals Men and Morals An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non humans br br br Publication of Animal Liberation br br In over lunch in Oxford with fellow student Richard Keshen a vegetarian Australian philosopher Peter Singer came to believe that by eating animals he was engaging in the oppression of other species Keshen introduced Singer to the Godlovitches and in Singer reviewed their book for The New York Review of Books In the review he used the term animal liberation writing br br We are familiar with Black Liberation Gay Liberation and a variety of other movements With Women s Liberation some thought we had come to the end of the road Discrimination on the basis of sex it has been said is the last form of discrimination that is universally accepted and practiced without pretense But one should always be wary of talking of the last remaining form of discrimination Animals Men and Morals is a manifesto for an Animal Liberation movement br On the strength of his review The New York Review of Books took the unusual step of commissioning a book from Singer on the subject published in as Animal Liberation now one of the animal rights movement s canonical texts Singer based his arguments on the principle of utilitarianism the view in its simplest form that an act is right if it leads to the greatest happiness of the greatest number a phrase first used in by Jeremy Bentham He argued in favor of the equal consideration of interests the position that there are no grounds to suppose that a violation of the basic interests of a human for example an interest in not suffering is different in any morally significant way from a violation of the basic interests of a nonhuman Singer used the term speciesism in the book citing Ryder and it stuck becoming an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in br The book s publication triggered a groundswell of scholarly interest in animal rights Richard Ryder s Victims of Science The Use of Animals in Research appeared followed by Andrew Linzey s Animal Rights A Christian Perspective and Stephen R L Clark s The Moral Status of Animals A Conference on Animal Rights was organized by Ryder and Linzey at Trinity College Cambridge in August This was followed by Mary Midgley s Beast And Man The Roots of Human Nature then Animal Rights A Symposium which included the papers delivered to the Cambridge conference br From onwards a series of articles by Tom Regan led to his The Case for Animal Rights in which he argues that nonhuman animals are subjects of a life and therefore possessors of moral rights a work regarded as a key text in animal rights theory Regan wrote in that philosophers had written more about animal rights in the previous years than in the years before that Garner writes that Charles Magel s bibliography Keyguide to Information Sources in Animal Rights contains pages of philosophical material on animals up to but pages between and alone br br br Founding of the Animal Liberation Front br br In a law student Ronnie Lee formed a branch of the Hunt Saboteurs Association in Luton later calling it the Band of Mercy after a th century RSPCA youth group The Band attacked hunters vehicles by slashing tires and breaking windows calling it active compassion In November they engaged in their first act of arson when they set fire to a Hoechst Pharmaceuticals research laboratory claiming responsibility as a nonviolent guerilla organization dedicated to the liberation of animals from all forms of cruelty and persecution at the hands of mankind br Lee and another activist were sentenced to three years in prison in paroled after months In Lee brought together the remaining Band of Mercy activists along with some fresh faces to start a leaderless resistance movement calling it the Animal Liberation Front ALF ALF activists see themselves as a modern Underground Railroad passing animals removed from farms and laboratories to sympathetic veterinarians safe houses and sanctuaries Some activists also engage in threats intimidation and arson acts that have lost the movement sympathy in mainstream public opinion br The decentralized model of activism is frustrating for law enforcement organizations who find the networks difficult to infiltrate because they tend to be organized around friends In the US Department of Homeland Security indicated how seriously it takes the ALF when it included them in a list of domestic terrorist threats The tactics of some of the more determined ALF activists are anathema to many animal rights advocates such as Singer who regard the movement as something that should occupy the moral high ground ALF activists respond to the criticism with the argument that as Ingrid Newkirk puts it Thinkers may prepare revolutions but bandits must carry them out br From the s through to the early s there was an increased level of violence by animal rights extremist groups directed at individuals and institutions associated with animal research Activist groups involved included the Justice Department the Animal Rights Militia and SHAC br br br Subcultures and animal rights br br In the s animal rights became associated with punk subculture and ideologies particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho punk in the United Kingdom This association continues on into the st century as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe br br br Animal Rights International br br Henry Spira a former seaman and civil rights activist became the most notable of the new animal advocates in the United States A proponent of gradual change he formed Animal Rights International in and introduced the idea of reintegrative shaming whereby a relationship is formed between a group of animal rights advocates and a corporation they see as misusing animals with a view to obtaining concessions or halting a practice It is a strategy that has been widely adopted including the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals br Spira s first campaign was in opposition to the American Museum of Natural History in where cats were being experimented on research that he persuaded them to stop In he convinced the cosmetics company Revlon to stop using the Draize test which involves toxicity tests on the skin or in the eyes of animals He took out a full page ad in several newspapers featuring a rabbit with sticking plaster over the eyes and the caption How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty s sake Revlon stopped using animals for cosmetics testing donated money to help set up the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing and was followed by other leading cosmetics companies br br br st century developments br In New Zealand passed a new Animal Welfare Act that had the effect of banning experiments on non human hominids br Also in Public Law Title Section was put into action in the United States This law makes it a felony to create sell or possess videos showing animal cruelty with the intention of profiting financially from them However there have been strong arguments that this law is unconstitutional in light of the Supreme Court s jurisprudence concerning privacy and sex as well as the fact that the U S government may not criminalize mere possession of obscene materials in the privacy of one s own home br In the Austrian Parliament banned experiments on apes unless they are performed in the interests of the individual ape Also in Austria the Supreme Court ruled in January that a chimpanzee called Matthew Hiasl Pan by those advocating for his personhood was not a person after the Association Against Animal Factories sought personhood status for him because his custodians had gone bankrupt The chimpanzee had been captured as a baby in Sierra Leone in then smuggled to Austria to be used in pharmaceutical experiments but was discovered by customs officials when he arrived in the country and was taken to a shelter instead He was kept there for years until the group that ran the shelter went bankrupt in Donors offered to help him but under Austrian law only a person can receive personal gifts so any money sent to support him would be lost to the shelter s bankruptcy The association appealed the ruling to the European Court of Human Rights The lawyer proposing the chimpanzee s personhood asked the court to appoint a legal guardian for him and to grant him four rights the right to life limited freedom of movement personal safety and the right to claim property br In June a committee of Spain s national legislature became the first to vote for a resolution to extend limited rights to nonhuman primates The parliamentary Environment Committee recommended giving chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans the right not to be used in medical experiments or in circuses and recommended making it illegal to kill apes except in self defense based upon the rights recommended by the Great Ape Project The committee s proposal has not yet been enacted into law br From onwards several countries outlawed the use of some or all animals in circuses starting with Bolivia and followed by several countries in Europe Scandinavia the Middle East and Singapore br In the regional government in Catalonia passed a motion to outlaw bull fighting the first such ban in Spain In PETA sued SeaWorld over the captivity of five orcas in San Diego and Orlando arguing that the whales were being treated as slaves It was the first time the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which outlaws slavery and involuntary servitude was cited in court to protect nonhuman rights A federal judge dismissed the case in February br br br Petitions for habeas corpus br In the Nonhuman Rights Project NhPR filed three lawsuits in New York State on behalf of four captive chimpanzees demanding that the courts grant them the right to bodily liberty via the writ of habeas corpus and immediately send them to a sanctuary affiliated with the North American Primate Sanctuary Alliance All of the petitions were denied In the case involving the chimpanzees Hercules and Leo Justice Barbara Jaffe did not immediately dismiss the filing and instead ordered a hearing requiring the chimpanzee owner to show why the chimpanzees should not be released and transferred to the sanctuary Following the hearing Justice Jaffe issued an order denying Hercules and Leo s petition br Even though the petition was denied the NhRP interpreted Justice Jaffe s decision as a victory In its press release it emphasized the fact that Justice Jaffe agreed with NhRP writing that persons are not restricted to human beings and that who is a person is not a question of biology but of public policy and principle and also stating that efforts to extend legal rights to chimpanzees are thus understandable some day they may even succeed br br br br
