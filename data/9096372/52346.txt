Nebuchadnezzar II Babylonian cuneiform Nab kudurri u ur meaning Nabu watch over my heir Biblical Hebrew N a ne ar also spelled Nebuchadrezzar II was the second king of the Neo Babylonian Empire ruling from the death of his father Nabopolassar in BC to his own death in BC Historically known as Nebuchadnezzar the Great he is typically regarded as the empire s greatest king Nebuchadnezzar remains famous for his military campaigns in the Levant for his construction projects in his capital Babylon including the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and for the role he plays in Jewish history Ruling for years Nebuchadnezzar was the longest reigning king of the Babylonian dynasty By the time of his death he was among the most powerful rulers in the world br Possibly named after his grandfather of the same name or after Nebuchadnezzar I r c BC one of Babylon s greatest ancient warrior kings Nebuchadnezzar II already secured renown for himself during his father s reign leading armies in the Medo Babylonian conquest of the Assyrian Empire At the Battle of Carchemish in BC Nebuchadnezzar inflicted a crushing defeat on an Egyptian army led by Pharaoh Necho II and ensured that the Neo Babylonian Empire would succeed the Neo Assyrian Empire as the dominant power in the ancient Near East Shortly after this victory Nabopolassar died and Nebuchadnezzar became king br Despite his successful military career during his father s reign the first third or so of Nebuchadnezzar s reign saw little to no major military achievements and notably a disastrous failure in an attempted invasion of Egypt These years of lackluster military performance saw some of Babylon s vassals particularly in the Levant beginning to doubt Babylon s power viewing the Neo Babylonian Empire as a paper tiger rather than a power truly on the level of the Neo Assyrian Empire The situation grew so severe that people in Babylonia itself began disobeying the king some going as far as to revolt against Nebuchadnezzar s rule br After this disappointing early period as king Nebuchadnezzar s luck turned In the s BC Nebuchadnezzar engaged in a successful string of military actions in the Levant against the vassal states in rebellion there likely with the ultimate intent of curbing Egyptian influence in the region In BC Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah and its capital Jerusalem The destruction of Jerusalem led to the Babylonian captivity as the city s population and people from the surrounding lands were deported to Babylonia The Jews thereafter referred to Nebuchadnezzar the greatest enemy they had faced until that point as a destroyer of nations Jer The biblical Book of Jeremiah paints Nebuchadnezzar as a cruel enemy but also as God s appointed ruler of the world and a divine instrument to punish disobedience Through the destruction of Jerusalem the capture of the rebellious Phoenician city of Tyre and other campaigns in the Levant Nebuchadnezzar completed the Neo Babylonian Empire s transformation into the new great power of the ancient Near East br In addition to his military campaigns Nebuchadnezzar is remembered as a great builder king The prosperity ensured by his wars allowed Nebuchadnezzar to conduct great building projects in Babylon and elsewhere in Mesopotamia The modern image of Babylon is largely of the city as it was after Nebuchadnezzar s projects during which he among other work rebuilt many of the city s religious buildings including the Esagila and Etemenanki renovated its existing palace constructed a brand new palace and beautified its ceremonial centre through renovations to the city s Processional Street and the Ishtar Gate As most of Nebuchadnezzar s inscriptions deal with his building projects rather than military accomplishments he was for a time seen by historians mostly as a builder rather than a warrior br br br Sources br There are very few cuneiform sources for the period between BC and BC covering much of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II and the reigns of his three immediate successors Amel Marduk Neriglissar and Labashi Marduk This lack of sources has the unfortunate effect that even though Nebuchadnezzar had the longest reign of all of them less is confidently known of Nebuchadnezzar s reign than of the reigns of almost all the other Neo Babylonian kings Though the handful of cuneiform sources recovered notably the Babylonian Chronicle confirm some events of his reign such as conflicts with the Kingdom of Judah other events such as the BC destruction of Solomon s Temple and other military campaigns Nebuchadnezzar possibly conducted are not covered in any known cuneiform documents br As a result historical reconstructions of this period generally follow secondary sources in Hebrew Greek and Latin to determine what events transpired at the time in addition to contract tablets from Babylonia Though use of the sources written by later authors many of them created several centuries after Nebuchadnezzar s time and often reflecting their own cultural attitudes to the events and figures discussed presents problems in and of itself blurring the line between history and tradition it is the only possible approach to gain insight into Nebuchadnezzar s reign br br br Background br br br Name br br Nebuchadnezzar II s name in Akkadian was Nab kudurri u ur meaning Nabu watch over my heir The name was often interpreted in earlier scholarship as Nabu protect the boundary given that the word kudurru can also mean boundary or line Modern historians support the heir interpretation over the boundary interpretation in terms of this name There is no reason to believe that the Babylonians intended the name to be difficult to interpret or to have a double meaning br Nab kudurri u ur is typically anglicised to Nebuchadnezzar following how the name is most commonly rendered in Hebrew and Greek particularly in most of the Bible In Hebrew the name was rendered as N a ne ar and in Greek it was rendered as Nabouchodonosor Some scholars such as Donald Wiseman prefer the anglicisation Nebuchadrezzar with an r rather than an n following the assumption that Nebuchadnezzar is a later corrupted form of the contemporary Nab kudurri u ur br The alternate anglicisation Nebuchadrezzar derives from how the name is rendered in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel N a re ar a more faithful transliteration of the original Akkadian name The Assyriologist Adrianus van Selms suggested in that the variant with an n rather than an r was a rude nickname deriving from an Akkadian rendition like Nab k danu u ur which means Nabu protect the mule though there is no concrete evidence for this idea Van Selms believed that a nickname like that could derive from Nebuchadnezzar s early reign which was plagued by political instability br Nebuchadnezzar II s name Nab kudurri u ur was identical to the name of his distant predecessor Nebuchadnezzar I r c BC who ruled more than five centuries before Nebuchadnezzar II s time Like Nebuchadnezzar II Nebuchadnezzar I was a renowned warrior king who appeared in a time of political upheaval and defeated the forces of Babylon s enemies in Nebuchadnezzar I s case the Elamites Although theophoric names using the god Nabu are common in texts from the early Neo Babylonian Empire the name Nebuchadnezzar is relatively rare only being mentioned four times with certainty Though there is no evidence that Nabopolassar named his son after Nebuchadnezzar I Nabopolassar was knowledgeable in history and actively worked to connect his rule to the rule of the Akkadian Empire which preceded him by nearly two thousand years The significance of his son and heir bearing the name of one of Babylon s greatest kings would not have been lost on Nabopolassar br If Jursa s theory concerning Nabopolassar s origin is correct it is alternatively possible that Nebuchadnezzar II was named after his grandfather of the same name as the Babylonians employed patronymics rather than after the previous king br br br Ancestry and early life br br Nebuchadnezzar was the eldest son of Nabopolassar r BC the founder of the Neo Babylonian Empire This is confirmed by Nabopolassar s inscriptions which explicitly name Nebuchadnezzar as his eldest son as well as inscriptions from Nebuchadnezzar s reign which refer to him as the first or chief son of Nabopolassar and as Nabopolassar s true or legitimate heir The Neo Babylonian Empire was founded through Nabopolassar s rebellion and later war against the Neo Assyrian Empire which liberated Babylonia after nearly a century of Assyrian control The war resulted in the complete destruction of Assyria and the Neo Babylonian Empire which rose in its place was powerful but hastily built and politically unstable br As Nabopolassar never clarified his ancestry in lineage in any of his inscriptions his origin is not entirely clear Subsequent historians have variously identified Nabopolassar as a Chaldean an Assyrian or a Babylonian Although no evidence conclusively confirms him as being of Chaldean origin the term Chaldean dynasty is frequently used by modern historians for the royal family he founded and the term Chaldean Empire remains in use as an alternate historiographical name for the Neo Babylonian Empire br Nabopolassar appears to regardless of his ethnic origin have been strongly connected to the city of Uruk located south of Babylon It is possible that he was a member of its ruling elite before becoming king and there is a growing body of evidence that Nabopolassar s family originated in Uruk for instance that Nebuchadnezzar s daughters lived in the city br In Michael Jursa advanced the theory that Nabopolassar was a member of a prominent political family in Uruk whose members are attested since the reign of Esarhaddon r BC To support his theory Jursa pointed to how documents describe how the grave and body of Kudurru a deceased governor of Uruk was desecrated due to the anti Assyrian activities of Kudurru s two sons Nabu shumu ukin and a son whose name is mostly missing The desecration went so far as to drag Kudurru s body through the streets of Uruk Kudurru can be identified with Nebuchadnezzar Nab kudurri u ur Kudurru simply being a common and shortened nickname a prominent official in Uruk who served as its governor under the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal r BC in the s BC br In Assyrian tradition the desecration of a dead body showed that the deceased individual and their surviving family were traitors and enemies of the state and that they had to be completely eradicated serving to punish them even after death The name of the son whose name is unpreserved in the letter ended with either ahi n sir or u ur and the remaining traces can fit with the name Nab apla u ur meaning that Nabopolassar could be the other son mentioned in the letter and thus a son of Kudurru br Strengthening this connection is that Nebuchadnezzar II is attested very early during his father s reign from to BC as high priest of the Eanna temple in Uruk where he is often attested under the nickname Kudurru Nebuchadnezzar must have been made high priest at a very young age considering that his year of death BC is years after BC The original Kudurru s second son Nabu shumu ukin also appears to be attested as a prominent general under Nabopolassar and the name was also used by Nebuchadnezzar II for one of his sons possibly honoring his dead uncle br br br Nebuchadnezzar as crown prince br br Nebuchadnezzar s military career began in the reign of his father though little information survives Based on a letter sent to the temple administration of the Eanna temple it appears that Nebuchadnezzar participated in his father s campaign to take the city of Harran in BC Harran was the seat of Ashur uballit II who had rallied what remained of the Assyrian army and ruled the Neo Assyrian rump state The Babylonian victory in the Harran campaign and the defeat of Ashur uballit in BCE marked the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy which would never be restored According to the Babylonian Chronicles Nebuchadnezzar also commanded an army in an unspecified mountainous region for several months in BC br In the war against the Babylonians and Medes Assyria had allied with Pharaoh Psamtik I of the Twenty sixth Dynasty of Egypt who had been interested in ensuring Assyria s survival so that Assyria could remain as a buffer state between his own kingdom and the Babylonian and Median kingdoms After the fall of Harran Psamtik s successor Pharaoh Necho II personally led a large army into former Assyrian lands to turn the tide of the war and restore the Neo Assyrian Empire even though it was more or less a lost cause as Assyria had already collapsed As Nabopolassar was occupied with fighting Urartu in the north the Egyptians took control of the Levant largely unopposed capturing territories as far north as the city of Carchemish in Syria where Necho established his base of operations br Nebuchadnezzar s greatest victory from his time as crown prince came at the Battle of Carchemish in BC which put an end to Necho s campaign in the Levant by inflicting a crushing defeat on the Egyptians Nebuchadnezzar had been the sole commander of the Babylonian army at this battle as his father had chosen to stay in Babylon perhaps on account of illness Necho s forces were completely annihilated by Nebuchadnezzar s army with Babylonian sources claiming that not a single Egyptian escaped alive The account of the battle in the Babylonian Chronicle reads as follows br br The king of Akkad stayed home while Nebuchadnezzar his eldest son and crown prince mustered the army of Akkad He took his army s lead and marched to Carchemish which is on the bank of the Euphrates He crossed the river at Carchemish They did battle together The army of Egypt retreated before him He inflicted a defeat upon them and finished them off completely In the district of Hamath the army of Akkad overtook the remainder of the army of Egypt which managed to escape from the defeat and which was not overcome They inflicted a defeat upon them so that a single Egyptian man did not return home At that time Nebuchadnezzar conquered all of Ha ma th br The story of Nebuchadnezzar s victory at Carchemish reverberated through history appearing in many later ancient accounts including in the Book of Jeremiah and the Books of Kings in the Bible It is possible to conclude based on subsequent geopolitics that the victory resulted in all of Syria and Israel coming under the control of the Neo Babylonian Empire a feat which the Assyrians under Tiglath Pileser III r BC only accomplished after five years of protracted military campaigns The defeat of Egypt at Carchemish ensured that the Neo Babylonian Empire would grow to become the major power of the ancient Near East and the uncontested successor of the Neo Assyrian Empire br br br Reign br br br Accession to the throne br br Nabopolassar died just a few weeks after Nebuchadnezzar s victory at Carchemish At this point in time Nebuchadnezzar was still away on his campaign against the Egyptians having chased the retreating Egyptian forces to the region around the city of Hamath The news of Nabopolassar s death reached Nebuchadnezzar s camp on Abu late July and Nebuchadnezzar quickly arranged affairs with the Egyptians and rushed back to Babylon where he was proclaimed king on Ul lu mid August br The speed in which Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon might be due to the threat that one of his brothers two are known by name Nabu shum lishir and Nabu zer ushabshi could claim the throne in his absence Though Nebuchadnezzar had been recognised as the eldest son and heir by Nabopolassar Nabu shum lishir Nabopolassar s second born son had been recognised as his equal brother a dangerously vague title Despite these possible fears there were no attempts made at usurping his throne at this time br One of Nebuchadnezzar s first acts as king was to bury his father Nabopolassar was laid in a huge coffin adorned with ornamented gold plates and fine dresses with golden beads which was then placed within a small palace he had constructed in Babylon Shortly thereafter before the end of the month in which he had been crowned Nebuchadnezzar returned to Syria to resume his campaign The Babylonian Chronicle records that he marched about victoriously meaning that he faced little to no resistance returning to Babylon after several months of campaigning The Syrian campaign though it resulted in a certain amount of plunder was not a complete success in that it did not ensure Nebuchadnezzar s grasp on the region He had seemingly failed to inspire fear given that none of the westernmost states in the Levant swore fealty to him and paid tribute br br br Early military campaigns br Though little information survives concerning them the Babylonian Chronicle preserves brief accounts of Nebuchadnezzar s military activities in his first eleven years as king In BC Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant once again conquering the city of Ascalon According to the Babylonian Chronicle Ascalon s king was captured and taken to Babylon and the city was plundered and levelled to the ground Modern excavations at Ascalon have confirmed that the city was more or less destroyed at this point in time The Ascalon campaign was preceded by a campaign in Syria which was more successful than Nebuchadnezzar s first resulting in oaths of fealty from the rulers of Phoenicia br br In BC Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in a land whose name is not preserved in the surviving copy of the chronicle The chronicle records that this campaign was extensive given that the account mentions the construction of large siege towers and a siege of a city the name of which does not survive either Anson Rainey speculated in that the city taken was Gaza whereas Nadav Na aman thought in that it was Kummuh in south eastern Anatolia In the second half of the th century BC some documents mentioned the towns Isqalanu the name derived from Ascalon and Hazzatu the name possibly derived from Gaza near the city of Nippur indicating that deportees from both of these cities lived near Nippur and as such possibly that they had been captured at around the same time br In both BC and BC Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant though little information survives beyond that a vast amount of booty was brought from the Levant to Babylonia in BC On account of the entry for BC also referring to Nabu shum lishir Nebuchadnezzar s younger brother in a fragmentary and unclear context it is possible that Nabu shum lishir led a revolt against his brother in an attempt to usurp the throne in that year especially since he is no longer mentioned in any sources after BC The damage to the text however makes this idea speculative and conjectural br br In the BC campaign Nebuchadnezzar departed from the Levant and then marched into Egypt Despite the defeat at Carchemish in BC Egypt still had a great amount of influence in the Levant even though the region was ostensibly under Babylonian rule Thus a campaign against Egypt was logical in order to assert Babylonian dominance and also carried enormous economic and propagandistic benefits but it was also risky and ambitious The path into Egypt was difficult and the lack of secure control of either side of the Sinai Desert could spell disaster br Nebuchadnezzar s invasion of Egypt failed the Babylonian Chronicle states that both the Egyptian and Babylonian armies suffered a huge number of casualties Though Egypt was not conquered the campaign did result in momentarily curbing Egyptian interest in the Levant given that Necho II gave up his ambitions in the region In BC Nebuchadnezzar marched his army into the Levant and then attacked and raided the Arabs in the Syrian desert Though apparently successful it is unclear what the achievements gained in this campaign were br In BC Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against the Kingdom of Judah succeeding in capturing the city of Jerusalem Judah represented a prime target of Babylonian attention given that it was at the epicenter of competition between Babylon and Egypt By BC Judah s king Jehoiakim had begun to openly challenge Babylonian authority counting on that Egypt would lend support to his cause Nebuchadnezzar s first BC assault on Jerusalem is recorded in the Bible but also in the Babylonian Chronicle which describes it as follows br br The seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar in the month of Kislimu the king of Akkad mustered his troops marched to the Levant and set up quarters facing the city of Judah Jerusalem In the month of Addaru early in BC the second day he took the city and captured the king He installed there a king of his choice He colle cted its massive tribute and went back to Babylon br Jehoiakim had died during Nebuchadnezzar s siege and been replaced by his son Jeconiah who was captured and taken to Babylon with his uncle Zedekiah installed in his place as king of Judah Jeconiah is recorded as being alive in Babylonia thereafter with records as late as or BC listing him among the recipients of food at Nebuchadnezzar s palace and still referring to him as the king of the land of Judah br In BC the Babylonian army departed for the Levant again but appears to not have engaged in any military activities as they turned back immediately after reaching the Euphrates The following year Nebuchadnezzar marched his army along the Tigris river to do battle with the Elamites but no actual battle happened as the Elamites retreated out of fear once Nebuchadnezzar was a day s march away In BC Nebuchadnezzar stayed at home in Babylon but soon had to face a rebellion against his rule there though he defeated the rebels with the chronicle stating that the king put his large army to the sword and conquered his foe Shortly thereafter Nebuchadnezzar again campaigned in the Levant and secured large amounts of tribute In the last year recorded in the chronicle BC Nebuchadnezzar campaigned in the Levant yet again br There were several years without any noteworthy military activity at all Notably Nebuchadnezzar spent all of BC in Babylon when the chronicle excuses the king by stating that he stayed in Babylon to refit his numerous horses and chariotry Some of the years when Nebuchadnezzar was victorious can also hardly be considered real challenges Raiding the Arabs in BC was not a major military accomplishment and the victory over Judah and the retreat of the Elamites were not secured on the battlefield It thus appears that Nebuchadnezzar achieved little military success after the failure of his invasion of Egypt Nebuchadnezzar s poor military record had dangerous geopolitical consequences According to the Bible in Zedekiah s fourth year as king of Judah BC the kings of Ammon Edom Moab Sidon and Tyre met in Jerusalem to deal with the possibility of throwing off Babylonian control br Evidence that Babylonian control was beginning to unravel is also clear from contemporary Babylonian records such as the aforementioned rebellion in Babylonia itself as well as records of a man being executed in BC at Borspippa for breaking his oath to the king The oath breaking was serious enough that the judge in the trial was Nebuchadnezzar himself It is also possible that Babylonian Median relations were becoming strained with records of a Median defector being housed in Nebuchadnezzar s palace and some inscriptions indicating that the Medes were beginning to be seen as enemies By BC the failure of the Egyptian invasion and the lacklustre state of Nebuchadnezzar s other campaigns loomed high According to the Assyriologist Israel Eph al Babylon at this time was seen by its contemporaries more like a paper tiger i e an ineffectual threat than a great empire like Assyria just a few decades prior br br br Destruction of Jerusalem br br From his appointment as king of Judah Zedekiah waited for the opportune moment to throw off Babylonian control After Pharaoh Necho II s death in BC Egyptian intervention in affairs in the Levant increased once again under his successors Psamtik II r BC and Apries r BC who both worked to encourage anti Babylonian rebellions It is possible that the Babylonian failure to invade Egypt in BC helped inspire revolts against the Babylonian Empire The outcome of these efforts was Zedekiah s open revolt against Nebuchadnezzar s authority Unfortunately no cuneiform sources are preserved from this time and the only known account of the fall of Judah is the biblical account br br In BC Zedekiah refused to pay tribute to Nebuchadnezzar and he was closely followed in this by Ithobaal III the king of Tyre In BC Ammon Edom and Moab likewise rebelled In response to Zedekiah s uprising Nebuchadnezzar conquered and destroyed the Kingdom of Judah in BC one of the great achievements of his reign The campaign which probably ended in the summer of BC resulted in the plunder and destruction of the city of Jerusalem a permanent end to Judah and it led to the Babylonian captivity as the Jews were captured and deported to Babylonia Archaeological excavations confirm that Jerusalem and the surrounding area was destroyed and depopulated It is possible that the intensity of the destruction carried out by Nebuchadnezzar at Jerusalem and elsewhere in the Levant was due to the implementation of something akin to a scorched earth policy aimed at stopping Egypt from gaining a foothold there br Some Jewish administration was allowed to remain in the region under the governor Gedaliah governing from Mizpah under close Babylonian monitoring According to the Bible and the st century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus Zedekiah attempted to flee after resisting the Babylonians but was captured at Jericho and suffered a terrible fate According to the narrative Nebuchadnezzar wanted to make an example out of him given that Zedekiah was not an ordinary vassal but a vassal directly appointed by Nebuchadnezzar As such Zedekiah was supposedly taken to Riblah in northern Syria where he had to watch his sons being executed before having his eyes gouged out and sent to be imprisoned in Babylon br Per the Books of Kings in the Bible the campaign against Judah was longer than typical Mesopotamian wars with the siege of Jerusalem lasting months depending on the calculation rather than the typical length of less than a year Whether the unusual length of the siege indicates that the Babylonian army was weak unable to break into the city for more than a year or that Nebuchadnezzar by this time had succeeded in stabilising his rule in Babylonia and could thus wage war patiently without being pressured by time to escalate the siege is not certain br br br Later military campaigns br br It is possible that the Egyptians took advantage of the Babylonians being preoccupied with besieging Jerusalem Herodotus describes Pharaoh Apries as campaigning in the Levant taking the city of Sidon and fighting the Tyrians which indicates a renewed Egyptian invasion of the Levant Apries is unlikely to have been as successful as Herodotus describes given that it is unclear how the Egyptian navy would have defeated the superior navies of the Phoenician cities and even if some cities had been taken they must have shortly thereafter fallen into Babylonian hands again Tyre had rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar at around the same time as Judah and Nebuchadnezzar moved to retake the city after his successful subduing of the Jews br The biblical Book of Ezekiel describes Tyre in BC as if it had been recently captured by the Babylonian army The supposed length of the siege years is only given by Flavius Josephus and is subject to debate among modern scholars Josephus s account of Nebuchadnezzar s reign is obviously not entirely historic as he describes Nebuchadnezzar as five years after the destruction of Jerusalem invading Egypt capturing the Pharaoh and appointing another Pharaoh in his place A stele from Tahpanhes uncovered in records that Nebuchadnezzar attempted to invade Egypt in BC although Apries forces managed to repel the invasion br Josephus states that Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre in the seventh year of his reign though it is unclear whether his in this context refers to Nebuchadnezzar or to Ithobaal III of Tyre If it refers to Nebuchadnezzar a siege begun in BC and lasting for thirteen years later simultaneously with the siege of Jerusalem is unlikely to have gone unmentioned in Babylonian records If the seventh year of Ithobaal is intended the beginning of the siege may conjecturally be placed after Jerusalem s fall If the siege lasting years is taken at face value the siege would then not have ended before or BC The supposed length of the siege can be ascribed to the difficulty in besieging the city Tyre was located on an island metres from the coast and could not be taken without naval support Though the city withstood numerous sieges it would not be captured until Alexander the Great s siege in BC br In the end the siege was resolved without a need of battle and did not result in the Tyre being conquered It seems Tyre s king and Nebuchadnezzar came to an agreement for Tyre to continue to be ruled by vassal kings though probably under heavier Babylonian control than before Documents from Tyre near the end of Nebuchadnezzar s reign demonstrate that the city had become a centre for Babylonian military affairs in the region According to later Jewish tradition it is possible that Ithobaal III was deposed and taken as a prisoner to Babylon with another king Baal II proclaimed by Nebuchadnezzar in his place br It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar campaigned against Egypt in BC given that a fragmentary Babylonian inscription given the modern designation BM from that year records the word Egypt as well as possibly traces of the name Amasis the name of the then incumbent Pharaoh Amasis II r BC A stele of Amasis also fragmentary may also describe a combined naval and land attack by the Babylonians Recent evidence suggests that the Babylonians were initially successful during the invasion and gained a foothold in Egypt but they were repelled by Amasis forces If Nebuchadnezzar did campaign against Egypt again he was unsuccessful again given that Egypt did not come under Babylonian rule br Nebuchadnezzar s campaigns in the Levant most notably those directed towards Jerusalem and Tyre completed the Neo Babylonian Empire s transformation from a rump state of the Neo Assyrian Empire to the new dominant power of the ancient Near East Still Nebuchadnezzar s military accomplishments can be questioned given that the borders of his empire by the end of his reign had not noticeably increased in size and that he had not managed to conquer Egypt Even after a reign of several decades Nebuchadnezzar s greatest victory remained his victory over the Egyptians at Carchemish in BC before he even became king br br br Building projects br br The Babylonian king was traditionally a builder and restorer and as such large scale building projects were important as a legitimizing factor for Babylonian rulers Nebuchadnezzar extensively expanded and rebuilt his capital city of Babylon and the most modern historical and archaeological interpretations of the city reflect it as it appeared after Nebuchadnezzar s construction projects The projects were made possible through the prospering economy during Nebuchadnezzar s reign sustained by his conquests His building inscriptions record work done to numerous temples notably the restoration of the Esagila the main temple of Babylon s national deity Marduk and the completion of the Etemenanki a great ziggurat dedicated to Marduk br br Extensive work was also conducted on civil and military structures Among the most impressive efforts was the work done surrounding the city s northern ceremonial entrance the Ishtar Gate These projects included restoration work on the South Palace inside the city walls the construction of a completely new North Palace on the other side of the walls facing the gate as well as the restoration of Babylon s Processional Street which led through the gate and of the gate itself The ruins of Nebuchadnezzar s North Palace are poorly preserved and as such its structure and appearance are not entirely understood Nebuchadnezzar also constructed a third palace the Summer Palace built some distance north of the inner city walls in the northernmost corner of the outer walls br The restored Ishtar Gate was decorated with blue and yellow glazed bricks and depictions of bulls symbols of the god Adad and dragons symbols of the god Marduk Similar bricks were used for the walls surrounding the Processional Street which also featured depictions of lions symbols of the goddess Ishtar Babylon s Processional Street the only such street yet excavated in Mesopotamia ran along the eastern walls of the South Palace and exited the inner city walls at the Ishtar Gate running past the North Palace To the south this street went by the Etemenanki turning to the west and going over a bridge constructed either under the reign of Nabopolassar or Nebuchadnezzar br Some of the bricks of the Processional Street bear the name of the Neo Assyrian king Sennacherib r BC on their underside perhaps indicating that construction of the street had begun already during his reign but the fact that the upper side of the bricks all bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar suggests that construction of the street was completed under Nebuchadnezzar s reign Glazed bricks such as the ones used in the Procession Street were also used in the throne room of the South Palace which was decorated with depictions of lions and tall stylized palm trees br Nebuchadnezzar also directed building efforts on the city of Borsippa with several of his inscriptions recording restoration work on that city s temple the Ezida dedicated to the god Nabu Additionally Nebuchadnezzar also restored the ziggurat of the Ezida the E urme imin anki and also worked on the temple of Gula Etila as well as numerous other temples and shrines in the city Nebuchadnezzar also repaired Borsippa s walls br Other great building projects by Nebuchadnezzar include the Nar Shamash a canal to bring water from the Euphrates close to the city of Sippar and the Median Wall a large defensive structure built to defend Babylonia against incursions from the north The Median Wall was one of two walls built to protect Babylonia s northern border Further evidence that Nebuchadnezzar believed the north to be the most likely point of attack for his enemies comes from that he fortified the walls of northern cities such as Babylon Borsippa and Kish but left the walls of southern cities such as Ur and Uruk as they were Nebuchadnezzar also began work on the Royal Canal also known as Nebuchadnezzar s Canal a great canal linking the Euphrates to the Tigris which in time completely transformed the agriculture of the region but the structure was not completed until the reign of Nabonidus who ruled as the last king of the Neo Babylonian Empire from to BC br br br Death and succession br Nebuchadnezzar died at Babylon in BC The last known tablet dated to Nebuchadnezzar s reign from Uruk is dated to the same day October as the first known tablet of his successor Amel Marduk from Sippar Amel Marduk s administrative duties probably began before he became king during the last few weeks or months of his father s reign when Nebuchadnezzar was ill and dying Having ruled for years Nebuchadnezzar s reign was the longest of his dynasty and he would be remembered favourably by the Babylonians br Amel Marduk s accession does not appear to have gone smoothly Amel Marduk was not the eldest living son of Nebuchadnezzar and the reason why he was picked as crown prince is not known The choice is especially strange given that some sources suggest that the relationship between Nebuchadnezzar and Amel Marduk was particularly poor with one surviving text describing both as parties in some form of conspiracy and accusing one of them the text is too fragmentary to determine which one of failing in the most important duties of Babylonian kingship through exploiting Babylon s populace and desecrating its temples Amel Marduk also at one point appears to have been imprisoned by his father possibly on account of the Babylonian aristocracy having proclaimed him as king while Nebuchadnezzar was away It is possible that Nebuchadnezzar intended to replace Amel Marduk as heir with another son but died before doing so br In one of Nebuchadnezzar s late inscriptions written more than forty years into his reign he wrote that he had been chosen for the kingship by the gods before he was even born Mesopotamian rulers typically only stressed divine legitimacy in this fashion when their actual legitimacy was questionable a method often employed by usurpers Given that Nebuchadnezzar at this point had been king for several decades and was the legitimate heir of his predecessor the inscription is very strange unless it was intended to help legitimize Nebuchadnezzar s successor Amel Marduk who as a younger son and a former conspirator could be seen as politically problematic br br br Family and children br br No surviving contemporary Babylonian documents provide the name of Nebuchadnezzar s wife According to Berossus her name was Amytis daughter of Astyages king of the Medes Berossus writes that Nabopolassar sent troops to the assistance of Astyages the tribal chieftain and satrap of the Medes in order to obtain a daughter of Astyages Amyitis as wife for his son Nebuchadnezzar Though the ancient Greek historian Ctesias instead wrote that Amytis was the name of a daughter of Astyages who had married Cyrus I of Persia it seems more likely that a Median princess would marry a member of the Babylonian royal family considering the good relations established between the two during Nabopolassar s reign br Given that Astyages was still too young during Nabopolassar s reign to already have children and was not yet king it seems more probable that Amytis was Astyages s sister and thus a daughter of his predecessor Cyaxares By marrying his son to a daughter of Cyaxares Nebuchadnezzar s father Nabopolassar likely sought to seal the alliance between the Babylonians and the Medes br According to tradition Nebuchadnezzar constructed the Hanging Gardens of Babylon one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World featuring exotic shrubs vines and trees as well as artificial hills watercourses and knolls so that Amytis would feel less homesick for the mountains of Media No archaeological evidence for these gardens has yet been found br Nebuchadnezzar had six known sons Most of the sons with the exceptions of Marduk nadin ahi and Eanna sharra usur are attested very late in their father s reign It is possible that they might have been the product of a second marriage and that they could have been born relatively late in Nebuchadnezzar s reign possibly after his known daughters The known sons of Nebuchadnezzar are br br Marduk nadin ahi Akkadian Marduk n din a i the earliest attested of Nebuchadnezzar s children attested in a legal document probably as an adult as he is described as being in charge of his own land already in Nebuchadnezzar s third year as king BC Presumably Nebuchadnezzar s firstborn son if not eldest child and thus his legitimate heir He is also

succeeded Nebuchadnezzar as king in BC His reign was marred with intrigues and he only ruled for two years before being murdered and usurped by his brother in law Neriglissar Later Babylonian sources mostly speak ill of his reign Amel Marduk is first attested notably as crown prince in a document BC Given that Amel Marduk had an older brother in Marduk nadin ahi alive as late as BC why he was named crown prince is not clear br Marduk shum usur Akkadian Marduk um u ur or Marduk uma u ur named as a royal prince in documents from Nebuchadnezzar s BC and BC years recording payments by his

reign as the king s daughter Her name is of unclear origin it might be derived from the word ka kassite Kashshaya is attested from contemporary texts as a resident of and landowner in Uruk Kashshaya is typically although speculatively identified as the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar who married Neriglissar br Innin etirat Akkadian Innin irat attested as the king s daughter in a BC document which records her granting m r ban tu status status of a free man to a slave by the name Nab mukk elip The document in question was written at Babylon but names including the divine prefix Innin are almost unique to Uruk suggesting that she was a resident of that city br Ba u asitu Akkadian Ba u as tu attested as the owner of a piece of real estate in an economic document The precise reading and meaning of her name is somewhat unclear Paul Alain Beaulieu who in published the translated text which confirms her existence believes that her name is best interpreted as meaning Ba u is a the physician The document was written at Uruk where Ba u asitu is presumed to have lived br It is possible that one of Nebuchadnezzar s daughters married the high official Nabonidus Marriage to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar could explain how Nabonidus could become king and also explain why certain later traditions such as the Book of Daniel in the Bible describe Nabonidus s son Belshazzar as Nebuchadnezzar s son descendant Alternatively these later traditions might instead derive from royal propaganda br The ancient Greek historian Herodotus names the last great queen of the Babylonian Empire as Nitocris though that name nor any other name is not attested in contemporary Babylonian sources Herodotus s description of Nitocris contains a wealth of legendary material that makes it difficult to determine whether he uses the name to refer to Nabonidus s wife or mother In William H Shea proposed that Nitocris may tentatively be identified as the name of Nabonidus s wife and Belshazzar s mother br br br Legacy br br br Assessment by historians br Because of the scarcity of sources assessment by historians of Nebuchadnezzar s character and the nature of his reign have differed considerably over time He has typically been regarded as the greatest and most prestigious king of the Neo Babylonian Empire br Since military activity was not a major issue described in the inscriptions of any Neo Babylonian king regardless of their actual military accomplishments in sharp contrast to the inscriptions of their Neo Assyrian predecessors Nebuchadnezzar s own inscriptions record very little about his wars Out of the fifty or so known inscriptions by the king only a single one deals with military action and in this case only small scale conflicts in the Lebanon region Many Assyriologists such as Wolfram von Soden in thus initially assumed that Nebuchadnezzar had mainly been a builder king devoting his energy and efforts to building and restoring his country br A major change in evaluations of Nebuchadnezzar came with the publication of the tablets of the Babylonian Chronicle by Donald Wiseman in which cover the geopolitical events of Nebuchadnezzar s first eleven years as king From the publication of these tablets and onwards historians have shifted to perceiving Nebuchadnezzar as a great warrior devoting special attention to the military achievements of his reign br According to the historian Josette Elayi writing in Nebuchadnezzar is somewhat difficult to characterise on account of the scarcity of Babylonian source material Elayi wrote about Nebuchadnezzar that h e was a conqueror even though reservations can be had about his military capabilities There was no lack of statesmanlike qualities given his success in building the Babylonian Empire He was a great builder who restored a country that for a long time had been devastated by war That is roughly all we know about him because the Babylonian Chronicles and other texts say little about his personality br br br In Jewish and biblical tradition br br The Babylonian captivity initiated by Nebuchadnezzar came to an end with the fall of Babylon to the Achaemenid king Cyrus the Great in BC Within a year of their liberation some exiled Jews returned to their homeland Their liberation did little to erase the memory of five decades of imprisonment and oppression Instead Jewish literary accounts ensured that accounts of the hardship endured by the Jews as well as of the monarch responsible for it would be remembered for all time The Book of Jeremiah calls Nebuchadnezzar a lion and a destroyer of nations br Nebuchadnezzar s story thus found its way into the Old Testament of the Bible The Bible narrates how Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Kingdom of Judah besieged plundered and destroyed Jerusalem and how he took away the Jews in captivity portraying him as a cruel enemy of the Jewish people The Bible also portrays Nebuchadnezzar as the legitimate ruler of all the nations of the world appointed to rule the world by God As such Judah through divine ruling should have obeyed Nebuchadnezzar and should not have rebelled Nebuchadnezzar is also depicted as carrying out death sentences pronounced by God slaying two false prophets Nebuchadnezzar s campaigns of conquest against other nations are portrayed as being in line with God s will for Nebuchadnezzar s dominance br Despite Nebuchadnezzar s negative portrayal the Book of Jeremiah notably refers to him using the epithet my servant i e God s servant in three passages br br Nebuchadnezzar s attack on the Kingdom of Judah is theologically justified in the Book of Jeremiah on account of Judah s populace s disobedience of God and the king is called Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant br The Book of Jeremiah also states that God has made all the Earth and given it to whom it seemed proper to give it to deciding upon giving all of the lands of the world to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant br The Book of Jeremiah also prophesies Nebuchadnezzar s victory over Egypt stating that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant will invade Egypt and deliver to death those appointed for death and to captivity those appointed for captivity and to the sword those appointed for the sword br Given that Nebuchadnezzar was the enemy of what the Bible proclaims as God s chosen people possibly the worst enemy they had faced until this point there must be a special reason for referring to him with the epithet my servant Other uses of this epithet are usually limited to some of the most positively portrayed figures such as the various prophets Jacob the symbol of the chosen people and David the chosen king Klaas A D Smelik noted in that in the Hebrew Bible there is no better company conceivable than these at the same time there is no candidate less likely for this title of honour than the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar br It is possible that the epithet is a later addition as it is missing in the Septuagint version of the Old Testament perhaps added after Nebuchadnezzar began to be seen in a slightly more favourable light than immediately after Jerusalem s destruction Alternatively possible theological explanations include Nebuchadnezzar being seen despite his cruelty as an instrument in fulfilling God s universal plan or perhaps that designating him as a servant of God was to show that readers should not fear Nebuchadnezzar but his true master God br br In the Book of Daniel considered by scholars to be a work of historical fiction the figure of Nebuchadnezzar differs considerably from his portrayal in the Book of Jeremiah He is for the most part depicted as a merciless and despotic ruler The king has a nightmare and asks his wise men including Daniel and his three companions Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to interpret the dream but refuses to state the dream s contents When the servants protest Nebuchadnezzar sentences all of them including Daniel and his companions to death br By the end of the story when Daniel has successfully interpreted the dream Nebuchadnezzar shows much gratitude showering Daniel with gifts appointing him the governor of the province of Babylon and making him the chief of the kingdom s wise men A second story again casts Nebuchadnezzar as a tyrannical and pagan king who after Shadrach Meshach and Abednego refuse to worship a newly erected golden statue sentences them to death through being thrown into a fiery furnace They are miraculously delivered and Nebuchadnezzar then acknowledges God as the lord of kings and god of gods br Though Nebuchadnezzar is also mentioned as acknowledging the Hebrews God as the true god in other passages of the Book of Daniel it is apparent that his supposed conversion to Judaism does not change his violent character given that he proclaims that anyone who speaks amiss of God shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill In a third story Daniel interprets another dream as meaning that Nebuchadnezzar will lose his mind and live like an animal for seven years before being restored to his normal state Daniel The Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel a fickle tyrant who is not particularly consistent in his faith contrasts with the typical servant of God in other books of the Bible br br Given that Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as the father of Belshazzar in the Book of Daniel it is probable that this portrayal of Nebuchadnezzar especially the story of his madness was actually based on Belshazzar s actual father Nabonidus the last king of the Neo Babylonian Empire r BC Separate Jewish and Hellenistic traditions exist concerning Nabonidus having been mad and it is likely that this madness was simply reattributed to Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel through conflation br Some later traditions conflated Nebuchadnezzar with other rulers as well such as the Assyrian Ashurbanipal r BC the Persian Artaxerxes III r BC the Seleucids Antiochus IV Epiphanes r BC and Demetrius I Soter r BC and the Armenian Tigranes the Great r BC The apocryphal Book of Judith which probably applies the name Nebuchadnezzar to Tigranes the Great of Armenia refers to Nebuchadnezzar as a king of the Assyrians rather than of the Babylonians and demonstrates that Nebuchadnezzar was still viewed as an evil king responsible for destroying Jerusalem looting its temple taking the Jews hostage in Babylon and for the various misdeeds ascribed to him in later Jewish writings br br br Other br Nebuchadnezzar is referred to as Bu t Nu ur in works of the mediaeval scholar al abar where he is credited with conquering Egypt Syria Phoenicia and Arabia The historical Nebuchadnezzar never conquered Egypt and it appears that al abar transferred to him the achievements of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon r In similar fashion Strabo citing Megasthenes mentioned in a list of mythical and semi legendary conquerors a Nabocodrosor as having led an army to the Pillars of Hercules and being revered by the Chaldaeans br br br Titles br br In most of his inscriptions Nebuchadnezzar is typically only titled as Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon son of Nabopolassar king of Babylon or Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon the one who provides for Esagil and Ezida son of Nabopolassar king of Babylon In economic documents Nebuchadnezzar is also ascribed the ancient title king of the Universe and he sometimes also used the title king of Sumer and Akkad used by all the Neo Babylonian kings Some inscriptions accord Nebuchadnezzar more elaborate version of his titles including the following variant attested in an inscription from Babylon br br Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon pious prince the favorite of the god Marduk exalted ruler who is the beloved of the god Nab the one who deliberates and acquires wisdom the one who constantly seeks out the ways of their divinity and reveres their dominion the indefatigable governor who is mindful of provisioning Esagil and Ezida daily
