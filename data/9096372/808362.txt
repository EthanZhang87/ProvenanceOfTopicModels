id: 808362
A vivarium Latin literally for place of life pl vivaria or vivariums is an area usually enclosed for keeping and raising animals or plants for observation or research Water based vivaria may have open tops providing they are not connected to other water bodies An animal enclosure is considered a vivarium only if it provides quality of life through naturalistic components such as ample living space and natural decor that allow and encourage natural behaviours Often a portion of the ecosystem for a particular species is simulated on a smaller scale with controls for environmental conditions such as temperature humidity and light br A vivarium may be small enough to sit on a desk or table such as a terrarium or an aquarium or may be a very large structure possibly outdoors Large vivaria particularly those holding organisms capable of flight typically include some sort of a dual door mechanism such as a sally port for entry and exit so that the outer door can be closed to prevent escape before the inner door is opened br br br Types of vivarium br Some vivaria can be subcategorized according to the habitat or lifeforms enclosed within A vivarium that contains multiple components may be named according to its primary component or simply called a vivarium Each subcategory can refer to either an individual enclosure or a facility that encompasses numerous like enclosures br br br Aquarium br br An aquarium aqua water is a water filled enclosure housing aquatic plants and or animals such as fish A bioactive aquarium would additionally house micro organisms such as beneficial bacteria and janitor animal species such as caridean shrimp boxer shrimp algae eating snails and burrowing snails At least one side of an aquarium is glazed to allow viewing of the aquatic habitat from the side as though viewing from underwater Aquaria are further subcategorized by temperature cold water tropical and salinity freshwater brackish marine br A Dutch aquarium origin Netherlands is an underwater garden that features plants with minimal visible hardscaping and few fish It is terraced or the back wall is lined in moss to prevent view through the rear of the aquarium br br br Terrarium br br A terrarium terra land is an enclosure for a land habitat for animals plants fungi lichens or any combination thereof A bioactive terrarium would additionally house soil microorganisms and janitor animal species such as springtails and terrestrial isopods It is distinct from a pot plant or animal cage by being enclosed to an extent to permit maintenance of temperature and humidity levels different from the ambient environment Terraria are further subcategorized by biome tropical temperate desert rainforest grassland etc A terrarium may feature a horizontal land surface an escarpment steep slope or cliff or a fossorial underground section br A Wardian case is a th century sealed terrarium used for transport or display of plants or small animals such as moths under conditions where ventilation was more harmful than beneficial such as where ambient conditions were too saline dry or polluted to support delicate species br A bottle garden is a small sealed glazed terrarium an actual glass bottle or otherwise in which all water and nutrients that will be required for future growth of the plant s and soil microorganisms are sealed into the vessel at the time of planting the only required care being management of light and temperature br A sandwich style terrarium is a terrarium or a section of a terrarium where soil other firm substrate or a tree cookie cross section or disc is enclosed in a narrow space between two sheets of glass or two nested jars for observation of fossorial or woodboring animals such as earthworms ants or termites br A glirarium glires dormice plural of glis is an enclosure for housing trapped edible dormice as they fatten in preparation for hibernation br br br Semi aquatic vivarium br br A semi aquatic vivarium is an enclosure for species that live partially submerged or alternate between immersion in water and air Examples include br br A paludarium palus marsh or swamp is a semi aquatic enclosure with aerial space above and water below designed to house semi aquatic plants that are rooted underwater but whose crowns reach above the surface of the water or animals that do the same such as the mata mata In addition to semi aquatic plants a paludarium may house animals such as shallow water fish and treefrogs The land area of a paludarium is absent or insignificant but the term paludarium is often misused to refer to a riparium br A riparium ripa bank or shore is a semi aquatic enclosure with a land area beside a water area Though often used for semi aquatic animals such as newts or turtles that alternate between time in the water and on land a riparium can simply be an aquarium terrarium combination set together for visual effect or to use the water area as means to help increase the humidity for terrestrial species br An oceanarium is a semi aquatic marine saltwater habitat with aerial space above the water for animals such as dolphins which emerge wholly or partially above the ocean surface and or a land area beside the water to accommodate semi aquatic species such as seals or penguins that emerge from the water to rest on land An oceanarium can also house fully aquatic marine animals such as sharks and rays where the aerial space above the tank is designed only to accommodate the observer A dolphinarium is an oceanarium for dolphins a penguinarium is an oceanarium for penguins br br br Pond br br A natural excavated or elevated pond is a vivarium if it is sealed from other waterbodies and managed such as by filtration aeration or additions of animals or plants br A water garden is an ornamental pond and its shore that features plants growing in and around the water but may also house animals such as goldfish turtles or mandarin ducks br A fish pond is a controlled pond artificial lake or reservoir that is stocked with fish br A koi pond is a pond used for keeping American koi or Japanese nishikigoi br br br Aviary br An aviary avis bird is a large enclosure for birds or other flying gliding or swinging arboreal animals such as butterflies bats flying squirrels or primates An aviary accommodates the birds in flight turning radius whereas a flight cage restricts the bird to linear flight Planted aviaries often have a very high ratio of plants to birds as many bird species will completely defoliate sparse plantings br br br Other br A nocturnal house nocturnus night adj is a windowless building or room for housing nocturnal or crepuscular animals or nyctinastic plants Artificial lighting is staggered to the local natural daylight so that the inhabitants experience a natural hour cycle but their activity is scheduled at a time that is convenient for observers br A greenhouse is an enclosure for plants with a glazed roof and wall s that allow the plants to make use of natural sunlight br A conservatory is a room of a house or of another building with a glazed roof and wall s that combines growing space for plants with a sitting room or dining area for people Some conservatories also house animals such as koi tortoises or free flying birds br An arboretum arbor tree is a greenhouse conservatory or outdoor place where many varieties of trees or shrubs are grown br Some animal vivaria are not well described by their name as related animal species can require vastly different habitats br br A herpetarium herpeton reptile creeping thing is an enclosure housing amphibians or reptiles A serpentarium is a herpetarium for snakes br An insectarium is an enclosure for housing insects When used to refer to a facility it often refers to a facility that houses both insects and other invertebrates A formicarium formica ant or ant farm is an enclosure housing ants br br br Size and materials br br A vivarium is usually made from clear container often plastic or glass Unless it is an aquarium it does not need to withstand the pressure of water so it can also be made out of wood or metal with at least one transparent side Modern vivariums can be as simple as a bottle see bottle garden and are sometimes constructed from epoxy coated plywood and fitted with sliding glass doors Coating the inside of a plywood vivarium helps to retain the natural effect of the environment Epoxy coated plywood vivariums retain heat better than glass or plastic enclosures and are able to withstand high degrees of humidity They may be cubical spherical cuboidal or other shapes The choice of materials depends on the desired size and weight of the entire ensemble resistance to high humidity the cost and the desired quality br The floor of a vivarium must have sufficient surface area for the species living inside The height can also be important for the larger plants climbing plants or for tree climbing animal species The width must be great enough to create the sensation of depth both for the pleasure of the spectator and the good of the species inside br The most commonly used substrates are common soil small pebbles sand peat chips of various trees wood mulch vegetable fibres of coconut for example or a combination of these The choice of the substrate depends on the needs of the plants or of the animals moisture the risks involved and aesthetic aspects Sterile vivariums sometimes used to ensure high levels of hygiene especially during quarantine periods generally have very straightforward easily removable substrates such as paper tissue wood chips and even newspaper Typically a low nutrient high drainage substrate is placed on top of a false bottom or layer of expanded clay aggregate or stones which retains humidity without saturating the substrate surface br br br Environmental controls br br br Lighting br A lighting system is necessary always adapted to the requirements of the animal and plant species For example certain reptiles in their natural environment need to heat themselves by the sun so various bulbs may be necessary to simulate this in a terrarium br Also certain plants or diurnal animals need a source of UV to help synthesize Vitamin D and assimilate calcium Such UV can be provided by specialized fluorescent tubes or daylight bulbs which recreate the reptiles natural environment and emit a more natural sunlight effect compared to the blue glow of a fluorescent tube br A day night regulator might be needed to simulate with accuracy the alternation of light and dark periods The duration of the simulated day and night depends on the conditions in the natural habitat of the species and the season desired br br br Temperature br The temperature can be a very important parameter for species that cannot adapt to other conditions than those found in their natural habitat br Heating can be provided by several means all of which are usually controlled by a thermostat br heating lamps or infrared lamps br hot plates and heat mats providing heat at the base or sides of a terrarium br heating cords or heat mats placed beneath the substrate br heat rocks or br more complex equipment generating or producing hot air to the inside of the vivarium br Similar to lighting a decrease in temperature might be needed for the simulated night periods thus keeping living species healthy Such variation need to be coherent to those found in the natural habitats of the species Thermo control systems are often used to regulate light cycles and heating as well as humidity coupled to built in misting or rain systems Light dependent resistors or photo diodes connected to the lighting are frequently used to simulate daytime evening and nighttime light cycles as well as timers to switch lighting and heating on and off when necessary br br br Humidity br Many plants and animals have quite limited tolerance to the variation of moisture br The regulation of humidity can be done by several means br regular water pulverization br water evaporation inside from a basin or circulation of water or br automated pulverization systems and humidifiers br br br Ventilation and openings br Access inside the vivarium is required for the purpose of maintenance to take care of the plants and animals or for the addition and withdrawal of food br In the case of some animals a frontal opening is preferable because accessing a vivarium from the top is associated by some species with the presence of predators and can therefore cause unnecessary stress br Ventilation is not just important for circulating air but also for preventing the growth of mold and development and spread of harmful bacteria This is especially important in warm humid vivariums The traditional method consists of placing a suction fan or ventilation slits at a low level and another exhaust fan at a higher level which allows the continual circulation of fresh air br br br Gallery
