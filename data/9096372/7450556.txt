exclusively online with journals additionally published in print br As of researchers at McGill and Stanford University examined the impact of review articles using a corpus of individual review papers published in past and current Annual Reviews journal titles in the biological physical and social sciences The authors noted that Annual Review articles often focus on emerging fields that may be undergoing structural transformations Examining impact on scholarly discourse they concluded that formal invited Annual Review articles provide a distinctly authoritative source By identifying distinct clusters of work and articles that bridge such clusters review articles can integrate a topic Research suggests that they can shift discourse in a manner that simultaneously simplifies and collapses a knowledge community helping to define and organize emergent research areas br br br Subscribe to Open publishing model br br In the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation awarded six grants for examining the potential for open science and open access as part of an initiative for Increasing Openness and Transparency in Research One of the awardees was Annual Reviews which was interested in finding ways to remove barriers to access to scientific publications Annual Reviews used the grant to release the Annual Review of Public Health under an open access license in April and tracked the impact of the change in licensing br By May usage of the journal had increased eight fold relative to to about downloads monthly For comparison the titles for clinical psychology and medicine that maintained gated access showed no change in usage In addition the audience for the journal increased from institutions in countries to institutions in countries br Annual Reviews has continued to explore the possibilities of open access by developing the Subscribe to Open S O publishing model Subscribe to Open is an example of an assurance contract In the S O pilot for subscribing institutions were asked to maintain their existing subscriptions to the offered journals less a discount on the understanding that if enough subscriptions were received the final content for the journals would be published as open access If enough subscriptions were not received the content would remain paywalled In this way S O appealed to the individual subscriber s economic self interest receiving a discount instead of paying full price and avoided reliance on collective behavior or altruism The approach allowed participating publishers to convert content from gated to open access on a year to year basis br As of September the pilot program for S O included two publishers Annual Reviews and Berghahn Books both of whom opened part of their content Annual Reviews offered five titles in the S O pilot the Annual Review of Cancer Biology the Annual Review of Environment and Resources the Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science the Annual Review of Political Science and the Annual Review of Public Health All were published as open access through the Subscribe to Open approach br Additional publishers have since adopted S O which is seen as benefiting libraries researchers and publishers alike In a survey commissioned by the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers to determine how publishers aligned with Plan S authors Alicia Wise and Lorraine Estelle called Subscribe to Open the most promising transformative agreement for publishers as it offers a predictable revenue stream br In April the publisher announced that new content from all of its academic journals would progressively be made openly available over the course of eighteen months under the S O framework provided that current subscription support is maintained br br br Availability
