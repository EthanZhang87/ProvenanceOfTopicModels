title: Biodiversity
id: 45086
Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variety and variability of life on Earth It can be measured on various levels There is for example genetic variability species diversity ecosystem diversity and phylogenetic diversity Diversity is not distributed evenly on Earth It is greater in the tropics as a result of the warm climate and high primary productivity in the region near the equator Tropical forest ecosystems cover less than one fifth of Earth s terrestrial area and contain about of the world s species There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity for both marine and terrestrial taxa br Since life began on Earth six major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity The Phanerozoic aeon the last million years marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the Cambrian explosion In this period the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared The next million years included repeated massive biodiversity losses Those events have been classified as mass extinction events In the Carboniferous rainforest collapse may have led to a great loss of plant and animal life The Permian Triassic extinction event million years ago was the worst vertebrate recovery took million years br Human activities have lead to an ongoing biodiversity loss and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity This process is often referred to as Holocene extinction or sixth mass extinction For example it was estimated in that up to of all species will be extinct by Destroying habitats for farming is a key reason why biodiversity is decreasing today Climate change also plays a role This can be seen for example in the effects of climate change on biomes This anthropogenic extinction may have started toward the end of the Pleistocene as some studies suggest that the megafaunal extinction event that took place around the end of the last ice age partly resulted from overhunting br br br History of the term br br The term biological diversity was used first by J Arthur Harris in The Variable Desert Scientific American The bare statement that the region contains a flora rich in genera and species and of diverse geographic origin or affinity is entirely inadequate as a description of its real biological diversity br Raymond F Dasmann used the term biological diversity in reference to the richness of living nature that conservationists should protect in his book A Different Kind of Country br The term natural diversity was introduced by John Terborgh br Thomas Lovejoy introduced the term biological diversity to the scientific community in a book It rapidly became commonly used br According to Edward O Wilson the contracted form biodiversity was coined by W G Rosen The National Forum on BioDiversity was conceived by Walter G Rosen Dr Rosen represented the NRC NAS throughout the planning stages of the project Furthermore he introduced the term biodiversity br The term biodiversity appears in the article A New Plan to Conserve the Earth s Biota by Laura Tangley br The term biodiversity first appeared in publication br to Present The United Nations Environment Programme UNEP Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in began working in November leading to the publication of the draft Convention on Biological Diversity in May Since this time there have been Conferences of the Parties COPs to discuss potential global political responses to biodiversity loss Most recently COP in Montreal Canada in br br br Definitions br Biologists most often define biodiversity as the totality of genes species and ecosystems of a region An advantage of this definition is that it presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified br br taxonomic diversity usually measured at the species diversity level br ecological diversity often viewed from the perspective of ecosystem diversity br morphological diversity which stems from genetic diversity and molecular diversity br functional diversity which is a measure of the number of functionally disparate species within a population e g different feeding mechanism different motility predator vs prey etc br Biodiversity is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms species diversity and species richness However there is no concrete definition for biodiversity as its definition continues to be defined Other definitions include in chronological order br br An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A Wilcox commissioned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources IUCN for the World National Parks Conference Wilcox s definition was Biological diversity is the variety of life forms at all levels of biological systems i e molecular organismic population species and ecosystem br A publication by Wilcox in Biodiversity can be defined genetically as the diversity of alleles genes and organisms They study processes such as mutation and gene transfer that drive evolution br The United Nations Earth Summit defined biological diversity as the variability among living organisms from all sources including inter alia terrestrial marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part this includes diversity within species between species and of ecosystems This definition is used in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity br Gaston and Spicer s definition in their book Biodiversity an introduction in is variation of life at all levels of biological organization br The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations FAO defined biodiversity in as the variability that exists among living organisms both within and between species and the ecosystems of which they are part br br br Number of species br br According to Mora and her colleagues estimation there are approximately million terrestrial species and million oceanic species The authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryote diversity Other estimates include br br vascular plants estimated using the species area relation method br million marine species br million insects of some million we know today br million bacteria br million fungi estimates based on data from the tropics long term non tropical sites and molecular studies that have revealed cryptic speciation Some million species of fungi had been documented by br million mites br The number of microbial species is not reliably known but the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition dramatically increased the estimates of genetic diversity by identifying an enormous number of new genes from near surface plankton samples at various marine locations initially over the period The findings may eventually cause a significant change in the way science defines species and other taxonomic categories br Since the rate of extinction has increased many extant species may become extinct before they are described Not surprisingly in the animalia the most studied groups are birds and mammals whereas fishes and arthropods are the least studied animals groups br br br Current biodiversity loss br br During the last century decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed It was estimated in that up to of all species will be extinct by Of these about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction Estimates reach as high as species per year based on Species area theory This figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices because few species emerge each year The rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates and expected to still grow in the upcoming years As of some studies suggest that of all mammal species could be extinct in years br In absolute terms the planet has lost of its biodiversity since according to a study by the World Wildlife Fund The Living Planet Report claims that the number of mammals birds reptiles amphibians and fish across the globe is on average about half the size it was years ago Of that number accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone for the marine wildlife gone and for the freshwater wildlife gone Biodiversity took the biggest hit in Latin America plummeting percent High income countries showed a increase in biodiversity which was canceled out by a loss in low income countries This is despite the fact that high income countries use five times the ecological resources of low income countries which was explained as a result of a process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses br A study published in PLOS One found that the biomass of insect life in Germany had declined by three quarters in the last years Dave Goulson of Sussex University stated that their study suggested that humans appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse br In the World Wildlife Foundation published a report saying that biodiversity is being destroyed at a rate unprecedented in human history The report claims that of the population of the examined species were destroyed in the years br Of monitored species around are experiencing population declines from human activity in whereas only have increasing populations br br Rates of decline in biodiversity in the current sixth mass extinction match or exceed rates of loss in the five previous mass extinction events in the fossil record Biodiversity loss is in fact one of the most critical manifestations of the Anthropocene since around the s the continued decline of biodiversity constitutes an unprecedented threat to the continued existence of human civilization The reduction is caused primarily by human impacts particularly habitat destruction br Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services Species today are being wiped out at a rate to times higher than baseline and the rate of extinctions is increasing This process destroys the resilience and adaptability of life on Earth br In many species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened moreover scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized About percent of the species assessed using the IUCN Red List criteria are now listed as threatened with extinction a total of As of late species were considered part of the IUCN s critically endangered br Numerous scientists and the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services assert that human population growth and overconsumption are the primary factors in this decline However other scientists have criticized this finding and say that loss of habitat caused by the growth of commodities for export is the main driver br Some studies have however pointed out that habitat destruction for the expansion of agriculture and the overexploitation of wildlife are the more significant drivers of contemporary biodiversity loss not climate change br br br Distribution br br Biodiversity is not evenly distributed rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions and seasons Among other factors the diversity of all living things biota depends on temperature precipitation altitude soils geography and the interactions between other species The study of the spatial distribution of organisms species and ecosystems is the science of biogeography br Diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized regions such as the Cape Floristic Region and lower in polar regions generally Rain forests that have had wet climates for a long time such as Yasun National Park in Ecuador have particularly high biodiversity br There is local biodiversity which directly impacts daily life affecting the availability of fresh water food choices and fuel sources for humans Regional biodiversity includes habitats and ecosystems that synergizes and either overlaps or differs on a regional scale National biodiversity within a country determines the ability for a country to thrive according to its habitats and ecosystems on a national scale Also within a country endangered species are initially supported on a national level then internationally Ecotourism may be utilized to support the economy and encourages tourists to continue to visit and support species and ecosystems they visit while they enjoy the available amenities provided International biodiversity impacts global livelihood food systems and health Problematic pollution over consumption and climate change can devastate international biodiversity Nature based solutions are a critical tool for a global resolution Many species are in danger of becoming extinct and need world leaders to be proactive with the Kumming Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework br Terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to times greater than ocean biodiversity Forests harbour most of Earth s terrestrial biodiversity The conservation of the world s biodiversity is thus utterly dependent on the way in which we interact with and use the world s forests A new method used in put the total number of species on Earth at million of which million were estimated to live in the ocean However this estimate seems to under represent the diversity of microorganisms Forests provide habitats for percent of amphibian species percent of bird species and percent of mammal species About percent of all vascular plants are found in tropical forests Mangroves provide breeding grounds and nurseries for numerous species of fish and shellfish and help trap sediments that might otherwise adversely affect seagrass beds and coral reefs which are habitats for many more marine species Forests span around billion acres nearly a third of the Earth s land mass and are home to approximately of the world s biodiversity About billion hectares are covered by primary forests Over million hectares of the world s woods are officially protected br The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type geography climate and soils in addition to human use Most forest habitats in temperate regions support relatively few animal and plant species and species that tend to have large geographical distributions while the montane forests of Africa South America and Southeast Asia and lowland forests of Australia coastal Brazil the Caribbean islands Central America and insular Southeast Asia have many species with small geographical distributions Areas with dense human populations and intense agricultural land use such as Europe parts of Bangladesh China India and North America are less intact in terms of their biodiversity Northern Africa southern Australia coastal Brazil Madagascar and South Africa are also identified as areas with striking losses in biodiversity intactness European forests in EU and non EU nations comprise more than of Europe s land mass around million hectares representing an almost growth since br br br Latitudinal gradients br br Generally there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics Thus localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes This is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity Several ecological factors may contribute to the gradient but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that at the poles br Even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in aquatic ecosystems especially in marine ecosystems The latitudinal distribution of parasites does not appear to follow this rule Also in terrestrial ecosystems the soil bacterial diversity has been shown to be highest in temperate climatic zones and has been attributed to carbon inputs and habitat connectivity br In an alternative hypothesis the fractal biodiversity was proposed to explain the biodiversity latitudinal gradient In this study the species pool size and the fractal nature of ecosystems were combined to clarify some general patterns of this gradient This hypothesis considers temperature moisture and net primary production NPP as the main variables of an ecosystem niche and as the axis of the ecological hypervolume In this way it is possible to build fractal hyper volumes whose fractal dimension rises to three moving towards the equator br br br Biodiversity Hotspots br A biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that have experienced great habitat loss The term hotspot was introduced in by Norman Myers While hotspots are spread all over the world the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics br Brazil s Atlantic Forest is considered one such hotspot containing roughly plant species vertebrates and millions of insects about half of which occur nowhere else The island of Madagascar and India are also particularly notable Colombia is characterized by high biodiversity with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics species that are not found naturally anywhere else of any country About of the species of the Earth can be found in Colombia including over species of bird more than in Europe and North America combined Colombia has of the world s mammals species of the amphibian species and of the bird species of the world Madagascar dry deciduous forests and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio of endemism Since the island separated from mainland Africa million years ago many species and ecosystems have evolved independently Indonesia s islands cover square miles km and contain of the world s flowering plants of mammals and of reptiles amphibians and birds along with nearly million people Many regions of high biodiversity and or endemism arise from specialized habitats which require unusual adaptations for example alpine environments in high mountains or Northern European peat bogs br Accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult Selection bias amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity In Rev Gilbert White succinctly observed of his Selborne Hampshire all nature is so full that that district produces the most variety which is the most examined br br br Evolution over geologic timeframes br Biodiversity is the result of billion years of evolution The origin of life has not been established by science however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well established only a few hundred million years after the formation of the Earth Until approximately billion years ago all life consisted of microorganisms archaea bacteria and single celled protozoans and protists br br Biodiversity grew fast during the Phanerozoic the last million years especially during the so called Cambrian explosion a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared However recent studies suggest that this diversification had started earlier at least in the Ediacaran and that it continued in the Ordovician Over the next million years or so invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend This dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events A significant loss occurred in anamniotic limbed vertebrates when rainforests collapsed in the Carboniferous but amniotes seem to have been little affected by this event their diversification slowed down later around the Asselian Sakmarian boundary in the early Cisuralian Early Permian about Ma ago The worst was the Permian Triassic extinction event million years ago Vertebrates took million years to recover from this event The most recent major mass extinction event the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event occurred million years ago This period has attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs which were represented by many lineages at the end of the Maastrichtian just before that extinction event However many other taxa were affected by this crisis which affected even marine taxa such as ammonites which also became extinct around that time br The biodiversity of the past is called Paleobiodiversity The fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history However not all scientists support this view since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity million years ago whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life Estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from million to million with a best estimate of somewhere near million the vast majority arthropods Diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection br br br Diversification br The existence of a global carrying capacity limiting the amount of life that can live at once is debated as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species While records of life in the sea show a logistic pattern of growth life on land insects plants and tetrapods shows an exponential rise in diversity As one author states Tetrapods have not yet invaded percent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase exponentially until most or all of the available eco space is filled br It also appears that the diversity continues to increase over time especially after mass extinctions br On the other hand changes through the Phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model widely used in population biology demography and macrosociology as well as fossil biodiversity than with exponential and logistic models The latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first order positive feedback more ancestors more descendants and or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation Hyperbolic model implies a second order positive feedback Differences in the strength of the second order feedback due to different intensities of interspecific competition might explain the faster rediversification of ammonoids in comparison to bivalves after the end Permian extinction The hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth The hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity The similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics br Most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction named the Holocene extinction event caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment It has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet Earth within years br New species are regularly discovered on average between new species each year most of them insects and many though discovered are not yet classified estimates are that nearly of all arthropods are not yet classified Most of the terrestrial diversity is found in tropical forests and in general the land has more species than the ocean some million species may exist on Earth of which some million live in the ocean br br br Species diversity in geologic time frames br br It is estimated that to billion species have existed on the planet Assuming that there may be a maximum of about million species currently alive it stands to reason that greater than of the planet s species went extinct prior to the evolution of humans Estimates on the number of Earth s current species range from million to million of which about million have been documented and over have not yet been described However a May scientific report estimates that trillion species are currently on Earth with only one thousandth of one percent described The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at x and weighs billion tonnes In comparison the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as four trillion tons of carbon In July scientists reported identifying a set of genes from the last universal common ancestor LUCA of all organisms living on Earth br The age of Earth is about billion years The earliest undisputed evidence of life dates at least from billion years ago during the Eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten Hadean eon There are microbial mat fossils found in billion year old sandstone discovered in Western Australia Other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in billion year old meta sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland More recently in remains of biotic life were found in billion year old rocks in Western Australia According to one of the researchers If life arose relatively quickly on Earth then it could be common in the universe br br br Role and benefits of biodiversity br br br General ecosystem services br br From the perspective of the method known as Natural Economy the economic value of ecosystem services for Earth s biosphere calculated in has an estimated value of US trillion x per year br Ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity The natural species or biota are the caretakers of all ecosystems It is as if the natural world is an enormous bank account of capital assets capable of paying life sustaining dividends indefinitely but only if the capital is maintained br These services come in three flavors br br Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources e g food wood fresh water br Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change e g climate regulation pest disease control br Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment e g landscape aesthetics cultural heritage outdoor recreation and spiritual significance br There have been many claims about biodiversity s effect on these ecosystem services especially provisioning and regulating services After an exhaustive survey through peer reviewed literature to evaluate different claims about biodiversity s effect on ecosystem services of those claims have been validated demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported are incorrect and lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions br br br Services enhanced br Provisioning services br Greater species diversity br br of plants increases fodder yield synthesis of experimental studies br of plants i e diversity within a single species increases overall crop yield synthesis of experimental studies Although another review of experimental studies reports mixed evidence br of trees increases overall wood production Synthesis of experimental studies However there is not enough data to draw a conclusion about the effect of tree trait diversity on wood production br Regulating services br Greater species diversity br br of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield Synthesis of observational studies br of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations Data from two separate reviews Synthesis of experimental and observational studies Synthesis of observational studies Although another review of experimental studies found mixed support for this claim suggesting that in cases where mutual intraguild predation occurs a single predatory species is often more effective br of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants Synthesis of experimental studies br of plants increases resistance to plant invasion Data from two separate reviews Synthesis of experimental studies Synthesis of experimental studies br of plants increases carbon sequestration but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage see below Synthesis of experimental studies br plants increases soil nutrient remineralization Synthesis of experimental studies br of plants increases soil organic matter Synthesis of experimental studies br br br Services with mixed evidence br Provisioning services br None to date br Regulating services br Greater species diversity of plants may or may not decrease herbivorous pest populations Data from two separate reviews suggest that greater diversity decreases pest populations Synthesis of observational studies Synthesis of experimental studies One review found mixed evidence Synthesis of experimental studies while another found contrary evidence Synthesis of experimental studies br Greater species diversity of animals may or may not decrease disease prevalence on those animals Synthesis of experimental and observational studies although a study offers more support showing that biodiversity may in fact enhance disease resistance within animal communities at least in amphibian frog ponds Many more studies must be published in support of diversity to sway the balance of evidence will be such that we can draw a general rule on this service br Greater species and trait diversity of plants may or may not increase long term carbon storage Synthesis of observational studies br Greater pollinator diversity may or may not increase pollination Synthesis of observational studies but a publication from March suggests that increased native pollinator diversity enhances pollen deposition although not necessarily fruit set as the authors would have you believe for details explore their lengthy supplementary material br br br Services hindered br Provisioning services br Greater species diversity of plants reduces primary production Synthesis of experimental studies br Regulating services br greater genetic and species diversity of a number of organisms reduces freshwater purification Synthesis of experimental studies although an attempt by the authors to investigate the effect of detritivore diversity on freshwater purification was unsuccessful due to a lack of available evidence only observational study was found br Effect of species diversity of plants on biofuel yield In a survey of the literature the investigators only found studies br Effect of species diversity of fish on fishery yield In a survey of the literature the investigators only found experimental studies and observational study br Regulating services br Effect of species diversity on the stability of biofuel yield In a survey of the literature the investigators did not find any studies br Effect of species diversity of plants on the stability of fodder yield In a survey of the literature the investigators only found studies br Effect of species diversity of plants on the stability of crop yield In a survey of the literature the investigators only found study br Effect of genetic diversity of plants on the stability of crop yield In a survey of the literature the investigators only found studies br Effect of diversity on the stability of wood production In a survey of the literature the investigators could not find any studies br Effect of species diversity of multiple taxa on erosion control In a survey of the literature the investigators could not find any studies they did however find studies on the effect of species diversity and root biomass br Effect of diversity on flood regulation In a survey of the literature the investigators could not find any studies br Effect of species and trait diversity of plants on soil moisture In a survey of the literature the investigators only found studies br Other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in Robert Costanza and his colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services not captured in traditional markets at an average of trillion annually br Since the Stone Age species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate driven by human activity Estimates of species losses are at a rate times as fast as is typical in the fossil record Biodiversity also affords many non material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values knowledge systems and education br br br Agriculture br br Agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories intraspecific diversity which includes the genetic variation within a single species like the potato Solanum tuberosum that is composed of many different forms and types e g in the U S they might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes all different but all part of the same species S tuberosum br The other category of agricultural diversity is called interspecific diversity and refers to the number and types of different species Thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots peppers lettuce etc br Agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is planned diversity or associated diversity This is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity Planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged planted or raised e g crops covers symbionts and livestock among others which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops uninvited e g herbivores weed species and pathogens among others br Associated biodiversity can be damaging or beneficial The beneficial associated biodiversity include for instance wild pollinators such as wild bees and syrphid flies that pollinate crops and natural enemies and antagonists to pests and pathogens Beneficial associated biodiversity occurs abundantly in crop fields and provide multiple ecosystem services such as pest control nutrient cycling and pollination that support crop production br The control of damaging associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face On monoculture farms the approach is generally to suppress damaging associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive pesticides mechanized tools and transgenic engineering techniques then to rotate crops Although some polyculture farmers use the same techniques they also employ integrated pest management strategies as well as more labor intensive strategies but generally less dependent on capital biotechnology and energy br Interspecific crop diversity is in part responsible for offering variety in what we eat Intraspecific diversity the variety of alleles within a single species also offers us a choice in our diets If a crop fails in a monoculture we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new If a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year relying on intraspecific diversity We may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether relying on interspecific diversity Even an agricultural society that primarily grows monocultures relies on biodiversity at some point br br The Irish potato blight of was a major factor in the deaths of one million people and the emigration of about two million It was the result of planting only two potato varieties both vulnerable to the blight Phytophthora infestans which arrived in br When rice grassy stunt virus struck rice fields from Indonesia to India in the s varieties were tested for resistance Only one was resistant an Indian variety and known to science only since This variety formed a hybrid with other varieties and is now widely grown br Coffee rust attacked coffee plantations in Sri Lanka Brazil and Central America in A resistant variety was found in Ethiopia The diseases are themselves a form of biodiversity br Monoculture was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters including the European wine industry collapse in the late th century and the US southern corn leaf blight epidemic of br Although about percent of humans food supply comes from just kinds of plants humans use at least species Earth s surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential br br br Human health br br Biodiversity s relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity e g changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors scarcity of fresh water impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission such as that of West Nile Virus Lyme disease and Hantavirus according to a study done co authored by Felicia Keesing an ecologist at Bard College and Drew Harvell associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future ACSF at Cornell University br The growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health Partly the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting the preservation of water resources While the distribution of clean water increases in some parts of the world it remains unequal According to the World Health Organisation only of the global population used a safely managed drinking water service br Some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security infectious disease medical science and medicinal resources social and psychological health Biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post disaster relief and recovery efforts br According to the United Nations Environment Programme a pathogen like a virus have more chances to meet resistance in a diverse population Therefore in a population genetically similar it expands more easily For example the COVID pandemic had less chances to occur in a world with higher biodiversity A broad literature review published in by Nature journal Impacts of biodiversity on the emergence and transmission of infectious disease found this to be broadly true within real environments Although some small population exceptions were found to exist on average a collapse in biodiversity significantly increased the spread spillover of infectious diseases br Biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources A significant proportion of drugs are derived directly or indirectly from biological sources at least of the pharmaceutical compounds on the US market are derived from plants animals and microorganisms while about of the world population depends on medicines from nature used in either modern or traditional medical practice for primary healthcare Only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential Biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics Evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration bioprospecting in favour of genomics and synthetic chemistry indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development meanwhile natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation Marine ecosystems are particularly important although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken br br br Business and industry br br Many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources These include building materials fibers dyes rubber and oil Biodiversity is also important to the security of resources such as water timber paper fiber and food As a result biodiversity loss is a significant risk factor in business development and a threat to long term economic sustainability Many logging companies do not abide by the rules and legislation established by their respective governments likewise governments of timer producing countries also fail in enforcing their own forestry legislations br br br Leisure cultural and aesthetic value br Biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as birdwatching or natural history study br Popular activities such as gardening and fishkeeping strongly depend on biodiversity The number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands though the majority do not enter commerce br The relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors suppliers breeders propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood The general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms reflecting their inherent value br Philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to mankind in and of itself This idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that tropical forests and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide br br br Ecological services br br Biodiversity supports many ecosystem services br br There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources produce biomass decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time br It plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our atmosphere and water supply Biodiversity is directly involved in water purification recycling nutrients and providing fertile soils Experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs for example insect pollination cannot be mimicked though there have been attempts to create artificial pollinators using unmanned aerial vehicles The economic activity of pollination alone represented between billion in br br br Measuring biodiversity br br br Analytical limits br Less than of all species that have been described have been studied beyond noting their existence The vast majority of Earth s species are microbial Contemporary biodiversity physics is firmly fixated on the visible macroscopic world For example microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life see e g extremophile On the tree of life based on analyses of small subunit ribosomal RNA visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs The inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder to a first approximation all multicellular species on Earth are insects Insect extinction rates are high supporting the Holocene extinction hypothesis br br br Biodiversity changes other than losses br br br Natural seasonal variations br Biodiversity naturally varies due to seasonal shifts Spring s arrival enhances biodiversity as numerous species breed and feed while winter s onset temporarily reduces it as some insects perish and migrating animals leave Additionally the seasonal fluctuation in plant and invertebrate populations influences biodiversity br br br Introduced and invasive species br br Barriers such as large rivers seas oceans mountains and deserts encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier via the process of allopatric speciation The term invasive species is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained Without barriers such species occupy new territory often supplanting native species by occupying their niches or by using resources that would normally sustain native species br The number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the s Species are increasingly being moved by humans on purpose and accidentally In some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats e g zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the Great Lakes region and the lion fish along the North American Atlantic coast Some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance Others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals An important question is do invasive species cause extinctions Many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives but not extinctions Invasive species seem to increase local i e alpha diversity diversity which decreases turnover of diversity i e beta diversity Overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes but even some of the most insidious invaders e g Dutch elm disease emerald ash borer chestnut blight in North America have not caused their host species to become extinct Extirpation population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common Human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers by introducing them for food and other purposes Human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas and thus become invasive occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range br Not all introduced species are invasive nor all invasive species deliberately introduced In cases such as the zebra mussel invasion of US waterways was unintentional In other cases such as mongooses in Hawaii the introduction is deliberate but ineffective nocturnal rats were not vulnerable to the diurnal mongoose In other cases such as oil palms in Indonesia and Malaysia the introduction produces substantial economic benefits but the benefits are accompanied by costly unintended consequences br Finally an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces In Belgium Prunus spinosa from Eastern Europe leafs much sooner than its West European counterparts disrupting the feeding habits of the Thecla betulae butterfly which feeds on the leaves Introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive The exotic organisms may be predators parasites or may outcompete indigenous species for nutrients water and light br At present several countries have already imported so many exotic species particularly agricultural and ornamental plants that their indigenous fauna flora may be outnumbered For example the introduction of kudzu from Southeast Asia to Canada and the United States has threatened biodiversity in certain areas Another example are pines which have invaded forests shrublands and grasslands in the southern hemisphere br br br Hybridization and genetic pollution br Endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution i e uncontrolled hybridization introgression and genetic swamping Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and or fitness advantage of an introduced species br Hybridization and introgression are side effects of introduction and invasion These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species swamping its gene pool This problem is not always apparent from morphological outward appearance observations alone Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved However hybridization with or without introgression may nevertheless threaten a rare species existence br In agriculture and animal husbandry the Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield Often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases Local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization Formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution This has resulted in the loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole br Genetically modified organisms contain genetic material that is altered through genetic engineering Genetically modified crops have become a common source for genetic pollution in not only wild varieties but also in domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization br Genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique genotypes threatening future access to food security A decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate br br br Conservation br br Conservation biology matured in the mid th century as ecologists naturalists and other scientists began to research and address issues pertaining to global biodiversity declines br The conservation ethic advocates management of natural resources for the purpose of sustaining biodiversity in species ecosystems the evolutionary process and human culture and society br Conservation biology is reforming around strategic plans to protect biodiversity Preserving global biodiversity is a priority in strategic conservation plans that are designed to engage public policy and concerns affecting local regional and global scales of communities ecosystems and cultures Action plans identify ways of sustaining human well being employing natural capital market capital and ecosystem services br In the EU Directive EC zoos are described as having a role in the preservation of the biodiversity of wildlife animals by conducting research or participation in breeding programs br br br Protection and restoration techniques br Removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches Exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically e g with Digital Automated Identification SYstem DAISY using the barcode of life Removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost br As sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured missing species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the Encyclopedia of Life and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility br br Biodiversity banking places a monetary value on biodiversity One example is the Australian Native Vegetation Management Framework br Gene banks are collections of specimens and genetic material Some banks intend to reintroduce banked species to the ecosystem e g via tree nurseries br Reduction and better targeting of pesticides allows more species to survive in agricultural and urbanized areas br Location specific approaches may be less useful for protecting migratory species One approach is to create wildlife corridors that correspond to the animals movements National and other boundaries can complicate corridor creation br br br Priorities for resource allocation br Focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity br A second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity which typically require little or no restoration These are typically non urbanized non agricultural areas Tropical areas often fit both criteria given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development br br br Protected areas br br Protected areas including forest reserves and biosphere reserves serve many functions including for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat Protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals Some scientists have called on the global community to designate as protected areas of percent of the planet by and percent by in order to mitigate biodiversity loss from anthropogenic causes The target of protecting of the area of the planet by the year by was adopted by almost countries in the United Nations Biodiversity Conference At the moment of adoption December of land territory and of ocean territory were protected In a study published September in Science Advances researchers mapped out regions that can help meet critical conservation and climate goals br br Protected areas safeguard nature and cultural resources and contribute to livelihoods particularly at local level There are over designated protected areas worldwide equivalent to percent of the earth s land surface varying in their extension level of protection and type of management IUCN Forest protected areas are a subset of all protected areas in which a significant portion of the area is forest This may be the whole or only a part of the protected area Globally percent of the world s forest area or more than million hectares fall within legally established protected areas such as national parks conservation areas and game reserves br The benefits of protected areas extend beyond their immediate environment and time In addition to conserving nature protected areas are crucial for securing the long term delivery of ecosystem services They provide numerous benefits including the conservation of genetic resources for food and agriculture the provision of medicine and health benefits the provision of water recreation and tourism and for acting as a buffer against disaster Increasingly there is acknowledgement of the wider socioeconomic values of these natural ecosystems and of the ecosystem services they can provide br Forest protected areas in particular play many important roles including as a provider of habitat shelter food and genetic materials and as a buffer against disaster They deliver stable supplies of many goods and environmental services The role of protected areas especially forest protected areas in mitigating and adapting to climate change has increasingly been recognized over the last few years Protected areas not only store and sequester carbon i e the global network of protected areas stores at least percent of terrestrial carbon but also enable species to adapt to changing climate patterns by providing refuges and migration corridors Protected areas also protect people from sudden climate events and reduce their vulnerability to weather induced problems such as floods and droughts UNEP WCMC br br br National parks br br A national park is a large natural or near natural area set aside to protect large scale ecological processes which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual scientific educational recreational and visitor opportunities These areas are selected by governments or private organizations to protect natural biodiversity along with its underlying ecological structure and supporting environmental processes and to promote education and recreation The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas WCPA has defined National Park as its Category II type of protected areas br National parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments In some cases a limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas Designated trails or roads are created The visitors are allowed to enter only for study cultural and recreation purposes Forestry operations grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated and the exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned br br br Wildlife sanctuary br Wildlife sanctuaries aim only at the conservation of species and have the following features br br The boundaries of the sanctuaries are not limited by state legislation br The killing hunting or capturing of any species is prohibited except by or under the control of the highest authority in the department which is responsible for the management of the sanctuary br Private ownership may be allowed br Forestry and other usages can also be permitted br br br Forest reserves br There is an estimated million ha of forest in protected areas worldwide Of the six major world regions South America has the highest share of forests in protected areas percent br The forests play a vital role in harboring more than floral and faunal species of which floral and faunal species are endemic In addition there are different tree species in the world Plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species In forest reserves rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products The unclassed forests cover percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics br br They are large inaccessible forests br Many of these are unoccupied br They are ecologically and economically less important br Approximately million hectares or of European forest land is protected for biodiversity and landscape protection Forests allocated for soil water and other ecosystem services encompass around million hectares of European forest area br br br Steps to conserve the forest cover br br An extensive reforestation afforestation programme should be followed br Alternative environment friendly sources of fuel energy such as biogas other than wood should be used br Loss of biodiversity due to forest fire is a major problem immediate steps to prevent forest fire need to be taken br Overgrazing by cattle can damage a forest seriously Therefore certain steps should be taken to prevent overgrazing by cattle br Hunting and poaching should be banned br br br Zoological parks br In zoological parks or zoos live animals are kept for public recreation education and conservation purposes Modern zoos offer veterinary facilities provide opportunities for threatened species to breed in captivity and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care Zoos play a major role in creating awareness about the need to conserve nature br br br Botanical gardens br In botanical gardens plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes They consist of a collection of living plants grown outdoors or under glass in greenhouses and conservatories Also a botanical garden may include a collection of dried plants or herbarium and such facilities as lecture rooms laboratories libraries museums and experimental or research plantings br br br Role of society br br br Transformative change br In a summary for policymakers of the largest most comprehensive study to date of biodiversity and ecosystem services the Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services was published by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES It stated that the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate To fix the problem humanity will need a transformative change including sustainable agriculture reductions in consumption and waste fishing quotas and collaborative water management br br br Citizen science br Citizen science also known as public participation in scientific research has been widely used in environmental sciences and is particularly popular in a biodiversity related context It has been used to enable scientists to involve the general public in biodiversity research thereby enabling the scientists to collect data that they would otherwise not have been able to obtain An online survey of CS participants across biodiversity citizen science projects in Europe Australia and New Zealand reported positive changes in a content process and nature of science knowledge b skills of science inquiry c self efficacy for science and the environment d interest in science and the environment e motivation for science and the environment and f behaviour towards the environment br Volunteer observers have made significant contributions to on the ground knowledge about biodiversity and recent improvements in technology have helped increase the flow and quality of occurrences from citizen sources A study published in Biological Conservation registers the massive contributions that citizen scientists already make to data mediated by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF Despite some limitations of the dataset level analysis it is clear that nearly half of all occurrence records shared through the GBIF network come from datasets with significant volunteer contributions Recording and sharing observations are enabled by several global scale platforms including iNaturalist and eBird br br br Legal status br br br International br United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity and Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety br UN BBNJ High Seas Treaty Intergovernmental conference on an international legally binding instrument under the UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction GA resolution br Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES br Ramsar Convention Wetlands br Bonn Convention on Migratory Species br UNESCO Convention concerning the Protection of the World s Cultural and Natural Heritage indirectly by protecting biodiversity habitats br UNESCO Global Geoparks br Regional Conventions such as the Apia Convention br Bilateral agreements such as the Japan Australia Migratory Bird Agreement br Global agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity give sovereign national rights over biological resources not property The agreements commit countries to conserve biodiversity develop resources for sustainability and share the benefits resulting from their use Biodiverse countries that allow bioprospecting or collection of natural products expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers exploits the resource to capture them privately Bioprospecting can become a type of biopiracy when such principles are not respected br Sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements ABAs The Convention on Biodiversity implies informed consent between the source country and the collector to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a fair agreement on benefit sharing br On the of December during the United Nations Biodiversity Conference every country on earth with the exception of the United States and the Holy See signed onto the agreement which includes protecting of land and oceans by by and other targets intended to reduce biodiversity loss The agreement includes also recovering of earth degraded ecosystems and increasing funding for biodiversity issues br br br European Union br In May the European Union published its Biodiversity Strategy for The biodiversity strategy is an essential part of the climate change mitigation strategy of the European Union From the of the European budget that will go to fight climate change large part will go to restore biodiversity and nature based solutions br The EU Biodiversity Strategy for include the next targets br br Protect of the sea territory and of the land territory especially Old growth forests br Plant billion trees by br Restore at least kilometers of rivers so they will become free flowing br Reduce the use of Pesticides by by br Increase Organic farming In linked EU program From Farm to Fork it is said that the target is making of EU agriculture organic by br Increase biodiversity in agriculture br Give billion per year to the issue and make it part of the business practice br Approximately half of the global GDP depend on nature In Europe many parts of the economy that generate trillions of euros per year depend on nature The benefits of Natura alone in Europe are billion per year br br br National level laws br Biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions br br The relationship between law and ecosystems is very ancient and has consequences for biodiversity It is related to private and public property rights It can define protection for threatened ecosystems but also some rights and duties for example fishing and hunting rights br Law regarding species is more recent It defines species that must be protected because they may be threatened by extinction The U S Endangered Species Act is an example of an attempt to address the law and species issue br Laws regarding gene pools are only about a century old Domestication and plant breeding methods are not new but advances in genetic engineering have led to tighter laws covering distribution of genetically modified organisms gene patents and process patents Governments struggle to decide whether to focus on for example genes genomes or organisms and species br Uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved however Bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals br India passed the Biological Diversity Act in for the conservation of biological diversity in India The Act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional
