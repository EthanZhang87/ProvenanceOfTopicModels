The Works Progress Administration WPA renamed in as the Work Projects Administration was an American New Deal agency that employed millions of jobseekers mostly men who were not formally educated to carry out public works projects including the construction of public buildings and roads It was set up on May by presidential order as a key part of the Second New Deal br The WPA s first appropriation in was billion about per person in the U S around percent of the GDP Headed by Harry Hopkins the WPA supplied paid jobs to the unemployed during the Great Depression in the United States while building up the public infrastructure of the US such as parks schools and roads Most of the jobs were in construction building more than miles km of streets and over bridges in addition to many airports and much housing In the WPA played a key role in both building and staffing internment camps to incarcerate Japanese Americans br At its peak in it supplied paid jobs for three million unemployed men and women as well as youth in a separate division the National Youth Administration Between and the WPA employed million people about half the population of New York Hourly wages were typically kept well below industry standards Full employment which was reached in and appeared as a long term national goal around was not the goal of the WPA rather it tried to supply one paid job for all families in which the breadwinner suffered long term unemployment br In one of its most famous projects Federal Project Number One the WPA employed musicians artists writers actors and directors in arts drama media and literacy projects The five projects dedicated to these were the Federal Writers Project FWP the Historical Records Survey HRS the Federal Theatre Project FTP the Federal Music Project FMP and the Federal Art Project FAP In the Historical Records Survey for instance many former slaves in the South were interviewed these documents are of immense importance to American history Theater and music groups toured throughout the United States and gave more than performances Archaeological investigations under the WPA were influential in the rediscovery of pre Columbian Native American cultures and the development of professional archaeology in the US br The WPA was a federal program that ran its own projects in cooperation with state and local governments which supplied of the costs Usually the local sponsor provided land and often trucks and supplies with the WPA responsible for wages and for the salaries of supervisors who were not on relief WPA sometimes took over state and local relief programs that had originated in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation RFC or Federal Emergency Relief Administration programs FERA It was liquidated on June because of low unemployment during World War II Robert D Leininger asserted millions of people needed subsistence incomes Work relief was preferred over public assistance the dole because it maintained self respect reinforced the work ethic and kept skills sharp br br br Establishment br br On May FDR issued executive order establishing the Works Progress Administration The WPA superseded the work of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration which was dissolved Direct relief assistance was permanently replaced by a national work relief program a major public works program directed by the WPA br The WPA was largely shaped by Harry Hopkins supervisor of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and close adviser to Roosevelt Both Roosevelt and Hopkins believed that the route to economic recovery and the lessened importance of the dole would be in employment programs such as the WPA Hallie Flanagan national director of the Federal Theatre Project wrote that for the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker and hence the preservation of his self respect became important br The WPA was organized into the following divisions br br The Division of Engineering and Construction which planned and supervised construction projects including airports dams highways and sanitation systems br The Division of Professional and Service Projects called the Division of Women s and Professional Projects in which was responsible for white collar projects including education programs recreation programs and the arts projects It was later named the Division of Community Service Programs and the Service Division br The Division of Finance br The Division of Information br The Division of Investigation which succeeded a comparable division at FERA and investigated fraud misappropriation of funds and disloyalty br The Division of Statistics also known as the Division of Social Research br The Project Control Division which processed project applications br Other divisions including the Employment Management Safety Supply and Training and Reemployment br br br Employment br br These ordinary men and women proved to be extraordinary beyond all expectation They were golden threads woven in the national fabric In this they shamed the political philosophy that discounted their value and rewarded the one that placed its faith in them thus fulfilling the founding vision of a government by and for its people All its people br The goal of the WPA was to employ most of the unemployed people on relief until the economy recovered Harry Hopkins testified to Congress in January why he set the number at million using Federal Emergency Relief Administration data Estimating costs at per worker per year in present day terms he asked for and received billion billion in present day terms Many women were employed but they were few compared to men br In there were million people on relief in the United States Of these million were children under years of age million were persons between the ages of and who were not working or seeking work These included housewives students in school and incapacitated persons Another were person age or over Thus of the total of million persons then receiving relief million were not considered eligible for employment This left a total of million presumably employable persons between the ages of and inclusive Of these however million were said to be farm operators or persons who had some non relief employment while another were despite the fact that they were already employed or seeking work considered incapacitated Deducting this million from the total of million there remained million persons age to unemployed looking for work and able to work br br Because of the assumption that only one worker per family would be permitted to work under the proposed program this total of million was further reduced by million the estimated number of workers who were members of families with two or more employable people Thus there remained a net total of million workers in as many households for whom jobs were to be provided br The WPA reached its peak employment of people in November To be eligible for WPA employment an individual had to be an American citizen or older able bodied unemployed and certified as in need by a local public relief agency approved by the WPA The WPA Division of Employment selected the worker s placement to WPA projects based on previous experience or training Worker pay was based on three factors the region of the country the degree of urbanization and the individual s skill It varied from per month to per month with the average wage being about in present day terms The goal was to pay the local prevailing wage but limit the hours of work to hours a day or hours a week the stated minimum being hours a week or hours a month br Being a voter or a Democrat was not a prerequisite for a relief job Federal law specifically prohibited any political discrimination against WPA workers Vague charges were bandied about at the time The consensus of experts is that In the distribution of WPA project jobs as opposed to those of a supervisory and administrative nature politics plays only a minor in comparatively insignificant role However those who were hired were reminded at election time that FDR created their job and the Republicans would take it away The great majority voted accordingly br br br Projects br br WPA projects were administered by the Division of Engineering and Construction and the Division of Professional and Service Projects Most projects were initiated planned and sponsored by states counties or cities Nationwide projects were sponsored until br The WPA built traditional infrastructure of the New Deal such as roads bridges schools libraries courthouses hospitals sidewalks waterworks and post offices but also constructed museums swimming pools parks community centers playgrounds coliseums markets fairgrounds tennis courts zoos botanical gardens auditoriums waterfronts city halls gyms and university unions Most of these are still in use today The amount of infrastructure projects of the WPA included new and improved buildings These new buildings included new schools new auditoriums gyms and recreational buildings new libraries new dormitories and new armories In addition infrastructure projects included stadiums grandstands and bleachers fairgrounds and rodeo grounds parks covering acres playgrounds athletic fields swimming pools handball courts tennis courts horseshoe pits ice skating areas outdoor theatres golf courses and ski jumps Total expenditures on WPA projects through June totaled approximately billion the equivalent of billion today Over billion was spent on highway road and street projects more than billion on public buildings including the iconic Dock Street Theatre in Charleston the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and Timberline Lodge in Oregon s Mount Hood National Forest br More than billion billion today was spent on publicly owned or operated utilities and another billion on welfare projects including sewing projects for women the distribution of surplus commodities and school lunch projects One construction project was the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut the bridges of which were each designed as architecturally unique In its eight year run the WPA built firehouses and renovated of them across the United States The miles of water mains installed by their hand as well contributed to increased fire protection across the country br The direct focus of the WPA projects changed with need In priority projects were to improve infrastructure roads extension of electricity to rural areas water conservation sanitation and flood control In as outlined in that year s Emergency Relief Appropriations Act public facilities became a focus parks and associated facilities public buildings utilities airports and transportation projects were funded The following year saw the introduction of agricultural improvements such as the production of marl fertilizer and the eradication of fungus pests As the Second World War approached and then eventually began WPA projects became increasingly defense related br One project of the WPA was funding state level library service demonstration projects to create new areas of library service to underserved populations and to extend rural service Another project was the Household Service Demonstration Project which trained women for domestic employment South Carolina had one of the larger statewide library service demonstration projects At the end of the project in South Carolina had twelve publicly funded county libraries one regional library and a funded state library agency br br br Federal Project Number One br A significant aspect of the Works Progress Administration was the Federal Project Number One which had five different parts the Federal Art Project the Federal Music Project the Federal Theatre Project the Federal Writers Project and the Historical Records Survey The government wanted to provide new federal cultural support instead of just providing direct grants to private institutions After only one year over artists and other talented workers had been employed through this project in the United States Cedric Larson stated that The impact made by the five major cultural projects of the WPA upon the national consciousness is probably greater in total than anyone readily realizes As channels of communication between the administration and the country at large both directly and indirectly the importance of these projects cannot be overestimated for they all carry a tremendous appeal to the eye the ear or the intellect or all three br br br Federal Art Project br br This project was directed by Holger Cahill and in employment peaked at over artists The Arts Service Division created illustrations and posters for the WPA writers musicians and theaters The Exhibition Division had public exhibitions of artwork from the WPA and artists from the Art Teaching Division were employed in settlement houses and community centers to give classes to an estimated children and adults They set up over art centers around the country that served an estimated eight million individuals br br br Federal Music Project br br Directed by Nikolai Sokoloff former principal conductor of the Cleveland Orchestra the Federal Music Project employed over musicians at its peak Its purpose was to create jobs for unemployed musicians It established new ensembles such as chamber groups orchestras choral units opera units concert bands military bands dance bands and theater orchestras They gave performances and programs to million people each week The Federal Music Project performed plays and dances as well as radio dramas In addition the Federal Music Project gave music classes to an estimated children and adults every week recorded folk music served as copyists arrangers and librarians to expand the availability of music and experimented in music therapy Sokoloff stated Music can serve no useful purpose unless it is heard but these totals on the listeners side are more eloquent than statistics as they show that in this country there is a great hunger and eagerness for music br br br Federal Theatre Project br br In Broadway alone had employed upwards of workers onstage and backstage in only still had jobs The Actors Dinner Club and the Actors Betterment Association were giving out free meals every day Every theatrical district in the country suffered as audiences dwindled The New Deal project was directed by playwright Hallie Flanagan and employed performers and staff at its peak They presented more than performances each month to almost one million people produced plays in the four years it was established and introduced new playwrights Many performers later became successful in Hollywood including Orson Welles John Houseman Burt Lancaster Joseph Cotten Canada Lee Will Geer Joseph Losey Virgil Thomson Nicholas Ray E G Marshall and Sidney Lumet The Federal Theatre Project was the first project to end it was terminated in June after Congress zeroed out the funding br br br Federal Writers Project br br This project was directed by Henry Alsberg and employed writers at its peak in By January more than major books and booklets had been published by the FWP Most famously the FWP created the American Guide Series which produced thorough guidebooks for every state that include descriptions of towns waterways historic sites oral histories photographs and artwork An association or group that put up the cost of publication sponsored each book the cost was anywhere from to In almost all cases the book sales were able to reimburse their sponsors Additionally another important part of this project was to record oral histories to create archives such as the Slave Narratives and collections of folklore These writers also participated in research and editorial services to other government agencies br br br Historical Records Survey br br This project was the smallest of Federal Project Number One and served to identify collect and conserve United States historical records It is one of the biggest bibliographical efforts and was directed by Luther H Evans At its peak this project employed more than workers br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Library Services Program br Before the Great Depression it was estimated that one third of the population in the United States did not have reasonable access to public library services Understanding the need not only to maintain existing facilities but to expand library services led to the establishment of the WPA s Library Projects With the onset of the Depression local governments facing declining revenues were unable to maintain social services including libraries This lack of revenue exacerbated problems of library access that were already widespread In only two states Massachusetts and Delaware provided their total population access to public libraries In many rural areas there were no libraries and where they did exist reading opportunities were minimal of the South s population did not have access to any public library Libraries that existed circulated one book per capita The early emphasis of these programs was on extending library services to rural populations by creating libraries in areas that lacked facilities The WPA library program also greatly augmented reader services in metropolitan and urban centers br By the WPA Library Services Project had established new libraries reading rooms in existing libraries and traveling libraries for sparsely settled areas Federal money for these projects could only be spent on worker wages therefore local municipalities would have to provide upkeep on properties and purchase equipment and materials At the local level WPA libraries relied on funding from county or city officials or funds raised by local community organizations such as women s clubs Due to limited funding many WPA libraries were little more than book distribution stations tables of materials under temporary tents a tenant home to which nearby readers came for their books a school superintendents home or a crossroads general store The public response to the WPA libraries was extremely positive For many the WPA had become the breadline of the spirit br At its height in there were people primarily women employed in library services programs while were employed in library services and were employed in bookbinding and repair br Because book repair was an activity that could be taught to unskilled workers and once trained could be conducted with little supervision repair and mending became the main activity of the WPA Library Project The basic rationale for this change was that the mending and repair projects saved public libraries and school libraries thousands of dollars in acquisition costs while employing needy women who were often heads of households br By the WPA Library Project now the Library Services Program began to shift its focus as the entire WPA began to move operations towards goals of national defense WPA Library Programs served those goals in two ways existing WPA libraries could distribute materials to the public on the nature of an imminent national defense emergency and the need for national defense preparation and the project could provide supplementary library services to military camps and defense impacted communities br By December the number of people employed in WPA library work was only In May of the following year all statewide Library Projects were reorganized as WPA War Information Services Programs By early the work of closing war information centers had begun The last week of service for remaining WPA library workers was March br While it is difficult to quantify the success or failure of WPA Library Projects relative to other WPA programs what is incontestable is the fact that the library projects provided much needed employment for mostly female workers recruited many to librarianship in at least semiprofessional jobs and retained librarians who may have left the profession for other work had employment not come through federal relief the WPA subsidized several new ventures in readership services such as the widespread use of bookmobiles and supervised reading rooms services that became permanent in post depression and postwar American libraries br In extending library services to people who lost their libraries or never had a library to begin with WPA Library Services Projects achieved phenomenal success made significant permanent gains and had a profound impact on library life in America br br br Incarceration of Japanese Americans in internment camps br br The WPA spent million on removal and internment between March and November slightly more than the million spent by the Army for that purpose during that period Jason Scott Smith observes that the eagerness of many WPA administrators to place their organization in the forefront of this wartime enterprise is striking The WPA was on the ground helping with removal and relocation even before the creation of the WRA On March Rex L Nicholson the WPA s regional director took charge of the Reception and Induction centers that controlled the first thirteen assembly centers Nicholson s old WPA associates played key roles in the administration of the camps br WPA veterans involved in internment included Clayton E Triggs the first manager of the Manzanar Relocation Center in California a facility that according to one insider was manned just about by the WPA Drawing on experiences derived from New Deal era road building he supervised the installation of such features as guard towers and spotlights Then Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins praised his successor as WPA administrator Howard O Hunter for the building of those camps for the War Department for the Japanese evacuees on the West Coast br br br African Americans br The share of Federal Emergency Relief Administration and WPA benefits for African Americans exceeded their proportion of the general population The FERA s first relief census reported that more than two million African Americans were on relief during early a proportion of the African American population that was nearly double the proportion of white Americans on relief This was during the period of Jim Crow and racial segregation in the South when black Americans were largely disenfranchised br By there were African Americans men women and children on relief almost percent of the African American population plus another African American adults were working on WPA projects Altogether during about percent of the nation s African American families were either on relief or were employed by the WPA br Civil rights leaders initially objected that African Americans were proportionally underrepresented African American leaders made such a claim with respect to WPA hires in New Jersey stating In spite of the fact that Blacks indubitably constitute more than percent of the State s unemployed they composed of those assigned to W P A jobs during Nationwide in of the population were African American br However by the perception of discrimination against African Americans had changed to the point that the NAACP magazine Opportunity hailed the WPA br br It is to the eternal credit of the administrative officers of the WPA that discrimination on various projects because of race has been kept to a minimum and that in almost every community Negroes have been given a chance to participate in the work program In the South as might have been expected this participation has been limited and differential wages on the basis of race have been more or less effectively established but in the northern communities particularly in the urban centers the Negro has been afforded his first real opportunity for employment in white collar occupations br The WPA mostly operated segregated units as did its youth affiliate the National Youth Administration Blacks were hired by the WPA as supervisors in the North however of WPA supervisors in the South only were black Historian Anthony Badger argues New Deal programs in the South routinely discriminated against blacks and perpetuated segregation br br br People with physical disabilities br The League of the Physically Handicapped in New York was organized in May to end discrimination by the WPA against the physically disabled unemployed The city s Home Relief Bureau coded applications by the physically disabled applicants as PH physically handicapped Thus they were not hired by the WPA In protest the League held two sit ins in The WPA relented and created jobs for physically disabled workers in New York City br br br Women br br About of the household heads on relief were women and youth programs were operated separately by the National Youth Administration The average worker was about years old about the same as the average family head on relief br WPA policies were consistent with the strong belief of the time that husbands and wives should not both be working because the second person working would take one job away from some other breadwinner A study of female workers in Philadelphia showed that were married but wives were reported as living with their husbands in only percent of the cases Only percent of the husbands had private employment Of the women all were responsible for one to five additional people in the household br In rural Missouri of the WPA employed women were without husbands were single widowed and divorced separated or deserted Thus only were married and living with their husbands but of the husbands were permanently disabled were temporarily disabled were too old to work and remaining were either unemployed or disabled Most of the women worked with sewing projects where they were taught to use sewing machines and made clothing and bedding as well as supplies for hospitals orphanages and adoption centers br One WPA funded project the Pack Horse Library Project mainly employed women to deliver books to rural areas in eastern Kentucky Many of the women employed by the project were the sole breadwinners for their families br br br Criticism br br The WPA had numerous critics The strongest attacks were that it was the prelude for a national political machine on behalf of Roosevelt Reformers secured the Hatch Act of that largely depoliticized the WPA br Others complained that far left elements played a major role especially in the New York City unit Representative J Parnell Thomas of the House Committee on Un American Activities claimed in that divisions of the WPA were a hotbed of Communists and one more link in the vast and unparalleled New Deal propaganda network br Much of the criticism of the distribution of projects and funding allotment is a result of the view that the decisions were politically motivated The South despite being the poorest region of the United States received less in federal relief and public works funds per capita than the West Critics would point to the fact that Roosevelt s Democrats could be sure of voting support from the South whereas the West was less of a sure thing swing states took priority over the other states br There was a perception that WPA employees were not diligent workers and that they had little incentive to give up their busy work in favor of productive jobs Some employers said that the WPA instilled poor work habits and encouraged inefficiency Some job applicants found that a WPA work history was viewed negatively by employers who said they had formed poor work habits br A Senate committee reported that To some extent the complaint that WPA workers do poor work is not without foundation Poor work habits and incorrect techniques are not remedied Occasionally a supervisor or a foreman demands good work The WPA and its workers were ridiculed as being lazy The organization s initials were said to stand for We Poke Along or We Putter Along or We Piddle Around or Whistle Piss and Argue These were sarcastic references to WPA projects that sometimes slowed down deliberately because foremen had an incentive to keep going rather than finish a project br The WPA s Division of Investigation proved so effective in preventing political corruption that a later congressional investigation couldn t find a single serious irregularity it had overlooked wrote economist Paul Krugman This dedication to honest government wasn t a sign of Roosevelt s personal virtue rather it reflected a political imperative FDR s mission in office was to show that government activism works To maintain that mission s credibility he needed to keep his administration s record clean And he did br Many complaints were recorded from private industry at the time that the existence of WPA works programs made hiring new workers difficult The WPA claimed to counter this by keeping hourly wages well below private wages and encouraging relief workers to actively seek private employment and accept job offers if they got them br br br Evolution br br On December after leading the WPA for three and a half years Harry Hopkins resigned and became the Secretary of Commerce To succeed him Roosevelt appointed Francis C Harrington a colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers and the WPA s chief engineer who had been leading the Division of Engineering and Construction br Following the passage of the Reorganization Act of in April the WPA was grouped with the Bureau of Public Roads Public Buildings Branch of the Procurement Division Branch of Buildings Management of the National Park Service United States Housing Authority and the Public Works Administration under the newly created Federal Works Agency Created at the same time the Federal Security Agency assumed the WPA s responsibility for the National Youth Administration The name of the Works Progress Administration has been changed to Work Projects Administration in order to make its title more descriptive of its major purpose President Roosevelt wrote when announcing the reorganization br As WPA projects became more subject to the state local sponsors were called on to provide of project costs As the number of public works projects slowly diminished more projects were dedicated to preparing for war Having languished since the end of World War I the American military services were depopulated and served by crumbling facilities when Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in the U S Army numbered only soldiers br br On May FDR delivered a fireside chat to the American people about the approaching storm and on June Harrington reprioritized WPA projects anticipating a major expansion of the U S military Types of WPA work to be expedited in every possible way to include in addition to airports and military airfields construction of housing and other facilities for enlarged military garrisons camp and cantonment construction and various improvements in navy yards Harrington said He observed that the WPA had already made substantial contributions to national defense over its five years of existence by building percent of the new airports in the U S and making million in improvements to military facilities He predicted there would be WPA workers on defense related projects over the next months at a cost of million The estimated number of WPA workers needed for defense projects was soon revised to between and Vocational training for war industries was also begun by the WPA with trainees in the program by October br Only the WPA having employed millions of relief workers for more than five years had a comprehensive awareness of the skills that would be available in a full scale national emergency wrote journalist Nick Taylor As the country began its preparedness buildup the WPA was uniquely positioned to become a major defense agency br Harrington died suddenly aged on September Notably apolitical he boasted that he had never voted he had deflected Congressional criticism of the WPA by bringing attention to its building accomplishments and its role as an employer Harrington s successor Howard O Hunter served as head of the WPA until May br br br Termination br Unemployment ended with war production for World War II as millions of men joined the services and cost plus contracts made it attractive for companies to hire unemployed men and train them br Concluding that a national relief program was no longer needed Roosevelt directed the Federal Works Administrator to end the WPA in a letter December Seven years ago I was convinced that providing useful work is superior to any and every kind of dole Experience had amply justified this policy FDR wrote br br By building airports schools highways and parks by making huge quantities of clothing for the unfortunate by serving millions of lunches to school children by almost immeasurable kinds and quantities of service the Work Projects Administration has reached a creative hand into every county in this Nation It has added to the national wealth has repaired the wastage of depression and has strengthened the country to bear the burden of war By employing eight millions of Americans with thirty millions of dependents it has brought to these people renewed hope and courage It has maintained and increased their working skills and it has enabled them once more to take their rightful places in public or in private employment br Roosevelt ordered a prompt end to WPA activities to conserve funds that had been appropriated Operations in most states ended February With no funds budgeted for the next fiscal year the WPA ceased to exist after June br br br Legacy br The agencies of the Franklin D Roosevelt administration had an enormous and largely unrecognized role in defining the public space we now use wrote sociologist Robert D Leighninger In a short period of ten years the Public Works Administration the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps built facilities in practically every community in the country Most are still providing service half a century later It is time we recognized this legacy and attempted to comprehend its relationship to our contemporary situation br br br br br br br br br br br br br
