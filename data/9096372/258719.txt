id: 258719
A puppy mill also known as a puppy farm is a commercial dog breeding facility characterized by quick breeding and poor conditions Although no standardized legal definition for puppy mill exists a definition was established in Avenson v Zegart in as a dog breeding operation in which the health of the mill s dogs is disregarded to maintain a low overhead and maximize profits They are cited as being a result of increased demand for household pets especially after World War II The Veterinary Medical Association of the Humane Society of the United States defines the main characteristics of a puppy mill as emphasis on quantity over quality indiscriminate breeding continuous confinement lack of human contact and environmental enrichment poor husbandry and minimal to no veterinary care br There are an estimated licensed and unlicensed puppy mills in the United States in total selling more than puppies annually br The term mill is also applied to operations involving other animals bred for profit including cats For profit breeding on a smaller scale may be referred to as backyard breeding although this term may also refer to unplanned or non commercial breeding Like mill it has negative connotations br The United States Department of Agriculture oversees regulations pertaining to the commercial dog industry The regulations are similar to those in the livestock industry br Puppy mills have been found to negatively affect dogs mental health as many develop psychological scars phobias fears and compulsive behaviors br br br Differences in breeding conditions br The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club both state that responsible breeders should raise their animals with the intent to produce healthy dogs and to ensure that all animals are provided with responsible homes and socialization However there is no way to enforce these wishes or records being kept to prove this is the case The socialization period in a puppy occurs between the ages of weeks and up to weeks of age This period is crucial for adult development as almost all adult abilities are learned during this stage With puppy mills essentially skipping the process of socialization the result is often social problems when the puppy matures to adulthood br Females in puppy mills are sometimes bred every time they are in heat regardless of whether they have physically recovered from the last litter Once a breeding female can no longer be bred whether from pure exhaustion or from age the female is usually killed Puppies are also often weaned from their mothers well before the recommended weeks of age br br br Conditions in puppy mills br The ASPCA states that some puppy mills can have up to dogs under one roof Because of the high volume of animals the mill runner will often resort to housing them in wire cages This results in the animals having poor locomotion Keeping dogs in wire kennels can lead to injury and damage to the dogs paws and legs It s also fairly common for these kennels to be stacked on top of each other in columns The conditions in these mills are so unsanitary that the animals are often coated in their own urine and feces causing mats in their fur Due to unsanitary conditions puppies from mills will often have internal parasites affecting their health Puppy mills are often unheated and this increases the number of deaths due to cold among the dogs used for breeding Conversely the mills can also be too hot in warmer weather leading to hyperthermia br Other common conditions in mills include malnutrition and untreated injuries br Due to the frequently poor breeding conditions in puppy mills puppies bred there often suffer from health and or social problems Puppy mill dogs are usually housed in a small wire cages similar to rabbit hutches and chicken coops Puppies raised in these cramped environments shared by many other dogs become poorly socialized to other dogs and to humans Dogs are then transported over long distances in poor conditions sometimes resulting in animal stress and death As the surviving mill dogs grow older they are more prone to developing respiratory ailments and pneumonia as well as hereditary defects such as hip dysplasia In addition mill dogs are more prone to having problems with their temperament due to lack of socialization enrichment and positive human contact Puppies from mills are usually sold as purebred dogs in an attempt to attract the higher prices associated with purebreds However due to the indiscriminate breeding practices of puppy mills the dog may not actually be a purebred puppy A high population of puppies from mills are inbred due to uncontrolled breeding The vast majority of puppy mill animals are sold to pet stores by dealers or brokers Some puppies are sold by dealers masquerading as authentic breeders br Puppy mills in the US often start with hundreds of female dogs which serve their entire lives in the establishment The females are bred until they can no longer conceive puppies and are often euthanized after that The estimated number of puppies per breeding female per year is In most puppy mills the dogs live in cages that are only centimetres inches larger than the dog on all sides which is the minimum legal size allowed Two million puppies are bred in mills each year and almost million dogs are euthanized in shelters every year The conditions in puppy mills are considered inhumane because all of the dogs are in a small dirty area which is confined with disease and bacteria Because of the poor living conditions dogs are often sick and malnourished Food is often found crawling with bugs and feces is almost everywhere Health issues that are prevalent in puppy mills consist of giardia mange heartworm respiratory infections and much more br br br History br Puppy mills originated in the post World War II era Midwestern farmers suffering crop failures turned to puppy farming as an alternative crop An increasing demand for household pets resulted in the development of the commercial puppy business br Conditions in puppy mills were well known to be poor As a result organizations such as the Humane Society of the United States began to investigate breeding kennels leading to the passage of the Animal Welfare Act of August br br br Prevalence br br br United States br According to the Humane Society of the United States only about of the puppy mills in the United States are closely monitored by the U S Department of Agriculture This presents the possibility of significant noncompliance with federal law by owners and operators of mill operations Puppy mills do not only affect the dogs that live in and come from them purchases from pet stores and breeders lessen the number of adoptions from shelters where three to four million dogs are euthanized every year br A high concentration of both puppy mills and breeders has been reported in the states of Pennsylvania Arkansas Kansas and Missouri br Pennsylvania and in particular Lancaster County has been labeled the Puppy Mill Capital of the East due to its high volume of puppy mills br Missouri has been labeled the Puppy Mill Capital of the U S by animal welfare and consumer protection groups A study by the Better Business Bureau concluded that the southwest corner of Missouri is the hub of the nation s puppy mill industry and termed it the national hot spot of the puppy industry The state of Missouri has around puppy mills as of br br br Australia br Dog breeding is regulated by individual Australian states There is no available data on the prevalence of puppy farms br In the RSPCA Australia identified puppy farms in the state of Queensland and estimated a similar prevalence in other Australian states br br br Hobby breeders br br The term puppy mill has been widely used by animal rights groups in protests against breeders who have substandard breeding conditions Critics in the breeder community claim that emotional rhetoric sensationalism and pictures of dirty kennels are used to justify additional legislation or additional restrictive licensing that travels well beyond the initial goal of removing dogs from truly deplorable conditions or that attempts to legislate puppy mills would put them out of business They argue the laws requiring additional costs in updating and maintaining their facility and licensing would be detrimental to the dogs in their care They cite existing lemon laws for puppies as sufficient protection for both dogs and prospective buyers br br br Legislative response br br br United States br br In the United States some elements of the dog breeding industry are regulated by the Animal Welfare Act of August br In recent years state legislatures have passed new laws aimed at eliminating the worst abuses at puppy mills New laws include limits on the number of breeding females requirements that facilities be licensed and inspected and requirements that dogs be given proper veterinary care Louisiana Pennsylvania and Virginia passed puppy mill laws in and states passed laws in to crack down on abusive puppy mills br In Missouri voters passed Proposition B the Puppy Mill Cruelty Prevention Act which establishes minimum standards of humane care and limits breeders to intact dogs br A compromise dubbed the Missouri Solution was signed by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon br Gov Jay Nixon Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster Missouri Director of Agriculture Jon Hagler and Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick in the St Louis Post Dispatch state that key provisions of a compromise dog breeding law passed in April will protect animals without putting dog breeders out of business br It retained some of the provisions of Proposition B and made available some state funding for inspections Humane Society of Missouri President Kathy Warnick reacted favorably seeing a step in the right direction for animal welfare br The Missouri Senate has a current bill SB that modifies provisions relating to agriculture Section under the Animal Care Facilities Act states how there will be fees for dog facilities every year On the same bill section it states that breeders can receive penalties for animal care violations up to and receive a class C misdemeanor br br br Australia br Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore has responded to the problem of puppy mills in Australia by proposing the Animals Regulation of Sale Bill It would ban the sale of dogs through pet shops the internet or newspapers The aim is to crack down on impulse purchases and shut down unregistered backyard breeders These breeders should no longer easily profit from the sale of the dogs and the number of unwanted and abandoned animals could drop br Also recently there were a few bold initiatives to fight against puppy mills Namely RSPCA Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals strategy Oscar s law The organization s name originates from the story of a dog called Oscar who was rescued from a puppy factory in central Victoria and Victorian Labor Party Efforts that restrict the number of dogs per breeding facility and require that pet shop owners keep records of every dog sold br br br United Kingdom br In Britain passed the Breeding and Sale of Dogs Act which requires annual veterinary inspections for anyone breeding five or more litters in one year Breeding females are restricted to one litter per year and four per lifetime br Breeders who choose to be members of the UK Kennel Club are required to register purebred puppies for sale with that organization and must certify the conditions under which the puppies were raised Breeders who sell puppies by misrepresenting these standards may be liable to prosecution under the Sale of Goods Act br Members of the UK public frequently buy puppies and kittens without knowing the conditions under which the animals were reared the Blue Cross estimates from to puppies are sold that way per year To prevent this a new law is planned banning the sale of puppies and kittens below the age of months in England except by licensed breeders and rehoming centres Paula Boyden of the Dogs Trust approves of the ban but advised potential loopholes needed to be addressed She maintains rehoming organisations need regulation br Lucy s Law which came into effect in April is intended to prevent puppy and kitten farming by banning third party sales such as in pet shops br br br Legal cases br Chelsea Vancleve v Chien Et Chat Inc stated In the Animal Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against Barkworks a Southern California pet store chain with six locations Barkworks tricked many puppy buyers into purchasing sick puppies They were also making illegal breeder licenses fabricating breeding certificates and lying about providing veterinary care The Animal Defense Fund made a complaint in that could have turned into a class action The court prevented the case from going any further as a class action but in the parties agreed on a settlement Barkworks had taken down the misleading in store signs and closed four of its six retail stores and the California legislature had passed a law banning the sale of dogs from commercial breeders br The Humane Society of the United States sued the USDA on March for failing to release information in the Animal Welfare Act records we requested under the Freedom of Information The following day Congress urged the USDA to restore the records as part of a report accompanying the agency s spending bill As of April USDA had still not restored the records br The ASPCA American Society for the Prevention of Animal Cruelty filed a lawsuit in against the USDA for abandoning its responsibility to enforce the Animal Welfare Act AWA which was put in place on August to regulate the humane treatment of commercially bred dogs The AWA requires the USDA to inspect facilities to ensure they meet the minimum requirements of care in which violators would be face penalties such as fines and license revocation The lawsuit claims that the USDA purposefully has chosen to ignore violations which then go unreported and unpunished which has resulted in not a single penalty filed against a commercial dog dealer since despite overwhelming evidence of cruelty It was also claimed the USDA did not act even with reported violations on record As of the USDA has only issued four recored punishments to commercial dog dealers out of over violations These commercial dog dealers were still allowed to continue operating br br br See also br Factory farming br
