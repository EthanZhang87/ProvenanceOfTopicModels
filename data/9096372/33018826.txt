id: 33018826
The Battery formerly known as Battery Park is a acre ha public park located at the southern tip of Manhattan Island in New York City facing New York Harbor It is bounded by Battery Place on the north with Bowling Green to the northeast State Street on the east New York Harbor to the south and the Hudson River to the west The park contains attractions such as an early th century fort named Castle Clinton multiple monuments and the SeaGlass Carousel The surrounding area known as South Ferry contains multiple ferry terminals including the Staten Island Ferry s Whitehall Terminal a boat launch to the Statue of Liberty National Monument which includes Ellis Island and Liberty Island and a boat launch to Governors Island br The park and surrounding area is named for the artillery batteries that were built in the late th century to protect the fort and settlement behind them By the s the Battery had become an entertainment destination and promenade with the conversion of Castle Clinton into a theater venue During the mid th century the modern day Battery Park was laid out and Castle Clinton was converted into an immigration and customs center The Battery was commonly known as the landing point for immigrants to New York City until when the immigration center was relocated to Ellis Island in the middle of the harbor Castle Clinton sometimes called Castle Garden then hosted the New York Aquarium from to br By the th century the quality of Battery Park had started to decline and several new structures were proposed within the park many of which were not built In the entirety of Battery Park was closed for twelve years due to the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the Battery Park Underpass The park reopened in after a renovation but then subsequently went into decline The Battery Conservancy founded in by Warrie Price underwrote and funded the restoration and improvement of the once dilapidated park In the Conservancy restored the park s historical name the Battery br br br History br br br Site br The area was originally occupied by the Lenape Native Americans Dutch settlers populated the area as part of the settlement of New Amsterdam in the early th century The Dutch referred to the southern tip of Manhattan as Capske Hook or Capsie Hoek the term coming from the Lenape word Kapsee meaning rocky ledge Capske Hook was originally a narrow hilly ledge that extended northward to Broadway which at the time was a Lenape trail Schreyers Hook cf Amsterdam s Schreierstoren was just adjacent In the Dutch built Fort Amsterdam atop of a hill at the site of the present Alexander Hamilton U S Custom House However the fort was largely ineffective despite several attempts at reconstruction The British took over the settlement in and renamed the defenses Fort James An artillery battery was installed at the fort in by Governor Thomas Dongan the first of a series of batteries put in around King William s War which gave the area its name Other batteries were installed at Whitehall and at Oyster Pasty the British sometimes used the same name to refer to all of these batteries Fort Amsterdam would be renamed several times before the British settled on the name of Fort George by br br The Battery did not fire any additional shots until during the New York and New Jersey campaign of the American Revolutionary War when American troops commandeered the fort and fired on British ships in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent them from sailing up the Hudson River Following the British landing at Kip s Bay on September the Americans had abandoned the fort and the British took Lower Manhattan At the end of the war in the Battery was the center of Evacuation Day celebrations commemorating the departure of the last British troops in the United States the event was later commemorated with the erection of a flagstaff By Fort George had been demolished and debris from the fort was used to expand the Battery The fort itself became the site of Government House an executive mansion intended for U S president George Washington though never actually used for that purpose v p br In just prior to the War of the West Battery was erected on a small artificial offshore island nearby to replace the earlier batteries in the area At the time the shore at the Battery was a relatively flat edge The West Battery was never used and following the war the artillery battery was renamed Castle Clinton When Battery Park s landmass was created it encircled and incorporated the island About acres ha were added to the park area in Meanwhile Castle Clinton was turned over to the city government which turned the structure into an entertainment venue It subsequently served various purposes including as an immigration and customs center as well as an aquarium br br br Creation br By the s members of the city s elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in Manhattan Proponents said that the park would serve three purposes abetting good health improving the behavior of the disorderly classes and showcasing the refinement of the city s elite At the time Manhattan s seventeen squares comprised a combined acres ha of land the largest of which was the acre ha park at the Battery Two sites were considered for a large park Jones s Wood and the present site of Central Park An alternate suggestion was to enlarge the existing Battery Park a move endorsed by most of the public However the expansion of Battery Park was opposed by wealthy merchants who deemed the proposed enlargement to be dangerous to maritime traffic and they obtained the opinion of a United States Navy lieutenant who agreed with them As a compromise New York City s aldermen also voted to expand Battery Park to acres ha Ultimately the plans for the large park would result in the construction of Central Park br The relatively modern Battery Park was mostly created by landfill as part of Lower Manhattan expansion starting from using earth from street widening projects in Lower Manhattan which united Castle Garden s island with the mainland of Manhattan The original shoreline is roughly the modern day park s eastern boundary at State Street On State Street the former harbor front and the northern boundary of the park a single Federal mansion the James Watson House survives as part of the Shrine of Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton br br By there were plans to improve Battery Park and Bowling Green which were seen as having degraded substantially due to overuse Paths were to be laid through both parks intersecting with a plaza to be built outside Castle Clinton City Pier A located immediately north of Castle Clinton was commissioned in and completed two years after The building originally housed the New York City Board of Dock Commissioners and subsequently was used as a fireboat station until br br br Elevated and subway lines br br Several elevated railroad lines or els were being built to Battery Park by the late th century but they were controversial for several reasons Because the els were originally pulled by steam trains until this caused substantial pollution at Battery Park The New York Elevated Railroad Company opened the Battery Place elevated station at Battery Place on the park s northern end in This was followed by the opening of the two track South Ferry elevated station at the park s southern end in New York Elevated Railroad agreed to beautify Battery Park as a condition of being allowed to construct the station but the elevated station s construction soon prompted opposition among people who wanted the elevated tracks removed br A larger four track station was built nearby in serving the Second Third Sixth and Ninth Avenue Lines In the state legislature established a committee to examine the process through which permission had been granted to construct the elevated station The following year New York Elevated proposed to extend the platforms of the Battery Place station over Battery Park because the platforms were too short to accommodate four car trains Another plan which would have created elevated track loops over Battery Park was rejected in as being unlawful Other unsuccessful plans to build elevated tracks over Battery Park were proposed in and br By the els were considered a nuisance and there were calls to destroy the segments of elevated tracks that ran directly over the park though this did not come to pass for another fifty years In a state assemblyman proposed a bill that would give the elevated railroad companies the exclusive rights to build a rail terminal at Battery Park precluding the construction of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company IRT s underground subway The bill was not passed By that time the IRT Lexington Avenue Line the Joralemon Street Tunnel to Brooklyn and the South Ferry subway terminal were being built directly under the park The South Ferry station opened in while the Joralemon Street Tunnel opened in br Another early method of transportation was by streetcars which stopped at Battery Place and traveled up both sides of Manhattan Island These streetcar lines terminated at South Ferry and included what are now the M M M and M bus routes The streetcars were eliminated by though only some were replaced by buses br br br th century br br By the th century the quality of Battery Park had started to decline and several new structures were being proposed within the park itself though most plans faced opposition and were not built For instance in a large memorial arch to honor United States Navy sailors was proposed within the park Another monument to steamboat operator Robert Fulton was proposed in September by Gustav H Schwab There was also a bill to construct a playground in the park which was vetoed in Opposition to structures in Battery Park was such that even the construction of the IRT subway under Battery Park was opposed by the Manhattan parks commissioner Other proposals included a plan to expand the Aquarium within Battery Park and a proposal for an athletic jogging field the following year Furthermore during World War I there was a plan to construct a federal government building on the site but this was withdrawn after the U S government found new premises following opposition to the project br Proposals to redesign Battery Park continued through the next decade An expansion of the New York Aquarium within the park was announced in and a new memorial plaque was unveiled the same year By a group called the Battery Park Association had formed a committee to study ways to improve the park In it was proposed to remove the els from Battery Park The following year an immigrants memorial was proposed within Battery Park and the park itself was proposed for reconstruction into a formal vista In Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes proposed making Battery Park into a landscaped front door for New York City with a semicircular seawall and a curving plaza Officials announced a proposal the following year to expand the park by acres ha in conjunction with improvements to roads around the park br In Battery Park was partially closed for the construction of the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the aquarium was shuttered Subsequently several plans to modify Battery Park were proposed A design competition to rebuild Battery Park was hosted in and a plan to replace Castle Clinton with a Fort Clinton memorial was also discussed During the park s closure its northern end was used to store debris A second tunnel the Battery Park Underpass started construction in The following year the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel opened and the South Ferry elevated station was removed after the closure of the last elevated line leading to the station After the underpass was completed in the park was re landscaped and expanded by acres ha and it reopened on July In Battery Park s new layout it contained a landscaped esplanade a raised waterfront terrace and an oval lawn with a playground Various statues formerly scattered across the park were rearranged in patterns The reconstruction of Battery Park had cost roughly million br br Several memorials opened through the mid th century Peter Minuit Plaza and a Coast Guard memorial were both dedicated in and the East Coast Memorial was dedicated in Additionally a foot tall m space needle with office and commercial space twice the height of the Empire State Building was proposed for the Battery in the s while discussions were ongoing on where to put the additional earth created from the construction of the World Trade Center The building would have been placed partially on landfill adjacent to the Battery The needle was never built and the earth was used as landfill for the creation of Battery Park City just to the north of Battery Park By Battery Park was so dilapidated that a U S representative from Missouri Richard Howard Ichord Jr called the litter ridden park a national disgrace and proposed that two National Park Service employees be hired to clean up the park Castle Clinton was restored several years later and reopened in br In Battery Park and multiple other historic waterfront sites were designated by the government of New York State as part of a zone called Harbor Park The other sites included South Street Seaport in Manhattan Liberty and Ellis Islands in New York Harbor Fulton Ferry in Brooklyn and Sailors Snug Harbor in Staten Island which were to be linked by new ferry routes The Harbor Park legislation was part of a city proposal to create a larger tourist destination out of these sites focused chiefly around New York Harbor s history The park was opened in July br br br Restoration and st century br br br s to s br Battery Park City was constructed as a luxury waterfront neighborhood through the s and s The success of the development resulted in attention and new funding for Battery Park projects such as million for a garden near Castle Clinton In governor Mario Cuomo and mayor Ed Koch announced a million plan to construct two new parks in Battery Park City and rearrange the park at the Battery as part of a new Hudson River waterfront park system Part of the waterfront park system had been completed previously but the new proposal would complete the system of parks Within Battery Park the Battery Park City Authority would add new entrances and redesign the park to give clearer views of the Hudson River br However by the s Battery Park was worn down and many of the nearby residents and tourists shunned it altogether except when taking boats to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island The New York Times said of the park Some benches are broken all need repainting Where grass should be there is dirt and litter A sign with a map and guide is so smeared with graffiti it is unreadable There are potholes on the asphalt where people line up for boats to the Statue of Liberty The nonprofit Battery Conservancy was created in and one of its first actions was to create an architectural plan for the park and renovating it for million In the administration of mayor Rudy Giuliani announced a million initiative to renovate Battery Park The restoration project based on similar successful projects at Bryant and Central Parks called for the relocation of the Battery s statues as well as an expansion of Castle Clinton Much of the funding was to be raised privately and at the time this was thought to be a minor obstacle since Battery Park was neither as high profile as Central Park nor as worn down as Bryant Park br br br s to present br One of the first renovation projects to commence was the reconstruction of the park s seawall and promenade at a cost of million Although Battery Park was used as an emergency staging site following the September attacks in construction on the upper promenade continued largely uninterrupted and it opened in December Five months after being damaged in the September attacks Fritz Koenig s The Sphere which once stood at the center of the plaza of the World Trade Center a few blocks away was reinstalled in a temporary location in the northern section of the park It was located near the Netherland Monument in the northeast corner of the park before being moved to Liberty Park in the new World Trade Center in late The Battery Bosque a new landscaped garden opened in br br Some restoration projects were undertaken in Battery Park in the s including the addition of a community garden the renovation of a promenade and the construction of the SeaGlass Carousel By June a third of the park was being cordoned off for these construction projects though the park itself remained open serving to daily visitors In October of that year Hurricane Sandy caused severe damage to the area submerging the park under salt water for several hours the Battery Conservancy restored the wooded areas within Battery Park as well as added gardens and green patches to mitigate the effects of future storms Though the SeaGlass Carousel was left largely intact during Hurricane Sandy its opening was delayed Following the storm the attraction was supposed to open in late but did not actually open until August br The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation restored the park s original historical title of The Battery in By the following year the Battery Conservancy had raised million in private funding over its year existence as well as million in city funding The conservancy planned to use these funds to make additional improvements to the park For instance the Battery Oval was opened in A acre ha environmentally friendly flood resistant playground called the Playscape was proposed in Work began in March and the Playscape was completed in December In addition as part of the Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency program consulting firm Stantec published designs in for the Battery Coastal Resilience Project which would build a seawall around Battery Park The project which was expected to cost million by the end of would raise the shoreline by up to feet m to protect the park from sea level rise Work on the seawall began in early br br br Notable attractions br br The Battery contains multiple attractions and points of interest Castle Clinton a former fort lies near the northwestern corner of the Battery and serves as the park s main attraction To its north is the former fireboat station Pier A which was converted into a restaurant called Harbor House in and operated until Another eatery the Battery Gardens restaurant is located next to the United States Coast Guard Battery Building br Located nearby is a acre ha garden called the Battery Bosque which was designed by Dutch landscape architect Piet Oudolf and is centered around a grove of plane trees An additional grove of trees was dedicated at the park in as a gift from the city of Jerusalem This area located northwest of Castle Clinton is called Jerusalem Grove The northeastern corner hosts a lawn called the Battery Oval The square foot m lawn opened in as part of a major restoration of the park and contains turf made of Kentucky bluegrass Along the waterfront Statue Cruises offers ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island br The southwestern corner of the Battery contains the SeaGlass Carousel an attraction with bioluminescent design that pays homage not only to the carousel s waterfront site but also to Castle Clinton s former status as an aquarium The southeastern corner contains Peter Minuit Plaza an intermodal passenger transport hub The plaza hosts a bus terminal for the M M SBS and M buses an entrance to the Staten Island Ferry s Whitehall Terminal entrances to the New York City Subway s South Ferry Whitehall Street station and taxi stands The plaza also includes the New Amsterdam Plein and Pavilion a pavilion gifted by the Kingdom of the Netherlands which displays art design and horticulture br The park is also the site of numerous memorials and monuments placed there over the years As of the park saw over five million annual visitors In the Battery Conservancy said that the park saw visitors a month which amounted to about million visitors per year br br br Castle Clinton br br Castle Clinton was originally called the West Battery it was built as a fort just prior to the War of It was renamed Castle Clinton in after the war in honor of mayor DeWitt Clinton and became property of the city in When leased by the city it became a popular promenade and beer garden called Castle Garden Later roofed over it became one of the premier theatrical venues in the United States and contributed greatly to the development of New York City as the theater capital of the nation In the early s alone the venue hosted such acts as Swedish soprano Jenny Lind European dancing star Lola Montez French conductor Louis Antoine Jullien and the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company br The migration of the city s elite uptown increased during the mid th century and in Castle Garden was closed and made into the world s first immigration depot The immigration center operated until just before the offshore immigration facility at Ellis Island opened An estimated million immigrants passed through the center during its operation The structure then housed the New York Aquarium from to when it was closed as part of Triborough Bridge Authority commissioner Robert Moses s plans to build the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel Moses wanted to create a Fort Clinton memorial on the site but would only keep Castle Clinton if the federal government agreed to pay for its restoration Ultimately Castle Clinton was preserved as part of a National Monument in br The structure was restored in Today Castle Clinton retains its original name and is managed by the National Park Service It contains a small history exhibit and ticket booths for the ferries to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in addition it occasionally hosts concerts As the site of the ferry ticket office it recorded nearly million visitors in According to data from the National Park Service the Statue of Liberty National Monument which includes Castle Clinton was the most popular national monument in the United States that year br br br SeaGlass Carousel br br The SeaGlass Carousel was proposed in and opened in plans for the ride had been devised by Warrie Price the founding president of the Battery Park Conservancy The city and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation each paid half of the million cost The carousel was designed by architectural firm WXY and artist George Tsypin Music for the ride was created by Teddy Zambetti a composer and music executive for SiriusXM A ride lasts for three and a half minutes The carousel is designed to resemble an under the sea garden through which visitors ride on fish that appear to be made of sea glass and shimmer as though they were bioluminescent The carousel features seating on species such as a Siamese fighting fish The operating machinery is under the floor so there is no post in the center of the ride br br br Memorials br Battery Park contains over monuments many of which are clustered in an area called Monument Walk br br br Hope Garden br Within the park is Hope Garden a memorial dedicated to AIDS victims where The Sphere had been exhibited at times The garden has also been used as a site for environmental demonstrations due to its fragility and the Battery s status as a tourist attraction The Sphere was moved to Liberty Park in br br br Netherland Monument br The Netherland Monument with its flagpole was dedicated on December as a gift from the Dutch in commemoration of the purchase of Manhattan Island three centuries prior It was originally located south of Castle Clinton but during the renovation the flagpole was relocated to the northeast entrance of the Battery where it still stands It was renovated and rededicated in br br br East Coast

Battle of the Atlantic A total of names are inscribed on both sides of eight foot tall granite pylons The pylons are arranged in two rows of four each Between the two rows stands a bronze statue of an eagle erected on a black granite pedestal The eagle faces the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor br The memorial was designed by the architectural firm of Gehron Seltzer while the eagle statue was created by Albino Manca an Italian born sculptor The granite slabs were set up in October the sculpture was installed in February and the memorial was dedicated by President John F Kennedy that May br

Staten Island Ferry Disaster Memorial Museum a piece memorializing a fake octopus attack on the Staten Island Ferry as well as a UFO Tugboat Abduction Memorial from the same sculptor as the ferry memorial br At least ten monuments including the Verrazzano Coast Guard and Wireless memorials were stored in the park behind a temporary fence from the mid s until Controversy over the statues integrity arose in after renovations took longer than expected Representatives of NYC Park Advocates and the Italian American organization UNICO expressed concern about the statues condition although experts said there should be no long term physical harm The monuments have since been installed in or around the perimeter of the park although not necessarily in their previous locations Prior to the restoration which cost some of the monuments had not been restored for years br br br Surroundings br br br Around the park br To the northwest of the park lies Battery Park City a planned community built on landfill in the s and s which includes Robert F Wagner Park and the Battery Park City Promenade Battery Park City proposed in was named after the park br Battery Park contains the Battery Bikeway a component piece of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway a system of parks bikeways and promenades around Manhattan Island The bicycle path was completed in late and consists of terracotta pavings near the waterfront adjacent to a foot m pedestrian walkway The bikeway contains three connections to other parts of the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway br br A bike path originates on the northern side of the Battery and runs parallel to the West Side Highway to its west North of Battery Park City the bikeway continues into Hudson River Park which extends up the Hudson River shoreline br Another bike path exits the Battery from the northwest and runs directly on the shore of the Hudson River through Battery Park City br At the Battery s southeast end the bikeway continues as the East River Greenway which runs next to FDR Drive br Across State Street to the northeast is Bowling Green as well as the old U S Customs House now used as a branch of the National Museum of the American Indian and the district U S Bankruptcy Court Peter Minuit Plaza abuts the southeast end of the park directly in front of the Staten Island Ferry s Whitehall Terminal at South Ferry br br br Under the park br br Two road tunnels and several rail tunnels run under Battery Park The Brooklyn Battery Tunnel opened carries vehicular traffic to Brooklyn The Battery Park Underpass opened carries vehicular traffic from the West Side Highway to the FDR Drive br Several New York City Subway tunnels also run under the Battery The old South Ferry station opened as part of the city s first subway line the former Interborough Rapid Transit Company s Broadway Seventh Avenue and Lexington Avenue Lines have a balloon loop to enable trains to turn around and switch between the two lines It closed in following the opening of a replacement subway station The replacement station South Ferry on the Broadway Seventh Avenue Line train opened in created a new free connection with the BMT Broadway Line s Whitehall Street station N R and W trains comprising the South Ferry Whitehall Street station complex The new station sustained severe damage following Hurricane Sandy in October and the old loop station was temporarily reactivated between April and June when the new station reopened br The Bowling Green station which opened in as part of the original subway serves the and trains at the northeast corner of the park Its original entrance or Control House is a New York City designated landmark Tracks leading south of the station go to both the old South Ferry station and to the Joralemon Street Tunnel which skirts the park before traveling under the East River br br br Discovery of wall br br In late New York City authorities announced that builders working on the new station had found the remains of a stone wall from the British colonial era during the late th or th century After archeological analysis the wall was widely reported to be the oldest man made structure still in place in Manhattan Four walls and over individual artifacts were found and a portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside Castle Clinton Another long portion of the wall was embedded permanently into the entrance to the newly constructed station at the same depth below street level as originally discovered br Robert Tierney chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission said that the wall was probably built to protect the park s original artillery batteries The remains were described as an important remnant of the history of New York City br
