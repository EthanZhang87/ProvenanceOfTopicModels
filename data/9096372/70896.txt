those in need are run by the Food and Nutrition Service Activities in this program include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program which provides healthy food to over million low income and homeless people each month USDA is a member of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness where it is committed to working with other agencies to ensure these mainstream benefits have been accessed by those experiencing homelessness br The USDA also is concerned with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both the domestic and world markets It plays a role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries This aid can go through USAID foreign governments international bodies such as World Food Program or approved nonprofits The Agricultural Act of section b and Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of also known as Food for Peace provides the legal basis of such actions The USDA is a partner of the World Cocoa Foundation br br br History br br The standard history is Gladys L Baker ed Century of Service The first years of the United States Department of Agriculture U S Department of Agriculture br br br Origins in the Patent Office br Early in its history the American economy was largely agrarian Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds plants and animals for import into the United States In by request of James Smithson out of a desire to further promulgate and diffuse scientific knowledge amongst the American people the Smithsonian Institution was established though it did not incorporate agriculture In Henry Leavitt Ellsworth became Commissioner of Patents in the Department of State He began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the Congress and local agricultural societies In Congress established the Agricultural Division within the Patent Office and allotted for the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes Ellsworth s interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants a clerk to collect agricultural statistics the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions and the application of chemistry to agriculture Ellsworth was called the Father of the Department of Agriculture br In the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created Department of the Interior In the ensuing years agitation for a separate bureau within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring br br br History br br On May Abraham Lincoln established the independent Department of Agriculture through the Morrill Act to be headed by a commissioner without Cabinet status Staffed by only eight employees the department was charged with conducting research and development related to agriculture rural development aquaculture and human nutrition in the most general and comprehensive sense of those terms Agriculturalist Isaac Newton was appointed to be the first commissioner Lincoln called it the people s department owing to the fact that over half of the nation at the time was directly or indirectly involved in agriculture or agribusiness br In the department moved into the new Department of Agriculture Building in Washington designed by famed D C architect Adolf Cluss Located on the National Mall between th Street and th SW the department had offices for its staff and the entire width of the Mall up to B Street NW to plant and experiment with plants br In the s varied advocacy groups were lobbying for Cabinet representation Business interests sought a Department of Commerce and Industry and farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank In the House of Representatives and Senate passed separate bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor Finally in the Department of Agriculture was given cabinet level status br In the Hatch Act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state The Smith Lever Act of then funded cooperative extension services in each state to teach agriculture home economics and other subjects to the public With these and similar provisions the USDA reached out to every county of every state br br br New Deal era br By the department was well established in Washington and very well known in rural America In the agricultural field the picture was different Statisticians created a comprehensive data gathering arm in the Division of Crop and Livestock Estimates Secretary Henry Wallace a statistician further strengthened the expertise by introducing sampling techniques Professional economists ran a strong Bureau of Agricultural Economics Most important was the agricultural experiment station system a network of state partners in the land grant colleges which in turn operated a large field service in direct contact with farmers in practically every rural county The department worked smoothly with a nationwide well organized pressure group the American Farm Bureau Federation It represented the largest commercial growers before Congress br As late as the Great Depression farm work occupied a fourth of Americans Indeed many young people who moved to the cities in the prosperous s returned to the family farm after the depression caused unemployment after The USDA helped ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it assisted with loans for small landowners and provided technical advice Its Bureau of Home Economics established in published shopping advice and recipes to stretch family budgets and make food go farther br br br Modern times br It was revealed on August that the U S Department of Agriculture would be providing U S farmers with a farm aid package which will total billion in direct payments to American farmers This package is meant to offset the losses farmers are expected to incur from retaliatory tariffs placed on American exports during the Trump tariffs br On February the USDA announced the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities a billion program that will test and verify the benefits of climate friendly agricultural practices br In October the USDA announced a billion debt relief program for about farmers who had fallen behind on loan payments or facing foreclosures The provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act of set aside billion to help such farmers with high risk operations caused by USDA backed loans br br br Organization and Component Staff Level br USDA s offices and agencies are listed below with full time equivalent staff levels according to the estimated FY appropriation as reported in USDA s FY Congressional Budget Justification br br br Inactive Departmental Services br Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service ASCS became part of the Farm Service Agency in br Animal Damage Control renamed Wildlife Services br Soil Conservation Service SCS renamed Natural Resources Conservation Service br Section of Vegetable Pathology Division of Botany br Renamed Division of Vegetable Pathology br br br Discrimination br br Allegations have been made that throughout the agency s history its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds denying them loans and access to other programs well into the s The effect of this discrimination caused a reduction in the number of African American farmers in the United States Though African American farmers have been the most hit by discriminatory actions by the USDA women Native Americans Hispanics and other minorities have experienced discrimination in a variety of forms at the hands of the USDA The majority of these discriminatory actions have occurred through the Farm Service Agency which oversees loan and assistance programs to farmers br In response to the Supreme Court s ruling of unconstitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act Congress enacted the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of which established the Soil Conservation Service SCS which provided service to private landowners and encouraged subsidies that would relieve soil from excessive farming The SCS in its early days were hesitant especially in Southern jurisdictions to hire Black conservationists Rather than reaching out to Black students in universities for interviews and job opportunities students had to reach out for the few opportunities granted to Black conservationists br As part of the Civil Rights Act the USDA formally ended racial segregation among its staff In the Pigford v Glickman class action lawsuit brought by African American farmers the USDA agreed to a billion dollar settlement due to its patterns of discrimination in the granting of loans and subsidies to black farmers In a second round of payouts Pigford II was appropriated by Congress for billion although this payout far too late to support the many who desperately needed financial assistance during lawsuit only comes out to around per farmer br A March letter from the GAO about the Pigford Settlement indicated that the court noted that USDA disbanded its Office of Civil Rights in and stopped responding to claims of discrimination br br br Pigford v Glickman br br Following long standing concerns black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the USDA filed in federal court in An attorney called it the most organized largest civil rights case in the history of the country Also in black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the USDA headquarters in Washington D C Protests in front of the USDA were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers Representatives of the National Black Farmers Association met with President Bill Clinton and other administration officials at the White House And NBFA s president testified before the United States House Committee on Agriculture br In Pigford v Glickman U S Federal District Court Judge Paul L Friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on April The settlement recognized discrimination against black farmers but the NBFA would later call the agreement incomplete because more than were excluded Nevertheless the settlement was deemed to be the largest ever civil rights class action settlement in American history Lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than billion Some farmers would have their debts forgiven Judge Friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement Farmers in Alabama Mississippi Arkansas and Georgia were among those affected by the settlement br The NBFA s president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the United States Senate Committee on Agriculture on September when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement It was later revealed that one DoJ staff general attorney was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers cases NBFA called for all those cases to be reheard The Chicago Tribune reported in that the result of such longstanding USDA discrimination was that black farmers had been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers In in U S farmers was African American and by the number was in USDA spokesman Ed Loyd when acknowledging that the USDA loan process was unfair to minority farmers had claimed it was hard to determine the effect on such farmers br In the Government Accountability Office GAO issued a report highly critical of the USDA in its handling of the black farmers cases NBFA continued to lobby Congress to provide relief NBFA s John Boyd farmer secured congressional support for legislation that would provide million in funds to settle late filer cases In a bill was introduced into the House of Representatives and later the Senate by Senator George Felix Allen In Boyd testified before the United States House Committee on the Judiciary about this legislation As the organization was making headway by gathering Congressional supporters in it was revealed that some USDA Farm Services Agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking Congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers Barack Obama then a U S Senator lent his support to the black farmers issues in A bill co sponsored by Obama passed the Senate in br In early June hundreds of black farmers denied a chance to have their cases heard in the Pigford settlement filed a new lawsuit against USDA The Senate and House versions of the black farmers bill reopening black farmers discrimination cases became law in June Some news reports said that the new law could affect up to black farmers In October the GAO issued a report criticizing the USDA s handling of discrimination complaints The GAO recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints br After numerous public rallies and an intensive NBFA member lobbying effort Congress approved and Obama signed into law in December legislation that set aside billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers cases NBFA s John W Boyd Jr attended the bill signing ceremony at the White House As of African American Hispanic female and Native American farmers had filed claims It was reported that some had been found fraudulent or transparently bogus In Maple Hill North Carolina by the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with out of African Americans being paid while claimants were not required by the USDA to present documentary evidence that they had been unfairly treated or had even tried to farm Lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the USDA practice of discarding denied applications after three years br br br Keepseagle v Vilsack br In Native American farmers discriminated in a similar fashion to black farmers filed a class action lawsuit against the USDA alleging loan discrimination under the ECOA and the APA This case relied heavily on its predecessor Pigford v Glickman in terms of the reasoning it set forth in the lawsuit Eventually a settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the USDA to the amount of up to million awardable through individual damages claims These claims could be used for monetary relief debt relief and or tax relief The filing period began June and lasted days Track A claimants would be eligible for up to whereas Track B claimants would be eligible for up to with a higher standard of proof br br br Garcia v Vilsack br br In similar to Pigford v Glickman a class action lawsuit was filed in the U S District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Hispanic farmers alleging that the USDA discriminated against them in terms of credit transactions and disaster benefits in direct violation of ECOA As per the settlement billion is available for compensation in awards of up to or while an additional million is available in debt relief br br br Love v Vilsack br br In similar to Garcia v Vilsack a class action lawsuit was filed in the same court alleging discrimination on the basis of gender A Congressional response to the lawsuit resulted in the passing of the Equality for Women Farmers Act which created a system that would allow for allegations of gender discrimination to be heard against the USDA and enable claims for damages br br br Environmental justice initiatives br In their environmental justice strategy the U S Department of Agriculture USDA stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission and operations In Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack emphasized the USDA s focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States as well as connecting with Indigenous Tribes and ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights USDA does fund programs with social and environmental equity goals however it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ br br br Background br On February President Clinton issued Executive Order Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations Executive Order requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency s mission Under Executive Order federal agencies must br br enforce all health and environmental statutes in areas with minority and low income populations br ensure public participation br improve research and data collection relating to the health and environment of minority and low income populations and br identify differential patterns of consumption of natural resources among minority and low income populations br The Executive Order also created an Interagency Working Group IWG consisting of heads of departments and agencies br br br Environmental Justice Strategy br On February the USDA released a final Environmental Justice Strategic Plan identifying new and updated goals and performance measures beyond what USDA identified in a EJ strategy that was adopted in response to E O Generally USDA believes its existing technical and financial assistance programs provide solutions to environmental inequity such as its initiatives on education food deserts and economic development

resource guide discusses how to br br Maintain a governmental relationship with Federally Recognized tribal governments br Implement Forest Service programs and activities honoring Indian treaty rights and fulfill legally mandated trust responsibilities to the extent that they are determine applicable to National Forest System lands br Administer programs and activities to address and be sensitive to traditional Native religious beliefs and practices br Provide research transfer of technology and technical assistance to Indian governments br The USFS works to maintain good governmental relationships through regular intergovernmental meetings acknowledgement of pre existing tribal sovereignty and a better general understanding of tribal government which varies from tribe to tribe Indian treaty rights and trust responsibilities are honored through visits to tribal neighbors discussions of mutual interest and attempts to honor and accommodate the legal positions of Indians and the federal government Addressing and demonstrating sensitivity to Native religious beliefs and practices includes walking through Native lands and acknowledging cultural needs when implementing USFS activities Providing research technology and assistance to Indian governments is shown through collaboration of ecological studies and sharing of various environmental technologies as well as the inclusion of traditional Native practices in contemporary operations of the USFS br The Intertribal Technical Assistance Network works to improve access of tribal governments communities and individuals to USDA technical assistance programs br br br Tribal Services Cooperatives br The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service provides APHIS Veterinary Services which serve

consultation internship opportunities for students and general education on damage reduction livestock protection and disease monitoring br Meanwhile the Agricultural Marketing Service AMS is exploring a program to use meat from bisons raised on tribal land to supply AMS food distribution programs to tribes br br br Other EJ Initiatives br br br Technical and financial assistance br The NRCS Strike Force Initiative has identified impoverished counties in Mississippi Georgia and Arkansas to receive increased outreach and training regarding USDA assistance programs USDA credits this increased outreach with generating a percent increase in contracts representing more than acres of farmland in its Environmental Quality Incentives Program In NRCS funded and published a study Environmental Justice Perceptions of Issues Awareness and Assistance focused on rural Southern Black Belt counties and analyzing how the NRCS workforce could more effectively integrate environmental justice into impacted communities br The Farm Services Agency in devoted of its Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers program budget to improving its outreach to counties with persistent poverty

administers water and wastewater loans including SEARCH Grants that are targeted to financially distressed small rural communities and other opportunities specifically for Alaskan Native villages br br br Mapping br USFS has established several Urban Field Stations to research urban natural resources structure function stewardship and benefits By mapping urban tree coverage the agency hopes to identify and prioritize EJ communities for urban forest projects br Another initiative highlighted by the agency is the Food and Nutrition Service and Economic Research Service s Food Desert Locator The Locator provides a spatial view of food deserts defined as a low income census tract where a substantial number or share of residents has low access to a supermarket or large grocery store The mapped deserts can be used to direct agency resources to increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other food assistance programs br br br Meat and poultry hotline br The USDA Meat and Poultry hotline is a toll free user assistance hotline for consumers to answer inquiries about the safe storage handling and preparation of meat poultry and egg products that can be reached at MPHotline The Hotline also responds to other issues related to the mission of USDA s Food Safety and Inspection Service FSIS which is to ensure that commercial supply of meat poultry and egg products

specialists with backgrounds in home economics nutrition and food technology The hotline began on July and has answered over million calls to date in The hotline added Spanish support in and added two hours in April The hotline can help detect public health threats and has been attributed with increasing American s awareness of foodborne bacteria and how to avoid them br The USDA also offers online text support via Ask Karen br br br Other br br br Private sector relationships br USDA formalized a relationship with the Global Food Safety Initiative GFSI in GFSI is a private organization where members of the Consumer Goods Forum have control over benchmarking requirements in recognition of private standards for food safety In August USDA achieved Technical Equivalence against Version of the GFSI Benchmarking Requirements for their Harmonized GAP Plus certification programme where Technical Equivalence is limited to government owned food safety certification programmes This is misaligned with U S Government Policy and OMB Circular No A which instructs its agencies to adopt voluntary consensus standards before relying upon industry standards private standards or developing government standards br Harmonized GAP Plus Standard V was published in February with reference to GFSI Guidance Document Version Part III ignoring reference to international standards and technical specifications ISO and ISO T S Prerequisite Programmes for Farming The USDA exception to OMB Circular No A might be attributed to lobbying and influence of Consumer Goods Forum members in Washington D C In November GFSI announced its Technical Equivalence was under strategic review explaining the assessment has raised concerns across many stakeholders br br br COVID relief br During the COVID pandemic Congress allocated funding to the USDA to address the disturbances rippling through the agricultural sector On April U S Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program br br The American food supply chain had to adapt and it remains safe secure and strong and we all know that starts with America s farmers and ranchers This program will not only
