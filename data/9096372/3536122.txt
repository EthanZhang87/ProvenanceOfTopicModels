William Temple Hornaday Sc D December March was an American zoologist conservationist taxidermist and author He served as the first director of the New York Zoological Park known today as the Bronx Zoo and he was a pioneer in the early wildlife conservation movement in the United States br br br Biography br Hornaday was born in Avon Indiana and educated at Oskaloosa College the Iowa State Agricultural College now Iowa State University and in Europe br br After serving as a taxidermist at Henry Augustus Ward s Natural Science Establishment in Rochester New York he spent years in India and Ceylon collecting specimens In May he reached southeast Asia and traveled in Malaya and Sarawak in Borneo His travels inspired his first publication Two Years in the Jungle He also advocated the establishment of a museum in Sarawak In he was appointed chief taxidermist of the United States National Museum a post he held until his resignation in br In his position at the museum Hornaday was tasked with inventorying the museum s specimen collection of American Buffalo which was meager He then undertook a census of bison by writing to ranchers hunters army officers and zookeepers across the American West and in Canada Based on firsthand accounts Hornaday estimated that as recently as there were approximately million wild bison in the American West Through his census he ascertained that those numbers had rapidly depleted In a letter written to his superior at the Smithsonian George Brown Goode Hornaday reported that in the United States the extermination of all the large herds of buffalo is already an accomplished fact br In Hornaday went out west to the Musselshell River region of Montana where the last surviving herds of wild American buffalo lived He was tasked with collecting specimens from the region for the United States National Museum collections so that future generations would know what the buffalo looked like after their expected extinction br The buffalo that Hornaday mounted remained on exhibit until the s when the museum underwent an exhibit modernization program The Smithsonian sent the specimens to Montana where they were placed in storage After many years of neglect they were rediscovered restored and placed on display in at the Museum of the Northern Great Plains in Fort Benton Montana br The decimation of the species that Hornaday witnessed had a profound effect on him transforming him into a conservationist In addition to the specimens for the collection he acquired live specimens for the conservation of the species that he brought back to Washington D C which formed the nucleus of the Department of Living Animals he created at the Smithsonian the precursor to the National Zoological Park which he helped establish a few years later in Hornaday served as the zoo s first director but left soon thereafter after conflict with the head of the Smithsonian Samuel Pierpont Langley br br br Bronx Zoo Director br br In the newly chartered New York Zoological Society known today as the Wildlife Conservation Society enticed Hornaday back to the zoo field by offering him the opportunity to create a world class zoo Hornaday played a commanding role in selection of the site for the Bronx Zoo a nickname he hated which opened in and in the design of early exhibits He served in the triple role of Director General Curator and Curator of Mammals Among his several activities he established one of the world s most extensive collections insisted on unprecedented standards for exhibit labeling promoted lecture series and offered studio space to wildlife artists When he retired in he was succeeded as Bronx Zoo director by W Reid Blair br br br Exhibiting a human br During Dr Hornaday s tenure as director of the New York zoo Ota Benga a pygmy native of the Congo was placed on display in the monkey house in September Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow wove twine and wrestled with an orangutan Although according to the New York Times few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions black clergymen in the city took great offense Our race we think is depressed enough without exhibiting one of us with the apes said the Reverend James H Gordon superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn We think we are worthy of being considered human beings with souls br New York Mayor George B McClellan Jr refused to meet with the clergymen drawing the praise of Dr Hornaday who wrote to him When the history of the Zoological Park is written this incident will form its most amusing passage br Hornaday remained unapologetic insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibit In another letter he said that he and Madison Grant the secretary of the New York Zoological Society who ten years later would publish the racist tract The Passing of the Great Race considered it imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to by the black clergymen br Hornaday decided to close the exhibit after just two days and on Monday September Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds often followed by a crowd howling jeering and yelling Benga died by suicide in when his return trip to the Congo was delayed by World War I br br br Wildlife Conservation Legacy br Hornaday s became an advocate for preserving the American bison from extinction At the end of the nineteenth century he began to plan with Theodore Roosevelt s support a society for the protection of the bison Years later as director of the Bronx Zoo Hornaday acquired bison and by there were forty bison on the Zoo s ten acre range In the American Bison Society was formed at a meeting in the Bronx Zoo s Lion House with Hornaday as its president When the first large game preserve in America was created in the Wichita National Forest and Game Preserve Hornaday offered fifteen individuals from the Bronx Zoo herd for a reintroduction program He personally selected the release site and the individual animals By nine herds had been established in the US through the efforts of the American Bison Society br During his lifetime Hornaday published almost two dozen books and hundreds of articles on the need for conservation frequently presenting it as a moral obligation Most notable was the publication and distribution to every member of Congress of his bestselling Our Vanishing Wildlife Its Extermination and Preservation a riveting call to action against the destructive forces of overhunting As the historian Douglas Brinkley has described it What Upton Sinclair s The Jungle had been for meatpacking reform Our Vanishing Wildlife was for championing disappearing creatures like prairie chickens whooping cranes and roseate spoonbills Hornaday appealed to readers emotions urging them that the birds and mammals now are literally dying for your help Although he was not entirely opposed to hunting he became increasingly convinced of the perils that modern hunting shaped by new firearm technology and easier access to wildlife by cars posed to wildlife populations As he proclaimed with characteristic zeal in Our Vanishing Wildlife It is time for the people who don t shoot to call a halt on those who do and if this be treason then let my enemies make the most of it br Throughout his career he lobbied and provided testimony for several congressional acts for wildlife protection laws In he established the Permanent Wild Life Protection Fund as a vehicle to fund his tireless conservation lobbying efforts Through a network of conservation activists throughout the United States Hornaday pushed at both the state and federal level for protective legislation national parks wildlife refuges and international treaties By the American Museum Journal declared that Hornaday has no doubt inaugurated and carried to success more movements for the protection of wild animal life than has any other man in America br br br Influence on Scouting br br Hornaday had a large impact on the Scouting movement and especially the Boy Scouts of America BSA Not only is there a series of conservation awards previously named after him but his beliefs and writings were a major reason conservation and ecology have long been an important part of the BSA s program This awards program was created in by Dr Hornaday He named the award the Wildlife Protection Medal Its purpose was to challenge Americans to work constructively for wildlife conservation and habitat protection After his death in the award was renamed in Dr Hornaday s honor and became a BSA award In October the BSA changed the name of the award to the BSA Distinguished Conservation Service Award as they felt that Hornaday s values go against the BSA s values and we determined that given this information the conservation award should no longer bear his name in order to uphold our commitment against racism and discrimination br br br Personal life br Hornaday married Josephine Chamberlain in They were married for fifty eight years until his death The Hornadays had one daughter Helen Hornaday died in Stamford Connecticut and was buried at Putnam Cemetery in Greenwich Connecticut br A year after his death in at the suggestion of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt the National Park Service named a peak Mount Hornaday in the Absaroka Range in Yellowstone National Park for him A street in the Bronx NY is named in his honor Hornaday Place The bee keeper Douglas Hornaday was awarded the Rachel Carson Award in for his impact
