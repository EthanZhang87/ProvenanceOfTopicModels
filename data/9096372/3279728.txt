across different regions within different countries It was estimated in that worldwide million dogs are eaten each year by humans br br br Historical practices br br br Mesoamerica br br br Aztecs br In the Aztec Empire Mexican hairless dogs were bred for many purposes Hern n Cort s an enemy of the Aztec claimed in a letter that when he arrived in Tenochtitlan in small gelded dogs which they breed for eating were among the goods sold in the city markets No other source corroborates this practice These dogs Xoloitzcuintles were often depicted in pre Columbian Mexican pottery The breed was almost extinct in the s but the British military attach in Mexico City Norman Wright developed a thriving breed from some of the dogs he found in remote villages The genetic heritage of the breed has been almost erased through interbreeding with other dog breeds to keep its looks alive br br br Native North Americans br The traditional culture surrounding the consumption of dog meat varied from tribe to tribe among the original inhabitants of North America with some tribes relishing it as a delicacy and others such as the Comanche treating it as a forbidden food Native peoples of the Great Plains such as the Sioux and Cheyenne consumed it but there was a concurrent religious taboo against the meat of wild canines br The Kickapoo people include puppy meat in many of their traditional festivals This practice has been well documented in the Works Progress Administration Indian Pioneer History Project for Oklahoma br On December the federal Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act was signed into law as part of the Farm Bill It bans slaughtering dogs and cats for food in the United States with exceptions for Native American rituals br br br Europe br One of Ireland s mythological heroes C Chulainn had two geasa or vows one of which was to avoid the meat of dogs and the other was not to refuse an offer of hospitality In the myth of his death the breaking of this geis after being offered

against eating dogs which featured prominently in their cultural myths The indigenous Taiwan Dog was deeply valued as a hunting companion However they also started consuming dog meat after it was introduced by incoming waishengren mainlander Han Chinese migrants in the mid th century leading to the near extinction of the Taiwan Dog br br br Island Southeast Asia br Domesticated dogs were carried into the Philippines by the Neolithic Austronesian migrations from Taiwan whose dogs in turn were acquired from the pre Austronesian cultures in Neolithic southeastern China Dog meat were consumed in some pre colonial Philippine ethnic groups during certain shamanic rituals and special occasions However dog bones are very rarely found in middens in archaeological sites in contrast to pig and deer remains and most complete dog remains in archaeological sites are of dog burials near or beside human graves This indicates that while dogs were sometimes eaten they were primarily kept as companions and hunting dogs and not as food animals The Spanish historian Francisco Ignacio Alcina have detailed descriptions of the affectionate treatment of dogs by native Visayans in the th century during the early Spanish colonial period Alcina disapprovingly records that dogs were treated by locals like their own children Thus the rise in the consumption of dog meat as food in the secular context in some ethnic groups in the Philippines is likely to have only occurred some time after the arrival of the Spanish br The tradition of eating dog meat for ritual purposes in some ethnic groups survived into the modern times in the Cordillera highlands of the Philippines Among Cordillerans dogs are sacrificed and eaten in a cleansing ritual known as dao es or daw es The ritual is typically done after a person dies unexpectedly through murder or an accident gets severely ill was released from prison or witnessed death firsthand Cordillerans believe that dogs have one of the purest souls among animals comparable to humans and thus they are the most appealing to the ancestor spirits anito The dog soul is sent as a messenger to the spirit world by a shaman mambunong which is believed to cleanse the minds of participants of images of death and evil spirits These rituals are still legally permitted though they are required to keep records and are overseen by the Committee on Animal Welfare br br br Oceania br br Dogs lost their economic importance as hunting animals usually for wild boar among Austronesians that reached the smaller islands in Melanesia and Polynesia They became a competitor for limited food resources and thus were themselves eaten The Austronesian domesticated dogs originally carried by the Lapita Culture migrations were eaten to extinction in many islands since ancient times Dogs were reintroduced later on from surviving populations in other islands as well as dogs that descended from non Austronesian Mainland Southeast Asian populations This caused a marked discontinuity in the genes of domesticated dogs as well as the terms for dogs among Austronesians in the Pacific Islands in comparison to other Austronesian regions in Island Southeast Asia br Dogs were historically eaten in Tahiti and other islands of Polynesia including Hawaii at the time of first European contact James Cook when first visiting Tahiti in recorded in his journal few were there of us but what allow d that a South Sea Dog was next to an English Lamb one thing in their favour is that they live entirely upon Vegetables Calvin Schwabe reported in that dog was widely eaten in Hawaii and considered to be of higher quality than pork or chicken When Hawaiians first encountered early British and American explorers they were at a loss to explain the visitors attitudes about dog meat The Hawaiians raised both dogs and pigs as pets and for food They could not understand why their British and American visitors only found the pig suitable for consumption This practice seems to have died out along with the native Hawaiian breed of dog the unique Hawaiian Poi Dog which was primarily used for this purpose br Although Hawaii has outlawed commercial sales of dog meat until the federal Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act it was legal to slaughter an animal classified as a pet if it was bred for human consumption and done in a humane manner This allowed dog meat trade to continue mostly using stray lost or stolen dogs br br br Religious dietary laws br According to kashrut Jewish dietary law it is forbidden to consume the flesh of

br Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen s party famously planned to eat their sled dogs as well as to feed weaker dogs to other dogs during their expedition to the South Pole This allowed the party to carry less food thus lightening the load and ultimately helped Amundsen to win his race to the South Pole against Robert Scott s expedition which used ponies When comparing sled dogs to ponies as draught animals Amundsen noted br br There is the obvious advantage that dog can be fed on dog One can reduce one s pack little by little slaughtering the feebler ones and feeding the chosen with them In this way they get fresh meat Our dogs lived on dog s flesh and pemmican the whole way and this enabled them to do splendid work And if we ourselves wanted a piece of fresh meat we could cut off a delicate little fillet it tasted to us as good as the best beef The dogs do not object at all as long as they get their share they do not mind what part of their comrade s carcass it comes from All that was left after one of these canine meals was the teeth of the victim and if it had been a really hard day these also disappeared br br Douglas Mawson and Xavier Mertz were part of the Far Eastern Party a three man sledging team with Lieutenant B E S Ninnis to survey King George V Land Antarctica On December Ninnis fell through a snow covered crevasse along with most of the party s rations and was never seen again Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately They had one and a half weeks food for themselves and nothing at all for the dogs Their meagre provisions forced them to eat their remaining sled dogs on their mile km return journey Their meat was tough stringy and without a vestige of fat Each animal yielded very little and the major part was fed to the surviving dogs which ate the meat skin and bones until nothing remained The men also ate the dog s brains and livers Unfortunately eating the liver of sled dogs produces the condition hypervitaminosis A because canines have a much higher tolerance for vitamin A than humans do Mertz suffered a quick deterioration He developed stomach pains and became incapacitated and incoherent On January Mertz died Mawson continued alone
