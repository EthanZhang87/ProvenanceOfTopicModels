Turtles are reptiles of the order Testudines characterized by a special shell developed mainly from their ribs Modern turtles are divided into two major groups the Pleurodira side necked turtles and Cryptodira hidden necked turtles which differ in the way the head retracts There are living and recently extinct species of turtles including land dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins They are found on most continents some islands and in the case of sea turtles much of the ocean Like other amniotes reptiles birds and mammals they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater although many species live in or around water br Turtle shells are made mostly of bone the upper part is the domed carapace while the underside is the flatter plastron or belly plate Its outer surface is covered in scales made of keratin the material of hair horns and claws The carapace bones develop from ribs that grow sideways and develop into broad flat plates that join up to cover the body Turtles are ectotherms or cold blooded meaning that their internal temperature varies with their direct environment They are generally opportunistic omnivores and mainly feed on plants and animals with limited movements Many turtles migrate short distances seasonally Sea turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances to lay their eggs on a favored beach br Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world Some terrestrial and freshwater species are widely kept as pets Turtles have been hunted for their meat for use in traditional medicine and for their shells Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing nets Turtle habitats around the world are being destroyed As a result of these pressures many species are extinct or threatened with extinction br br br Naming and etymology br The word turtle is borrowed from the French word tortue or tortre turtle tortoise It is a common name and may be used without knowledge of taxonomic distinctions In North America it may denote the order as a whole In Britain the name is used for sea turtles as opposed to freshwater terrapins and land dwelling tortoises In Australia which lacks true tortoises family Testudinidae non marine turtles were traditionally called tortoises but more recently turtle has been used for the entire group br The name of the order Testudines teh STEW din eez is based on the Latin word testudo tortoise and was coined by German naturalist August Batsch in The order has also been historically known as Chelonii Latreille and Chelonia Ross and Macartney which are based on the Ancient Greek word chelone tortoise Testudines is the official order name due to the principle of priority The term chelonian is used as a formal name for members of the group br br br Anatomy and physiology br br br Size br The largest living species of turtle and fourth largest reptile is the leatherback turtle which can reach over m ft in in length and weigh over kg lb The largest known turtle was Archelon ischyros a Late Cretaceous sea turtle up to m ft long m ft wide between the tips of the front flippers and estimated to have weighed over kg lb The smallest living turtle is Chersobius signatus of South Africa measuring no more than cm in in length and weighing g oz br br br Shell br br The shell of a turtle is unique among vertebrates and serves to protect the animal and provide shelter from the elements It is primarily made of bones and consists of two parts the domed dorsal back carapace and the flatter ventral belly plastron They are connected by lateral side extensions of the plastron br The carapace is fused with the vertebrae and ribs while the plastron is formed from bones of the shoulder girdle sternum and gastralia abdominal ribs During development the ribs grow sideways into a carapacial ridge unique to turtles entering the dermis inner skin of the back to support the carapace The development is signaled locally by proteins known as fibroblast growth factors that include FGF The shoulder girdle in turtles is made up of two bones the scapula and the coracoid Both the shoulder and pelvic girdles of turtles are located within the shell and hence are effectively within the rib cage The trunk ribs grow over the shoulder girdle during development br br The shell is covered in epidermal outer skin scales known as scutes that are made of keratin the same substance that makes up hair and fingernails Typically a turtle has scutes on the carapace and on the plastron giving them in total Carapace scutes are divided into marginals around the margin and vertebrals over the vertebral column though the scute that overlays the neck is called the cervical Pleurals are present between the marginals and vertebrals Plastron scutes include gulars throat humerals pectorals abdominals and anals Side necked turtles additionally have intergular scutes between the gulars Turtle scutes are usually structured like mosaic tiles but some species like the hawksbill sea turtle have overlapping scutes on the carapace br The shapes of turtle shells vary with the adaptations of the individual species and sometimes with sex Land dwelling turtles are more dome shaped which appears to make them more resistant to being crushed by large animals Aquatic turtles have flatter smoother shells that allow them to cut through the water Sea turtles in particular have streamlined shells that reduce drag and increase stability in the open ocean Some turtle species have pointy or spiked shells that provide extra protection from predators and camouflage against the leafy ground The lumps of a tortoise shell can tilt its body when it gets flipped over allowing it to flip back In male tortoises the tip of the plastron is thickened and used for butting and ramming during combat br Shells vary in flexibility Some species such as box turtles lack the lateral extensions and instead have the carapace bones fully fused or ankylosed together Several species have hinges on their shells usually on the plastron which allow them to expand and contract Softshell turtles have rubbery edges due to the loss of bones The leatherback turtle has hardly any bones in its shell but has thick connective tissue and an outer layer of leathery skin br br br Head and neck br br The turtle s skull is unique among living amniotes which includes reptiles birds and mammals it is solid and rigid with no openings for muscle attachment temporal fenestrae Muscles instead attach to recesses in the back of the skull Turtle skulls vary in shape from the long and narrow skulls of softshells to the broad and flattened skull of the mata mata Some turtle species have developed large and thick heads allowing for greater muscle mass and stronger bites br Turtles that are carnivorous or durophagous eating hard shelled animals have the most powerful bites For example the durophagous Mesoclemmys nasuta has a bite force of lbf N Species that are insectivorous piscivorous fish eating or omnivorous have lower bite forces Living turtles lack teeth but have beaks made of keratin sheaths along the edges of the jaws These sheaths may have sharp edges for cutting meat serrations for clipping plants or broad plates for breaking mollusks Sea turtles and several extinct forms have evolved a bony secondary palate which completely separates the oral and nasal cavities br The necks of turtles are highly flexible possibly to compensate for their rigid shells Some species like sea turtles have short necks while others such as snake necked turtles have long ones Despite this all turtle species have eight neck vertebrae a consistency not found in other reptiles but similar to mammals Some snake necked turtles have both long necks and large heads limiting their ability to lift them when not in water Some turtles have folded structures in the larynx or glottis that vibrate to produce sound Other species have elastin rich vocal cords br br br Limbs and locomotion br Due to their heavy shells turtles are slow moving on land A desert tortoise moves at only km h mph By contrast sea turtles can swim at km h mph The limbs of turtles are adapted for various means of locomotion and habits and most have five toes Tortoises are specialized for terrestrial environments and have column like legs with elephant like feet and short toes The gopher tortoise has flattened front limbs for digging in the substrate Freshwater turtles have more flexible legs and longer toes with webbing giving them thrust in the water Some of these species such as snapping turtles and mud turtles mainly walk along the water bottom as they would on land Others such as terrapins swim by paddling with all four limbs switching between the opposing front and hind limbs which keeps their direction stable br br Sea turtles and the pig nosed turtle are the most specialized for swimming Their front limbs have evolved into flippers while the shorter hind limbs are shaped more like rudders The front limbs provide most of the thrust for swimming while the hind limbs serve as stabilizers Sea turtles such as the green sea turtle rotate the front limb flippers like a bird s wings to generate a propulsive force on both the upstroke and on the downstroke This is in contrast to similar sized freshwater turtles measurements having been made on young animals in each case such as the Caspian turtle which uses the front limbs like the oars of a rowing boat creating substantial negative thrust on the recovery stroke in each cycle In addition the streamlining of the marine turtles reduces drag As a result marine turtles produce a propulsive force twice as large and swim six times as fast as freshwater turtles The swimming efficiency of young marine turtles is similar to that of fast swimming fish of open water like mackerel br Compared to other reptiles turtles tend to have reduced tails but these vary in both length and thickness among species and between sexes Snapping turtles and the big headed turtle have longer tails the latter uses it for balance while climbing The cloaca is found underneath and at the base and the tail itself houses the reproductive organs Hence males have longer tails to contain the penis In sea turtles the tail is longer and more prehensile in males who use it to grasp mates Several turtle species have spines on their tails br br br Senses br br Turtles make use of vision to find food and mates avoid predators and orient themselves The retina s light sensitive cells include both rods for vision in low light and cones with three different photopigments for bright light where they have full color vision There is possibly a fourth type of cone that detects ultraviolet as hatchling sea turtles respond experimentally to ultraviolet light but it is unknown if they can distinguish this from longer wavelengths A freshwater turtle the red eared slider has an exceptional seven types of cone cell br Sea turtles orient themselves on land by night using visual features detected in dim light They can use their eyes in clear surface water muddy coasts the darkness of the deep ocean and also above water Unlike in terrestrial turtles the cornea the curved surface that lets light into the eye does not help to focus light on the retina so focusing underwater is handled entirely by the lens behind the cornea The cone cells contain oil droplets placed to shift perception toward the red part of the spectrum improving color discrimination Visual acuity studied in hatchlings is highest in a horizontal band with retinal cells packed about twice as densely as elsewhere This gives the best vision along the visual horizon Sea turtles do not appear to use polarized light for orientation as many other animals do The deep diving leatherback turtle lacks specific adaptations to low light such as large eyes large lenses or a reflective tapetum It may rely on seeing the bioluminescence of prey when hunting in deep water br Turtles have no ear openings the eardrum is covered with scales and encircled by a bony otic capsule which is absent in other reptiles Their hearing thresholds are high in comparison to other reptiles reaching up to Hz in air but underwater they are more attuned to lower frequencies The loggerhead sea turtle has been shown experimentally to respond to low sounds with maximal sensitivity between and Hz br Turtles have olfactory smell and vomeronasal receptors along the nasal cavity the latter of which are used to detect chemical signals Experiments on green sea turtles showed they could learn to respond to a selection of different odorant chemicals such as triethylamine and cinnamaldehyde which were detected by olfaction in the nose Such signals could be used in navigation br br br Breathing br br The rigid shell of turtles is not capable of expanding and making room for the lungs as in other amniotes so they have had to evolve special adaptations for respiration The lungs of turtles are attached directly to the carapace above while below connective tissue attaches them to the organs They have multiple lateral side and medial middle chambers the numbers of which vary between species and one terminal end chamber br The lungs are ventilated using specific groups of abdominal muscles attached to the organs that pull and push on them Specifically it is the turtle s large liver that compresses the lungs Underneath the lungs in the coelomic cavity the liver is connected to the right lung by the root and the stomach is directly attached to the left lung and to the liver by a mesentery When the liver is pulled down inhalation begins Supporting the lungs is a wall or septum which is thought to prevent them from collapsing During exhalation the contraction of the transversus abdominis muscle propels the organs into the lungs and expels air Conversely during inhalation the relaxing and flattening of the oblique abdominis muscle pulls the transversus back down allowing air back into the lungs br Although many turtles spend large amounts of their lives underwater all turtles breathe air and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs Depending on the species immersion periods vary between a minute and an hour Some species can respire through the cloaca which contains large sacs that are lined with many finger like projections that take up dissolved oxygen from the water br br br Circulation br br Turtles share the linked circulatory and pulmonary lung systems of vertebrates where the three chambered heart pumps deoxygenated blood through the lungs and then pumps the returned oxygenated blood through the body s tissues The cardiopulmonary system has both structural and physiological adaptations that distinguish it from other vertebrates Turtles have a large lung volume and can move blood through non pulmonary blood vessels including some within the heart to avoid the lungs while they are not breathing They can hold their breath for much longer periods than other reptiles and they can tolerate the resulting low oxygen levels They can moderate the increase in acidity during anaerobic non oxygen based respiration by chemical buffering and they can lie dormant for months in aestivation or brumation br The heart has two atria but only one ventricle The ventricle is subdivided into three chambers A muscular ridge enables a complex pattern of blood flow so that the blood can be directed either to the lungs via the pulmonary artery or to the body via the aorta The ability to separate the two outflows varies between species The leatherback has a powerful muscular ridge enabling almost complete separation of the outflows supporting its actively swimming lifestyle The ridge is less well developed in freshwater turtles like the sliders Trachemys br Turtles are capable of enduring periods of anaerobic respiration longer than many other vertebrates This process breaks down sugars incompletely to lactic acid rather than all the way to carbon dioxide and water as in aerobic oxygen based respiration They make use of the shell as a source of additional buffering agents for combating increased acidity and as a sink for lactic acid br br br Osmoregulation br In sea turtles the bladder is one unit and in most freshwater turtles it is double lobed Sea turtle bladders are connected to two small accessory bladders located at the sides to the neck of the urinary bladder and above the pubis Arid living tortoises have bladders that serve as reserves of water storing up to of their body weight in fluids The fluids are normally low in solutes but higher during droughts when the reptile gains potassium salts from its plant diet The bladder stores these salts until the tortoise finds fresh drinking water To regulate the amount of salt in their bodies sea turtles and the brackish living diamondback terrapin secrete excess salt in a thick sticky substance from their tear glands Because of this sea turtles may appear to be crying when on land br br br Thermoregulation br br Turtles like other reptiles have a limited ability to regulate their body temperature This ability varies between species and with body size Small pond turtles regulate their temperature by crawling out of the water and basking in the sun while small terrestrial turtles move between sunny and shady places to adjust their temperature Large species both terrestrial and marine have sufficient mass to give them substantial thermal inertia meaning that they heat up or cool down over many hours The Aldabra giant tortoise weighs up to some kilograms lb and is able to allow its temperature to rise to some C F on a hot day and to fall naturally to around C F by night Some giant tortoises seek out shade to avoid overheating on sunny days On Grand Terre Island food is scarce inland shade is scarce near the coast and the tortoises compete for space under the few trees on hot days Large males may push smaller females out of the shade and some then overheat and die br Adult sea turtles too have large enough bodies that they can to some extent control their temperature The largest turtle the leatherback can swim in the waters off Nova Scotia which may be as cold as C F while their body temperature has been measured at up to C F warmer than the surrounding water To help keep their temperature up they have a system of countercurrent heat exchange in the blood vessels between their body core and the skin of their flippers The vessels supplying the head are insulated by fat around the neck br br br Behavior br br br Diet and feeding br br Most turtle species are opportunistic omnivores land dwelling species are more herbivorous and aquatic ones more carnivorous Generally lacking speed and agility most turtles feed either on plant material or on animals with limited movements like mollusks worms and insect larvae Some species such as the African helmeted turtle and snapping turtles eat fish amphibians reptiles including other turtles birds and mammals They may take them by ambush but also scavenge The alligator snapping turtle has a worm like appendage on its tongue that it uses to lure fish into its mouth Tortoises are the most herbivorous group consuming grasses leaves and fruits Many turtle species including tortoises supplement their diet with eggshells animal bones hair and droppings for extra nutrients br Turtles generally eat their food in a straightforward way though some species have special feeding techniques The yellow spotted river turtle and the painted turtle may filter feed by skimming the water surface with their mouth and throat open to collect particles of food When the mouth closes the throat constricts and water is pushed out through the nostrils and the gap in between the jaws Some species employ a gape and suck method where the turtle opens its jaws and expands its throat widely sucking the prey in br The diet of an individual within a species may change with age sex and season and may also differ between populations In many species juveniles are generally carnivorous but become more herbivorous as adults With Barbour s map turtle the larger female mainly eats mollusks while the male usually eats arthropods Blanding s turtle may feed mainly on snails or crayfish depending on the population The European pond turtle has been recorded as being mostly carnivorous much of the year but switching to water lilies during the summer Some species have developed specialized diets such as the hawksbill which eats sponges the leatherback which feeds on jellyfish and the Mekong snail eating turtle br br br Communication and intelligence br br While popularly thought of as mute turtles make various sounds to communicate One study which recorded species found that all of them vocalized Tortoises may bellow when courting and mating Various species of both freshwater and sea turtles emit short low frequency calls from the time they are in the egg to when they are adults These vocalizations may serve to create group cohesion when migrating The oblong turtle has a particularly large vocal range producing sounds described as clacks clicks squawks hoots various kinds of chirps wails hooos grunts growls blow bursts howls and drum rolls br Play behavior has been documented in some turtle species In the laboratory Florida red bellied cooters can learn novel tasks and have demonstrated a long term memory of at least months Similarly giant tortoises can learn and remember tasks and master lessons much faster when trained in groups Tortoises appear to be able to retain operant conditioning nine years after their initial training Studies have shown that turtles can navigate the environment using landmarks and a map like system resulting in accurate direct routes towards a goal Navigation in turtles have been correlated to high cognition function in the medial cortex region of the brain br br br Defense br br When sensing danger a turtle may flee freeze or withdraw into its shell Freshwater turtles flee into the water though the Sonora mud turtle may take refuge on land as the shallow temporary ponds they inhabit make them vulnerable When startled a softshell turtle may dive underwater and bury itself under the sea floor If a predator persists the turtle may bite or discharge from its cloaca Several species produce foul smelling chemicals from musk glands Other tactics include threat displays and Bell s hinge back tortoise can play dead When attacked big headed turtle hatchlings squeal possibly startling the predator br br br Migration br br Turtles are the only reptiles that migrate long distances more specifically the marine species that can travel up to thousands of kilometers Some non marine turtles such as the species of Geochelone terrestrial Chelydra freshwater and Malaclemys estuarine migrate seasonally over much shorter distances up to around km mi to lay eggs Such short migrations are comparable to those of some lizards snakes and crocodilians Sea turtles nest in a specific area such as a beach leaving the eggs to hatch unattended The young turtles leave that area migrating long distances in the years or decades in which they grow to maturity and then return seemingly to the same area every few years to mate and lay eggs though the precision varies between species and populations This natal homing has appeared remarkable to biologists though there is now plentiful evidence for it including from genetics br How sea turtles navigate to their breeding beaches remains unknown One possibility is imprinting as in salmon where the young learn the chemical signature effectively the scent of their home waters before leaving and remember that when the time comes for them to return as adults Another possible cue is the orientation of the Earth s magnetic field at the natal beach There is experimental evidence that turtles have an effective magnetic sense and that they use this in navigation Proof that homing occurs is derived from genetic analysis of populations of loggerheads hawksbills leatherbacks and olive ridleys by nesting place For each of these species the populations in different places have their own mitochondrial DNA genetic signatures that persist over the years This shows that the populations are distinct and that homing must be occurring reliably br br br Reproduction and life cycle br br Turtles have a wide variety of mating behaviors but do not form pair bonds or social groups In green sea turtles females generally outnumber males In terrestrial species males are often larger than females and fighting between males establishes a dominance hierarchy for access to mates For most semi aquatic and bottom walking aquatic species combat occurs less often Males of these species instead may use their size advantage to mate forcibly In fully aquatic species males are often smaller than females and rely on courtship displays to gain mating access to females br br br Courtship and mounting br Courtship varies between species and with habitat It is often complex in aquatic species both marine and freshwater but simpler in the semi aquatic mud turtles and snapping turtles A male tortoise bobs his head then subdues the female by biting and butting her before mounting The male scorpion mud turtle approaches the female from the rear and often resorts to aggressive methods such as biting the female s tail or hind limbs followed by a mounting br Female choice is important in some species and female green sea turtles are not always receptive As such they have evolved behaviors to avoid the male s attempts at copulation such as swimming away confronting the male followed by biting or taking up a refusal position with her body vertical her limbs widely outspread and her plastron facing the male If the water is too shallow for the refusal position the females resort to beaching themselves as the males do not follow them ashore br br All turtles fertilize internally mounting and copulation can be difficult In many species males have a concave plastron that interlocks with the female s carapace In species like the Russian tortoise the male has a lighter shell and longer legs The high rounded shape of box turtles are particular obstacles for mounting The male eastern box turtle leans backward and hooks onto the back of the female s plastron Aquatic turtles mount in water and female sea turtles support the mounting male while swimming and diving During copulation the male turtle aligns his tail with the female s so he can insert his penis into her cloaca Some female turtles can store sperm from multiple males and their egg clutches can have multiple sires br br br Eggs and hatchlings br br Turtles including sea turtles lay their eggs on land although some lay eggs near water that rises and falls in level submerging the eggs While most species build nests and lay eggs where they forage some travel miles The common snapping turtle walks km mi on land while sea turtles travel even further the leatherback swims some km mi to its nesting beaches Most turtles create a nest for their eggs Females usually dig a flask like chamber in the substrate Other species lay their eggs in vegetation or crevices Females choose nesting locations based on environmental factors such as temperature and humidity which are important for developing embryos Depending on the species the number of eggs laid varies from one to over Larger females can lay eggs that are greater in number or bigger in size Compared to freshwater turtles tortoises deposit fewer but larger eggs Females can lay multiple clutches throughout a season particularly in species that experience unpredictable monsoons br br Most mother turtles do no more in the way of parental care than covering their eggs and immediately leaving though some species guard their nests for days or weeks Eggs vary between rounded oval elongated and between hard and soft shelled Most species have their sex determined by temperature In some species higher temperatures produce females and lower ones produce males while in others milder temperatures produce males and both hot and cold extremes produce females There is experimental evidence that the embryos of Mauremys reevesii can move around inside their eggs to select the best temperature for development thus influencing their sexual destiny In other species sex is determined genetically The length of incubation for turtle eggs varies from two to three months for temperate species and four months to over a year for tropical species Species that live in warm temperate climates can delay their development br Hatching young turtles break out of the shell using an egg tooth a sharp projection that exists temporarily on their upper beak Hatchlings dig themselves out of the nest and find safety in vegetation or water Some species stay in the nest for longer be it for overwintering or to wait for the rain to loosen the soil for them to dig out Young turtles are highly vulnerable to predators both in the egg and as hatchlings Mortality is high during this period but significantly decreases when they reach adulthood Most species grow quickly during their early years and slow down when they are mature br br br Lifespan br Turtles can live long lives The oldest living turtle and land animal is said to be a Seychelles giant tortoise named Jonathan who turned in A Gal pagos tortoise named Harriet was collected by Charles Darwin in it died in having lived for at least years Most wild turtles do not reach that age Turtles keep growing new scutes under the previous scutes every year allowing researchers to estimate how long they have lived They also age slowly The survival rate for adult turtles can reach per year br br br Systematics and evolution br br br Fossil history br br Zoologists have sought to explain the evolutionary origin of the turtles and in particular of their unique shells In Jan Versluys proposed that bony plates in the dermis called osteoderms fused to the ribs beneath them later called the Polka Dot Ancestor by Olivier Rieppel The theory accounted for the evolution of fossil pareiasaurs from Bradysaurus to Anthodon but not for how the ribs could have become attached to the bony dermal plates br More recent discoveries have painted a different scenario for the evolution of the turtle s shell The stem turtles Eunotosaurus of the Middle Permian Pappochelys of the Middle Triassic and Eorhynchochelys of the Late Triassic lacked carapaces and plastrons but had shortened torsos expanded ribs and lengthened dorsal vertebrae Also in the Late Triassic Odontochelys had a partial shell consisting of a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace The development of a shell reached completion with the Late Triassic Proganochelys with its fully developed carapace and plastron Adaptations that led to the evolution of the shell may have originally been for digging and a fossorial lifestyle br The oldest known members of the Pleurodira lineage are the Platychelyidae from the Late Jurassic The oldest known unambiguous cryptodire is Sinaspideretes a close relative of softshell turtles from the Late Jurassic of China During the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic members of the pleurodire families Bothremydidae and Podocnemididae became widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere due to their coastal habits The oldest known soft shelled turtles and sea turtles appeared during the Early Cretaceous Tortoises originated in Asia during the Eocene A late surviving group of stem turtles the Meiolaniidae survived in Australasia into the Pleistocene and Holocene br br br External relationships br The turtles exact ancestry has been disputed It was believed they were the only surviving branch of the ancient evolutionary grade Anapsida which includes groups such as procolophonids and pareiasaurs All anapsid skulls lack a temporal opening while all other living amniotes have temporal openings It was later suggested that the anapsid like turtle skulls may be due to backward evolution rather than to anapsid descent Fossil evidence has shown that early stem turtles possessed small temporal openings br Some early morphological phylogenetic studies have placed turtles closer to Lepidosauria tuataras lizards and snakes than to Archosauria crocodilians and birds By contrast several molecular studies place turtles either within Archosauria or more commonly as a sister group to extant archosaurs though an analysis conducted by Tyler Lyson and colleagues recovered turtles as the sister group of lepidosaurs instead Ylenia Chiari and colleagues analyzed nuclear genes from vertebrates and suggested that turtles share a more recent common ancestor with birds and crocodilians The date of separation of turtles and birds and crocodilians was estimated to be million years ago during the Permian Through genomic scale phylogenetic study of ultra conserved elements UCEs to clarify the placement of turtles within reptiles Nicholas Crawford and colleagues similarly found that turtles are closer to birds and crocodilians br Using the draft unfinished genome sequences of the green sea turtle and the Chinese softshell turtle Zhuo Wang and colleagues concluded that turtles are likely a sister group of crocodilians and birds The external phylogeny of the turtles is shown in the cladogram below br br br Internal relationships br Modern turtles and their extinct relatives with a complete shell are classified within the clade Testudinata The most recent common ancestor of living turtles corresponding to the split between Pleurodira side necked species and Cryptodira hidden necked species is estimated to have occurred around million years ago during the Late Triassic Robert Thompson and colleagues comment that living turtles have low diversity relative to how long they existed Diversity has been stable according to their analysis except for a single rapid increase around the Eocene Oligocene boundary some million years ago and a large regional extinction at roughly the same time They suggest that global climate change caused both events as the cooling and drying caused the land to become arid and turtles to become extinct there while new continental margins opened up by the climate change provided habitats for other species to evolve br The cladogram from Nicholas Crawford and colleagues shows the internal phylogeny of the Testudines down to the level of families The analysis by Thompson and colleagues in supports the same structure down to the family level br br br Differences between the two suborders br br Turtles are divided into two living suborders Cryptodira and Pleurodira The two groups differ in the way the neck is retracted for protection Pleurodirans retract their neck to the side and in front of the shoulder girdles whereas cryptodirans retract their neck backward into their shell These motions are enabled by the morphology and arrangement of neck vertebrae Sea turtles which belong to Cryptodira have mostly lost the ability to retract their heads br The adductor muscles in the lower jaw create a pulley like system in both subgroups However the bones that the muscles articulate with differ In Pleurodira the pulley is formed with the pterygoid bones of the palate but in Cryptodira the pulley is formed with the otic capsule Both systems help to vertically redirect the adductor muscles and maintain a powerful bite br A further difference between the suborders is the attachment of the pelvis In Cryptodira the pelvis is free linked to the shell only by ligaments In Pleurodira the pelvis is sutured joined with bony connections to the carapace and to the plastron creating a pair of large columns of bone at the back end of the turtle linking the two parts of the shell br br br Distribution and habitat br Turtles are widely distributed across the world s continents oceans and islands with terrestrial fully aquatic and semi aquatic species Sea turtles are mainly tropical and subtropical but leatherbacks can be found in colder areas of the Atlantic and Pacific Living Pleurodira all live in freshwater and are found only in the Southern Hemisphere The Cryptodira include terrestrial freshwater and marine species and these range more widely The world regions richest in non marine turtle species are the Amazon basin the Gulf of Mexico drainages of the United States and parts of South and Southeast Asia br For turtles in colder climates their distribution is limited by constraints on reproduction which is reduced by long hibernations North American species barely range above the southern Canadian border Some turtles are found at high altitudes for example the species Terrapene ornata occurs up to m ft in New Mexico Conversely the leatherback sea turtle can dive over m ft Species of the genus Gopherus can tolerate both below freezing and over C F in body temperature though they are most active at C F br br br Conservation br br Among vertebrate orders turtles are second only to primates in the percentage of threatened species modern species have existed since AD Of these are considered threatened and considered threatened or extinct Turtles face many threats including habitat destruction harvesting for consumption the pet trade light pollution and climate change Asian species have a particularly high extinction risk primarily due to their long term unsustainable exploitation for food and medicine and about of Asia s non marine turtle species are considered threatened As of turtle extinction is progressing much faster than during the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction At this rate all turtles could be extinct in a few centuries br Turtle hatcheries can be set up when protection against flooding erosion predation or heavy poaching is required Chinese markets have sought to satisfy an increasing demand for turtle meat with farmed turtles In it was estimated that over a thousand turtle farms operated in China All the same wild turtles continue to be caught and sent to market in large numbers resulting in what conservationists have called the Asian turtle crisis In the words of the biologist George Amato the hunting of turtles vacuumed up entire species from areas in Southeast Asia even as biologists still did not know how many species lived in the region In all the Asian box turtles were placed on the CITES list of endangered species br Harvesting wild turtles is legal in some American states and there has been a growing demand for American turtles in China The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimated in that around pounds of softshell turtles were exported weekly via Tampa International Airport However the great majority of turtles exported from the US between and were farmed br Large numbers of sea turtles are accidentally killed in longlines gillnets and trawling nets as bycatch A study suggested that over million had been killed between and the Eastern Pacific and the Mediterranean were identified as among the areas worst affected Since the s the United States has required all shrimp trawlers to fit their nets with turtle excluder devices that prevent turtles from being entangled in the net and drowning br More locally other human activities are affecting marine turtles In Australia Queensland s shark culling program which uses shark nets and drum lines has killed over turtles as bycatch between and including loggerhead turtles and hawksbill sea turtles which are listed as critically endangered br Native turtle populations can also be threatened by invasive ones The central North American red eared slider turtle has been listed among the world s worst invasive species pet turtle having been released globally They appear to compete with native turtle species in eastern and western North America Europe and Japan br br br Human uses br br br On space flights br Two tortoises were on the Soviet Union s September Zond circumlunar flight making them the first earthly living things to travel to the vicinity of the Moon Turtles were also on the Zond and the Zond circumlunar flights br br br In culture br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Turtles have featured in human cultures across the world since ancient times They are generally viewed positively despite not being cuddly or flashy their association with the ancient times and old age have contributed to their endearing image br In Hindu mythology the World Turtle named Kurma or Kacchapa supports four elephants on his back they in turn carry the weight of the whole world on their backs The turtle is one of the ten avatars or incarnations of the god Vishnu The yoga pose Kurmasana is named for the avatar World Turtles are found in Native American cultures including the Algonquian Iroquois and Lenape They tell many versions of the creation story of Turtle Island One version has Muskrat pile up earth on Turtle s back creating the continent of North America An Iroquois version has the pregnant Sky Woman fall through a hole in the sky between a tree s roots where she is caught by birds who land her safely on Turtle s back the Earth grows around her The turtle here is altruistic but the world is a heavy burden and the turtle sometimes shakes itself to relieve the load causing earthquakes br A turtle was the symbol of the Ancient Mesopotamian god Enki from the rd millennium BCE onward An ancient Greek origin myth told that only the tortoise refused the invitation of the gods Zeus and Hera to their wedding as it preferred to stay at home Zeus then ordered it to carry its house with it ever after Another of their gods Hermes invented a seven stringed lyre made with the shell of a tortoise In the Shang dynasty Chinese practice of plastromancy dating back to BCE oracles were obtained by inscribing questions on turtle plastrons using the oldest known form of Chinese characters burning the plastron and interpreting the resulting cracks Later the turtle was one of the four sacred animals in Confucianism while in the Han period steles were mounted on top of stone turtles later linked with Bixi the turtle shelled son of the Dragon King Marine turtles feature significantly in Australian Aboriginal art The army of Ancient Rome used the testudo tortoise formation where soldiers would form a shield wall for protection br In Aesop s Fables The Tortoise and the Hare tells how an unequal race may be won by the slower partner Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland features a Mock Turtle
