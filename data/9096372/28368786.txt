A zoo key is a large novelty key used to activate talking storybooks at American zoos These were used by various zoos largely in the latter half of the th century as part of a system which played audio recordings describing exhibits The keys were typically made from brightly colored plastic in the shape of animals although some zoos issued the keys in non animal shapes br The first generation of keys were in the shape of an elephant with the trunk being the blade of the key This was commonly known as Trunkey the Elephant sometimes spelled Trunky At the Cleveland Zoo it was called Packey br Installations included zoos in Portland see Packy San Francisco Cleveland Detroit Philadelphia Cincinnati New Orleans and New York br br br Children s Fairyland br The system was invented and patented by Bruce Sedley in response to a request from William Penn Mott of the Oakland California Park Department Originally known as Talking Storybooks and implemented with a different shaped key the first version of the system was installed at Children s Fairyland in br Predating the Talking Storybooks Children s Fairyland had a similar system based on coin operated record players which would frequently break down Sedley devised a more reliable implementation using the more modern magnetic tape system with the audio program recorded on a tape loop The concept was based on message repeater devices Sedley was using in his recording studio The first units produced used Sedley s voice later production switched to using celebrity voices br As of April the system is still in use there with new Magic Keys available for purchase at br A version of the Talking Storybook system is still being produced as of manufactured by The Talking Storybook Company in Santa Cruz California Sedley later
