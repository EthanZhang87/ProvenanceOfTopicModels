id: 10153680
Fluoxetine sold under the brand name Prozac among others is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI class It is used for the treatment of major depressive disorder obsessive compulsive disorder OCD anxiety bulimia nervosa panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder It is also approved for treatment of major depressive disorder in adolescents and children years of age and over It has also been used to treat premature ejaculation Fluoxetine is taken by mouth br Common side effects include indigestion trouble sleeping sexual dysfunction loss of appetite nausea diarrhea dry mouth and rash Serious side effects include serotonin syndrome mania seizures an increased risk of suicidal behavior in people under years old and an increased risk of bleeding Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is less likely to occur with fluoxetine than with other antidepressants but it still happens in many cases Fluoxetine taken during pregnancy is associated with significant increase in congenital heart defects in the newborns It has been suggested that fluoxetine therapy may be continued during breastfeeding if it was used during pregnancy or if other antidepressants were ineffective br Fluoxetine was invented by Eli Lilly and Company in and entered medical use in It is on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines It is available as a generic medication In it was the th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than million prescriptions Lilly also markets fluoxetine in a fixed dose combination with olanzapine as olanzapine fluoxetine Symbyax br br br Medical uses br br Fluoxetine is frequently used to treat major depressive disorder obsessive compulsive disorder OCD post traumatic stress disorder PTSD bulimia nervosa panic disorder premenstrual dysphoric disorder and trichotillomania It has also been used for cataplexy obesity and alcohol dependence as well as binge eating disorder Fluoxetine seems to be ineffective for social anxiety disorder Studies do not support a benefit in children with autism though there is tentative evidence for its benefit in adult autism Fluoxetine together with fluvoxamine has shown some initial promise as a potential treatment for reducing COVID severity if given early br br br Depression br Fluoxetine is approved for the treatment of major depression in children and adults Meta analysis of trials in adults conclude that fluoxetine modestly outperforms placebo Fluoxetine may be less effective than other antidepressants but has high acceptability br For children and adolescents with moderate to severe depressive disorder fluoxetine seems to be the best treatment either with or without cognitive behavioural therapy although fluoxetine alone does not appear to be superior to CBT alone but more research is needed to be certain as effect sizes are small and the existing evidence is of dubious quality A systematic review and trial restoration of the two original blinded control trials used to approve the use of fluoxetine in children and adolescents with depression found that both of the trials were severely flawed and therefore did not demonstrate the safety or efficacy of the medication br br br Obsessive compulsive disorder br Fluoxetine is effective in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder OCD for adults It is also effective for treating OCD in children and adolescents The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry state that SSRIs including fluoxetine should be used as first line therapy in children along with cognitive behavioral therapy CBT for the treatment of moderate to severe OCD br br br Panic disorder br The efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two week randomized multicenter phase III clinical trials that enrolled patients diagnosed with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia In the first trial of subjects in the fluoxetine treated arm were free of panic attacks at the end of the study vs in the placebo arm In the second trial of fluoxetine treated patients were free of panic attacks at the end of the study vs in the placebo arm br br br Bulimia nervosa br A systematic review discussed seven trials which compared fluoxetine to a placebo in the treatment of bulimia nervosa six of which found a statistically significant reduction in symptoms such as vomiting and binge eating However no difference was observed between treatment arms when fluoxetine and psychotherapy were compared to psychotherapy alone br br br Premenstrual dysphoric disorder br Fluoxetine is used to treat premenstrual dysphoric disorder a condition where individuals have affective and somatic symptoms monthly during the luteal phase of menstruation Taking fluoxetine mg d can be effective in treating PMDD though doses of mg d have also been prescribed effectively br br br Impulsive aggression br Fluoxetine is considered a first line medication for the treatment of impulsive aggression of low intensity Fluoxetine reduced low intensity aggressive behavior in patients in intermittent aggressive disorder and borderline personality disorder Fluoxetine also reduced acts of domestic violence in alcoholics with a history of such behavior br br br Obesity and overweight adults br In a systematic review compared the effects on weight of various doses of fluoxetine mg d mg d mg d mg d in obese and overweight adults When compared to placebo all dosages of fluoxetine appeared to contribute to weight loss but lead to increased risk of experiencing side effects such as dizziness drowsiness fatigue insomnia and nausea during period of treatment However these conclusions were from low certainty evidence When comparing in the same review the effects of fluoxetine on weight of obese and overweight adults to other anti obesity agents omega gel capsule and not receiving a treatment the authors could not reach conclusive results due to poor quality of evidence br br br Special populations br In children and adolescents fluoxetine is the antidepressant of choice due to tentative evidence favoring its efficacy and tolerability Evidence supporting an increased risk of major fetal malformations resulting from fluoxetine exposure is limited although the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA of the United Kingdom has warned prescribers and patients of the potential for fluoxetine exposure in the first trimester during organogenesis formation of the fetal organs to cause a slight increase in the risk of congenital cardiac malformations in the newborn Furthermore an association between fluoxetine use during the first trimester and an increased risk of minor fetal malformations was observed in one study br However a systematic review and meta analysis of studies published in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada concluded the apparent increased risk of fetal cardiac malformations associated with maternal use of fluoxetine has recently been shown also in depressed women who deferred SSRI therapy in pregnancy and therefore most probably reflects an ascertainment bias Overall women who are treated with fluoxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy do not appear to have an increased risk of major fetal malformations br Per the FDA infants exposed to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn Limited data support this risk but the FDA recommends physicians consider tapering SSRIs such as fluoxetine during the third trimester A review recommended against fluoxetine as a first line SSRI during lactation stating Fluoxetine should be viewed as a less preferred SSRI for breastfeeding mothers particularly with newborn infants and in those mothers who consumed fluoxetine during gestation Sertraline is often the preferred SSRI during pregnancy due to the relatively minimal fetal exposure observed and its safety profile while breastfeeding br br br Adverse effects br Side effects observed in fluoxetine treated persons in clinical trials with an incidence and at least twice as common in fluoxetine treated persons compared to those who received a placebo pill include abnormal dreams abnormal ejaculation anorexia anxiety asthenia diarrhea dizziness dry mouth dyspepsia fatigue flu syndrome impotence insomnia decreased libido nausea nervousness pharyngitis rash sinusitis somnolence sweating tremor vasodilation and yawning Fluoxetine is considered the most stimulating of the SSRIs that is it is most prone to causing insomnia and agitation It also appears to be the most prone of the SSRIs for producing dermatologic reactions e g urticaria hives rash itchiness etc br br br Sexual dysfunction br br Sexual dysfunction including loss of libido erectile dysfunction lack of vaginal lubrication and anorgasmia are some of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with fluoxetine and other SSRIs While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is br In the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee of the European Medicines Agency recommended that packaging leaflets of selected SSRIs and SNRIs should be amended to include information regarding a possible risk of persistent sexual dysfunction Following on the European assessment a safety review by Health Canada could neither confirm nor rule out a causal link which was long lasting in rare cases but recommended that healthcare professionals inform patients about the potential risk of long lasting sexual dysfunction despite discontinuation of treatment br br br Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome br Fluoxetine s longer half life makes it less common to develop antidepressant discontinuation syndrome following cessation of therapy especially when compared with antidepressants with shorter half lives such as paroxetine Although gradual dose reductions are recommended with antidepressants with shorter half lives tapering may not be necessary with fluoxetine br br br Pregnancy br Antidepressant exposure including fluoxetine is associated with shorter average duration of pregnancy by three days increased risk of preterm delivery by lower birth weight by g and lower Apgar scores by points There is increase in congenital heart defects among children whose mothers were prescribed fluoxetine during pregnancy with fluoxetine use in the first trimester associated with increase in septal heart defects br br br Suicide br br In October the FDA added a black box warning to all antidepressant drugs regarding use in children In the FDA included adults aged or younger Statistical analyses conducted by two independent groups of FDA experts found a fold increase of the suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents and fold increase of suicidality in the age group The suicidality was slightly decreased for those older than and statistically significantly lower in the and older group This analysis was criticized by Donald Klein who noted that suicidality that is suicidal ideation and behavior is not necessarily a good surrogate marker for suicide and it is still possible while unproven that antidepressants may prevent actual suicide while increasing suicidality In February the Food and Drug Administration FDA ordered an update to the warnings based on statistical evidence from twenty four trials in which the risk of such events increased from two percent to four percent relative to the placebo trials br On September Joseph T Wesbecker killed eight people and injured twelve before committing suicide His relatives and victims blamed his actions on the Prozac medication he had begun taking a month prior The incident set off a chain of lawsuits and public outcries Lawyers began using Prozac to justify the abnormal behaviors of their clients Eli Lilly was accused of not doing enough to warn patients and doctors about the adverse effects which it had described as activation years prior to the incident br There is less data on fluoxetine than on antidepressants as a whole In the FDA had to combine the results of trials of antidepressants for psychiatric indications to obtain statistically significant results Considered separately fluoxetine use in children increased the odds of suicidality by and in adults decreased the odds of suicidality by approximately A study published in May found that fluoxetine was more likely to increase overall suicidal behavior of the patients n on fluoxetine had suicidal events compared to in the psychotherapy group and from the combined treatment group Similarly the analysis conducted by the UK MHRA found a increase in suicide related events not reaching statistical significance in the children and adolescents on fluoxetine as compared to the ones on placebo According to the MHRA data fluoxetine did not change the rate of self harm in adults and statistically significantly decreased suicidal ideation by br br br QT prolongation br Fluoxetine can affect the electrical currents that heart muscle cells use to coordinate their contraction specifically the potassium currents Ito and IKs that repolarise the cardiac action potential Under certain circumstances this can lead to prolongation of the QT interval a measurement made on an electrocardiogram reflecting how long it takes for the heart to electrically recharge after each heartbeat When fluoxetine is taken alongside other drugs that prolong the QT interval or by those with a susceptibility to long QT syndrome there is a small risk of potentially lethal abnormal heart rhythms such as torsades de pointes A study completed in found that fluoxetine does not alter the QT interval and has no clinically meaningful effects on the cardiac action potential br br br Overdose br br In overdose most frequent adverse effects include br br br Interactions br Contraindications include prior treatment within the past weeks depending on the dose with MAOIs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine due to the potential for serotonin syndrome Its use should also be avoided in those with known hypersensitivities to fluoxetine or any of the other ingredients in the formulation used Its use in those concurrently receiving pimozide or thioridazine is also advised against br In case of short term administration of codeine for pain management it is advised to monitor and adjust dosage Codeine might not provide sufficient analgesia when fluoxetine is co administered If opioid treatment is required oxycodone use should be monitored since oxycodone is metabolized by the cytochrome P CYP enzyme system and fluoxetine and paroxetine are potent inhibitors of CYP D enzymes This means combinations of codeine or oxycodone with fluoxetine antidepressant may lead to reduced analgesia br In some cases use of dextromethorphan containing cold and cough medications with fluoxetine is advised against due to fluoxetine increasing serotonin levels as well as the fact that fluoxetine is a cytochrome P D inhibitor which causes dextromethorphan to not be metabolized at a normal rate thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome and other potential side effects of dextromethorphan br Patients who are taking NSAIDs antiplatelet drugs anticoagulants omega fatty acids vitamin E and garlic supplements must be careful when taking fluoxetine or other SSRIs as they can sometimes increase the blood thinning effects of these medications br Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit many isozymes of the cytochrome P system that are involved in drug metabolism Both are potent inhibitors of CYP D which is also the chief enzyme responsible for their metabolism and CYP C and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP B and CYP C In vivo fluoxetine and norfluoxetine do not significantly affect the activity of CYP A and CYP A They also inhibit the activity of P glycoprotein a type of membrane transport protein that plays an important role in drug transport and metabolism and hence P glycoprotein substrates such as loperamide may have their central effects potentiated This extensive effect on the body s pathways for drug metabolism creates the potential for interactions with many commonly used drugs br Its use should also be avoided in those receiving other serotonergic drugs such as monoamine oxidase inhibitors tricyclic antidepressants methamphetamine amphetamine MDMA triptans buspirone ginseng dextromethorphan DXM linezolid tramadol serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and other SSRIs due to the potential for serotonin syndrome to develop as a result br Fluoxetine may also increase the risk of opioid overdose in some instances in part due to its inhibitory effect on cytochrome P Similar to how fluoxetine can effect the metabolization of dextromethorphan it may cause medications like oxycodone to not be metabolized at a normal rate thus increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome as well as resulting in an increased concentration of oxycodone in the blood which may lead to accidental overdose br A study which examined the health insurance claims of over million Americans who began taking oxycodone while using SSRIs between and found that patients taking paroxetine or fluoxetine had a higher risk of overdosing on oxycodone than those using other SSRIs br There is also the potential for interaction with highly protein bound drugs due to the potential for fluoxetine to displace said drugs from the plasma or vice versa hence increasing serum concentrations of either fluoxetine or the offending agent br br br Pharmacology br br br Pharmacodynamics br Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI and does not appreciably inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake at therapeutic doses It does however delay the reuptake of serotonin resulting in serotonin persisting longer when it is released Large doses in rats have been shown to induce a significant increase in synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine Thus dopamine and norepinephrine may contribute to the antidepressant action of fluoxetine in humans at supratherapeutic doses mg This effect may be mediated by HT C receptors which are inhibited by higher concentrations of fluoxetine br Fluoxetine increases the concentration of circulating allopregnanolone a potent GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulator in the brain Norfluoxetine a primary active metabolite of fluoxetine produces a similar effect on allopregnanolone levels in the brains of mice Additionally both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are such modulators themselves actions which may be clinically relevant br In addition fluoxetine has been found to act as an agonist of the receptor with a potency greater than that of citalopram but less than that of fluvoxamine However the significance of this property is not fully clear Fluoxetine also functions as a channel blocker of anoctamin a calcium activated chloride channel A number of other ion channels including nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and HT receptors are also known to be inhibited at similar concentrations br Fluoxetine has been shown to inhibit acid sphingomyelinase a key regulator of ceramide levels which derives ceramide from sphingomyelin br br br Mechanism of action br While it is unclear how fluoxetine exerts its effect on mood it has been suggested that fluoxetine elicits antidepressant effect by inhibiting serotonin reuptake in the synapse by binding to the reuptake pump on the neuronal membrane to increase serotonin availability and enhance neurotransmission Over time this leads to a downregulation of pre synaptic HT A receptors which is associated with an improvement in passive stress tolerance and delayed downstream increase in expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor which may contribute to a reduction in negative affective biases Norfluoxetine and desmethylfluoxetine are metabolites of fluoxetine and also act as serotonin reuptake inhibitors increasing the duration of action of the drug br Prolonged exposure to fluoxetine changes the expression of genes involved in myelination a process that shapes brain connectivity and contributes to symptoms of psychiatric disorders The regulation of genes involved with myelination is partially responsible for the long term therapeutic benefits of chronic SSRI exposure br br br Pharmacokinetics br br The bioavailability of fluoxetine is relatively high and peak plasma concentrations are reached in hours It is highly bound to plasma proteins mostly albumin and glycoprotein Fluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by isoenzymes of the cytochrome P system including CYP D The role of CYP D in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important as there is great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme among people CYP D is responsible for converting fluoxetine to its only active metabolite norfluoxetine Both drugs are also potent inhibitors of CYP D br The extremely slow elimination of fluoxetine and its active metabolite norfluoxetine from the body distinguishes it from other antidepressants With time fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit their own metabolism so fluoxetine elimination half life increases from to days after a single dose to to days after long term use Similarly the half life of norfluoxetine is longer days after long term use Therefore the concentration of the drug and its active metabolite in the blood continues to grow through the first few weeks of treatment and their steady concentration in the blood is achieved only after four weeks Moreover the brain concentration of fluoxetine and its metabolites keeps increasing through at least the first five weeks of treatment For major depressive disorder while onset of antidepressant action may be felt as early as weeks the full benefit of the current dose a patient receives is not realized for at least a month following ingestion For example in one week study the median time to achieving consistent response was days Likewise complete excretion of the drug may take several weeks During the first week after treatment discontinuation the brain concentration of fluoxetine decreases by only The blood level of norfluoxetine four weeks after treatment discontinuation is about of the level registered by the end of the first treatment week and seven weeks after discontinuation norfluoxetine is still detectable in the blood br br br Measurement in body fluids br Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine may be quantitated in blood plasma or serum to monitor therapy confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized person or assist in a medicolegal death investigation Blood or plasma fluoxetine concentrations are usually in a range of g L in persons taking the drug for its antidepressant effects g L in survivors of acute overdosage and g L in victims of fatal overdosage Norfluoxetine concentrations are approximately equal to those of the parent drug during chronic therapy but may be substantially less following acute overdosage since it requires at least weeks for the metabolite to achieve equilibrium br br br History br The work which eventually led to the discovery of fluoxetine began at Eli Lilly and Company in as a collaboration between Bryan Molloy and Ray Fuller It was known at that time that the antihistamine diphenhydramine showed some antidepressant like properties Phenoxy phenylpropylamine a compound structurally similar to diphenhydramine was taken as a starting point Molloy and fellow Eli Lilly chemist Klaus Schmiegel synthesized a series of dozens of its derivatives Hoping to find a derivative inhibiting only serotonin reuptake another Eli Lilly scientist David T Wong proposed to retest the series for the in vitro reuptake of serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine using a technique developed by neuroscientist Solomon Snyder This test showed the compound later named fluoxetine to be the most potent and selective inhibitor of serotonin reuptake of the series The first article about fluoxetine was published in following talks given at FASEB and ASPET A year later it was given the official chemical name fluoxetine and the Eli Lilly and Company gave it the brand name Prozac In February Dista Products Company a division of Eli Lilly Company filed an Investigational New Drug application to the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA for fluoxetine br Fluoxetine appeared on the Belgian market in In the U S the FDA gave its final approval in December and a month later Eli Lilly began marketing Prozac annual sales in the U S reached million within a year Worldwide sales eventually reached a peak of billion a year br Lilly tried several product line extension strategies including extended release formulations and paying for clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in premenstrual dysphoric disorder and rebranding fluoxetine for that indication as Sarafem after it was approved by the FDA in following the recommendation of an advisory committee in The invention of using fluoxetine to treat PMDD was made by Richard Wurtman at MIT the patent was licensed to his startup Interneuron which in turn sold it to Lilly br To defend its Prozac revenue from generic competition Lilly also fought a five year multimillion dollar battle in court with the generic company Barr Pharmaceuticals to protect its patents on fluoxetine and lost the cases for its line extension patents other than those for Sarafem opening fluoxetine to generic manufacturers starting in When Lilly s patent expired in August generic drug competition decreased Lilly s sales of fluoxetine by within two months br In an investment bank had projected that annual sales of Sarafem could reach M year Sales of Sarafem reached about M year in and in that year Lilly sold its assets connected with the drug for M to Galen Holdings a small Irish pharmaceutical company specializing in dermatology and women s health that had a sales force tasked to gynecologists offices analysts found the deal sensible since the annual sales of Sarafem made a material financial difference to Galen but not to Lilly br Bringing Sarafem to market harmed Lilly s reputation in some quarters The diagnostic category of PMDD was controversial since it was first proposed in and Lilly s role in retaining it in the appendix of the DSM IV TR the discussions for which got under way in has been criticized Lilly was criticized for inventing a disease in order to make money and for not innovating but rather just seeking ways to continue making money from existing drugs It was also criticized by the FDA and groups concerned with women s health for marketing Sarafem too aggressively when it was first launched the campaign included a television commercial featuring a harried woman at the grocery store who asks herself if she has PMDD br br br Society and culture br br br Prescription trends br In over million prescriptions for generic fluoxetine were filled in the United States making it the third most prescribed antidepressant after sertraline and citalopram br In million prescriptions for fluoxetine were filled in the United Kingdom Between and along with amitriptyline it was the most commonly prescribed first antidepressant for adolescents aged years in England br br br Environmental effects br Fluoxetine has been detected in aquatic ecosystems especially in North America There is a growing body of research addressing the effects of fluoxetine among other SSRIs exposure on non target aquatic species br In one of the first studies addressed in detail the potential effects of fluoxetine on aquatic wildlife this research concluded that exposure at environmental concentrations was of little risk to aquatic systems if a hazard quotient approach was applied to risk assessment However they also stated the need for further research addressing sub lethal consequences of fluoxetine specifically focusing on study species sensitivity behavioural responses and endpoints modulated by the serotonin system br Fluoxetine similar to several other SSRIs induces reproductive behavior in some shellfish at concentrations as low as M or parts per trillion br Since a number of studies have reported fluoxetine induced impacts on a number of behavioural and physiological endpoints inducing antipredator behaviour reproduction and foraging at or below field detected concentrations However a review on the ecotoxicology of fluoxetine concluded that at that time a consensus on the ability of environmentally realistic dosages to affect the behaviour of wildlife could not be reached At environmentally realistic concentrations fluoxetine alters insect emergence timing Richmond et al find that at low concentrations it accelerates emergence of Diptera while at unusually high concentrations it has no discernable effect br Several common plants are known to absorb fluoxetine Several crops have been tested and Redshaw et al find that cauliflower absorbs large amounts into the stem and leaf but not the head or root Wu et al find that lettuce and spinach also absorb detectable amounts while Carter et al find that radish Raphanus sativus ryegrass Lolium perenne and Wu et al find that soybean Glycine max absorb little Wu tested all tissues of soybean and all showed only low concentrations By contrast various Reinhold et al find duckweeds have a high uptake of fluoxetine and show promise for bioremediation of contaminated water especially Lemna minor and Landoltia punctata Ecotoxicity for organisms involved in aquaculture is well documented Fluoxetine affects both aquacultured invertebrates and vertebrates and inhibits soil microbes including a large antibacterial effect For applications of this see Other uses br br br Politics br During the campaign for governor of Florida it was disclosed that one of the candidates Lawton Chiles had depression and had resumed taking fluoxetine leading his political opponents to question his fitness to serve as governor br br br American aircraft pilots br Beginning in April fluoxetine became one of four antidepressant drugs that the FAA permitted for pilots with authorization from an aviation medical examiner The other permitted antidepressants are sertraline Zoloft citalopram Celexa and escitalopram Lexapro These four remain the only antidepressants permitted by FAA as of December br Sertraline citalopram and escitalopram are the only antidepressants permitted for EASA medical certification as of January br br br Research br The antibacterial effect in described above Environmental effects could be applied against multiresistant biotypes in crop bacterial diseases and bacterial aquaculture diseases In a glucocorticoid receptor defective zebrafish mutant Danio rerio with reduced exploratory behavior fluoxetine rescued the normal exploratory behavior This demonstrates relationships between glucocorticoids fluoxetine and exploration in this fish br Fluoxetine has an anti nematode effect Choy et al finds some of this effect is due to interference with certain transmembrane proteins br br br Veterinary use br Fluoxetine is commonly used and effective in treating anxiety related behaviours and separation anxiety in dogs especially when given as supplementation to behaviour modification br br br See also br List of antidepressants br br br br br br Further reading br br br External links
