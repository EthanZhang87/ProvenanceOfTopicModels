title: Pelagic fish
id: 2636111
Pelagic fish live in the pelagic zone of ocean or lake waters being neither close to the bottom nor near the shore in contrast with demersal fish that live on or near the bottom and reef fish that are associated with coral reefs br The marine pelagic environment is the largest aquatic habitat on Earth occupying million cubic kilometres million cubic miles and is the habitat for of known fish species The oceans have a mean depth of metres miles About of the total water volume is below metres ft and is below metres ft br Marine pelagic fish can be divided into coastal inshore fish and oceanic offshore fish Coastal pelagic fish inhabit the relatively shallow and sunlit waters above the continental shelf while oceanic pelagic fish inhabit the vast and deep waters beyond the continental shelf even though they also may swim inshore br Pelagic fish range in size from small coastal forage fish such as herrings and sardines to large apex predator oceanic fishes such as bluefin tuna and oceanic sharks They are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies capable of sustained cruising on long distance migrations Many pelagic fish swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes Others such as the large ocean sunfish are solitary There are also freshwater pelagic fish in some of the larger lakes such as the Lake Tanganyika sardine br br br Epipelagic fish br br Epipelagic fish inhabit the epipelagic zone the uppermost layer of the water column ranging from sea level down to m ft It is also referred to as the surface waters or the sunlit zone and includes the photic zone The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the depth where the sunlight is attenuated to of the surface value This depth depends on how turbid the water is but can extend to m ft in clear water coinciding with the epipelagic zone The photic zone allows sufficient light for phytoplankton to photosynthesize br A vast habitat for most pelagic fish the epipelagic zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action and can be a good habitat for algae to grow However it is an almost featureless habitat This lack of habitat variation results in a lack of species diversity so the zone supports less than of the world s known fish species Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the continental shelves where land runoff can provide nutrients or in those parts of the ocean where upwelling moves nutrients into the area br Epipelagic fish can be divided broadly into small forage fish and larger predator fish that feed on them Forage fish school and filter feed on plankton Most epipelagic fish have streamlined bodies capable of sustained cruising on migrations In general predatory and forage fish share the same morphological features Predator fish are usually fusiform with large mouths smooth bodies and deeply forked tails Many use vision to prey on zooplankton or smaller fish while others filter feed on plankton br br Most epipelagic predator fish and their smaller prey fish are countershaded with silvery colours that reduce visibility by scattering incoming light The silvering is achieved with reflective fish scales that function as small mirrors This may give an effect of transparency At medium depths at sea light comes from above so a mirror that is oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side br In the shallower epipelagic waters the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin as they would fail to reflect horizontally The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors all oriented vertically br Although the number of species is limited epipelagic fishes are abundant What they lack in diversity they make up for in numbers Forage fish occur in huge numbers and large fish that prey on them often are sought after as premier food fish As a group epipelagic fishes form the most valuable fisheries in the world br Many forage fish are facultative predators that can pick individual copepods or fish larvae out of the water column and then change to filter feeding on phytoplankton when that gives better results energetically Filter feeding fish usually use long fine gill rakers to strain small organisms from the water column Some of the largest epipelagic fishes such as the basking shark and whale shark are filter feeders and so are some of the smallest such as adult sprats and anchovies br Ocean waters that are exceptionally clear contain little food Areas of high productivity tend to be somewhat turbid from plankton blooms These attract the filter feeding plankton eaters which in turn attract the higher predators Tuna fishing tends to be optimum when water turbidity measured by the maximum depth a secchi disc can be seen during a sunny day is to metres br br br Floating objects br br Epipelagic fish are fascinated by floating objects They aggregate in considerable numbers around objects such as drifting flotsam rafts jellyfish and floating seaweed The objects appear to provide a visual stimulus in an optical void Floating objects may offer refuge for juvenile fish from predators An abundance of drifting seaweed or jellyfish can result in significant increases in the survival rates of some juvenile species br Many coastal juveniles use seaweed for the shelter and the food that is available from invertebrates and other fish associated with it Drifting seaweed particularly the pelagic Sargassum provide a niche habitat with its own shelter and food and even supports its own unique fauna such as the sargassum fish One study off Florida found species from families living in flotsam from Sargassum mats Jellyfish also are used by juvenile fish for shelter and food even though jellyfish can prey on small fish br Mobile oceanic species such as tuna can be captured by travelling long distances in large fishing vessels A simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects When fishermen use such objects they are called fish aggregating devices FADs FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type floating on the surface or just below it Fishermen in the Pacific and Indian oceans set up floating FADs assembled from all sorts of debris around tropical islands and then use purse seines to capture the fish attracted to them br A study using sonar in French Polynesia found large shoals of juvenile bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna aggregated closest to the devices to m Farther out to m was a less dense group of larger yellowfin and albacore tuna Yet farther out to m was a dispersed group of various large adult tuna The distribution and density of these groups was variable and overlapped The FADs also were used by other fish and the aggregations dispersed when it was dark br Larger fish even predator fish such as the great barracuda often attract a retinue of small fish that accompany them in a strategically safe way Skindivers who remain for long periods in the water also often attract a retinue of fish with smaller fishes coming in close and larger fishes observing from a greater distance Marine turtles functioning as a mobile shelter for small fish can be impaled accidentally by a swordfish trying to catch the fish br br br Coastal fish br br Coastal fish also called neritic or inshore fish inhabit the waters near the coast and above the continental shelf Since the continental shelf is usually less than metres deep it follows that coastal fish that are not demersal fish are usually epipelagic fish inhabiting the sunlit epipelagic zone br Coastal epipelagic fish are among the most abundant in the world They include forage fish as well as the predator fish that feed on them Forage fish thrive in those inshore waters where high productivity results from the upwelling and shoreline run off of nutrients Some are partial residents that spawn in streams estuaries and bays but most complete their life cycle in the zone br br br Oceanic fish br br Oceanic fish also called open ocean or offshore fish live in the waters that are not above the continental shelf Oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish who do live above the continental shelf However the two types are not mutually exclusive since there are no firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters particularly in different stages in their life cycle br Oceanic epipelagic fish can be true residents partial residents or accidental residents True residents live their entire life in the open ocean Only a few species are true residents such as tuna billfish flying fish sauries pilotfish remoras dolphinfish ocean sharks and ocean sunfish Most of these species migrate back and forth across open oceans rarely venturing over continental shelves Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds br Partial residents occur in three groups species that live in the zone only when they are juveniles drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds species that live in the zone only when they are adults salmon flying fish dolphin and whale sharks and deep water species that make nightly migrations up into the surface waters such as the lanternfish Accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried accidentally into the zone by currents br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Deep water fish br br In the deep ocean the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones br In deep water marine snow is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column Its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone Marine snow includes dead or dying plankton protists diatoms fecal matter sand soot and other inorganic dust The snowflakes grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor However most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes zooplankton and other filter feeding animals within the first metres of their journey that is within the epipelagic zone In this way marine snow can be considered the foundation of deep sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems As sunlight cannot reach them deep sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source br Some deep sea pelagic groups such as the lanternfish ridgehead marine hatchetfish and lightfish families are sometimes termed pseudoceanic because rather than having an even distribution in open water they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases notably seamounts and over continental slopes The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species that also are attracted to the structures br The fish in the different pelagic and deep water benthic zones are physically structured and behave in ways that differ markedly from each other Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways such as the small mesopelagic vertically migrating plankton feeders the bathypelagic anglerfishes and the deep water benthic rattails br Ray finned species with spiny fins are rare among deep sea fishes which suggests that deep sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the Beryciformes and Lampriformes which also are ancient forms Most deep sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders suggesting a long evolution in deep sea environments In contrast deep water benthic species are in orders that include many related shallow water fishes br Many species move daily between zones in vertical migrations In the following table they are listed in the middle or deeper zone where they regularly are found br br br Mesopelagic fish br br Below the epipelagic zone conditions change rapidly Between metres and approximately metres light continues to fade until darkness is nearly complete Temperatures fall through a thermocline to temperatures between C F and C F This is the twilight or mesopelagic zone Pressure continues to increase at the rate of one atmosphere every metres while nutrient concentrations fall along with dissolved oxygen and the rate at which the water circulates br Sonar operators using the sonar technology developed during World War II were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor metres deep at day and less deep at night This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms most particularly small mesopelagic fish with swimbladders that reflected the sonar br Mesopelagic organisms migrate into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton The layer is deeper when the moon is out and may move higher when the sky is dark This phenomenon has come to be known as the deep scattering layer br Most mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations moving each night into the epipelagic zone often following similar migrations of zooplankton and returning to the depths for safety during the day These vertical migrations occur over hundreds of meters br These fish have muscular bodies ossified bones scales well developed gills and central nervous systems and large hearts and kidneys Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill rakers while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill rakers br Vertically migratory fish have swimbladders The fish inflates its swimbladder to move up Given the high pressures in the mesopelagic zone this requires significant energy As the fish ascends the air in the swimbladder must decrease to prevent the swimbladder from bursting To return to the depths the swimbladder is deflated The migration takes them through the thermocline where the temperature changes between and C thus displaying considerable temperature tolerance br Mesopelagic fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions Most of them are visual predators with large eyes Some of the deeper water fish such as the Telescopefish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upward These give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light signals This adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision and allows the predator to pick out squid cuttlefish and smaller fish that are silhouetted above them br Mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines and use colour for camouflage Ambush predators are dark black or red Since the longer red wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea red effectively functions the same as black Migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours On their bellies they often display photophores producing low grade light For a predator from below looking upward this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish However some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the red deficient ambient light leaving the bioluminescence visible br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The brownsnout spookfish is a species of barreleye and is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror as opposed to a lens to focus an image in its eyes br Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as of all deep sea fish biomass Indeed lanternfish are among the most widely distributed populous and diverse of all vertebrates playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is million tonnes several times the entire world fisheries catch Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world s oceans Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders giving the appearance of a false bottom br The Malaspina Circumnavigation Expedition traveled km undertaking acoustic observations It reported that mesopelagic biomass was billion tonnes or more x prior estimates comprising about percent of all ocean fish biomass Estimates of how much carbon these fish sequester remained highly uncertain as of br Mesopelagic fish do not constitute a major fishery as of Initial efforts in Iceland Norway and the Soviet Union did not create a commercial industry The European Union funded the MEESO project to study abundance and fishing technologies for key mesopelagic species To date fish that appeal to the human palate have not been identified leading harvesters to focus on animal feed markets instead br Bigeye tuna are an epipelagic mesopelagic species that is carnivorous eating other fish Satellite tagging has shown that bigeye tuna often spend prolonged periods cruising deep below the surface during the daytime sometimes making dives as deep as metres feet These movements are thought to be in response to the vertical migrations of prey organisms in the deep scattering layer br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Bathypelagic fish br br Below the mesopelagic zone it is pitch dark This is the midnight or bathypelagic zone extending from m to the bottom deep water benthic zone If the water is exceptionally deep the pelagic zone below metres miles sometimes is called the lower midnight or abyssopelagic zone br Conditions are somewhat uniform throughout these zones the darkness is complete the pressure is crushing and temperatures nutrients and dissolved oxygen levels are all low br Bathypelagic fish have special adaptations to cope with these conditions they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets being willing to eat anything that comes along They prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish Mesopelagic are often highly mobile whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie in wait predators normally expending little energy in movement br The dominant bathypelagic fishes are small bristlemouth and anglerfish fangtooth viperfish daggertooth and barracudina are also common These fishes are small many about centimetres inches long and not many longer than cm in They spend most of their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus faecal material and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish About of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone but only about filters down to the bathypelagic zone br Bathypelagic fish are sedentary adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food or available energy not even sunlight only bioluminescence Their bodies are elongated with weak watery muscles and skeletal structures Since so much of the fish is water they are not compressed by the great pressures at these depths They often have extensible hinged jaws with recurved teeth They are slimy without scales The central nervous system is confined to the lateral line and olfactory systems the eyes are small and may not function and gills kidneys and hearts and swimbladders are small or missing br These are the same features found in fish larvae which suggests that during their evolution bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through neoteny As with larvae these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of energy br Despite their ferocious appearance these beasts of the deep are mostly miniature fish with weak muscles and are too small to represent any threat to humans br The swimbladders of deep sea fish are either absent or scarcely operational and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs Some deep sea fishes have swimbladders that function while they are young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat br The most important sensory systems are usually the inner ear which responds to sound and the lateral line which responds to changes in water pressure The olfactory system also can be important for males who find females by smell br Bathypelagic fish are black or sometimes red with few photophores When photophores are used it is usually to entice prey or attract a mate Because food is so scarce bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits but grab whatever comes close enough They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill rakers that prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping br It is not easy finding a mate in this zone Some species depend on bioluminescence Others are hermaphrodites which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males When a male finds her he bites onto her and never lets go When a male of the anglerfish species Haplophryne mollis bites into the skin of a female he release an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that when the female is ready to spawn she has a mate immediately available br Many animal forms other than fish live in the bathypelagic zone such as squid large whales octopuses sponges brachiopods sea stars and echinoids but this zone is difficult for fish to live in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Demersal fish br br Demersal fish live on or near the bottom of the sea Demersal fish are found by the seafloor in coastal areas on the continental shelf and in the open ocean they are found along the outer continental margin on the continental slope and the continental rise They are not generally found at abyssopelagic or hadopelagic depths or on the abyssal plain They occupy a range of seafloors consisting of mud sand gravel or rocks br In deep waters the fishes of the demersal zone are active and relatively abundant compared to fishes of the bathypelagic zone br Rattails and brotulas are common and other well established families are eels eelpouts hagfishes greeneyes batfishes and lumpfishes br The bodies of deep water benthic fishes are muscular with well developed organs In this way they are closer to mesopelagic fishes than bathopelagic fishes In other ways they are more variable Photophores are usually absent eyes and swimbladders range from absent to well developed They vary in size with larger species greater than one metre not uncommon br Deep sea benthic fish are usually long and narrow Many are eels or shaped like eels This may be because long bodies have long lateral lines Lateral lines detect low frequency sounds and some benthic fishes appear to have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates Smell is also important as indicated by the rapidity with which benthic fish find traps baited with bait fish br The main diet of deep sea benthic fish is invertebrates of the deep sea benthos and carrion Smell touch and lateral line sensitivities seem to be the main sensory devices for locating these br Deep sea benthic fish can be divided into strictly benthic fish and benthopelagic fish Usually strictly benthic fish are negatively buoyant while benthopelagic fish are neutrally buoyant Strictly benthic fish stay in constant contact with the bottom They either lie in wait as ambush predators or move actively over the bottom in search for food br br br Benthopelagic fish br br Benthopelagic fish inhabit the water just above the bottom feeding on benthos and benthopelagic zooplankton Most dermersal fish are benthopelagic br They can be divided into flabby or robust body types Flabby benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes they have a reduced body mass and low metabolic rates expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush prey An example of a flabby fish is the cusk eel Acanthonus armatus a predator with a huge head and a body that is water This fish has the largest ears otoliths and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates br Robust benthopelagic fish are muscular swimmers that actively cruise the bottom searching for prey They may live around features such as seamounts which have strong currents Examples are the orange roughy and Patagonian toothfish Because these fish were once abundant and because their robust bodies are good to eat these fish have been harvested commercially br br br Benthic fish br br Benthic fish are not pelagic fish but they are discussed here briefly by way of completeness and contrast br Some fishes do not fit into the above classification For example the family of nearly blind spiderfishes common and widely distributed feed on benthopelagic zooplankton Yet they are strictly benthic fish since they stay in contact with the bottom Their fins have long rays they use to stand on the bottom while they face the current and grab zooplankton as it passes by br The deepest living fish known the strictly benthic Abyssobrotula galatheae eel like and blind feeds on benthic invertebrates br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br At great depths food scarcity and extreme pressure works to limit the survivability of fish The deepest point of the ocean is about metres miles Bathypelagic fishes are not normally found below metres miles The greatest depth recorded for a benthic fish is m mi It may be that extreme pressures interfere with essential enzyme functions br Benthic fishes are more diverse and are likely to be found on the continental slope where there is habitat diversity and often food supplies Approximately of the ocean floor consists of abyssal plains but these flat featureless regions are covered with sediment and largely devoid of benthic life benthos Deep sea benthic fishes are more likely to associate with canyons or rock outcroppings among the plains where invertebrate communities are established Undersea mountains seamounts can intercept deep sea currents and cause productive upwellings that support benthic fish Undersea mountain ranges may separate underwater regions into different ecosystems br br br Pelagic fisheries br br br Forage fish br br Small pelagic fish are usually forage fish that are hunted by larger pelagic fish and other predators Forage fish filter feed on plankton and are usually less than centimetres inches long They often stay together in schools and may migrate large distances between spawning grounds and feeding grounds They are found particularly in upwelling regions around the northeast Atlantic off the coast of Japan and off the west coasts of Africa and the Americas Forage fish are generally short lived and their stocks fluctuate markedly over the years br Herring are found in the North Sea and the North Atlantic at depths to metres feet Important herring fisheries have existed in these areas for centuries Herring of different sizes and growth rates belong to different populations each of which have their own migration routes When spawning a female produces from to eggs After spawning the herrings are depleted of fat and migrate back to feeding grounds rich in plankton Around Iceland three separate populations of herring were fished traditionally These stocks collapsed in the late s although two have since recovered After the collapse Iceland turned to capelin which now account for about half of Iceland s total catch br Blue whiting are found in the open ocean and above the continental slope at depths between and meters They follow vertical migrations of the zooplankton they feed on to the bottom during daytime and to the surface at night time br Traditional fisheries for anchovies and sardines also have operated in the Pacific the Mediterranean and the southeast Atlantic The world annual catch of forage fish in recent years has been approximately million tonnes or one quarter of the world s total catch br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Predator fish br br Medium size pelagic fishes include trevally barracuda flying fish bonito mahi mahi and coastal mackerel Many of these fish hunt forage fish but are in turn hunted by yet larger pelagic fish Nearly all fish are predator fish to some measure and apart from the top predators the distinction between predator fish and prey or forage fish is somewhat artificial br Around Europe there are three populations of coastal mackerel One population migrates to the North Sea another stays in the waters of the Irish Sea and the third population migrates southward along the west coast of Scotland and Ireland The cruise speed of the mackerel is an impressive kilometres per hour br Many large pelagic fish are oceanic nomadic species that undertake long offshore migrations They feed on small pelagic forage fish as well as medium sized pelagic fish At times they follow their schooling prey and many species form schools themselves br Examples of larger pelagic fish are tuna billfish king mackerel sharks and large rays br Tuna in particular are of major importance to commercial fisheries Although tuna migrate across oceans trying to find them there is not the usual approach Tuna tend to congregate in areas where food is abundant along the boundaries of currents around islands near seamounts and in some areas of upwelling along continental slopes Tuna are captured by several methods purse seine vessels enclose an entire surface school with special nets pole and line vessels that use poles baited with other smaller pelagic fish as baitfish and rafts called fish aggregating devices are set up because tuna as well as some other pelagic fish tend to congregate under floating objects br Other large pelagic fish are premier game fish particularly marlin and swordfish br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Productivity br Upwelling occurs both along coastlines and in midocean when a collision of deep ocean currents brings cold water that is rich in nutrients to the surface These upwellings support blooms of phytoplankton which in turn produce zooplankton and support many of the world s main fisheries If the upwelling fails then fisheries in the area fail br In the s the Peruvian anchoveta fishery was the world s largest fishery The anchoveta population was greatly reduced during the El Ni o event when warm water drifted over the cold Humboldt Current as part of a year cycle lowering the depth of the thermocline The upwelling stopped and phytoplankton production plummeted as did the anchoveta population and millions of seabirds dependent on the anchoveta died Since the mid s the upwelling has resumed and the Peruvian anchoveta catch levels have returned to the s levels br Off Japan the collision of the Oyashio Current with the Kuroshio Current produces nutrient rich upwellings Cyclic changes in these currents resulted in a decline in the sardine sardinops melanosticta populations Fisheries catches fell from million tonnes in to thousand tonnes in As a further consequence Pacific bluefin tuna stopped moving into the region to feed br Ocean currents can shape how fish are distributed both concentrating and dispersing them Adjacent ocean currents can define distinct if shifting boundaries These boundaries can even be visible but usually their presence is marked by rapid changes in salinity temperature and turbidity br For example in the Asian northern Pacific albacore are confined between two current systems The northern boundary is determined by the cold North Pacific Current and the southern boundary is determined by the North Equatorial Current To complicate things their distribution is further modified within the area defined by the two current systems by another current the Kuroshio Current whose flows fluctuate seasonally br Epipelagic fish often spawn in an area where the eggs and larvae drift downstream into suitable feeding areas and eventually drift into adult feeding areas br Islands and banks can interact with currents and upwellings in a manner that results in areas of high ocean productivity Large eddies can form downcurrent or downwind from islands concentrating plankton Banks and reefs can intercept deep currents that upwell br br Scombrids br br br Highly migratory species br br Epipelagic fish generally move long distances between feeding and spawning areas or as a response to changes in the ocean Large ocean predators such as salmon and tuna can migrate thousands of kilometres crossing oceans br In a study the movements of Atlantic bluefin tuna from an area off North Carolina were studied with the help of special popup tags When attached to a tuna these tags monitored the movements of the tuna for about a year then detached and floated to the surface where they transmitted their information to a satellite The study found that the tuna had four different migration patterns One group confined itself to the western Atlantic for a year Another group also stayed mainly in the western Atlantic but migrated to the Gulf of Mexico for spawning A third group moved across the Atlantic Ocean and back again The fourth group crossed to the eastern Atlantic and then moved into the Mediterranean Sea for spawning The study indicates that while there is some differentiation by spawning areas there is essentially only one population of Atlantic bluefin tuna intermixing groups that between them use all of the north Atlantic Ocean the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea br The term highly migratory species HMS is a legal term that has its origins in Article of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS br The highly migratory species include tuna and tuna like species albacore Atlantic bluefin bigeye tuna skipjack yellowfin blackfin little tunny Pacific bluefin southern bluefin and bullet pomfret marlin sailfish swordfish saury and oceangoing sharks as well as mammals such as dolphins and other cetaceans br Essentially highly migratory species coincide with the larger of the large pelagic fish discussed in the previous section if cetaceans are added and some commercially unimportant fish such as the sunfish are excluded These are high trophic level species that undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding often on forage fish or reproduction and also have wide geographic distributions Thus these species are found both inside the nautical mile km exclusive economic zones and in the high seas outside these zones They are pelagic species which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore waters br br br Capture production br According to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO the world harvest in consisted of million tonnes captured by commercial fishing in wild fisheries Of this total about were pelagic fish The following table shows the world capture production in tonnes br br br Threatened species br In the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN produced the first red list for threatened oceanic sharks and rays They claim that approximately one third of open ocean sharks and rays are under threat of extinction There are species of oceanic sharks and rays on the list including hammerheads giant devil rays and porbeagle br Oceanic sharks are captured incidentally by swordfish and tuna high seas fisheries In the past there were few markets for sharks which were regarded as worthless bycatch Now sharks are being increasingly targeted to supply emerging Asian markets particularly for shark fins which are used in shark fin soup br The northwest Atlantic Ocean shark populations are estimated to have declined by since the early s Oceanic sharks are vulnerable because they do not produce many young and the young can take decades to mature br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In parts of the world the scalloped hammerhead shark has declined by since the late s Its status on the red list is that it is globally endangered meaning it is
