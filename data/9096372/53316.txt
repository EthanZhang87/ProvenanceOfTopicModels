Estate of Versailles About people visit the palace park or gardens of Versailles every year making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world br Louis XIII built a simple hunting lodge on the site of the Palace of Versailles in With his death came Louis XIV who expanded the ch teau into the beginnings of a palace that went through several changes and phases from to It was a favorite residence for both kings and in Louis XIV moved the seat of his court and government to Versailles making the palace the de facto capital of France This state of affairs was continued by Kings Louis XV and Louis XVI who primarily made interior alterations to the palace but in the royal family and capital of France returned to Paris For the rest of the French Revolution the Palace of Versailles was largely abandoned and emptied of its contents and the population of the surrounding city plummeted br Napoleon following his coronation as Emperor used the Grand Trianon as a summer residence from to but did not use the main palace Following the Bourbon Restoration when the king was returned to the throne he resided in Paris and it was not until the s that meaningful repairs were made to the palace A museum of French history was installed within it replacing the courtiers apartments of the southern wing br The palace and park were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in for its importance as the center of power art and science in France during the th and th centuries The French Ministry of Culture has placed the palace its gardens and some of its subsidiary structures on its list of culturally significant monuments br br br History br br In Louis XIII king of France built a hunting lodge on a hill in a favorite hunting ground kilometers mi west of Paris and kilometers mi from his primary residence the Ch teau de Saint Germain en Laye The site near a village named Versailles was a wooded wetland that Louis XIII s court scorned as being generally unworthy of a king one of his courtiers Fran ois de Bassompierre wrote that the lodge would not inspire vanity in even the simplest gentleman From to architect Philibert Le Roy replaced the lodge with a ch teau for Louis XIII who forbade his queen Anne of Austria from staying there overnight even when an outbreak of smallpox at Saint Germain en Laye in forced Louis XIII to relocate to Versailles with his three year old heir the future Louis XIV br When Louis XIII died in Anne became Louis XIV s regent and Louis XIII s ch teau was abandoned for the next decade She moved the court back to Paris where Anne and her chief minister Cardinal Mazarin continued Louis XIII s unpopular monetary practices This led to the Fronde a series of revolts against royal authority from to that masked a struggle between Mazarin and the princes of the blood Louis XIV s extended family for influence over him In the aftermath of the Fronde Louis XIV became determined to rule alone Following Mazarin s death in Louis XIV reformed his government to exclude his mother and the princes of the blood moved the court back to Saint Germain en Laye and ordered the expansion of his father s ch teau at Versailles into a palace br Louis XIV had hunted at Versailles in the s but did not take any special interest in Versailles until On August Louis XIV was a guest at a sumptuous festival hosted by Nicolas Fouquet the Superintendent of Finances at his palatial residence the Ch teau de Vaux le Vicomte Louis XIV was impressed by the ch teau and its gardens which were the work of Louis Le Vau the court architect since Andr Le N tre the royal gardener since and Charles Le Brun a painter in royal service since Vaux le Vicomte s scale and opulence led him to imprison Fouquet that September as he had also built an island fortress and a private army But Louis XIV was also inspired by Vaux le Vicomte and he recruited its authors for his own projects Louis XIV replaced Fouquet with Jean Baptiste Colbert a prot g of Mazarin and enemy of Fouquet and charged him with managing the corps of artisans in royal employment Colbert acted as the intermediary between them and Louis XIV who personally directed and inspected the planning and construction of Versailles br br br Construction br br Work at Versailles was at first concentrated on gardens and through the s Le Vau only added two detached service wings and a forecourt to the ch teau But in as a response to the growth of the gardens and victory over Spain in the War of Devolution Louis XIV decided to turn Versailles into a full scale royal residence He vacillated between replacing or incorporating his father s ch teau but settled on the latter by the end of the decade and from to Louis XIII s ch teau was encased on three sides in a feature dubbed the enveloppe This gave the ch teau a new Italianate fa ade overlooking the gardens but preserved the courtyard fa ade resulting in a mix of styles and materials that dismayed Louis XIV and that Colbert described as a patchwork Attempts to homogenize the two fa ades failed and in Le Vau died leaving the post of First Architect to the King vacant for the next seven years br Le Vau was succeeded at Versailles by his assistant architect Fran ois d Orbay Work at the palace during the s focused on its interiors as the palace was then nearing completion though d Orbay expanded Le Vau s service wings and connected them to the ch teau and built a pair of pavilions for government employees in the forecourt In d Orbay was tasked by Louis XIV with designing a city also called Versailles to house and service Louis XIV s growing government and court The granting of land to courtiers for the construction of townhouses that resembled the palace began in The next year the Franco Dutch War began and funding for Versailles was cut until when Louis XIV had work begun on the Ambassadors Staircase a grand staircase for the reception of guests and demolished the last of the village of Versailles br br Following the end of the Franco Dutch War with French victory in Louis XIV appointed as First Architect Jules Hardouin Mansart an experienced architect in Louis XIV s confidence who would benefit from a restored budget and large workforce of former soldiers Mansart began his tenure with the addition from to of the Hall of Mirrors a renovation of the courtyard fa ade of Louis XIII s ch teau and the expansion of d Orbay s pavilions to create the Ministers Wings in Adjacent to the palace Hardouin Mansart built a pair of stables called the Grande and Petite curies from to and the Grand Commun which housed the palace s servants and general kitchens from to Hardouin Mansart also added two entirely new wings in Le Vau s Italianate style to house the court first at the south end of the palace from to and then at its north end from to br War and the resulting diminished funding slowed construction at Versailles for the rest of the th century The Nine Years War which began in stopped work altogether until Three years later however the even more expensive War of the Spanish Succession began and combined with poor harvests in and plunged France into crisis Louis XIV thus slashed funding and canceled some of the work Hardouin Mansart had planned in the s such as the remodeling of the courtyard fa ade in the Italianate style Louis XIV and Hardouin Mansart focused on a permanent palace chapel the construction of which lasted from to br br Louis XIV s successors Louis XV and Louis XVI largely left Versailles as they inherited it and focused on the palace s interiors Louis XV s modifications began in the s with the completion of the Salon d Hercule a ballroom in the north wing and the expansion of the king s private apartment which required the demolition of the Ambassadors Staircase In Louis XV began construction of a palace theater the Royal Opera of Versailles at the northernmost end of the palace but completion was delayed until construction was interrupted in the s by the War of the Austrian Succession and then again in with the start of the Seven Years War These wars emptied the royal treasury and thereafter construction was mostly funded by Madame du Barry Louis XV s favorite mistress In Louis XV had the northern Ministers Wing rebuilt in Neoclassical style by Ange Jacques Gabriel his court architect as it was in the process of falling down That work was also stopped by financial constraints and it remained incomplete when Louis XV died in In Louis XVI briefly moved the royal family to the Ch teau de Saint Cloud ahead of more renovations to the Palace of Versailles but construction could not begin because of financial difficulty and political crisis In the French Revolution swept the royal family and government out of Versailles forever br br br Role in politics and culture br br The Palace of Versailles was key to Louis XIV s politics as an expression and concentration of French art and culture and for the centralization of royal power Louis XIV first used Versailles to promote himself with a series of nighttime festivals in its gardens in and the events of which were disseminated throughout Europe by print and engravings As early as but especially from Louis XIV sought to make Versailles his seat of government and he expanded the palace so as to fit the court within it The moving of the court to Versailles did not come until however and not officially as opinion on Versailles was mixed among the nobility of France br By however it was evident to all that Versailles was the de facto capital of France and Louis XIV succeeded in attracting the nobility to Versailles to pursue prestige and royal patronage within a strict court etiquette thus eroding their traditional provincial power bases It was at the Palace of Versailles that Louis XIV received the Doge of Genoa Francesco Maria Imperiale Lercari in an embassy from the Ayutthaya Kingdom in and an embassy from Safavid Iran in br Louis XIV died at Versailles on September and was succeeded by his five year old great grandson Louis XV then the duke of Anjou who was moved to the Ch teau de Vincennes and then to Paris by Louis XV s regent Philippe II Duke of Orl ans Versailles was neglected until when Philippe II removed the court to Versailles to escape the unpopularity of his regency and when Louis XV began his majority The move however broke the cultural power of Versailles and during the reign of Louis XVI courtiers spent their leisure in Paris not Versailles br br During Christmas Mozart and his family visited Versailles and dined with the King The year old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played several works during his stay and later dedicated his first two harpsichord sonatas published in in Paris to Madame Victoria daughter of Louis XV br In the palace was the site of the signing of the last two of the three treaties of the Peace of Paris which ended the American Revolutionary War On September British and American delegates led by Benjamin Franklin signed the Treaty of Paris at the H tel d York now Rue Jacob in Paris granting the United States independence On September Spain and France signed separate treaties with Britain at the Palace of Versailles formally ending the war br The King and Queen learned of the Storming of the Bastille in Paris on July while they were at the palace and remained isolated there as the Revolution in Paris spread The growing anger in Paris led to the Women s March on Versailles on October A crowd of several thousand men and women protesting the high price and scarcity of bread marched from the markets of Paris to Versailles They took weapons from the city armory besieged the palace and compelled the King and royal family and the members of the National Constituent Assembly to return with them to Paris the following day br As soon as the royal family departed the palace was closed In the National Convention the new revolutionary government ordered the transfer of all the paintings and sculptures from the palace to the Louvre In the Convention declared the abolition of the monarchy and ordered all of the royal property in the palace to be sold at auction The auction took place between August and August The furnishings and art of the palace including the furniture mirrors baths and kitchen equipment were sold in seventeen thousand lots All fleurs de lys and royal emblems on the buildings were chambered or chiseled off The empty buildings were turned into a storehouse for furnishings art and libraries confiscated from the nobility The empty grand apartments were opened for tours beginning in and a small museum of French paintings and art school was opened in some of the empty rooms br By virtue of an order issued by the Versailles district directorate in August the Royal Gate was destroyed the Cour Royale was cleared and the Cour de Marbre lost its precious floor br br br th century history museum and government venue br br br br When Napoleon became Emperor of the French in he considered making Versailles his residence but abandoned the idea because of the cost of the renovation Prior to his marriage with Marie Louise in he had the Grand Trianon restored and refurnished as a springtime residence for himself and his family in the style of furnishing that it is seen today br In with the final downfall of Napoleon Louis XVIII the younger brother of Louis XVI became king and considered returning the royal residence to Versailles where he had been born He ordered the restoration of the royal apartments but the task and cost was too great Louis XVIII had the far end of the south wing of the Cour Royale demolished and rebuilt to match the Gabriel wing of opposite which gave greater uniformity of appearance to the front entrance Neither he nor his successor Charles X lived at Versailles br The French Revolution of brought a new monarch Louis Philippe to power and a new ambition for Versailles He did not reside at Versailles but began the creation of the Museum of the History of France dedicated to all the glories of France which had been used to house some members of the royal family The museum was begun in and inaugurated on June Its most famous room is the Galerie des Batailles Hall of Battles which lies on most of the length of the second floor of the south wing The museum project largely came to a halt when Louis Philippe was overthrown in though the paintings of French heroes and great battles still remain in the south wing br Emperor Napoleon III used the palace on occasion as a stage for grand ceremonies One of the most lavish was the banquet that he hosted for Queen Victoria in the Royal Opera of Versailles on August br During the Franco Prussian War of the palace was occupied by the general staff of the victorious German Army Parts of the ch teau including the Hall of Mirrors were turned into a military hospital The creation of the German Empire combining Prussia and the surrounding German states under William I was formally proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors on January The Germans remained in the palace until the signing of the armistice in March In that month the government of the new Third French Republic which had departed Paris during the war for Tours and then Bordeaux moved into the palace The National Assembly held its meetings in the Opera House br The uprising of the Paris Commune in March prevented the French government under Adolphe Thiers from returning immediately to Paris The military operation which suppressed the Commune at the end of May was directed from Versailles and the prisoners of the Commune were marched there and put on trial in military courts In a second parliamentary body the French Senate was created and held its meetings for the election of a President of the Republic in a new hall created in in the south wing of the palace The French Senate and National Assembly continue to meet in the palace in joint session on special occasions such as the amendment of the Constitution of France br br br th century br br The end of the th and the early th century saw the beginning of restoration efforts at the palace first led by Pierre de Nolhac poet and scholar and the first conservator who began his work in The conservation and restoration were interrupted by two world wars but have continued until the present day br The palace returned to the world stage in June when after six months of negotiations the Treaty of Versailles formally ending the First World War was signed in the Hall of Mirrors Between and the American philanthropist and multi millionaire John D Rockefeller Jr gave the equivalent of about thirty million dollars today to restore and refurbish the palace br More work took place after World War II with the restoration of the Royal Opera of Versailles The theater was reopened in in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom br In parts of the palace were heavily damaged in a bombing committed by Breton terrorists br Starting in the s when the museum of Versailles was under the directorship of G rald van der Kemp the objective was to restore the palace to its state or as close to it as possible in when the royal family left the palace Among the early projects was the repair of the roof over the Hall of Mirrors the publicity campaign brought international attention to the plight of post war Versailles and garnered much foreign money including a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation br One of the more costly endeavors for the museum and the French Fifth Republic has been to repurchase as much of the original furnishings as possible Consequently because furniture with a royal provenance and especially furniture that was made for Versailles is a highly sought after commodity on the international market the museum has spent considerable funds on retrieving much of the palace s original furnishings br br br st century br In a new restoration initiative the Grand Versailles project was started which began with the replanting of the gardens which had lost over trees during Cyclone Lothar on December One part of the initiative the restoration of the Hall of

enclosed the estate br The landscape of the estate had to be created from the bog that surrounded Louis XIII s ch teau using landscape architecture usually employed in fortress building The approach to the palace and the gardens were carefully laid out via the moving of earth and construction of terraces The water from the marsh was marshalled into a series of lakes and ponds around Versailles but these reservoirs were not sufficient for the palace city or gardens Great lengths were taken to supply Versailles with water such as the damming of the river Bi vre to create an inflow in the s
