Louis XIV Louis Dieudonn September September also known as Louis the Great Louis le Grand or the Sun King le Roi Soleil was King of France from until his death in His verified reign of years and days is the longest of any sovereign Although Louis XIV s France was emblematic of the Age of Absolutism in Europe the King surrounded himself with a variety of significant political military and cultural figures such as Bossuet Colbert Louvois Le Brun Le N tre Lully Mazarin Moli re Racine Turenne Cond and Vauban br Louis began his personal rule of France in after the death of his chief minister Cardinal Mazarin when the King famously declared that he would take over the job himself An adherent of the divine right of kings Louis continued his predecessors work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France by compelling many members of the nobility to reside at his lavish Palace of Versailles he succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy many of whom had participated in the Fronde rebellions during his minority He thus became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured until the French Revolution Louis also enforced uniformity of religion under the Catholic Church His revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority and subjected them to a wave of dragonnades effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert virtually destroying the French Protestant community br During Louis s long reign France emerged as the leading European power and regularly asserted its military strength A conflict with Spain marked his entire childhood while during his personal rule Louis fought three major continental conflicts each against powerful foreign alliances the Franco Dutch War the Nine Years War and the War of the Spanish Succession In addition France also contested shorter wars such as the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions Warfare defined Louis s foreign policy and his personal ambition shaped his approach Impelled by a mix of commerce revenge and pique he sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory His wars strained France s resources to the utmost while in peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military Upon his death in Louis XIV left his great grandson and successor Louis XV a powerful kingdom albeit in major debt after the War of the Spanish Succession that had raged on since br Significant achievements during Louis XIV s reign which would go on to have a wide influence on the early modern period well into the Industrial Revolution and until today include the construction of the Canal du Midi the patronage of artists and the founding of the French Academy of Sciences br br br Early years br br Louis XIV was born on September in the Ch teau de Saint Germain en Laye to Louis XIII and Anne of Austria He was named Louis Dieudonn Louis the God given and bore the traditional title of French heirs apparent Dauphin At the time of his birth his parents had been married for years His mother had experienced four stillbirths between and Leading contemporaries thus regarded him as a divine gift and his birth a miracle of God br Louis s relationship with his mother was uncommonly affectionate for the time Contemporaries and eyewitnesses claimed that the Queen would spend all her time with Louis Both were greatly interested in food and theatre and it is highly likely that Louis developed these interests through his close relationship with his mother This long lasting and loving relationship can be evidenced by excerpts in Louis journal entries such as br br Nature was responsible for the first knots which tied me to my mother But attachments formed later by shared qualities of the spirit are far more difficult to break than those formed merely by blood br It was his mother who gave Louis his belief in the absolute and divine power of his monarchical rule br During his childhood he was taken care of by the governesses Fran oise de Lansac and Marie Catherine de Senecey In Nicolas V de Villeroy became the young king s tutor Louis XIV became friends with Villeroy s young children particularly Fran ois de Villeroy and divided his time between the Palais Royal and the nearby Hotel de Villeroy br br br Minority and the Fronde br br br Accession br br Sensing imminent death in the spring of King Louis XIII decided to put his affairs in order for his four year old son Louis XIV Not trusting the judgement of his Spanish wife Queen Anne who would normally have become the sole regent of France the king decreed that a regency council would rule on his son s behalf with Anne at its head br Louis XIII died on May On May Queen Anne had her husband s will annulled by the Parlement de Paris a judicial body of nobles and high clergymen and she became sole regent She exiled her husband s ministers Chavigny and Bouthilier and appointed the Count of Brienne as her minister of foreign affairs Anne kept the direction of religious policy strongly in hand until her son s majority in br She appointed Cardinal Mazarin as chief minister giving him the daily administration of policy She continued the policies of her late husband and Cardinal Richelieu despite their persecution of her in order to win absolute authority in France and victory abroad for her son Anne protected Mazarin by exiling her followers the Duke of Beaufort and Marie de Rohan who conspired against him in br The best example of Anne s loyalty to France was her treatment of one of Richelieu s men the Chancellor Pierre S guier S guier had brusquely interrogated Anne in like a common criminal as she recalled following the discovery that she was giving military secrets to her father in Spain and Anne was virtually under house arrest for years By keeping the effective S guier in his post Anne sacrificed her own feelings for the interests of France and her son Louis br The Queen sought a lasting peace between Catholic nations but only after a French victory over her native Spain She also gave a partial Catholic orientation to French foreign policy This was felt by the Netherlands France s Protestant ally which negotiated a separate peace with Spain in br In Anne and Mazarin successfully negotiated the Peace of Westphalia which ended the Thirty Years War Its terms ensured Dutch independence from Spain awarded some autonomy to the various German princes of the Holy Roman Empire and granted Sweden seats on the Imperial Diet and territories controlling the mouths of the Oder Elbe and Weser Rivers France however profited most from the settlement Austria ruled by the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand III ceded all Habsburg lands and claims in Alsace to France and acknowledged her de facto sovereignty over the Three Bishoprics of Metz Verdun and Toul Moreover many petty German states sought French protection eager to emancipate themselves from Habsburg domination This anticipated the formation of the League of the Rhine which further diminished Imperial power br br br Early acts br As the Thirty Years War came to an end a civil war known as the Fronde erupted in France It effectively checked France s ability to exploit the Peace of Westphalia Anne and Mazarin had largely pursued the policies of Cardinal Richelieu augmenting the Crown s power at the expense of the nobility and the Parlements Anne was more concerned with internal policy than foreign affairs she was a very proud queen who insisted on the divine rights of the King of France br br All this led her to advocate a forceful policy in all matters relating to the King s authority in a manner that was much more radical than the one proposed by Mazarin The Cardinal depended totally on Anne s support and had to use all his influence on the Queen to temper some of her radical actions Anne imprisoned any aristocrat or member of parliament who challenged her will her main aim was to transfer to her son an absolute authority in the matters of finance and justice One of the leaders of the Parlement of Paris whom she had jailed died in prison br The Frondeurs political heirs of the disaffected feudal aristocracy sought to protect their traditional feudal privileges from the increasingly centralized royal government Furthermore they believed their traditional influence and authority was being usurped by the recently ennobled bureaucrats the Noblesse de Robe or nobility of the robe who administered the kingdom and on whom the monarchy increasingly began to rely This belief intensified the nobles resentment br In Anne and Mazarin attempted to tax members of the Parlement de Paris The members refused to comply and ordered all of the king s earlier financial edicts burned Buoyed by the victory of Louis duc d Enghien later known as le Grand Cond at the Battle of Lens Mazarin on Queen Anne s insistence arrested certain members in a show of force The most important arrest from Anne s point of view concerned Pierre Broussel one of the most important leaders in the Parlement de Paris br br People in France were complaining about the expansion of royal authority the high rate of taxation and the reduction of the authority of the Parlement de Paris and other regional representative entities Paris erupted in rioting as a result and Anne was forced under intense pressure to free Broussel Moreover on the night of February when Louis was twelve a mob of angry Parisians broke into the royal palace and demanded to see their king Led into the royal bed chamber they gazed upon Louis who was feigning sleep were appeased and then quietly departed The threat to the royal family prompted Anne to flee Paris with the king and his courtiers br Shortly thereafter the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia allowed Cond s army to return to aid Louis and his court Cond s family was close to Anne at that time and he agreed to help her attempt to restore the king s authority The queen s army headed by Cond attacked the rebels in Paris the rebels were under the political control of Anne s old friend Marie de Rohan Beaufort who had escaped from the prison where Anne had incarcerated him five years before was the military leader in Paris under the nominal control of Conti After a few battles a political compromise was reached the Peace of Rueil was signed and the court returned to Paris br Unfortunately for Anne her partial victory depended on Cond who wanted to control the queen and destroy Mazarin s influence It was Cond s sister who pushed him to turn against the queen After striking a deal with her old friend Marie de Rohan who was able to impose the nomination of Charles de l Aubespine marquis de Ch teauneuf as minister of justice Anne arrested Cond his brother Armand de Bourbon Prince of Conti and the husband of their sister Anne Genevieve de Bourbon duchess of Longueville This situation did not last long and Mazarin s unpopularity led to the creation of a coalition headed mainly by Marie de Rohan and the duchess of Longueville This aristocratic coalition was strong enough to liberate the princes exile Mazarin and impose a condition of virtual house arrest on Queen Anne br br All these events were witnessed by Louis and largely explained his later distrust of Paris and the higher aristocracy In one sense Louis childhood came to an end with the outbreak of the Fronde It was not only that life became insecure and unpleasant a fate meted out to many children in all ages but that Louis had to be taken into the confidence of his mother and Mazarin on political and military matters of which he could have no deep understanding The family home became at times a near prison when Paris had to be abandoned not in carefree outings to other chateaux but in humiliating flights The royal family was driven out of Paris twice in this manner and at one point Louis XIV and Anne were held under virtual arrest in the royal palace in Paris The Fronde years planted in Louis a hatred of Paris and a consequent determination to move out of the ancient capital as soon as possible never to return br Just as the first Fronde the Fronde parlementaire of ended a second one the Fronde des princes of began Unlike that which preceded it tales of sordid intrigue and half hearted warfare characterized this second phase of upper class insurrection To the aristocracy this rebellion represented a protest for the reversal of their political demotion from vassals to courtiers It was headed by the highest ranking French nobles among them Louis uncle Gaston Duke of Orl ans and first cousin Anne Marie Louise d Orl ans Duchess of Montpensier known as la Grande Mademoiselle Princes of the Blood such as Cond his brother Armand de Bourbon Prince of Conti and their sister the Duchess of Longueville dukes of legitimised royal descent such as Henri Duke of Longueville and Fran ois Duke of Beaufort so called foreign princes such as Fr d ric Maurice Duke of Bouillon his brother Marshal Turenne and Marie de Rohan Duchess of Chevreuse and scions of France s oldest families such as Fran ois de La Rochefoucauld br Queen Anne played the most important role in defeating the Fronde because she wanted to transfer absolute authority to her son In addition most of the princes refused to deal with Mazarin who went into exile for a number of years The Frondeurs claimed to act on Louis behalf and in his real interest against his mother and Mazarin br Queen Anne had a very close relationship with the Cardinal and many observers believed that Mazarin became Louis XIV s stepfather by a secret marriage to Queen Anne However Louis coming of age and subsequent coronation deprived them of the Frondeurs pretext for revolt The Fronde thus gradually lost steam and ended in when Mazarin returned triumphantly from exile From that time until his death Mazarin was in charge of foreign and financial policy without the daily supervision of Anne who was no longer regent br During this period Louis fell in love with Mazarin s niece Marie Mancini but Anne and Mazarin ended the king s infatuation by sending Mancini away from court to be married in Italy While Mazarin might have been tempted for a short time to marry his niece to the King of France Queen Anne was absolutely against this she wanted to marry her son to the daughter of her brother Philip IV of Spain for both dynastic and political reasons Mazarin soon supported the Queen s position because he knew that her support for his power and his foreign policy depended on making peace with Spain from a strong position and on the Spanish marriage Additionally Mazarin s relations with Marie Mancini were not good and he did not trust her to support his position All of Louis tears and his supplications to his mother did not make her change her mind The Spanish marriage would be very important both for its role in ending the war between France and Spain because many of the claims and objectives of Louis foreign policy for the next years would be based upon this marriage and because it was through this marriage that the Spanish throne would ultimately be delivered to the House of Bourbon br br br Personal reign and reforms br br br Coming of age and early reforms br br Louis XIV was declared to have reached the age of majority on the th of September On the death of Mazarin in March Louis personally took the reins of government and astonished his court by declaring that he would rule without a chief minister Up to this moment I have been pleased to entrust the government of my affairs to the late Cardinal It is now time that I govern them myself You secretaries and ministers will assist me with your counsels when I ask for them I request and order you to seal no orders except by my command I order you not to sign anything not even a passport without my command to render account to me personally each day and to favor no one Capitalizing on the widespread public yearning for peace and order after decades of foreign and civil strife the young king consolidated central political authority and at the expense of the feudal aristocracy Praising his ability to choose and encourage men of talent the historian Chateaubriand noted it is the voice of genius of all kinds which sounds from the tomb of Louis br Louis began his personal reign with administrative and fiscal reforms In the treasury verged on bankruptcy To rectify the situation Louis chose Jean Baptiste Colbert as Controller General of Finances in However Louis first had to neutralize Nicolas Fouquet the powerful Superintendent of Finances Although Fouquet s financial indiscretions were not very different from Mazarin s before him or Colbert s after him his ambition worried Louis He lavishly entertained the king at the opulent ch teau of Vaux le Vicomte flaunting a wealth which could hardly have accumulated except through embezzlement of government funds br Fouquet appeared eager to succeed Mazarin and Richelieu in power and he indiscreetly purchased and privately fortified the remote island of Belle le These acts sealed his doom Fouquet was charged with embezzlement the Parlement found him guilty and sentenced him to exile and finally Louis altered the sentence to life imprisonment br Fouquet s downfall gave Colbert a free hand to reduce the national debt through more efficient taxation The principal taxes included the aides and douanes both customs duties the gabelle salt tax and the taille land tax The taille was reduced at first and certain tax collection contracts were auctioned instead of being sold privately to a favoured few Financial officials were required to keep regular accounts revising inventories and removing unauthorized exemptions up to only per cent of income from the royal domain reached the king Reform had to overcome vested interests the taille was collected by officers of the Crown who had purchased their post at a high price and punishment of abuses necessarily lowered the value of the purchase Nevertheless Colbert achieved excellent results with the deficit of turning into a surplus by with interest on the debt decreasing from million to million livres The taille was reduced to million in and million in while revenue from indirect taxation progressed from million to million The revenues of the royal domain were raised from livres in to million in In the receipts were equivalent to million British pounds of which million reached the treasury The expenditure was around million pounds leaving a deficit of million In the net receipts had risen to million pounds sterling while expenditure had fallen to million leaving a surplus of million pounds br br Money was the essential support of the reorganized and enlarged army the panoply of Versailles and the growing civil administration Finance had always been the weakness of the French monarchy tax collection was costly and inefficient direct taxes dwindled as they passed through the hands of many intermediate officials and indirect taxes were collected by private contractors called tax farmers who made a handsome profit The state coffers leaked at every joint br The main weakness arose from an old bargain between the French crown and nobility the king might raise taxes on the nation without consent if only he exempted the nobility Only the unprivileged classes paid direct taxes which came to mean the peasants only as most bourgeois finagled exemptions in one way or another The system laid the whole burden of state expenses on the backs of the poor and powerless After with the support of Louis pious secret wife Madame de Maintenon the king was persuaded to change his fiscal policy Though willing enough to tax the nobles Louis feared the political concessions which they would demand in return Only towards the close of his reign under the extreme exigency of war was he able for the first time in French history to impose direct taxes on the aristocracy This was a step toward equality before the law and toward sound public finance though it was predictably diminished by concessions and exemptions won by the insistent efforts of nobles and bourgeois br Louis and Colbert also had wide ranging plans to grow French commerce and trade Colbert s mercantilist administration established new industries and encouraged manufacturers and inventors such as the Lyon silk manufacturers and the Gobelins tapestry manufactory He invited manufacturers and artisans from all over Europe to France such as Murano glassmakers Swedish ironworkers and Dutch shipbuilders He aimed to decrease imports while increasing French exports hence reducing the net outflow of precious metals from France br Louis instituted reforms in military administration through Michel le Tellier and his son Fran ois Michel le Tellier successive Marquis de Louvois They helped to curb the independent spirit of the nobility imposing order on them at court and in the army Gone were the days when generals protracted war at the frontiers while bickering over precedence and ignoring orders from the capital and the larger strategic picture with the old military aristocracy noblesse d p e nobility of the sword monopolizing senior military positions and the higher ranks Louvois modernized the army and reorganised it into a professional disciplined well trained force He was devoted to the soldiers material well being and morale and even tried to direct campaigns br br br Relations with the major colonies br br Louis legal reforms were enacted in his numerous Great Ordinances Prior to that France was a patchwork of legal systems with as many traditional legal regimes as there were provinces and two co existing legal systems customary law in the north and Roman civil law in the south The Grande Ordonnance de Proc dure Civile of the Code Louis was a comprehensive legal code imposing a uniform regulation of civil procedure throughout the kingdom Among other things it prescribed baptismal marriage and death records in the state s registers not the church s and it strictly regulated the right of the Parlements to remonstrate The Code Louis later became the basis for the Napoleonic code which in turn inspired many modern legal codes br One of Louis more infamous decrees was the Grande Ordonnance sur les Colonies of the Code Noir black code Although it sanctioned slavery it attempted to humanise the practice by prohibiting the separation of families Additionally in the colonies only Roman Catholics could own slaves and these had to be baptised br Louis ruled through a number of councils br br Conseil d en haut High Council concerning the most important matters of state composed of the king the crown prince the controller general of finances and the secretaries of state in charge of various departments The members of that council were called ministers of state br Conseil des d p ches Council of Messages concerning notices and administrative reports from the provinces br Conseil de Conscience Council of Conscience concerning religious affairs and episcopal appointments br Conseil royal des finances Royal Council of Finances headed by the chef du conseil des finances an honorary post in most cases this was one of the few posts in the council available to the high aristocracy br br br Early wars in the Low Countries br br br Spain br br The death of Louis maternal uncle King Philip IV of Spain in precipitated the War of Devolution In Louis had married Philip IV s eldest daughter Maria Theresa as one of the provisions of the Treaty of the Pyrenees The marriage treaty specified that Maria Theresa was to renounce all claims to Spanish territory for herself and all her descendants Mazarin and Lionne however made the renunciation conditional on the full payment of a Spanish dowry of cus The dowry was never paid and would later play a part persuading his maternal first cousin Charles II of Spain to leave his empire to Philip Duke of Anjou later Philip V of Spain the grandson of Louis XIV and Maria Theresa br The War of Devolution did not focus on the payment of the dowry rather the lack of payment was what Louis XIV used as a pretext for nullifying Maria Theresa s renunciation of her claims allowing the land to devolve to him In Brabant the location of the land in dispute children of first marriages traditionally were not disadvantaged by their parents remarriages and still inherited property Louis wife was Philip IV s daughter by his first marriage while the new king of Spain Charles II was his son by a subsequent marriage Thus Brabant allegedly devolved to Maria Theresa justifying France to attack the Spanish Netherlands br br br Relations with the Dutch br br During the Eighty Years War with Spain France supported the Dutch Republic as part of a general policy of opposing Habsburg power Johan de Witt Dutch Grand Pensionary from to viewed this as crucial for Dutch security and a counterweight against his domestic Orangist opponents Louis provided support in the Second Anglo Dutch War but used the opportunity to launch the War of Devolution in This captured Franche Comt and much of the Spanish Netherlands French expansion in this area was a direct threat to Dutch economic interests br The Dutch opened talks with Charles II of England on a common diplomatic front against France leading to the Triple Alliance between England the Dutch and Sweden The threat of an escalation and a secret treaty to divide Spanish possessions with Emperor Leopold the other major claimant to the throne of Spain led Louis to relinquish many of his gains in the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle br Louis placed little reliance on his agreement with Leopold and as it was now clear French and Dutch aims were in direct conflict he decided to first defeat the Republic then seize the Spanish Netherlands This required breaking up the Triple Alliance he paid Sweden to remain neutral and signed the Secret Treaty of Dover with Charles an Anglo French alliance against the Dutch Republic In May France invaded the Republic supported by M nster and the Electorate of Cologne br br Rapid French advance led to a coup that toppled De Witt and brought William III to power Leopold viewed French expansion into the Rhineland as an increasing threat especially after they seized the strategic Duchy of Lorraine in The prospect of Dutch defeat led Leopold to an alliance with Brandenburg Prussia on June followed by another with the Republic on th Although Brandenburg was forced out of the war by the June Treaty of Vossem in August an anti French alliance was formed by the Dutch Spain Emperor Leopold and the Duke of Lorraine br The French alliance was deeply unpopular in England and only more so after the disappointing battles against Michiel de Ruyter s fleet Charles II of England made peace with the Dutch in the February Treaty of Westminster However French armies held significant advantages over their opponents an undivided command talented generals like Turenne Cond and Luxembourg and vastly superior logistics Reforms introduced by Louvois the Secretary of War helped maintain large field armies that could be mobilised much more quickly allowing them to mount offensives in early spring before their opponents were ready br The French were nevertheless forced to retreat from most of the Dutch Republic which deeply shocked Louis he retreated to St Germain for a time where no one except a few intimates was allowed to disturb him French military advantages allowed them however to hold their ground in Alsace and the Spanish Netherlands while retaking Franche Comt By mutual exhaustion led to the Treaty of Nijmegen which was generally settled in France s favour and allowed Louis to intervene in the Scanian War Despite the military defeat his ally Sweden regained much of what it had lost under the treaties of Saint Germain en Laye Fontainebleau and Lund imposed on Denmark Norway and Brandenburg Yet Louis two primary goals the destruction of the Dutch Republic and the conquest of the Spanish Netherlands had failed br Louis was at the height of his power but at the cost of uniting his opponents this increased as he continued his expansion In he dismissed his foreign minister Simon Arnauld marquis de Pomponne because he was seen as having compromised too much with the allies Louis maintained the strength of his army but in his next series of territorial claims avoided using military force alone Rather he combined it with legal pretexts in his efforts to augment the boundaries of his kingdom Contemporary treaties were intentionally phrased ambiguously Louis established the Chambers of Reunion to determine the full extent of his rights and obligations under those treaties br br Cities and territories such as Luxembourg and Casale were prized for their strategic positions on the frontier and access to important waterways Louis also sought Strasbourg an important strategic crossing on the left bank of the Rhine and theretofore a Free Imperial City of the Holy Roman Empire annexing it and other territories in Although a part of Alsace Strasbourg was not part of Habsburg ruled Alsace and was thus not ceded to France in the Peace of Westphalia br Following these annexations Spain declared war precipitating the War of the Reunions However the Spanish were rapidly defeated because the Emperor distracted by the Great Turkish War abandoned them and the Dutch only supported them minimally By the Truce of Ratisbon in Spain was forced to acquiesce in the French occupation of most of the conquered territories for years br Louis policy of the R unions may have raised France to its greatest size and power during his reign but it alienated much of Europe This poor public opinion was compounded by French actions off the Barbary Coast and at Genoa First Louis had Algiers and Tripoli two Barbary pirate strongholds bombarded to obtain a favourable treaty and the liberation of Christian slaves Next in a punitive mission was launched against Genoa in retaliation for its support for Spain in previous wars Although the Genoese submitted and the Doge led an official mission of apology to Versailles France gained a reputation for brutality and arrogance European apprehension at growing French might and the realisation of the extent of the dragonnades effect discussed below led many states to abandon their alliances with France Accordingly by the late s France became increasingly isolated in Europe br br br Non European relations and the colonies br br French colonies multiplied in Africa the Americas and Asia during Louis reign and French explorers made important discoveries in North America In Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette discovered the Mississippi River In Ren Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle followed the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and claimed the vast Mississippi basin in Louis name calling it Louisiane French trading posts were also established in India at Chandernagore and Pondicherry and in the Indian Ocean at le Bourbon Throughout these regions Louis and Colbert embarked on an extensive program of architecture and urbanism meant to reflect the styles of Versailles and Paris and the gloire of the realm br br Meanwhile diplomatic relations were initiated with distant countries In Suleiman Aga led an Ottoman embassy to revive the old Franco Ottoman alliance Then in after the reception of the Moroccan embassy of Mohammed Tenim in France Moulay Ismail Sultan of Morocco allowed French consular and commercial establishments in his country In Louis once again received a Moroccan ambassador Abdallah bin Aisha and in he received a Persian embassy led by Mohammad Reza Beg br From farther afield Siam dispatched an embassy in reciprocated by the French magnificently the next year under Alexandre Chevalier de Chaumont This in turn was succeeded by another Siamese embassy under Kosa Pan superbly received at Versailles in Louis then sent another embassy in under Simon de la Loub re and French influence grew at the Siamese court which granted Mergui as a naval base to France However the death of Narai King of Ayutthaya the execution of his pro French minister Constantine Phaulkon and the siege of Bangkok in ended this era of French influence br France also attempted to participate actively in Jesuit missions to China To break the Portuguese dominance there Louis sent Jesuit missionaries to the court of the Kangxi Emperor in Jean de Fontaney Joachim Bouvet Jean Fran ois Gerbillon Louis Le Comte and Claude de Visdelou Louis also received a Chinese Jesuit Michael Shen Fu Tsung at Versailles in Furthermore Louis librarian and translator Arcadio Huang was Chinese br br br Height of power br br br Centralisation of power br By the early s Louis had greatly augmented French influence in the world Domestically he successfully increased the influence of the crown and its authority over the church and aristocracy thus consolidating absolute monarchy in France br Louis initially supported traditional Gallicanism which limited papal authority in France and convened an Assembly of the French clergy in November Before its dissolution eight months later the Assembly had accepted the Declaration of the Clergy of France which increased royal authority at the expense of papal power Without royal approval bishops could not leave France and appeals could not be made to the pope Additionally government officials could not be excommunicated for acts committed in pursuance of their duties Although the king could not make ecclesiastical law all papal regulations without royal assent were invalid in France Unsurprisingly the Pope repudiated the Declaration br br By attaching nobles to his court at Versailles Louis achieved increased control over the French aristocracy According to historian Philip Mansel the king turned the palace into br br an irresistible combination of marriage market employment agency and entertainment capital of aristocratic Europe boasting the best theatre opera music gambling sex and most important hunting br Apartments were built to house those willing to pay court to the king However the pensions and privileges necessary to live in a style appropriate to their rank were only possible by waiting constantly on Louis For this purpose an elaborate court ritual was created wherein the king became the centre of attention and was observed throughout the day by the public With his excellent memory Louis could then see who attended him at court and who was absent facilitating the subsequent distribution of favours and positions Another tool Louis used to control his nobility was censorship which often involved the opening of letters to discern their author s opinion of the government and king Moreover by entertaining impressing and domesticating them with extravagant luxury and other distractions Louis not only cultivated public opinion of him but he also ensured the aristocracy remained under his scrutiny br Louis s extravagance at Versailles extended far beyond the scope of elaborate court rituals He took delivery of an African elephant as a gift from the king of Portugal He encouraged leading nobles to live at Versailles This along with the prohibition of private armies prevented them from passing time on their own estates and in their regional power bases from which they historically waged local wars and plotted resistance to royal authority Louis thus compelled and seduced the old military aristocracy the nobility of the sword into becoming his ceremonial courtiers further weakening their power In their place he raised commoners or the more recently ennobled bureaucratic aristocracy the nobility of the robe He judged that royal authority thrived more surely by filling high executive and administrative positions with these men because they could be more easily dismissed than nobles of ancient lineage and entrenched influence It is believed that Louis s policies were rooted in his experiences during the Fronde when men of high birth readily took up the rebel cause against their king who was actually the kinsman of some This victory over the nobility may thus have ensured the end of major civil wars in France until the French Revolution about a century later br br br France as the pivot of warfare br br Under Louis France was the leading European power and most wars pivoted around its aggressiveness No European state exceeded it in population and no one could match its wealth central location and very strong professional army It had largely avoided the devastation of the Thirty Years War Its weaknesses included an inefficient financial system that was hard pressed to pay for its military adventures and the tendency of most other powers to gang up against it br During Louis s reign France fought three major wars the Franco Dutch War the War of the League of Augsburg and the War of the Spanish Succession There were also two lesser conflicts the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions The wars were very expensive but defined Louis XIV s foreign policy and his personality shaped his approach Impelled by a mix of commerce revenge and pique Louis sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military By France retained much of its dominance but had lost control of the seas to England and Holland and most countries both Protestant and Catholic were in alliance against it S bastien Le Prestre de Vauban France s leading military strategist warned Louis in that a hostile Alliance was too powerful at sea He recommended that France fight back by licensing French merchant ships to privateer and seize enemy merchant ships while avoiding its navies br br France has its declared enemies Germany and all the states that it embraces Spain with all its dependencies in Europe Asia Africa and America the Duke of Savoy in Italy England Scotland Ireland and all their colonies in the East and West Indies and Holland with all its possessions in the four corners of the world where it has great establishments France has undeclared enemies indirectly hostile hostile and envious of its greatness Denmark Sweden Poland Portugal Venice Genoa and part of the Swiss Confederation all of which states secretly aid France s enemies by the troops that they hire to them the money they lend them and by protecting and covering their trade br Vauban was pessimistic about France s so called friends and allies br br For lukewarm useless or impotent friends France has the Pope who is indifferent the King of England James II expelled from his country the Grand Duke of Tuscany the Dukes of Mantua Modena and Parma all in Italy and the other faction of the Swiss Some of these are sunk in the softness that comes of years of peace the others are cool in their affections The English and Dutch are the main pillars of the Alliance they support it by making war against us in concert with the other powers and they keep it going by means of the money that they pay every year to Allies We must therefore fall back on privateering as the method of conducting war which is most feasible simple cheap and safe and which will cost least to the state the more so since any losses will not be felt by the King who risks virtually nothing It will enrich the country train many good officers for the King and in a short time force his enemies to sue for peace br br br Edict of Fontainebleau br br Louis decided to persecute Protestants and revoke the Edict of Nantes which awarded Huguenots political and religious freedom He saw the persistence of Protestantism as a disgraceful reminder of royal powerlessness After all the Edict was the pragmatic concession of his grandfather Henry IV to end the longstanding French Wars of Religion An additional factor in Louis thinking was the prevailing contemporary European principle to assure socio political stability cuius regio eius religio whose realm his religion the idea that the religion of the ruler should be the religion of the realm as originally confirmed in central Europe in the Peace of Augsburg of br Responding to petitions Louis initially excluded Protestants from office constrained the meeting of synods closed churches outside of Edict stipulated areas banned Protestant outdoor preachers and prohibited domestic Protestant migration He also disallowed Protestant Catholic intermarriages to which third parties objected encouraged missions to the Protestants and rewarded converts to Catholicism This discrimination did not encounter much Protestant resistance and a steady conversion of Protestants occurred especially among the noble elites br In Louis dramatically increased his persecution of Protestants The principle of cuius regio eius religio generally also meant that subjects who refused to convert could emigrate but Louis banned emigration and effectively insisted that all Protestants must be converted Secondly following the proposal of Ren de Marillac and the Marquis of Louvois he began quartering dragoons in Protestant homes Although this was within his legal rights the dragonnades inflicted severe financial strain on Protestants and atrocious abuse Between and Huguenots converted as this entailed financial rewards and exemption from the dragonnades br br On October Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau which cited the redundancy of privileges for Protestants given their scarcity after the extensive conversions The Edict of Fontainebleau revoked the Edict of Nantes and repealed all the privileges that arose therefrom By his edict Louis no longer tolerated the existence of Protestant groups pastors or churches in France No further churches were to be constructed and those already existing were to be demolished Pastors could choose either exile or secular life Those Protestants who had resisted conversion were now to be baptised forcibly into the established church br Historians have debated Louis reasons for issuing the Edict of Fontainebleau He may have been seeking to placate Pope Innocent XI with whom relations were tense and whose aid was necessary to determine the outcome of a succession crisis in the Electorate of Cologne He may also have acted to upstage Emperor Leopold I and regain international prestige after the latter defeated the Turks without Louis help Otherwise he may simply have desired to end the remaining divisions in French society dating to the Wars of Religion by fulfilling his coronation oath to eradicate heresy br Many historians have condemned the Edict of Fontainebleau as gravely harmful to France In support they cite the emigration of about highly skilled Huguenots roughly one quarter of the Protestant population or of the French population who defied royal decrees and fled France for various Protestant states weakening the French economy and enriching that of Protestant states On the other hand some historians view this as an exaggeration They argue that most of France s preeminent Protestant businessmen and industrialists converted to Catholicism and remained br What is certain is that the reaction to the Edict was mixed Even while French Catholic leaders exulted Pope Innocent XI still argued with Louis over Gallicanism and criticized the use of violence Protestants across Europe were horrified at the treatment of their co religionists but most Catholics in France applauded the move Nonetheless it is indisputable that Louis public image in most of Europe especially in Protestant regions was dealt a severe blow br In the end however despite renewed tensions with the Camisards of south central France at the end of his reign Louis may have helped ensure that his successor would experience fewer instances of the religion based disturbances that had plagued his forebears French society would sufficiently change by the time of his descendant Louis XVI to welcome tolerance in the form of the Edict of Versailles also known as the Edict of Tolerance This restored to non Catholics their civil rights and the freedom to worship openly With the advent of the French Revolution in Protestants were granted equal rights with their Roman Catholic counterparts br br br Nine Years War br br br Causes and conduct of the war br br The Nine Years War which lasted from to initiated a period of decline in Louis s political and diplomatic fortunes It arose from two events in the Rhineland First in the Elector Palatine Charles II died All that remained of his immediate family was Louis s sister in law Elizabeth Charlotte German law ostensibly barred her from succeeding to her brother s lands and electoral dignity but it was unclear enough for arguments in favour of Elizabeth Charlotte to have a chance of success Conversely the princess was clearly entitled to a division of the family s personal property Louis pressed her claims to land and chattels hoping the latter at least would be given to her Then in Maximilian Henry of Bavaria Archbishop of Cologne an ally of France died The archbishopric had traditionally been held by the Wittelsbachs of Bavaria but the Bavarian claimant to replace Maximilian Henry Prince Joseph Clemens of Bavaria was at that time not more than years old and not even ordained Louis sought instead to install his own candidate Wilhelm Egon von F rstenberg to ensure the key Rhenish state remained an ally br In light of his foreign and domestic policies during the early s which were perceived as aggressive Louis s actions fostered by the succession crises of the late s created concern and alarm in much of Europe This led to the formation of the League of Augsburg by the Holy Roman Emperor Spain Sweden Saxony and Bavaria Their stated intention was to return France to at least the borders agreed to in the Treaty of Nijmegen Emperor Leopold I s persistent refusal to convert the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent treaty fed Louis s fears that the Emperor would turn on France and attack the Reunions after settling his affairs in the Balkans br Another event Louis found threatening was England s Glorious Revolution of Although King James II was Catholic his two Anglican daughters Mary and Anne ensured the English people a Protestant succession But when James II s son James Francis Edward Stuart was born he took precedence in succession over his sisters This seemed to herald an era of Catholic monarchs in England Protestant lords called on the Dutch Prince William III of Orange grandson of Charles I of England to come to their aid He sailed for England with troops despite Louis s warning that France would regard it as a provocation Witnessing numerous desertions and defections even among those closest to him James II fled England Parliament declared the throne vacant and offered it to James s daughter Mary II and his son in law and nephew William Vehemently anti French William now William III of England pushed his new kingdoms into war thus transforming the League of Augsburg into the Grand Alliance Before this happened Louis expected William s expedition to England to absorb his energies and those of his allies so he dispatched troops to the Rhineland after the expiry of his ultimatum to the German princes requiring confirmation of the Truce of Ratisbon and acceptance of his demands about the succession crises This military manoeuvre was also intended to protect his eastern provinces from Imperial invasion by depriving the enemy army of sustenance thus explaining the preemptive scorched earth policy pursued in much of southwestern Germany the Devastation of the Palatinate br br French armies were generally victorious throughout the war because of Imperial commitments in the Balkans French logistical superiority and the quality of French generals such as Cond s famous pupil Fran ois Henri de Montmorency Bouteville duc de Luxembourg He triumphed at the Battles of Fleurus in Steenkerque in and Landen in although the battles proved to be of little of strategic consequence mostly due to the nature of late th century warfare br br Although an attempt to restore James II failed at the Battle of the Boyne in France accumulated a string of victories from Flanders in the north Germany in the east and Italy and Spain in the south to the high seas and the colonies Louis personally supervised the captures of Mons in and Namur in Luxembourg gave France the defensive line of the Sambre by capturing Charleroi in France also overran most of the Duchy of Savoy after the battles of Marsaglia and Staffarde in While naval stalemate ensued after the French victory at the Battle of Beachy Head in and the Allied victory at Barfleur La Hougue in the Battle of Torroella in exposed Catalonia to French invasion culminating in the capture of Barcelona The Dutch captured Pondich ry in but a French raid on the Spanish treasure port of Cartagena Spain yielded a fortune of livres br In July the city of Namur occupied for three years by the French was besieged by an allied army led by William III Louis XIV ordered the surprise destruction of a Flemish city to divert the attention of these troops This led to the bombardment of Brussels in which more than buildings were destroyed including the entire city centre The strategy failed as Namur fell three weeks later but harmed Louis XIV s reputation a century later Napoleon deemed the bombardment as barbarous as it was useless br Peace was broached by Sweden in By both sides evidently wanted peace and secret bilateral talks began but to no avail Louis tried to break up the alliance against him by dealing with individual opponents but did not achieve his aim until when the Savoyards agreed to the Treaty of Turin and switched sides Thereafter members of the League of Augsburg rushed to the peace table and negotiations for a general peace began in earnest culminating in the Peace of Ryswick of br br br Peace of Ryswick br br The Peace of Ryswick ended the War of the League of Augsburg and disbanded the Grand Alliance By manipulating their rivalries and suspicions Louis divided his enemies and broke their power br The treaty yielded many benefits for France Louis secured permanent French sovereignty over all of Alsace including Strasbourg and established the Rhine as the Franco German border as it is to this day Pondich ry and Acadia were returned to France and Louis s de facto possession of Saint Domingue was recognised as lawful However he returned Catalonia and most of the Reunions br French military superiority might have allowed him to press for more advantageous terms Thus his generosity to Spain with regard to Catalonia has been read as a concession to foster pro French sentiment and may ultimately have induced King Charles II to name Louis s grandson Philip Duke of Anjou heir to the Spanish throne In exchange for financial compensation France renounced its interests in the Electorate of Cologne and the Palatinate Lorraine which had been occupied by the French since was returned to its rightful Duke Leopold albeit with a right of way to the French military William and Mary were recognised as joint sovereigns of the British Isles and Louis withdrew support for James II The Dutch were given the right to garrison forts in the Spanish Netherlands that acted as a protective barrier against possible French aggression Though in some respects the Treaty of Ryswick may appear a diplomatic defeat for Louis since he failed to place client rulers in control of the Palatinate or the Electorate of Cologne he did fulfil many of the aims laid down in his ultimatum In any case peace in was desirable to Louis since France was exhausted from the costs of the war br br br War of the Spanish Succession br br br Causes and build up to the war br br By the time of the Peace of Ryswick the Spanish succession had been a source of concern to European leaders for well over forty years King Charles II ruled a vast empire comprising Spain Naples Sicily Milan the Spanish Netherlands and numerous Spanish colonies He produced no children however and consequently had no direct heirs br The principal claimants to the throne of Spain belonged to the ruling families of France and Austria The French claim derived from Louis XIV s mother Anne of Austria the older sister of Philip IV of Spain and his wife Maria Theresa Philip IV s eldest daughter Based on the laws of primogeniture France had the better claim as it originated from the eldest daughters in two generations However their renunciation of succession rights complicated matters In the case of Maria Theresa nonetheless the renunciation was considered null and void owing to Spain s breach of her marriage contract with Louis In contrast no renunciations tainted the claims of Emperor Leopold I s son Charles Archduke of Austria who was a grandson of Philip III s youngest daughter Maria Anna The English and Dutch feared that a French or Austrian born Spanish king would threaten the balance of power and thus preferred the Bavarian Prince Joseph Ferdinand a grandson of Leopold I through his first wife Margaret Theresa of Spain the younger daughter of Philip IV br In an attempt to avoid war Louis signed the Treaty of the Hague with William III of England in This agreement divided Spain s Italian territories between Louis s son le Grand Dauphin and Archduke Charles with the rest of the empire awarded to Joseph Ferdinand William III consented to permitting the Dauphin s new territories to become part of France when the latter succeeded to his father s throne The signatories however omitted to consult the ruler of these lands and Charles II was passionately opposed to the dismemberment of his empire In he re confirmed his will that named Joseph Ferdinand as his sole successor br Six months later Joseph Ferdinand died Therefore in Louis and William III concluded a fresh partitioning agreement the Treaty of London This allocated Spain the Low Countries and the Spanish colonies to the Archduke The Dauphin would receive all of Spain s Italian territories Charles II acknowledged that his empire could only remain undivided by bequeathing it entirely to a Frenchman or an Austrian Under pressure from his German wife Maria Anna of Neuburg Charles II named Archduke Charles as his sole heir br br br Acceptance of the will of Charles II and consequences br br On his deathbed in Charles II of Spain unexpectedly changed his will The clear demonstration of French military superiority for many decades before this time the pro French faction at the court of Spain and even Pope Innocent XII convinced him that France was more likely to preserve his empire intact He thus offered the entire empire to the Dauphin s second son Philip Duke of Anjou provided it remained undivided Anjou was not in the direct line of French succession thus his accession would not cause a Franco Spanish union If Anjou refused the throne would be offered to his younger brother Charles Duke of Berry If the Duke of Berry declined it it would go to Archduke Charles then to the distantly related House of Savoy if Charles declined it br Louis was confronted with a difficult choice He could agree to a partition of the Spanish possessions and avoid a general war or accept Charles II s will and alienate much of Europe He may initially have been inclined to abide by the partition treaties but the Dauphin s insistence persuaded him otherwise Moreover Louis s foreign minister Jean Baptiste Colbert marquis de Torcy pointed out that war with the Emperor would almost certainly ensue whether Louis accepted the partition treaties or Charles II s will He emphasised that should it come to war William III was unlikely to stand by France since he made a treaty to avoid war and did not intend to go to war to implement the treaty Indeed in the event of war it might be preferable to be already in control of the disputed lands Eventually therefore Louis decided to accept Charles II s will Philip Duke of Anjou thus became Philip V King of Spain br Most European rulers accepted Philip as king some reluctantly Depending on one s views of the war s inevitability Louis acted reasonably or arrogantly He confirmed that Philip V retained his French rights despite his new Spanish position Admittedly he may only have been hypothesising a theoretical eventuality and not attempting a Franco Spanish union But his actions were certainly not read as disinterested Moreover Louis sent troops to the Spanish Netherlands to evict Dutch garrisons and secure Dutch recognition of Philip V In Philip transferred the asiento the right to supply slaves to Spanish colonies to France as a sign of the two nations growing connections As tensions mounted Louis decided to acknowledge James Stuart the son of James II as King of England Scotland and Ireland on the latter s death infuriating William III These actions enraged Britain and the Dutch Republic With the Holy Roman Emperor and the petty German states they formed another Grand Alliance and declared war on France in French diplomacy secured Bavaria Portugal and Savoy as Franco Spanish allies br br br Commencement of fighting br br Even before war was officially declared hostilities began with Imperial aggression in Italy Once finally declared the War of the Spanish Succession lasted almost until Louis s death at great cost to him and France br The war began with French successes but the talents of John Churchill st Duke of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy checked these victories and broke the myth of French invincibility The duo allowed the Palatinate and Austria to occupy Bavaria after their victory at the Battle of Blenheim Maximilian II Emanuel Elector of Bavaria had to flee to the Spanish Netherlands The impact of this victory won the support of Portugal and Savoy Later the Battle of Ramillies delivered the Low Countries to the Allies and the Battle of Turin forced Louis to evacuate Italy leaving it open to Allied forces Marlborough and Eugene met again at the Battle of Oudenarde which enabled them to invade France br France established contact with Francis II R k czi and promised support if he took up the cause of Hungarian independence br Defeats famine and mounting debt greatly weakened France Between and over two million people died in two famines made worse as foraging armies seized food supplies from the villages In desperation Louis ordered a disastrous invasion of the English island of Guernsey in the autumn of with the aim of raiding their successful harvest By the winter of he was willing to accept peace at nearly any cost He agreed that the entire Spanish empire should be surrendered to Archduke Charles and also consented to return to the frontiers of the Peace of Westphalia giving up all the territories he had acquired over years But he could not promise that Philip V would accept these terms so the Allies demanded that Louis single handedly attack his grandson to force these terms on him If he could not achieve this within the year the war would resume Louis would not accept these terms br br br Turning point br br The final phases of the War of the Spanish Succession demonstrated that the Allies could not maintain Archduke Charles in Spain just as surely as France could not retain the entire Spanish inheritance for Philip V The Allies were definitively expelled from central Spain by the Franco Spanish victories at the Battles of Villaviciosa and Brihuega in French forces elsewhere remained obdurate despite their defeats The Allies suffered a Pyrrhic victory at the Battle of Malplaquet with casualties twice that of the French Eventually France recovered its military pride with the decisive victory at Denain in br French military successes near the end of the war took place against the background of a changed political situation in Austria In Emperor Leopold I died His elder son and successor Joseph I followed him in His heir was none other than Archduke Charles who secured control of all of his brother s Austrian landholdings If the Spanish empire then fell to him it would have resurrected a domain as vast as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V s in the th century To the maritime powers of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic this would have been as undesirable as a Franco Spanish union br br br Conclusion of peace br br As a result of the fresh British perspective on the European balance of power Anglo French talks began culminating in the Peace of Utrecht between Louis Philip V of Spain Anne of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic In after losing Landau and Freiburg the Holy Roman Emperor also made peace with France in the Treaties of Rastatt and Baden br In the general settlement Philip V retained Spain and its colonies while Austria received the Spanish Netherlands and divided Spanish Italy with Savoy Britain kept Gibraltar and Menorca Louis agreed to withdraw his support for James Stuart son of James II and pretender to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland and ceded Newfoundland Rupert s Land and Acadia in the Americas to Anne Britain gained the most from the treaty but the final terms were much more favourable to France than those being discussed in peace negotiations in and France retained le Saint Jean and le Royale and Louis acquired a few minor European territories such as the Principality of Orange and the Ubaye Valley which covered transalpine passes into Italy Thanks to Louis his allies the Electors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to their prewar status and returned their lands br br br Personal life br br br Marriages and children br br Louis and his wife Maria Theresa of Spain had six children from the marriage contracted for them in However only one child the eldest survived to adulthood Louis le Grand Dauphin known as Monseigneur Maria Theresa died in whereupon Louis remarked that she had never caused him unease on any other occasion br Despite evidence of affection early on in their marriage Louis was never faithful to Maria Theresa He took a series of mistresses both official and unofficial Among the better documented are Louise de La Valli re with whom he had five children Bonne de Pons d Heudicourt Catherine Charlotte de Gramont Fran oise Ath na s Marquise de Montespan with whom he had seven children Anne de Rohan Chabot Claude de Vin des illets one child born in Isabelle de Ludres and Marie Ang lique de Scorailles who died at age in childbirth Through these liaisons he produced numerous illegitimate children most of whom he married to members of cadet branches of the royal family br Louis proved relatively more faithful to his second wife Fran oise d Aubign Marquise de Maintenon He first met her through her work caring for his children by Madame de Montespan noting the care she gave to his favourite Louis Auguste Duke of Maine The king was at first put off by her strict religious practice but he warmed to her through her care for his children br When he legitimized his children by Madame de Montespan on December Fran oise d Aubign became the royal governess at Saint Germain As governess she was one of very few people permitted to speak to him as an equal without limits It is believed that they were married secretly at Versailles on or around October or January This marriage though never announced or publicly discussed was an open secret and lasted until his death br br br Piety and religion br br Louis was a pious and devout king who saw himself as the head and protector of the Catholic Church in France He made his devotions daily regardless of where he was following the liturgical calendar regularly Under the influence of his very religious second wife he became much stronger in the practice of his Catholic faith This included banning opera and comedy performances during Lent br Towards the middle and the end of his reign the centre for the King s religious observances was usually the Chapelle Royale at Versailles Ostentation was a distinguishing feature of daily Mass annual celebrations such as those of Holy Week and special ceremonies Louis established the Paris Foreign Missions Society but his informal alliance with the Ottoman Empire was criticised for undermining Christendom br br br Patronage of the arts br br Louis generously supported the royal court of France and those who worked under him He brought the Acad mie Fran aise under his patronage and became its Protector He allowed Classical French literature to flourish by protecting such writers as Moli re Racine and La Fontaine whose works remain influential to this day Louis also patronised the visual arts by funding and commissioning artists such as Charles Le Brun Pierre Mignard Antoine Coysevox and Hyacinthe Rigaud whose works became famous throughout Europe Composers and musicians such as Jean Baptiste Lully Jacques Champion de Chambonni res and Fran ois Couperin thrived In Louis founded the Acad mie Royale de Danse and in the Acad mie d Op ra important driving events in the evolution of ballet He also attracted supported and patronized such artists as Andr Charles Boulle who revolutionised marquetry with his art of inlay today known as Boulle work Always on the lookout for new talent the king launched music competitions in Michel Richard de Lalande thus became deputy master of the Royal Chapel composing his Symphonies for the Soupers du Roy along with large scale Grand Motets br Over the course of four building campaigns Louis converted a hunting lodge built by Louis XIII into the spectacular Palace of Versailles Except for the current Royal Chapel built near the end of his reign the palace achieved much of its current appearance after the third building campaign which was followed by an official move of the royal court to Versailles on May Versailles became a dazzling awe inspiring setting for state affairs and the reception of foreign dignitaries At Versailles the king alone commanded attention br br Several reasons have been suggested for the creation of the extravagant and stately palace as well as the relocation of the monarchy s seat The memoirist Saint Simon speculated that Louis viewed Versailles as an isolated power centre where treasonous cabals could be more readily discovered and foiled There has also been speculation that the revolt of the Fronde caused Louis to hate Paris which he abandoned for a country retreat but his sponsorship of many public works in Paris such as the establishment of a police force and of street lighting lend little credence to this theory As a further example of his continued care for the capital Louis constructed the H tel des Invalides a military complex and home to this day for officers and soldiers rendered infirm either by injury or old age While pharmacology was still quite rudimentary in his day the Invalides pioneered new treatments and set new standards for hospice treatment The conclusion of the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle in also induced Louis to demolish Paris s northern walls in and replace them with wide tree lined boulevards br Louis also renovated and improved the Louvre and other royal residences Gian Lorenzo Bernini was originally to plan additions to the Louvre however his plans would have meant the destruction of much of the existing structure replacing it with an Italian summer villa in the centre of Paris Bernini s plans were eventually shelved in favour of the elegant Louvre Colonnade designed by three Frenchmen Louis Le Vau Charles Le Brun and Claude Perrault With the relocation of the court to Versailles the Louvre was given over to the arts and the public br During his visit from Rome Bernini also executed a renowned portrait bust of the king br br br Image and depiction br br Few rulers in world history have commemorated themselves in as grand a manner as Louis He cultivated his image as the Sun King le Roi Soleil the centre of the universe without equal Louis used court ritual and the arts to validate and augment his control over France With his support Colbert established from the beginning of Louis personal reign a centralised and institutionalised system for creating and perpetuating the royal image The King was thus portrayed largely in majesty or at war notably against Spain This portrayal of the monarch was to be found in numerous media of artistic expression such as painting sculpture theatre dance music and the almanacs that diffused royal propaganda to the population at large br br br Evolution of royal portraiture br br Over his lifetime Louis commissioned numerous works of art to portray himself among them over formal portraits The earliest portrayals of Louis already followed the pictorial conventions of the day in depicting the child king as the majestically royal incarnation of France This idealisation of the monarch continued in later works which avoided depictions of the effect of smallpox that Louis contracted in In the s Louis began to be shown as a Roman emperor the god Apollo or Alexander the Great as can be seen in many works of Charles Le Brun such as sculpture paintings and the decor of major monuments br The depiction of the king in this manner focused on allegorical or mythological attributes instead of attempting to produce a true likeness As Louis aged so too did the manner in which he was depicted Nonetheless there was still a disparity between realistic representation and the demands of royal propaganda There is no better illustration of this than in Hyacinthe Rigaud s frequently reproduced Portrait of Louis XIV of in which a year old Louis appears to stand on a set of unnaturally young legs br Rigaud s portrait exemplified the height of royal portraiture during Louis reign Although Rigaud crafted a credible likeness of Louis the portrait was neither meant as an exercise in realism nor to explore Louis character Certainly Rigaud was concerned with detail and depicted the king s costume with great precision down to his shoe buckle br However Rigaud intended to glorify the monarchy Rigaud s original now housed in the Louvre was originally meant as a gift to Louis grandson Philip V of Spain However Louis was so pleased with the work that he kept the original and commissioned a copy to be sent to his grandson That became the first of many copies both in full and half length formats to be made by Rigaud often with the help of his assistants The portrait also became a model for French royal and imperial portraiture down to the time of Charles X over a century later In his work Rigaud proclaims Louis exalted royal status through his elegant stance and haughty expression the royal regalia and throne rich ceremonial fleur de lys robes as well as the upright column in the background which together with the draperies serves to frame this image of majesty br br br Other works of art br In addition to portraits Louis commissioned at least statues of himself in the s to stand in Paris and provincial towns as physical manifestations of his rule He also commissioned war artists to follow him on campaigns to document his military triumphs To remind the people of these triumphs Louis erected permanent triumphal arches in Paris and the provinces for the first time since the decline of the Roman Empire br Louis reign marked the birth and infancy of the art of medallions Sixteenth century rulers had often issued medals in small numbers to commemorate the major events of their reigns Louis however struck more than to celebrate the story of the king in bronze that were enshrined in thousands of households throughout France br He also used tapestries as a medium of exalting the monarchy Tapestries could be allegorical depicting the elements or seasons or realist portraying royal residences or historical events They were among the most significant means to spread royal propaganda prior to the construction of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles br br br Ballet br br Louis loved ballet and frequently danced in court ballets during the early half of his reign In general Louis was an eager dancer who performed roles in major ballets This approaches the career of a professional ballet dancer br His choices were strategic and varied He danced four parts in three of Moli re s com dies ballets which are plays accompanied by music and dance Louis played an Egyptian in Le Mariage forc in a Moorish gentleman in Le Sicilien in and both Neptune and Apollo in Les Amants magnifiques in br He sometimes danced leading roles that were suitably royal or godlike such as Neptune Apollo or the Sun At other times he would adopt mundane roles before appearing at the end in the lead role It is considered that at all times he provided his roles with sufficient majesty and drew the limelight with his flair for dancing For Louis ballet may not have merely been a tool for manipulation in his propaganda machinery The sheer number of performances he gave as well as the diversity of roles he played may serve to indicate a deeper understanding and interest in the art form br Ballet dancing was used by Louis as a political tool to hold power over his state He integrated ballet deeply into court social functions and fixated his nobles attention on upholding standards in ballet dancing effectively distracting them from political activities In the Royal Academy of Dance was founded by Louis to further his ambition Pierre Beauchamp his private dance instructor was ordered by Louis to come up with a notation system to record ballet performances which he did with great success His work was adopted and published by Feuillet in as Choregraphie This major development in ballet played an important role in promoting French culture and ballet throughout Europe during Louis time br Louis greatly emphasized etiquettes in ballet dancing evidently seen in La belle danse the French noble style More challenging skills were required to perform this dance with movements very much resembling court behaviours as a way to remind the nobles of the king s absolute power and their own status All the details and rules were compressed in five positions of the bodies codified by Beauchamp br br br Unofficial image br Besides the official depiction and image of Louis his subjects also followed a non official discourse consisting mainly of clandestine publications popular songs and rumours that provided an alternative interpretation of Louis and his government They often focused on the miseries arising from poor government but also carried the hope for a better future when Louis escaped the malignant influence of his ministers and mistresses and took the government into his own hands On the other hand petitions addressed either directly to Louis or to his ministers exploited the traditional imagery and language of monarchy These varying interpretations of Louis abounded in self contradictions that reflected the people s amalgamation of their everyday experiences with the idea of monarchy br br br In fiction br br br Literature br Alexandre Dumas portrayed Louis in his two sequels to his novel The Three Musketeers first as a child in Twenty Years After then as a young man in The Vicomte de Bragelonne in which he is a central character The final part of the latter

Louis Duke of Brittany joined them a few weeks later Thus on his deathbed Louis heir apparent was his five year old great grandson Louis Duke of Anjou Burgundy s younger son br Louis foresaw an underaged successor and sought to restrict the power of his nephew Philip II Duke of Orl ans who as his closest surviving legitimate relative in France would probably become regent to the prospective Louis XV Accordingly the king created a regency council as Louis XIII had in anticipation of Louis XIV s own minority with some power vested in his illegitimate son Louis Auguste de Bourbon Duke of Maine Orl ans however had Louis will annulled by the Parlement of Paris after his death and made himself sole regent He stripped Maine and his brother Louis Alexandre Count of Toulouse of the rank of

lasted for years after the death of Charles II of Spain in br br Further down the French line of succession in was the House of Conde followed by the House of Conti a cadet branch of the House of Conde Both of these royal houses were descended in the male line from Henri II Prince of Conde a second cousin of French King Louis XIII the father of Louis XIV in the male line br br br Legacy br br br Reputation br According to Philippe de Courcillon s Journal Louis on his deathbed advised his heir with these words Do not follow the bad example which I have set you I have often undertaken war too lightly and have sustained it for vanity Do not imitate me but be a peaceful prince and may you apply yourself principally to the alleviation of the burdens of your subjects br br Some historians point out that it was a customary demonstration of piety in those days to exaggerate one s sins Thus they do not place much emphasis on Louis deathbed declarations in assessing his accomplishments Rather they focus on military and diplomatic successes such as how he placed a French prince on the Spanish throne This they contend ended the threat of an aggressive Spain that historically interfered in domestic French politics These historians also emphasise the effect of Louis wars in expanding France s boundaries and creating more defensible frontiers that preserved France from invasion until the Revolution br Arguably Louis also applied himself indirectly to the alleviation of the burdens of his subjects For example he patronised the arts encouraged industry fostered trade and commerce and sponsored the founding of an overseas empire Moreover the significant reduction in civil wars and aristocratic rebellions during his reign are seen by these historians as the result of Louis consolidation of royal authority over feudal elites In their analysis his early reforms centralised France and marked the birth of the modern French state They regard the political and military victories as well as numerous cultural achievements as how Louis helped raise France to a preeminent position in Europe Europe came to admire France for its military and cultural successes power and sophistication Europeans generally began to emulate French manners values goods and deportment French became the universal language of the European elite br Louis detractors have argued that his considerable foreign military and domestic expenditure impoverished and bankrupted France His supporters however distinguish the state which was impoverished from France which was not As supporting evidence they cite the literature of the time such as the social commentary in Montesquieu s Persian Letters br Alternatively Louis critics attribute the social upheaval culminating in the French Revolution to his failure to reform French institutions while the monarchy was still secure Other scholars counter that there was little reason to reform institutions that largely worked well under Louis They also maintain that events occurring almost years after his death were not reasonably foreseeable to Louis and that in any case his successors had sufficient time to initiate reforms of their own br br Louis has often been criticised for his vanity The memoirist Saint Simon who claimed that Louis slighted him criticised him thus There was nothing he liked so much as flattery or to put it more plainly adulation the coarser and clumsier it was the more he relished it For his part Voltaire saw Louis vanity as the cause for his bellicosity It is certain that he passionately wanted glory rather than the conquests themselves In the acquisition of Alsace and half of Flanders and of all of Franche Comt what he really liked was the name he made for himself br Nonetheless Louis has also received praise The anti Bourbon Napoleon described him not only as a great king but also as the only King of France worthy of the name Leibniz the German Protestant philosopher commended him as one of the greatest kings that ever was And Lord Acton admired him as by far the ablest man who was born in modern times on the steps of a throne The historian and philosopher Voltaire wrote His name
