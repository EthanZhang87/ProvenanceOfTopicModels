Semiramis Syriac amm r m Greek Arabic Sam r m s Armenian amiram was the legendary Lydian Babylonian wife of Onnes and of Ninus who succeeded the latter on the throne of Assyria according to Movses Khorenatsi Legends narrated by Diodorus Siculus who drew primarily from the works of Ctesias of Cnidus describe her and her relationships to Onnes and King Ninus br Armenians and the Assyrians of Iraq northeast Syria southeast Turkey and northwest Iran still use Shamiram as a given name for girls br The real and historical Shammuramat the original Akkadian form of the name was the Assyrian wife of Shamshi Adad V ruled BC BC She ruled the Neo Assyrian Empire as its regent for five years before her son Adad nirari III came of age and took the reins of power She ruled at a time of political uncertainty which may partly explain why Assyrians may have accepted the rule of a woman when it was not allowed by their cultural tradition She conquered much of the Middle East and the Levant and stabilized and strengthened the empire after a destructive civil war It has been speculated that being a woman who ruled successfully may have made the Assyrians regard her with particular reverence and that her achievements may have been retold over the generations until she was gradually turned into a legendary figure br The name of Semiramis came to be applied to various monuments in Western Asia and Anatolia whose origins had been forgotten or unknown even the Behistun Inscription of Darius Herodotus ascribes to her the artificial banks that confined the Euphrates He knew her name because it was inscribed on a gate of Babylon Various places in Mesopotamia Media Persia the Levant Anatolia the Arabian Peninsula and the Caucasus received names recalling Semiramis br br br Historical figure br br While the achievements of Semiramis are clearly in the realm of mythical Persian Armenian and Greek historiography the historical Shammuramat certainly existed After her husband s death she might have served as regent for her son Adad nirari III Thus during that time Shammuramat could have been in control of the vast Neo Assyrian Empire BC which stretched from the Caucasus Mountains in the north to the Arabian Peninsula in the south and from western Iran in the east to Cyprus in the west br In the city of A ur on the Tigris she had an obelisk built and inscribed that read Stele of Shammuramat queen of Shamshi Adad King of the Universe King of Assyria Mother of Adad Nirari King of the Universe King of Assyria Daughter in Law of Shalmaneser King of the Four Regions of the World br br br Legend according to Diodorus Siculus br br According to Diodorus a first century BC Greek historian Semiramis was of noble parents the daughter of the fish goddess Derketo of Ascalon and of a mortal He related that Derketo abandoned her at birth and drowned herself Doves fed the child until Simmas the royal shepherd found her Semiramis married Onnes or Menones a general under King Ninus and she became an advisor to the king Her advice led him to great successes At the Siege of Bactra she personally led a party of soldiers to seize a key defensive point leading to the capture of the city br Ninus was so struck that he fell in love with her He tried to compel Onnes to give her to him as a wife first offering his own daughter Sonan in return and eventually threatening to put out his eyes as punishment Out of fear of the king and out of doomed passion for his wife Onnes fell into a kind of frenzy and madness and hanged himself Ninus then married Semiramis br Diodorus relates that after their marriage Semiramis and Ninus had a son named Ninyas After King Ninus conquered Asia including the Bactrians he was fatally wounded by an arrow Semiramis disguised herself as her son so the army would follow her instructions thinking they came from their new ruler Diodorus writes that her reign lasted for years and that she conquered much of Asia and achieved many feats She restored ancient Babylon and protected it with a high brick wall that completely surrounded the city She built several palaces in Persia including Ecbatana br She ruled Asia effectively and added Libya and Aethiopia to the empire She went to war with King Stabrobates Supratika of India having her artisans build an army of false elephants by putting manipulated skins of dark skinned buffaloes over her camels to deceive the Indians into thinking she had acquired real elephants This ploy succeeded initially but she was wounded in the counterattack and her army mainly annihilated forcing the surviving remnants to re ford the Indus and retreat to the west br Diodorus mistakenly attributed the Behistun Inscription to her it is now known to have been produced by Darius the Great The writings of Diodorus about Semiramis are strongly influenced by the writings of Ctesias of Cnidus although his writings about Semiramis do not always follow those by Ctesias br br br Other ancient traditions br br Legends describing Semiramis have been recorded by approximately ancient writers including Plutarch Eusebius Polyaenus Valerius Maximus Orosius and Justinus She was associated with Ishtar and Astarte since the time before Diodorus The association of the fish and dove is found at Hierapolis Bambyce Mabbog now Manbij the great temple that according to one legend was founded by Semiramis where her statue was shown with a golden dove on her head br The name of Semiramis came to be applied to various monuments in Western Asia and Anatolia the origins of which ancient writers sometimes asserted had been forgotten or unknown Various places in Assyria and throughout Mesopotamia as a whole Media Persia the Levant Anatolia the Arabian Peninsula and the Caucasus bore the name of Semiramis in slightly changed forms even some named during the Middle Ages She is credited with founding the city of Van in Turkey in order to have a summer residence and that city may be found referred to as Shamiramagerd city of Semiramis br br Herodotus an ancient Greek writer geographer and historian living from c to BC ascribes to Semiramis the artificial banks that confined the Euphrates and knows her name as borne by a gate of Babylon Strabo a Greek geographer philosopher and historian who lived in Asia Minor during or BC to AD credits her with building earthworks and other structures throughout almost the whole continent Nearly every stupendous work of antiquity by the Euphrates or in Iran seems to have been ascribed to Semiramis even the Behistun Inscription of Darius br Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus c c who wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from antiquity credits her as the first person to castrate a male youth into eunuch hood Semiramis that ancient queen who was the first person to castrate male youths of tender age br Armenian tradition portrays Semiramis negatively possibly because of a victorious military campaign she waged against them One of the most popular legends in Armenian tradition involves Semiramis and an Armenian king Ara the Handsome According to that legend Semiramis had fallen in love with the handsome Armenian King Ara and asked him to marry her When he refused in her passion she gathered the armies of Assyria and marched against Armenia br During the battle Semiramis was victorious but Ara was slain despite her orders to capture him alive This legend continues that to avoid continuous warfare with the Armenians Semiramis who they alleged was a sorceress took his body and prayed to deities to raise Ara from the dead When the Armenians advanced to avenge their leader she disguised one of her lovers as Ara and spread the rumor that the deities had brought Ara back to life reportedly convincing the Armenians not to continue the war br In one persistent tradition in this vein the prayers of Semiramis are successful and Ara returns to life During the nineteenth century it was reported that a village called Lezk near Van in Turkey traditionally held that it was the location of the resurrection of Ara br br br In later traditions br br Although negative portrayals did exist generally Semiramis was viewed positively before the rise of Christianity During the Middle Ages she became associated with promiscuity and lustfulness One story claimed that she had an incestuous relationship with her son justified it by passing a law to legitimize parent child marriages and invented the chastity belt to deter any romantic rivals before he eventually killed her This was likely popularized in the fifth century by Orosius in his universal history Seven Books of History Against the Pagans which has been described as an anti pagan polemic br In the Divine Comedy Inferno V Dante places Semiramis among the souls of the lustful in the Second Circle of Hell She appears in Petrarch s Triumph of Love canto III verse She is one of three women exemplifying evil love the other two being Byblis and Myrrha She is included in De Mulieribus Claris a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio that was composed in It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature Semiramis always was admired for her martial and political achievements br Her reputation partly recovered in the late Middle Ages and Renaissance She was included in Christine de Pizan s The Book of the City of Ladies finished by and starting in the fourteenth century she was commonly found on the Nine Worthies list for women br br br Literary references br Semiramis appears in many plays such as Voltaire s tragedy S miramis and Pedro Calder n de la Barca s drama La hija del aire and in operas by dozens of composers including Antonio Vivaldi Christoph Willibald Gluck Domenico Cimarosa Josef Myslive ek Giacomo Meyerbeer and Gioachino Rossini Arthur Honegger composed music for Paul Val ry s ballet pantomime Semiramis which was revived in after many years of neglect br In Eug ne Ionesco s play The Chairs the Old Woman character is referred to as Semiramis It has been suggested that the poem Semiramis perhaps written in by Warner of Rouen at the court of Emma of Normandy s brother Richard Duke of Normandy and dedicated to her brother Archbishop Robert was a satire ridiculing Emma s relation with her husband King Cnut br br Semiramis was mentioned by William Shakespeare in Titus Andronicus II and The Taming of the Shrew Ind Portrayal of Semiramis has been used as a metaphor for female rulership Sometimes she was referenced during political disputes regarding rule by women both as an unfavorable comparison for example against Elizabeth I of England and as an example of a woman who governed well Powerful female monarchs Margaret I of Denmark and Catherine the Great were given the designation Semiramis of the North br The mother of the sultan in The Man of Law s Tale in Geoffrey Chaucer s Canterbury Tales is compared to Semiramis with the intention of suggesting that the mother of the sultan is an evil woman just like Semiramis br In the twentieth century Semiramis has appeared in several sword and sandal films She was portrayed by Rhonda Fleming in Queen of Babylon and by Yvonne Furneaux in I am Semiramis br br br The Two Babylons br br Despite a lack of supporting evidence in the Bible the book The Two Babylons by the Christian minister Alexander Hislop was particularly influential in characterizing Semiramis as the Whore of Babylon Hislop claimed that Semiramis invented polytheism and with it goddess worship He claimed that the head of the Catholic Church inherited and continued to propagate a millennia old secret conspiracy founded by Semiramis and the Biblical king Nimrod to propagate the pagan religion of ancient Babylon Grabbe and others have rejected the allegations in this book as based on a flawed understanding of the texts but variations of them are accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants br Hislop asserted that Semiramis was a queen consort and the mother of Nimrod builder of the Bible s Tower of Babel He said that Semiramis and Nimrod s incestuous male offspring was the Akkadian deity Tammuz and that all divine pairings in religions were retellings of this story These claims are still circulated among some groups of evangelical Protestants in the form of Jack Chick tracts comic books and related media br Critics have dismissed the speculations by Hislop as based on misunderstandings br Lester L Grabbe has claimed that Hislop s argument particularly his identification of Ninus with Nimrod is based on a misunderstanding of historical Babylon and its religion Grabbe criticized Hislop for portraying Semiramis as Nimrod s consort despite that she has not been found in a single text associated with him and for portraying her as the mother of harlots even though this is not how she is depicted in any of the historical texts where she is mentioned br Ralph Woodrow also has been critical of this interpretation and has stated that Alexander Hislop picked chose and mixed portions of various myths from different cultures br br br In modern culture br The Semiramis InterContinental Hotel in Cairo is named after her It is where the Cairo Conference of
