Animal training is the act of teaching animals specific responses to specific conditions or stimuli Training may be for purposes such as companionship detection protection and entertainment The type of training an animal receives will vary depending on the training method used and the purpose for training the animal For example a seeing eye dog will be trained to achieve a different goal than a wild animal in a circus br In some countries animal trainer certification bodies exist They do not share consistent goals or requirements they do not prevent someone from practicing as an animal trainer nor using the title Similarly the United States does not require animal trainers to have any specific certification An animal trainer should consider the natural behaviors of the animal and aim to modify behaviors through a basic system of reward and punishment br br br Methods br br br The behavioral approach br br br Principles br During training an animal trainer can administer one of four potential consequences for a given behavior br br Positive reinforcement br Occurs when an animal s behavior is followed by a stimulus that increases occurrences of the behavior in the future br Negative reinforcement br Occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of an aversive stimulus which causes the occurrences of the behavior to increase in the future br Positive punishment br Occurs when a behavior is followed by the addition of an aversive stimulus This causes a decrease in occurrences of behavior in the future br Negative punishment br Occurs when a behavior is followed by the removal of a stimulus As a result the occurrences of the behavior decrease in the future br Behavior analysts emphasize the use of positive reinforcement for increasing desirable behaviors and negative punishment for decreasing undesirable behaviors If punishment is going to be used to decrease an undesirable behavior the animal must be able to receive positive reinforcement for an alternative behavior br br br Establishing new behavior br Reinforcement should be provided according to a predetermined schedule Such a schedule of reinforcement specifies whether all responses or only some are reinforced and includes the following br br Variable ratio br A reinforcer delivery occurs after a set number of responses but that number varies around an average number br Fixed ratio br A specific number of responses occur before a reinforcer is delivered br Variable interval br The first response that is emitted after a set but variable amount of time has elapsed is reinforced br Fixed interval br The first response that is emitted after a set time has elapsed is reinforced br While continuous reinforcement in a fixed ratio schedule may be necessary for the initial learning stages a variable ratio schedule is the most effective at maintaining behavior over long periods of time br There are various methods animal trainers can use to prompt an animal to respond to a stimulus in a specific way For example shaping is a process by which successive approximations are rewarded until the desirable response topography is attained An animal trainer can use conditioned reinforcers like clickers to bridge the interval between response and positive reinforcement Some stimuli that is considered discriminative are signals targets and cues They can be used to prompt a response from an animal and can be changed to other stimuli or faded in magnitude In order to delay satiation reinforcer size should be as small as possible and still be effective for reinforcement Also the timing of the delivery of a reinforcer is crucial Initially the interval between response and consequence must be minimal in order for the animal to associate the consequence with the response br Other important issues related to this method are br br Stimulus control br Motivating operations br Desensitization br Chaining br S deltas br Discrimination br Generalization br br br Other considerations br Certain sub fields of animal training tend to also have certain philosophies and styles For example fields such as br br Dog training br Companion bird training br Hunting bird training br Companion dog training br Show dog training br Dressage horse training br Mahout elephant training br Circus elephant training br Zoo elephant training br Zoo exotic animal training br Marine mammal training br br The degree of trainer protection from the animal and the tasks trained may also vary They can range from entertainment husbandry veterinary behaviors physical labor or athleticism habituation to averse stimuli interaction or non interaction with other humans or even research sensory physiological cognitive br Training also may take into consideration the natural social tendencies of the animal species or even breed such as predilections for attention span food motivation dominance hierarchies aggression or bonding to individuals conspecifics as well as humans Consideration must also be given to practical aspects on the human side such as the ratio of the number of trainers to each animal In some circumstances one animal may have multiple trainers in others a trainer might attend simultaneously to many animals in a training session Sometimes training is accomplished with a single trainer working individually with a single animal In some species the number of trainers is irrelevant yet it can usually achieve the wanted outcome br br br Service animals br Service animals such as assistance dogs Capuchin monkeys and miniature horses are trained to utilize their sensory and social skills to bond with a human and help that person to offset a disability in daily life The use of service animals especially dogs is an ever growing field with a wide range of special adaptations br In the United States selected inmates in prisons are used to train service dogs In addition to adding to the short supply of service animals such programs have produced benefits in improved socialization skills and behavior of inmates br br br Entertainment br br Organizations such as the American Humane Association monitor the use of animals such as those used in the entertainment industry but they do not monitor their training It is best known for its end credit disclaimer No Animals Were Harmed that appears at the end of the credits of films and shows br The Patsy Award Picture Animal Top Star of the Year was originated by the Hollywood office in after a horse was killed in an on set accident during the filming of the Tyrone Power film Jesse James The award now covers both film and television and is separated into four categories canine equine wild and special br One animal trainer Frank Inn received over Patsy awards While there is a high demand for mammals for film and television there is also a demand for other animals Steven R Kutcher has filled this niche for insects br br br Companion animals br br br Dogs br br Basic obedience training tasks for dogs include walking on a leash attention housebreaking nonaggression and socialization with humans or other pets Dogs are also trained for many other activities such as dog sports service dogs and working dog tasks br Positive reinforcement for dogs can include primary reinforcers like food or social reinforcers such as vocal good boy or tactile stroking ones Positive punishment if used at all can be physical such as pulling on a leash or spanking It may also be vocal such as saying bad dog Bridges to positive reinforcement include vocal cues whistling and dog whistles as well as clickers used in clicker training a method popularized by Karen Pryor Negative reinforcement may also be used Punishment is also a tool including withholding of food or physical discipline br br br Horses br br The primary purpose of training horses is to socialize them around humans teach them to behave in a manner that makes them safe for humans to handle and as adults to carry a rider under saddle or to be driven in order to pull a vehicle As prey animals much effort must be put into training horses to overcome its natural flight or fight instinct and accept handling that would not be natural for a wild animal such as willingly going into a confined space or having a predator a human being sit on its back As training advances some horses are prepared for competitive sports up to the Olympic games where horses are the only non human animal athlete that is used at the Olympics All equestrian disciplines from horse racing to draft horse showing require the horse to have specialized training br br Unlike dogs horses are not motivated as strongly by positive reinforcement rewards as they are motivated by other operant conditioning methods such as the release of pressure as a reward for the correct behavior called negative reinforcement Positive reinforcement techniques such as petting kind words rewarding of treats and clicker training have some benefit but not to the degree seen in dogs and other predator species Punishment of horses is effective only to a very limited degree usually a sharp command or brief physical punishment given within a few seconds of a disobedient act Horses do not correlate punishment to a specific behavior unless it occurs immediately They do however have a remarkably long memory and once a task is learned it will be retained for a very long time For this reason poor training or allowing bad habits to be learned can be very difficult to remedy at a later date br br br Birds br Typical training tasks for companion birds include perching non aggression halting feather picking controlling excessive vocalizations socialization with household members and other pets and socialization with strangers The large parrot species frequently have lifespans that exceed that of their human owners and they are closely bonded to their owners Some birds of prey are trained to hunt an ancient art known as falconry or hawking In China the practice of training cormorants to catch fish has gone on for over years br br br Chickens br br Training chickens has become a way for trainers of other animals primarily dogs to perfect their training technique Bob Bailey formerly of Animal Behavior Enterprises and the IQ Zoo teaches chicken training seminars where trainers teach poultry to discriminate between shapes to navigate an obstacle course and to chain behaviors together Chicken training is done using operant conditioning using a clicker and chicken feed for reinforcement The first chicken workshops were given by Keller and Marian Breland in to a group of animal feed salesmen from General Mills in Minneapolis Minnesota Trained chickens may be confined to a display Bird Brain where they play Tic Tac Toe against humans for a fee invented by Bob Bailey and Grant Evans of Animal Behavior Enterprises The moves were chosen by computer and indicated to the chicken by a light invisible to the human player br br br Fish and molluscs br Fish can also be trained For example goldfish may swim toward their owners and follow them as they walk through the room but will not follow anyone else The fish may swim up and down signalling the owner to turn on its aquarium light when it is off and it will skim the surface until its owner feeds it br Fish have also been taught to perform more complicated tasks such as fetching rings swimming through hoops and tubes doing the limbo and pushing a miniature soccer ball into a net br Fish have been taught to distinguish and respond differently to slight differences in human faces displayed on a screen archerfish or styles of music goldfish and koi br Molluscs with totally different brain designs have been taught to distinguish and respond to geometric symbols cuttlefish and octopus and have been taught that food behind a clear barrier cannot be eaten squid br br br Wild animals br br br Zoological parks br Animals in public display are sometimes trained for educational entertainment management and husbandry behaviors Educational behaviors may include species typical behaviors under stimulus control such as vocalizations Entertainment may include display behaviors to show the animal or simply arbitrary behaviors Management includes movement such as following the trainer entering crates or moving from pen to pen or tank to tank through gates Husbandry behaviors facilitate veterinary care It can include desensitization to various physical examinations or procedures such as br br Cleaning br Nail clipping or stepping onto a scale voluntarily br The collection of samples e g biopsy urine br Such voluntary training is important for minimizing the frequency with which zoo collection animals must be anesthetized or physically restrained br br br Marine mammal parks br Many marine mammals are trained for entertainment such as bottlenose dolphins killer whales belugas sea lions and others br In a public display situation the audience s attention is focused on the animal rather than the trainer therefore the discriminative stimulus is generally gestural a hand sign and sparse in nature Unobtrusive dog whistles are used as bridges and positive reinforcers are either primary food or tactile rub downs and not vocal However pinnipeds and mustelids sea lions seals walruses and otters can hear in our frequency so most of the time they will receive vocal reinforcers during shows and performances The shows are turned into more of a play production because of this instead of just a run through of behaviors like cetaceans generally do in their shows Guests can often hear these vocal reinforcers when attending a SeaWorld show During the Clyde and Seamore show the trainers may say something like Good grief Clyde or Good job Seamore The trainers substitute the word good in the place of food or rubdowns when teaching a specific behavior to the animals so that the animals no longer need constant feeding as praise for achieving the appropriate behavior br br br Field research br On an experimental basis wildlife researchers have employed animal trainers in their interactions with animals in the field br br br List of notable
