An animal sanctuary is a facility where animals are brought to live and to be protected for the rest of their lives Pattrice Jones co founder of VINE Sanctuary defines an animal sanctuary as a safe enough place or relationship within the continuing hazards that menace everybody In addition sanctuaries are an experimental staging ground for transformative human animal relations There are five types of animal sanctuaries reflective of the species belonging of the residents companion animal sanctuaries wildlife sanctuaries exotic animal sanctuaries farmed animal sanctuaries and cetacean sanctuaries br Unlike animal shelters sanctuaries do not seek to place animals with individuals or groups instead maintaining each animal until their natural death either from disease or from other animals in the sanctuary However they can offer rehoming services which can include veterinarians help In some cases an establishment may have characteristics of both a sanctuary and a shelter for instance some animals may be in residence temporarily until a good home is found and others may be permanent residents The mission of sanctuaries is generally to be safe havens where the animals receive the best care that the sanctuaries can provide Animals are not bought sold or traded nor are they used for animal testing Additionally no parts of nor secretions from the animals are commodified such as eggs wool or milk The resident animals are given the opportunity to behave as natural as possible in a protective environment br br br Overview br What distinguishes a sanctuary from other institutions is the philosophy that the residents come first In a sanctuary every action is scrutinized for any trace of human benefit at the expense of non human residents Sanctuaries act on behalf of the animals and the caregivers work under the notion that all animals in the sanctuary human and non human are of equal importance br Most sanctuaries are not open to the public in the sense of a zoo that is allowing unescorted public access to the facility A legitimate sanctuary avoids activity that would place the animals in an unduly stressful situation Most sanctuaries are also not government funded and are usually nonprofit Public help is accepted by sanctuaries in the form of volunteering monetary contributions donations of food and materials spreading the word and in some cases adoption br One of the most important missions of sanctuaries beyond caring for the animals is educating the public The ultimate goal of many sanctuaries is to change the way that humans think of and treat non human animals br On the basis of the types of animals being cared for sanctuaries are of five types br br Companion animal sanctuaries br Wildlife sanctuaries br Exotic animal sanctuaries br Farmed animal sanctuaries br Cetacean sanctuaries br br br Farmed animal sanctuaries br Farmed animal sanctuaries FAS provide care shelter and advocacy of farmed animal species such as chickens cows goats fish horses pig turkeys and sheep The farm sanctuary layout tends to resemble traditional farms however functions differently FAS as a movement began with Gene Baur the co founder of Farm Sanctuary the first official farm sanctuary that opened in The daily tasks of a FAS involve the primary guardians volunteers and at time visitors Each day is structured by routines such as feeding care and health procedures as well as cleaning and maintenance Points of conflict for sanctuaries include human intervention in matters of sterilizing animals and species segregation Moreover effective altruists have critiqued the efficiency of FAS s ability to reduce animal suffering as demonstrated in the arithmetic of compassion a utilitarian measure of advocacy that applies mathematical formulas to reduce the most suffering in light of individual lives Jon Bockman of Animal Charity Evaluators states expending too many resources on direct rescue results in less money directed toward education and a lower overall impact in helping animals and all advocates should give consideration to this concern when deciding how best to help animals FAS has in some ways evolved to more actions such as re homing to increase sanctuary capacity and rescuing farmed animals in criminal or domestic cases br br br Education br The educational role is a secondary role of FAS Investing in transforming visitors and volunteers perspectives on animal agriculture is a key component of FAS enlisting farmed animal residents as ambassadors of their species to serve a fundraiser role br br br FAS models br Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka have outlined two different types of FAS models FAS can be distinguished by ascribing to either refuge and advocacy model or intentional community model br br br Refuge and advocacy based models br Refuge and advocacy based models are the most standard These sanctuaries are found in traditional agricultural communities in part because of the physical and legal infrastructure Six characteristics of this model include duty of care support for species typical flourishing recognition of individuality non exploitation non perpetuation and awareness and advocacy The latter characteristic has launched a series of questions into the effectiveness of the educational component of sanctuaries br br br Intentional community model br The intentional community model addresses the shortcomings of the standard sanctuary model by focusing on movement building that includes a spectrum of speciesist issues such as developing farmed animal veterinary care that exist outside of standard practices that have aimed at meeting animal agricultural interests The six characteristics of the intentional community model include belonging absence of fixed hierarchical relationships self determination citizenship dependent agency and scaffolded choices and reconfigured spaces These characteristics redress some of the critiques of the refuge and advocacy model by grounding sanctuary practices in animal agency and expanding the geographical boundaries of where animals can live Expanding the geographies in which farmed animals are found serve as a corrective to forming human farmed animal friendships br An example of the intentional sanctuary model can be found in the Microsanctuary Movement started by Rosemary and Justin Van Kleeck The Microsanctuary Movement encourages city dwellers to rescue farmed animals to expand what species are considered to be companion animals br Similarly Darren Chang co founder of the Riverdale Farm Sanctuary Project has launched a campaign to transform Riverdale Farms an urban farm in Toronto into a FAS advocating for Animal Rescue Refuge and Advocacy Compassion and Nonviolence Ecological and Food Justice and Compassionate Interspecies Community br Expanding beyond the traditional role of a safe haven for farmed animals sanctuaries can also be understood as playing political roles in transforming the political and spatial lives of animal residents and their broader species communities leaning into pioneering a less speciesist future br br br Cetacean sanctuaries br Cetacean sanctuaries are designed for autonomy and well being enabling as natural a life as possible in ocean water Lifetime of care is provided for these whales dolphins or porpoises Like other wild animals who have spent much or all of their lives in zoos cetaceans who have lived in marine parks for most or all of their lives are potentially poor candidates for reintroduction and therefore sanctuaries are an alternative to living on display or in entertainment facilities Sanctuary site selection as far as size water quality protection from hazards and weather events and more introduce unique considerations for finding a location br The need for cetacean sanctuaries is quickly emerging due to shifting regulations and changes in public attitudes toward cetaceans in captivity With an estimated cetaceans in captivity globally the need for spacious natural ocean environments that provide feeding and care is increasing as globally marine parks and aquariums move away from whales and dolphins in their facilities A primary criticism of commercial facilities is that animals are expected to perform unnatural behaviors for audiences in spaces that are small and cannot adequately approximate a natural setting br The first cetacean sanctuary for belugas opened in August by SEA LIFE Trust as two belugas Little Grey and Little White were transported miles from an aquarium in China to the first open water whale sanctuary for belugas in Iceland The Whale Sanctuary Project is creating a coastal sanctuary for beluga whales and orcas in Port Hilford Nova Scotia and plans to welcome their first residents in late assuming the project gets the required federal and provincial permits The National Aquarium in Baltimore Maryland is seeking a Caribbean location to create a warm water seaside dolphin sanctuary to become the permanent home for the dolphins currently at their facility And the Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation is planning to create the Aegean Marine Life Sanctuary for previously captive dolphins on the island of Lipsi south of Samos in the eastern Aegean Sea br Like other animal sanctuaries cetacean sanctuaries adhere to a set of principles that put the animals first above the needs of the public researchers donors or other stakeholders In cetacean sanctuaries each animal s physical and mental well being is the priority and the mission is to provide an environment where the cetacean residents can thrive br br br Services provided br br Animal sanctuary services include spaying and neutering hygiene and physical well being These services are mainly performed by licensed veterinarians Other positions that can be held by people at sanctuaries include specialized animal trainers groomers and volunteers When it comes to new residents they are typically not used to living with a large population of their kind and can be easily overwhelmed or agitated Because of this they can be held for a certain amount of time before being admitted to the general public In this time veterinarians study the new animal s behavioral and dietary habits and try for a smooth transition into the sanctuary s environment Also some species of animals dogs for example are social creatures In isolation they get lonely and become depressed Animal sanctuaries often accommodate these types of animals by putting them in living quarters where they re in groups or pairs that they fit well with Enrichment activities are also available for the residents br br br Accreditation br br There are two primary organizations that provide accreditation and support for animal sanctuaries the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and the American Sanctuary Association In the United States sanctuaries must also be licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture USDA and regularly inspected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act br br br See also br List of animal sanctuaries br Nature
