title: Habitat destruction
id: 1707053
Habitat destruction also termed habitat loss and habitat reduction occurs when a natural habitat is no longer able to support its native species The organisms once living there have either moved to elsewhere or are dead leading to a decrease in biodiversity and species numbers Habitat destruction is in fact the leading cause of biodiversity loss and species extinction worldwide br Humans contribute to habitat destruction through the use of natural resources agriculture industrial production and urbanization urban sprawl Other activities include mining logging and trawling Environmental factors can contribute to habitat destruction more indirectly Geological processes climate change introduction of invasive species ecosystem nutrient depletion water and noise pollution are some examples Loss of habitat can be preceded by an initial habitat fragmentation Fragmentation and loss of habitat have become one of the most important topics of research in ecology as they are major threats to the survival of endangered species br br br Observations br br br By region br br Biodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and when all hotspots are combined may contain over half of the world s terrestrial species These hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction Most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed WRI Islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include New Zealand Madagascar the Philippines and Japan South and East Asia especially China India Malaysia Indonesia and Japan and many areas in West Africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat Marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat Forest City a township in southern Malaysia built on Environmentally Sensitive Area ESA Rank wetland is one such example with irreversible reclamation proceeding prior to environmental impact assessment and approvals Other such areas include the eastern coasts of Asia and Africa northern coasts of South America and the Caribbean Sea and its associated islands br Regions of unsustainable agriculture or unstable governments which may go hand in hand typically experience high rates of habitat destruction South Asia Central America Sub Saharan Africa and the Amazonian tropical rainforest areas of South America are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices and or government mismanagement br Areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction In the U S less than of native vegetation remains in many parts of the East and Midwest Only of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of Europe br Currently changes occurring in different environments around the world are changing the specific geographical habitats that are suitable for plants to grow Therefore the ability for plants to migrate to suitable environment areas will have a strong impact on the distribution of plant diversity However at the moment the rates of plant migration that are influenced by habitat loss and fragmentation are not as well understood as they could be br br br By type of ecosystem br br Tropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat From the approximately million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide less than million square kilometers remain today The current rate of deforestation is square kilometers per year which equates to a loss of approximately of original forest habitat each year br Other forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests Deforestation for farming and logging have severely disturbed at least of temperate broadleaf forests many old growth forest stands have lost more than of their previous area because of human activities Tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests consequently less than of dry forests in Central America s Pacific Coast and less than in Madagascar remain from their original extents br br Plains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent Only of the world s drylands which include temperate grasslands savannas and shrublands scrub and deciduous forests have been somewhat degraded But included in that of land is the approximately million square kilometers of seasonally dry lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification The tallgrass prairies of North America on the other hand have less than of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland br br Wetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction More than of wetlands in the U S have been destroyed in just the last years Between and of European wetlands have been completely destroyed In the United Kingdom there has been an increase in demand for coastal housing and tourism which has caused a decline in marine habitats over the last years The rising sea levels and temperatures have caused soil erosion coastal flooding and loss of quality in the UK marine ecosystem About one fifth of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans One fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing pollution and invasive species of the Philippines coral reefs alone have been destroyed Finally over of the mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed br br br Natural causes br br Habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism fire and climate change is well documented in the fossil record One study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles br br br Causes due to human activities br Habitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests etc to arable land urban sprawl infrastructure development and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land Habitat degradation fragmentation and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat yet result in habitat collapse Desertification deforestation and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas deserts forests coral reefs br br br Overarching drivers br The forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as drivers of habitat destruction Demographic economic sociopolitical scientific and technological and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction br Demographic drivers include the expanding human population rate of population increase over time spatial distribution of people in a given area urban versus rural ecosystem type and country and the combined effects of poverty age family planning gender and education status of people in certain areas Most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots This may explain why human population density accounts for of the variation in numbers of threatened species across countries providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity The boom in human population and migration of people into such species rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests The high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people most of whom lacking an education and family planning br According to the Geist and Lambin study the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows with the percent of the cases the factor played a significant role in economic factors institutional or policy factors technological factors cultural or socio political factors and demographic factors The main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets which are driven by national and international demands urban industrial growth low domestic costs for land labor fuel and timber and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops Institutional and policy factors included formal pro deforestation policies on land development economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement and subsidies for land based activities property rights and land tenure insecurity and policy failures such as corruption lawlessness or mismanagement The main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry which leads to wasteful logging practices Within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values individual household behavior public unconcern toward forest environments missing basic values and unconcern by individuals Demographic factors were the in migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas and growing population density a result of the first factor in those areas br br br Forest conversion to agriculture br br Geist and Lambin assessed case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation Their results yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant The proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion infrastructure expansion and wood extraction Therefore according to this study forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation The specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation transport extension commercial wood extraction permanent cultivation cattle ranching shifting slash and burn cultivation subsistence agriculture and fuel wood extraction for domestic use One result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions while transport extension including the construction of new roads is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation br Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area Conversion to trivial standardized ecosystems e g monoculture following deforestation effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity through clearing or draining the land discouraging weeds and pests and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species br There are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process Road construction has the largest feedback effect because it interacts with and leads to the establishment of new settlements and more people which causes a growth in wood logging and food markets Growth in these markets in turn progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries When these industries become commercialized they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often has a worse effect on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods Either way more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets This common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other br br br Climate change br br Climate change contributes to destruction of some habitats endangering various species For example br br Climate change causes rising sea levels which will threaten natural habitats and species globally br Melting sea ice destroys habitat for some species For example the decline of sea ice in the Arctic has been accelerating during the early twenty first century with a decline rate of per decade it has declined over since the first satellite records One well known example of a species affected is the polar bear whose habitat in the Artic is threatened Algae can also be affected when it grows on the underside of sea ice br Warm water coral reefs are very sensitive to global warming and ocean acidification Coral reefs provide a habitat for thousands of species They provide ecosystem services such as coastal protection and food But of today s warm water coral reefs will disappear even if warming is kept to C F For example Caribbean coral reefs which are biodiversity hotspots will be lost within the century if global warming continues at the current rate br br br Habitat fragmentation br br br Impacts br br br On animals and plants br When a habitat is destroyed the carrying capacity for indigenous plants animals and other organisms is reduced so that populations decline sometimes up to the level of extinction br Habitat loss is perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity Temple found that of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss Most amphibian species are also threatened by native habitat loss and some species are now only breeding in modified habitat Endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else in the world and thus have less chance of recovering Many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem resulting in their extinction Extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat a phenomenon known as extinction debt Habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations This can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population or different species One of the most famous examples is the impact upon China s giant panda once found in many areas of Sichuan Now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country as a result of widespread deforestation in the th century br As habitat destruction of an area occurs the species diversity offsets from a combination of habitat generalists and specialists to a population primarily consisting of generalist species Invasive species are frequently generalists that are able to survive in much more diverse habitats Habitat destruction leading to climate change offsets the balance of species keeping up with the extinction threshold leading to a higher likelihood of extinction br Habitat loss is one of the main environmental causes of the decline of biodiversity on local regional and global scales Many believe that habitat fragmentation is also a threat to biodiversity however some believe that it is secondary to habitat loss The reduction of the amount of habitat available results in specific landscapes that are made of isolated patches of suitable habitat throughout a hostile environment matrix This process is generally due to pure habitat loss as well as fragmentation effects Pure habitat loss refers to changes occurring in the composition of the landscape that causes a decrease in individuals Fragmentation effects refer to an addition of effects occurring due to the habitat changes Habitat loss can result in negative effects on the dynamic of species richness The order Hymenoptera is a diverse group of plant pollinators who are highly susceptible to the negative effects of habitat loss this could result in a domino effect between the plant pollinator interactions leading to major conservation implications within this group It is observed from the worlds longest running fragmentation experiment over years that habitat fragmentation has caused a decrease in biodiversity from to br br br On human population br br Habitat destruction can vastly increase an area s vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought crop failure spread of disease and water contamination On the other hand a healthy ecosystem with good management practices can reduce the chance of these events happening or will at least mitigate adverse impacts Eliminating swamps the habitat of pests such as mosquitoes has contributed to the prevention of diseases such as malaria br Completely depriving an infectious agent such as a virus of its habitat by vaccination for example can result in eradicating that infectious agent br Agricultural land can suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape Over the past years the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately of agricultural land worldwide via erosion salinization compaction nutrient depletion pollution and urbanization Humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed Aesthetic uses such as birdwatching recreational uses like hunting and fishing and ecotourism usually rely upon relatively undisturbed habitat Many people value the complexity of the natural world and express concern at the loss of natural habitats and of animal or plant species worldwide br Probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services Habitat destruction has altered nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and carbon cycles which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain algal blooms and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change One ecosystem service whose significance is becoming better understood is climate regulation On a local scale trees provide windbreaks and shade on a regional scale plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall on a global scale plants especially trees in tropical rainforests around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis Other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management nitrogen fixation oxygen production pollination see pollinator decline br waste treatment i e the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff br The loss of trees from tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of Earth s ability to produce oxygen and to use up carbon dioxide These services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change The loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous When biodiversity is lost the environment loses many species that perform valuable and unique roles in the ecosystem The environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions When too much biodiversity is lost a catastrophic event such as an earthquake flood or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash and humans would obviously suffer from that Loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher yielding crop varieties pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases such as cancer and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi viruses and bacteria br The negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations Across the globe poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed because less natural habitat means fewer natural resources per capita yet wealthier people and countries can simply pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources br Another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of destroying a given habitat In other words what do people lose out on with the removal of a given habitat A country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row crop agriculture but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water timber ecotourism or flood regulation and drought control br br br Outlook br The rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the world s food requirement substantially Simple logic dictates that more people will require more food In fact as the world s population increases dramatically agricultural output will need to increase by at least over the next years In the past continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to meet the global food demand That easy fix will no longer be available however as more than of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair br The impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction Commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land so they will use more fertilizers and show less concern for the environment to meet the market demand Others will seek out new land or will convert other land uses to agriculture Agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants Species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation degradation or pollution Any efforts to protect the world s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans growing demand for natural resources especially new agricultural lands br br br Solutions br Attempts to address habitat destruction are in international policy commitments embodied by Sustainable Development Goal Life on Land and Sustainable Development Goal Life Below Water However the United Nations Environment Programme report on Making Peace with Nature released in found that most of these efforts had failed to meet their internationally agreed upon goals br Tropical deforestation In most cases of tropical deforestation three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes This means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country Before any local national or international deforestation policies are written and enforced governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country This concept along with many other results of tropical deforestation from the Geist and Lambin study can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general br Shoreline erosion Coastal erosion is a natural process as storms waves tides and other water level changes occur Shoreline stabilization can be done by barriers between land and water such as seawalls and bulkheads Living shorelines are gaining attention as a new stabilization method These can reduce damage and erosion while simultaneously providing ecosystem services such as food production nutrient and sediment removal and water quality improvement to society br br Preventing an area from losing its specialist species to generalist invasive species depends on the extent of the habitat destruction that has already taken place In areas where the habitat is relatively undisturbed halting further habitat destruction may be enough In areas where habitat destruction is more extreme fragmentation or patch loss restoration ecology may be needed br Education of the general public is possibly the best way to prevent further human habitat destruction Changing the dull creep of environmental impacts from being viewed as acceptable to being seen a reason for change to more sustainable practices Education about the necessity of family planning to slow population growth is important as greater population leads to greater human caused habitat destruction Habitat restoration can also take place through the following processes extending habitats or repairing habitats Extending habitats aims to counteract habitat loss and fragmentation whereas repairing habitats counteracts degradation br The preservation and creation of habitat corridors can link isolated populations and increase pollination Corridors are also known to reduce the negative impacts of habitat destruction br The biggest potential to solving the issue of habitat destruction comes from solving the political economical and social problems that go along with it such as individual and commercial material consumption sustainable extraction of resources conservation areas restoration of degraded land and addressing climate change br Governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces rather than merely regulating the proximate causes In a broader sense governmental bodies at a local national and international scale need to emphasize br br Considering the irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by natural habitats br Protecting remaining intact sections of natural habitat br Finding ecological ways to increase agricultural output without increasing the total land in production br Reducing human population and expansion Apart from improving access to contraception globally furthering gender equality also has a great benefit When women have the same education decision making power this generally leads to smaller families br It is argued that the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation can be counteracted by including spatial processes in potential restoration management plans However even though spatial dynamics are incredibly important in the conservation and recovery of species a limited amount of management plans are taking the spatial effects of habitat restoration and conservation into consideration br br br
