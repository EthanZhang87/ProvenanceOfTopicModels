etymology of the name is not known Chorz w is believed to be first mentioned as Zversov or Zuersov in a document of by Pope Innocent II as a village with peasants silver miners and two inns Another place name likely indicating Chorz w is Coccham or Coccha which is mentioned in a document of by the Patriarch of Jerusalem who awarded this place to the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem Chorz w is then mentioned as Chareu or Charev in and then Charzow in The last name may originate from the personal name Charz short for Zachary and may mean Zachary s place The a in the early names may have been later modified to the current pronunciation with o perhaps due to similarity to the common adjective chory ill and a presence of a hospital which was moved in to Rozbark at the gates of Bytom Today the place of the old village is a subdivision called Chorz w III or Chorz w Stary the Old Chorz w br The industrial and residential settlement south west of Chorz w

Silesians and Germans br br br After br br At the end of World War II Chorz w was given to Poland Generally the Chorz w industry suffered little damage during World War II due to its inaccessibility to Allied bombing a Soviet Army enveloping manoeuvre in January and perhaps Albert Speer s slowness or refusal to implement the scorched earth policy This intact industry now played a critical role in
