title: Endangered Species Act of 1973
id: 532055
The Endangered Species Act of ESA or The Act U S C et seq is the primary law in the United States for protecting and conserving imperiled species Designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation the ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December The Supreme Court of the United States described it as the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species enacted by any nation The purposes of the ESA are two fold to prevent extinction and to recover species to the point where the law s protections are not needed It therefore protect s species and the ecosystems upon which they depend through different mechanisms For example section requires the agencies overseeing the Act to designate imperiled species as threatened or endangered Section prohibits unlawful take of such species which means to harass harm hunt Section directs federal agencies to use their authorities to help conserve listed species The Act also serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES The Supreme Court found that the plain intent of Congress in enacting the ESA was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction whatever the cost The Act is administered by two federal agencies the United States Fish and Wildlife Service FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS FWS and NMFS have been delegated by the Act with the authority to promulgate any rules and guidelines within the Code of Federal Regulations CFR to implement its provisions br br br History br Calls for wildlife conservation in the United States increased in the early s because of the visible decline of several species One example was the near extinction of the bison which used to number in the tens of millions Similarly the extinction of the passenger pigeon which numbered in the billions also caused concern The whooping crane also received widespread attention as unregulated hunting and habitat loss contributed to a steady decline in its population By it had disappeared from its primary breeding range in the north central United States Scientists of the day played a prominent role in raising public awareness about the losses For example George Bird Grinnell highlighted bison decline by writing articles in Forest and Stream br To address these concerns Congress enacted the Lacey Act of The Lacey Act was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets It also prohibited the sale of illegally killed animals between states Other legislation followed including the Migratory Bird Conservation Act a treaty prohibiting the hunting of right and gray whales and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of br br br Endangered Species Preservation Act of br br Despite these treaties and protections many populations still continued to decline By only an estimated whooping cranes remained in the wild By the bald eagle the U S national symbol was in danger of extinction Only around nesting pairs remained Loss of habitat shooting and DDT poisoning contributed to its decline br The U S Fish and Wildlife Service tried to prevent the extinction of these species Yet it lacked the necessary Congressional authority and funding In response to this need Congress passed the Endangered Species Preservation Act Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States on October The Act initiated a program to conserve protect and restore select species of native fish and wildlife As a part of this program Congress authorized the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land or interests in land that would further the conservation of these species br The Department of Interior issued the first list of endangered species in March It included mammals birds reptiles amphibians and fish A few notable species listed in were the grizzly bear American alligator Florida manatee and bald eagle The list included only vertebrates at the time because of the Department of Interior s limited definition of fish and wildlife br The Endangered Species Preservation Act was repealed by the Endangered Species Act br br br Endangered Species Conservation Act of br br The Endangered Species Conservation Act of Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States amended the Endangered Species Preservation Act of It established a list of species in danger of worldwide extinction It also expanded protections for species covered in and added to the list of protected species While the Act only applied to game and wild birds the Act also protected mollusks and crustaceans Punishments for poaching or unlawful importation or sale of these species were also increased Any violation could result in a fine or up to one year of jail time br Notably the Act called for an international convention or treaty to conserve endangered species A IUCN resolution called for a similar international convention In February a meeting in Washington D C was convened This meeting produced the comprehensive multilateral treaty known as CITES or the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora br The Endangered Species Conservation Act of provided a template for the Endangered Species Act of by using the term based on the best scientific and commercial data This standard is used as a guideline to determine if a species is in danger of extinction br br br Passage of the Act br In President Nixon declared current species conservation efforts to be inadequate He called on the rd United States Congress to pass comprehensive endangered species legislation Congress responded with a completely rewritten law the Endangered Species Act of which was signed by Nixon on December Pub L Tooltip Public Law United States br It was written by a team of lawyers and scientists including Dr Russell E Train the first appointed head of the Council on Environmental Quality CEQ an outgrowth of the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA of Dr Train was assisted by a core group of staffers including Dr Earl Baysinger at EPA Dick Gutting and Dr Gerard A Jerry Bertrand a Ph D marine biologist by training Oregon State University who had transferred from his post as the senior scientific adviser to the Commandant of the U S Army Corps of Engineers office of the Commandant of the Corps to join the newly formed White House Council on Environmental Quality The staff under Dr Train s leadership incorporated dozens of new principles and ideas into the landmark legislation but also incorporated previous laws as was desired by Congressman John Dingell D Michigan when he first proposed the idea of an Endangered Species Act Among the staff Dr Bertrand is credited with having written major parts of the Act including the infamous takings clause U S C We didn t know what we couldn t do Dr Bertrand has said about the Act We were doing what we thought was scientifically valid and right for the environment br br br New Features of the Act br The Endangered Species Act is administered by two federal agencies the United States Fish and Wildlife Service FWS and the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS NMFS handles marine species and the FWS has responsibility over freshwater fish and all other species Species that occur in both habitats e g sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon are jointly managed br It consists of sections Key legal requirements include br br The federal government must determine whether species are endangered or threatened If so they must list the species for protection under the ESA Section br If determinable critical habitat must be designated for listed species Section br Absent certain limited situations Section it is illegal to take an endangered species Section Take can mean kill harm or harass Section br Federal agencies will use their authorities to conserve endangered species and threatened species Section br Federal agencies cannot jeopardize listed species existence or destroy critical habitat Section br Any import export interstate and foreign commerce of listed species is generally prohibited Section br Endangered fish or wildlife cannot be taken without a take permit This also applies to certain threatened animals with section d rules Section br The Act is considered a landmark conservation law Academic researchers have referred to it as one of the nation s most significant environmental laws It has also been called one of the most powerful environmental statutes in the U S and one of the world s strongest species protection laws The Act itself has been amended four times and Formal regulations published in the Federal Register that specify how the Act will be implemented have also changed through time In recent years U S presidential elections that greatly shift environmental priorities have culminated in regulatory shifts in endangered species management back and forth Congressional elections also affect implementation of the Act via expansions or contractions in annual funding decisions for the agencies br br br Plants become eligible for listing br A distinction of the Act is that unlike the previous legislation plants became eligible for listing with the first listings occurring in Fifty years later significantly more species of plants were listed in the highest category endangered than animals plants and animals Historians attribute this new found concern for imperiled plants to ongoing global treaty negotiations especially in and toward what would eventually be adopted in under the title Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES br Prior to this time attention to the conservation needs of native plants had been stalled by complications that do not pertain to animals How to adequately distinguish plants illegally collected in the wild from plants propagated from seeds or cuttings taken from horticultural specimens was among the points of contention Ultimately federal authority over enforcement of endangered plant protections has centered on regulation of interstate commerce of such plants This legal distinction for plants became controversial in practice when a group of citizens Torreya Guardians chose to help an endangered glacial relict plant Florida Torreya move to cooler poleward climates before conservation professionals were ready to begin their own experimentation with assisted migration of endangered species Because movement of seeds and seedlings by this group was noncommercial and based on horticulturally produced specimens there was no legal apparatus to halt their actions br Another distinction is that when an animal is listed as endangered or threatened taking of that animal by capture or killing becomes a violation of the Act For plants taking occurs only within the boundaries of federal properties Even so states may choose to legislate and enforce prohibitions even on private lands as occurred in when the State of California passed a law that prevented killing or removal of the western variety of Joshua tree wherever it was found Climate change risk was a key factor in the determination br br br Two categories for listing species br The Act distinguished two grades of species for listing endangered and a lesser category called threatened An endangered species is in danger of extinction now a threatened species faces such a threat in the foreseeable future The aim for the lesser category is to enable protective actions by federal agencies at an earlier time such that the causes of population decline might be corrected before emergency concerns develop Controversy also arises as to whether and what differences in recovery plan elements and thus management policies and restrictions should distinguish threatened from endangered br br br Recovery plans must be made and published br A key provision of the Act was that preventing extinction would no longer be sufficient Rather recovery of listed species such that delisting could become possible was now a stated goal Recovery plans were now to be developed and published by the two agencies in charge the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service In practice recovery plans usually include population targets and objective measurable criteria that would constitute adequate reduction of threats and provision of habitat protection such that delisting or down listing from endangered to threatened would be warranted br br br Critical habitat may be designated br The Act introduced the concept of what is now called critical habitat in only one brief passage Section required federal agencies to ensure that actions they authorized funded or carried out would not result in the destruction or modification of habitat of such species which is determined by the Secretary after consultation as appropriate with affected States to be critical When the Act was amended in critical habitat was given a definition and basic terms for how it would be determined and used As will be seen in the Controversies section this provision was sometimes challenging to implement for both scientific and political reasons br br br Citizens can petition for listing species br A review of the Act published in recounted the unavoidable problems that arose from granting opportunities even for citizens to submit petitions for species listing br br Soon after the Endangered Species Act was enacted Congress recognized that at any given time there were likely to be more species potentially eligible for listing than the Service could address through the rule making process As a result Congress in directed the Service to develop a prioritization system that would enable it to determine which of the potentially eligible species should be considered first The Service responded with listing priority guidance that established a hierarchy of priorities based first on the magnitude of threat then upon its imminence and finally upon taxonomic distinctiveness with monotypic genera ranked ahead of other species and full species ranked ahead of subspecies br br Requirements that listing decisions be made based on scientific evidence and considerations coupled with an inability of the agencies to expand and contract staffing based on shifts in the volume of outstanding petitions induced Congress in to amend the Act by establishing deadlines for agency decisions As of those deadlines still nominally apply but in practice it is rare for a petitioner to approach the judicial system to force a decision before the agency is able to finish the job on its own timetable br br br Challenges and Controversies br In with this Congressional act achieving its th anniversary journalists were prompted to report on the Act s outcomes and controversies Congressional overturning of several recent listings and ability to hamper implementation by restricting agency funding were among the points mentioned by some media In contrast a foundation associated with the Western Caucus of U S senators and representatives issued a page report in titled The Endangered Species Act at with a subtitle expressing its primary criticism that a record of falsified recoveries underscores a lack of scientific integrity in the federal program Among the faculty expressing views in a University of Pennsylvania report one drew attention to an underlying shift in national worldviews during the past half century The Act reflects the confidence of mid th century liberal politics that any problem can be fixed with legislation based on scientific data yet pragmatic solutions that require flexibility have been hindered and polarization has become intense An academic review paper in reported that the Act had become a social legal and political battleground and that the scientific question of whether the ESA works effectively to protect species remains open Specific challenges and long term controversies are summarized in this section br br br Economic consequences and perverse incentives br Because the Act allowed species to be listed as endangered without consideration of the economic consequences it soon became and continues to be controversial Costs conferred on private landowners and various industries may come in the form of lost opportunity or slowing down operations to comply with the regulations put forth in the Act Notably in the listing of a tiny fish snail darter shut down for several years construction of a dam that was already underway on the Little Tennessee River More broadly the requirement to consult with the relevant agencies on federal projects has at times slowed operations by the oil and gas industry including exploration or development on federal lands rich in fossil fuels br One widely held opinion thus is that the protections afforded to listed species curtail economic activity In the extreme economic consequences can induce perverse incentives by which landowners actively curtail their lands from attracting endangered species An example in the eastern USA pertains to the endangered red cockaded woodpecker A study of some privately owned forest plots within the range of the woodpecker found that when landowners observed pine growth maturing to a stage in which it might attract nesting woodpeckers they were more likely to harvest regardless of timber prices at the time This is a form of intentional habitat destruction for avoiding economic consequences br Legislators have expressed that the ESA has been weaponized particularly against western states constraining state government choices about the use of public lands The case of the protracted dispute over the greater sage grouse is one such example and the spotted owl is another In the extreme is the largely western saying pertaining to endangered animals such as wolves shoot shovel and shut up In Rep Don Young Alaska the longest serving Republican congressman said As the one person in the Congress the only one that voted for the Endangered Species Act please beat me with a whip br Some economists have stated that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species One suggestion for ending perverse incentives would be to compensate property owners for protecting endangered species rather than having an endangered species regarded as a potential financial loss br As well while the standard to prevent jeopardy or adverse modification applies only to federal activities non federal activities are subject to Section of the Act and private activities on private lands may require federal discretionary permits such as those required by the Clean Water Act Section and thereby triggering Section of the ESA br br br Incentives for stopping development br Controversy sometimes roils when the timing of a petition to list a new species overlaps with plans for or initiation of a development project that could be impeded by such a listing A news editorial marking the th anniversary of the Act suggested that the ESA became the weapon of choice for environmental groups seeking to stop projects or tear down others Lawsuits by the score have been filed over projects large and small setting off ill feelings toward environmental groups br br br Risk assessment br The Act points to science professionals as solely responsible for making extinction risk assessments Governmental policies as shaped by various and changing public interests are necessarily the arbiters of how numerical statements of extinction risk should be gauged in context of other kinds of national risks and priorities In a multi author report published in the Ecological Society of America explained how this kind of controversy develops br Any decision to list a species also requires a policy judgment regarding how much risk to that species is acceptable Science can inform the decision by determining the degree of risk a species faces but science alone cannot determine whether the risk is acceptable Stakeholders with divergent views about acceptable levels of extinction risk frequently mount legal challenges over whether species need to be listed whether they are endangered or threatened how much habitat represents a significant portion of a species range and other key elements of ESA implementation br br br Effectiveness br As of an aggregate of species had been listed through the years as endangered or a less severe category of threatened Of that total species improved enough to be removed from the list delisted Another improved enough to be downlisted from endangered to threatened While species have been declared extinct since implementation of the law began another species have gone missing for so long that they have been proposed for official designation as extinct br Some have argued that the recovery of imperiled flesh eating birds notably the bald eagle brown pelican and peregrine falcon should be attributed to the ban of the pesticide DDT by the EPA rather than the Endangered Species Act Supporters of the Act argue that listing of these species as endangered led to additional actions that were also crucial for species recovery i e captive breeding habitat protection and protection from disturbance br br Following is a list of some of the best known species that increased in population size with some improving enough for delisting since being placed on the endangered list br br Bald eagle increased from to pairs between and removed from list br Whooping crane increased from to birds between and br Kirtland s warbler increased from to pairs between and br Peregrine falcon increased from to pairs between and removed from list br Gray wolf populations increased dramatically in the Northern Rockies and Western Great Lakes States br Mexican wolf increased to minimum population of wolves in in southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona br Red wolf increased from in to in br Gray whale increased from to whales between and removed from list Debated because whaling was banned before the ESA was set in place and that the ESA had nothing to do with the natural population increase since the cease of massive whaling excluding Native American tribal whaling br Grizzly bear increased from about to over bears in the Yellowstone area between and br California s southern sea otter increased from in to in br San Clemente Indian paintbrush increased from plants in to more than in br Florida s Key deer increased from in to in br Big Bend gambusia increased from a couple dozen to a population of over br Hawaiian goose increased from birds in to in br Virginia big eared bat increased from in to in br Black footed ferret increased from in to in br The Congressional amendments to the Act included a new section Section to aid effectiveness evaluations by having each of the two implementing agencies periodically report cumulative federal funding and to some degree state funding on a species by species basis As of the most recent report to Congress was by the U S Fish and Wildlife Service and presented expenditures cumulative through fiscal year The report entailed these statistics Of the status reviews completed percent recommend no change in status for the species percent recommend reclassifying from endangered to threatened percent recommend delisting due to extinction due to recovery and due to error percent recommend reclassifying from threatened to endangered and less than percent recommend a revision to the listed entity br br br Recovery and delistings are rare br Critics of the Act have noted that despite its goal of recovering species to the point of delisting this has rarely happened As of fifty years after its passage an aggregate of species had been listed through the years as endangered or the less severe category of threatened Of that total species improved enough to be removed from the list Another improved enough to be downlisted from endangered to threatened While species have been declared extinct since implementation of the law began another species have gone missing for so long that they have been proposed for official designation as extinct br The National Marine Fisheries Service lists eight species or populations of a species as among the most at risk of extinction in the near future These animals are the Atlantic salmon the Central California Coast coho salmon the Cook Inlet beluga whale the Hawaiian monk seal the Pacific leatherback sea turtle the Sacramento River winter run chinook salmon the southern resident population of killer whale and the white abalone Human activities are presented as the primary cause of extinction threats for all these species The two implementing agencies have a combined record of changing species status from threatened to endangered on nine occasions while the number of status improvements from endangered to threatened is greater br A widely used statistic supporting effectiveness of the Act is that percent of listed species have not gone extinct In the Center for Biological Diversity issued a report that surveyed a sample of listed species and concluded that percent of them were recovering at the rate specified by their federal recovery plan br On the opposing side of the spectrum a foundation associated with the Western Caucus of U S senators and representatives issued a page report in that points to data and statements made by the U S Fish and Wildlife Service during the past half century that can be interpreted as disputing proclamations of success Specifically statements of numbers of species recovered do not distinguish between those delisted owing to actual improvement in populations versus those for which the original population numbers were later found to have been greatly underestimated Had the science been more in line with reality at the start this report claims of the species reported by the agency as officially recovered would not have achieved listing at the outset br Controversy also develops when the science used to support a delisting decision differs from the numerical population thresholds included in the species recovery plan A court case upheld that the published recovery criteria are not legally binding for later delisting decisions br br br Delays in specifying recovery actions br Listing of a species triggers two overlapping types of conservation measures extinction prevention and recovery actions An official document required by the Act has come to be known as a recovery plan The Act gives few guidelines for their preparation and content and does not specify a deadline for how soon after listing the Services must complete recovery plans A report on the Act issued by Defenders of Wildlife calculated that species listed under the Act lack recovery guidance of any kind while additional species lack final recovery guidance The group also noted that more than half of the existing recovery plans were more than years old br Besides alleged funding inadequacies several inherent problems have been pointed to for delays in agency translation of scientific findings into actions beyond extinction prevention and thus actively toward species recovery One such problem is the knowledge action boundary that distinguishes conservation scientists from conservation managers That is how can scientific scholarship be made actionable and thereby contribute directly to forward moving policies and practices Impediments to generating boundary spanning conservation science include a reward structure in science that promotes publication and grant income rather than engaging with conservation practitioners Distrust across the boundary may also develop if conservation managers perceive that ESA funding allocated to research or monitoring reduces what is available for recovery actions br Fear of failure in conservation is another factor that contributes to agency and manager hesitancy to undertake recovery actions for which there is no certainty of success There are two reasons why scientists themselves may abstain from recommending actions One is fear that making such recommendations may compromise their status as objective researchers whose conclusions can be trusted A second is fear that a recommended action that is undertaken but then fails may injure their reputation These fears may be heightened when recommendations pertain to a species for which controversy has developed or one whose population has declined so drastically that any manipulation of the species or its habitat may later be denounced as contributing to its further decline or extinction Thus there are multiple reasons why recovery programs for some species may be trapped in a cycle where more resources are allocated to information gathering versus action br br br Allocating funds among listed species br The Fish Wildlife Service has developed a four factor prioritization system for analyzing tradeoffs in distributing funds among the listed species degree of threat potential for recovery taxonomic uniqueness and conflict with human activities Even so the special report on the Act by the Ecological Society of America concluded that the agency s decisions on apportioning funds are more often driven by political and social factors including congressional representation the number of employees in field offices staff workload and opportunities to form partnerships and secure matching funds As well the report stated Critics point out that recovery efforts are focused disproportionately on charismatic species to the detriment of others particularly plants br As well there is no requirement that federal agencies or any other institution implement any of the actions specified in the recovery plan br br br Stakeholder initiatives with or without listing br With or without listing there are opportunities for stakeholders themselves to begin actions on their own This especially applies to habitat improvements If suitable habitat for a species can be found on private state municipal or tribal lands there is no need to wait for the federal agency to offer or specify in place actions The parties can expand and improve such habitats on their own For example a National Park Service report in in behalf of the endangered Karner blue butterfly included a recommendation to encourage entities city state county tribal federal with sandy soils north of the current range to plant Lupinus perennis and nectar plants in anticipation of future authorization for managed relocation of populations threatened by heat and drought in southerly portions of the butterfly s historical range br While there are legal limitations on what citizens and other stakeholders can do directly for listed animal species the field is wide open for obtaining horticulturally produced seeds and specimens of listed plants and then conducting plantings on their own A well known example is a network of citizens who call themselves Torreya Guardians Florida Torreya is a glacial relict species of subcanopy tree that was listed as endangered in Since the citizen group has been using seeds from mature plantings on private lands in North Carolina to engage in a form of assisted migration poleward of this climate endangered plant br Prior to listing of a species stakeholders who wish to act in its behalf have freedom to engage with not only habitat but with the species itself A well known example entails actions taken in behalf of the subalpine Whitebark Pine of the northern Rocky Mountains soon after vast stands suddenly began to die in Yellowstone National Park and elsewhere A petition for listing was submitted in but status as threatened was not conferred until By then collaboration among concerned parties was well underway without agency direction Supportive research and actions were undertaken by the conservation organization American Forests as well as a new organization specific to the tree the Whitebark Pine Ecosystem Foundation Other collaborators include research scientists within the U S Forest Service geneticists at the University of California Davis and the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes The U S Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service were also involved in consultation prior to listing by the agency in charge of endangered species the U S Fish and Wildlife Service br Controversy is also apparent though rare when stakeholders entail activists who regard the political economic regime not as the source of solutions but as the root cause of biodiversity loss In such instances guerrilla rewilding of rare species has been known to occur br br br Collaborative planning on private lands br The amendments to the Act s Section authorized collaborative engagement of the implementing agencies with landowners in producing Habitat Conservation Plans Such a plan is a required part of an application for an Incidental Take Permit issued under the Act to private entities undertaking projects that might result in harm to a listed species The intent is to deter controversy by building into the plan practices for minimizing harm to listed species and their core habitat needs including seasonal peaks in use A validated plan then absolves the developer from harms that may incidentally occur to the species when following the plan Securing landowner pledges of habitat enhancement measures during the planning process can serve to defuse opposition from the public and other stakeholders br Habitat conservation plans have been successfully deployed to reduce conflicts between a type of beach nesting shorebird piping plover and recreational beach users in Massachusetts Such plans also apply to the red cockaded woodpecker of forests in the southeastern states In habitat conservation planning for grizzly bears in the northern Rocky Mountains became controversial when an increase in bear deaths caused trains was reported along with acknowledgment by the agency that several million dollars of federal funds for the plan participants had not yet been provided for them to engage in their specified mitigation actions br Summing up the practical difficulties in a report on the Act Defenders of Wildlife pointed to underfunding as a continuing problem and that the agencies lack adequate resources to develop approve and monitor these plans and there are significant data gaps in how many of these plans are performing br br br Species awaiting listing br A report found that the Fish and Wildlife Service faced a backlog of more than species that have been determined to potentially warrant protection The decision to list or defer listing of a petitioned species is supposed to take no more than years after a petition is filed However on average it takes the agency years to finalize a decision An analysis published in by the Ecological Society of America found that approximately species may have gone extinct while awaiting a listing decision Additional funding might enable the agency to direct more resources toward biological assessments of petitioned species and determine if they merit a listing decision br An additional issue is that species still listed under the Act may already be extinct For example the IUCN Red List declared the Scioto madtom extinct in It had last been seen alive in However FWS still classifies the catfish as endangered br br br Critical habitat br As habitat loss is regarded as the primary threat to most imperiled species Section of the Endangered Species Act of allowed the Fish and Wildlife Service FWS and National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS to designate specific areas as protected critical habitat zones The designation of critical habitat does not affect land ownership It does not allow the government to take or manage private property nor to establish a refuge reserve preserve or other conservation area Critical habitat designation does not allow unauthorized government access to private land Such designation can however restrict activities allowable on private lands br br In Congress amended the law to make critical habitat designation a mandatory requirement for all threatened and endangered species The amendment also added economics into the process of determining such designation It reads shall designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact and any other impact of specifying area as critical habitat The congressional report on the amendment described a potential controversy that might ensue given that economic impact was included in the amendment br the critical habitat provision is a startling section which is wholly inconsistent with the rest of the legislation It constitutes a loophole which could readily be abused by any Secretary who is vulnerable to political pressure or who is not sympathetic to the basic purposes of the Endangered Species Act House of Representatives Report at br br The controversy did arise and thus the amendment to the Act explicitly prohibited similar economic considerations when determining the status of a species br In designating critical habitat the needs of open space for individual and population growth food water light or other nutritional requirements breeding sites seed germination and dispersal needs and lack of disturbances are considered As itemized within a review paper on the Endangered Species Act designation of critical habitat is the first priority for agency action following listing of a species Next is formulation of a recovery plan Not all recovery plans however specify critical habitat Setting aside this requirement is authorized if the agency head determines that its designation would not be prudent br Most provisions of the ESA revolve around preventing extinction Critical habitat is one of the few that focus on recovery A paper published in the journal BioScience concluded that species afforded critical habitat are twice as likely to be recovering than are species without critical habitat A report published by the Ecological Society of America stated that data were inconclusive on this matter because in practice the Services often exempt habitat degradation from regulation As a result designating critical habitat has had limited regulatory effect Overall disagreement as to the effectiveness of critical habitat designation is expressed in a number of different reports br Another controversy arises from the Act specifying that critical habitat designation is required to contain all areas essential to the conservation of the imperiled species and may include private as well as public lands The Fish and Wildlife Service has a policy limiting designation to lands and waters within the U S and both federal agencies may exclude essential areas if they determine that economic or other costs exceed the benefit The ESA however is mute about how such costs and benefits are to be determined br All federal agencies are prohibited from authorizing funding or carrying out actions that destroy or adversely modify critical habitats Section a While the regulatory aspect of critical habitat does not apply directly to private and other non federal landowners large scale development logging and mining projects on private and state land typically require one or more federal permits and thus become subject to critical habitat regulations Outside or in parallel with regulatory processes critical habitats also focus and encourage voluntary actions such as land purchases grant making restoration and establishment of reserves br Finally the Act s specification of the timing of critical habitat designations has become problematic The ESA requires that critical habitat be designated at the time of or within one year of a species being placed on the endangered list In practice most designations occur several years after listing Between and the FWS regularly designated critical habitat In the Reagan administration issued a regulation limiting the protective status of critical habitat As a result few critical habitats were designated between and the late s In the late s and early s a series of court orders invalidated the Reagan regulations and forced the FWS and NMFS to designate several hundred critical habitats especially in Hawaii California and other western states Midwest and eastern states received less critical habitat primarily on rivers and coastlines As of December the Reagan regulation had not yet been replaced though its use had been suspended Nonetheless the agencies have generally changed course and since about have tried to designate critical habitat at or near the time of listing br br br Climate adaptation br Although the Endangered Species Act of did not in itself limit the placement of experimental populations to the historically native range of a plant or animal a regulatory change in regarding experimental populations made prospective translocations more difficult to justify June the U S Fish and Wildlife Service published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that would revise section j regulations under the ESA to better facilitate recovery by allowing for the introduction of listed species to suitable habitats outside of their historical ranges The proposed change will help improve the conservation and recovery of imperiled ESA listed species in the coming decades as growing impacts from climate change and invasive species cause habitats within their historical ranges to shift and become unsuitable The comment period ended August with more than comments posted online by supporters and opponents The final decision was scheduled for publication June br As reported on the news page of Audubon adoption of the proposed regulatory change would authorize for the first time use of a controversial climate adaptation tool assisted migration A paper in Conservation Letters had pointed out that while no statutory changes appeared necessary to facilitate this newly proposed form of climate adaptation current regulations are an impediment to assisted colonization for many endangered animal species whereas regulations do not necessarily restrict assisted colonization of endangered plants br br The U S Department of Interior on June announced its decision to modify the section j experimental populations rule generally as proposed a year earlier The press release summarized the reason for the change as br At the time the original j regulations were established the potential impact of climate change on species and their habitats was not fully realized yet in the decades since have become even more dramatic These revisions will help prevent extinctions and support the recovery of imperiled species by allowing the Service and our partners to implement proactive conservation based species introductions to reduce the impacts of climate change and other threats such as invasive species The rulemaking action includes a section summarizing topics entailed in comments submitted in along with the agency s official response to each br Six months after this climate adaptation regulation for listed species was published the National Park Service issued a page report on recommendations for halting the decline of the endangered Karner blue butterfly in its small and scattered populations across the northeastern states Among the recommendations were managed relocation of populations from the southern parts of its range into northward habitats with suitable conditions and supportive plants The report justified the managed relocation action by noting that stakeholders and managers are growing more supportive of novel science based interventions to save rare species from climate change driven extirpation br br br Reversals in policy track presidential elections br In October at the urging of the Pacific Legal Foundation and the Property and Environment Research Center the USFWS and the NMFS under President Donald Trump changed the d rule to treat threatened and critically endangered species differently legalizing private recovery initiatives and habitats for species that are merely threatened br Environmental opponents criticized the revision as crashing like a bulldozer through the act and tipping the scales way in favor of industry Some critics including the Sierra Club pointed out that these changes came just months after the IPBES released its Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services which found that human activity had pushed a million species of flora and fauna to the brink of extinction and would only serve to exacerbate the crisis The California legislature passed a bill to raise California regulations to thwart the Trump administration changes it was vetoed by Governor Newsom In January the House Natural Resources Committee reported similar legislation In December the Trump administration further rolled back the Endangered Species Act by reducing habitat protections for at risk species and thus restricting protections to where they currently live not where they lived previously or where they might migrate to as a result of climate change br In June the Biden administration said it was reviewing the Trump era rollback of the Endangered Species Act and planned to reverse or revise some of the changes in particular those relating to critical habitat regulations Such reversals became law in May A critic commented It seems to be one of those rules regulations things going on in Washington D C that like to flip flop with each administration while seeing no actual finality br br br Chronological list of species controversies br In a small species of fish in the southeastern USA was listed as endangered A conflict arose because a dam was already under construction within its native range and was scientifically deemed as damaging to its necessary habitat What came to be known as the snail darter controversy gained national attention A U S Supreme Court ruling prohibited dam completion which was then overridden when Congress exempted the Tellico Dam from provisions of the ESA Subsequently more populations of the species were discovered in rivers other than the Little Tennessee River where the dam was constructed and in the species was removed from the federal endangered list Nonetheless the fact that the Endangered Species Act effectively halted major construction underway in behalf of a small species of fish put an end to the wide political support that had accompanied passage of the Act br In despite protests from some environmental organizations the recovery plan for the endangered California condor began implementing the capture of all wild birds that remained By the early s the captive breeding effort was successful enough to begin returning some of the progeny to the wild including the Grand Canyon from which this carrion feeding bird had been missing for at least several centuries In the first wild nesting was recorded in the Grand Canyon As of the species had a wild population of individuals and a captive population of br In an extirpated eastern relative of the gray wolf was reintroduced into North Carolina following more than a decade of captive breeding Controversy accelerated when the state wildlife agency liberalized hunting regulations for coyotes Because the endangered red wolf resembles its coyote relative far more than the larger gray wolf does the number of mistaken shootings of the endangered species began to seriously impact the population As well detractors of red wolf protection pointed to the genetic deterioration of later generations of red wolves in the wild as they easily interbreed with coyotes br In another controversy arose that drew national attention when the Northern spotted owl was listed as endangered This species depended on intact and mature coastal forests in the states of Washington Oregon and California And this in turn posed new restrictions on logging of national forest lands in those regions which severely affected workers in small logging towns Not until did adoption by the federal government of the Northwest Forest Plan along with a community financial aid packet bring a close to peak hostilities between loggers and those defending owl habitat Preventing human destruction of habitat did not however result in species recovery Natural immigration of a bigger and more aggressive owl species the barred owl that was formerly native only to the eastern states became a major cause of continuing population decline of the spotted owl br Another ESA controversy that erupted in the s entailed the gray wolf listed as endangered in the Lower states in and the Mexican wolf listed as endangered in when each type was reintroduced into core areas of its former native range in the s Because wolves are so wide ranging and can be expected to occasionally prey upon livestock that ranchers legally graze on federal even wilderness lands announcements of intents to restore these predators to particular federal lands in the Rocky Mountain states generated conflicting views at the outset Ever after state authority to manage roaming wolves and authorize takings and hunts has been controversial as well br Climate change became an element of extinction risk assessment and thus controversy when the polar bear was listed as threatened in br By critical habitat designation on private land in Louisiana for the Mississippi gopher frog also known as dusky gopher frog had become so controversial that the U S Supreme Court chose to adjudicate a lower court decision The result effectively removed the habitat designation as overreach owing to the species having gone missing from Louisiana a half century earlier br In a inch flowering plant Tiehm s buckwheat was listed as endangered and accorded critical habitat protection on acres of federal lands in Nevada The listing was controversial because mining for lithium crucial for solar power battery storage was already underway in the area br In the largest and fiercest member of the weasel family the wolverine was listed as threatened for habitat outside of Alaska The listing was controversial because climate change was invoked as a primary cause of the rising temperatures and declining snowpack making successful snow cave denning difficult for the remaining populations in the Cascade Range and Rocky Mountains br br br Section by Section Summaries of the Act br br br Section Listing and Recovery br Section of the ESA sets forth the process by which species are designated as endangered or threatened Species with these designations receive protections under federal law Section also requires critical habitat designation and recovery plans for those species br br br Petition and listing br To be considered for listing the species must meet one of five criteria section a br There is the present or threatened destruction modification or curtailment of its habitat or range An over utilization for commercial recreational scientific or educational purposes The species is declining due to disease or predation There is an inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms There are other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence br Potential candidate species are then prioritized with emergency listing given the highest priority Species that face a significant risk to their well being are in this category br A species can be listed in two ways The United States Fish and Wildlife Service FWS or NOAA Fisheries also called the National Marine Fisheries Service can directly list a species through its candidate assessment program or an individual or organizational petition may request that the FWS or NMFS list a species A species under the act can be a true taxonomic species a subspecies or in the case of vertebrates a distinct population segment The procedures are the same for both types except with the person organization petition there is a day screening period br During the listing process economic factors cannot be considered but must be based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available The amendment to the ESA added the word solely to prevent any consideration other than the biological status of the species Congress rejected President Ronald Reagan s Executive Order which required economic analysis of all government agency actions The House committee s statement was that economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species br The very opposite result happened with the amendment where Congress added the words taking into consideration the economic impact in the provision on critical habitat designation br The amendment linked the listing procedure with critical habitat designation and economic considerations which almost completely halted new listings with almost species being withdrawn from consideration br br br Listing process br After receiving a petition to list a species the two federal agencies take the following steps or rulemaking procedures with each step being published in the Federal Register the US government s official journal of proposed or adopted rules and regulations br If a petition presents information that the species may be imperiled a screening period of days begins interested persons and or organization petitions only If the petition does not present substantial information to support listing it is denied br If the information is substantial a status review is started which is a comprehensive assessment of a species biological status and threats with a result of warranted not warranted or warranted but precluded br br A finding of not warranted the listing process ends br Warranted finding means the agencies publish a month finding a proposed rule within one year of the date of the petition proposing to list the species as threatened or endangered Comments are solicited from the public and one or more public hearings may be held Three expert opinions from appropriate and independent specialists may be included but this is voluntary br A warranted but precluded finding is automatically recycled back through the month process indefinitely until a result of either not warranted or warranted is determined The agencies monitor the status of any warranted but precluded species br Essentially the warranted but precluded finding is a deferral added by the amendment to the ESA It means other higher priority actions will take precedence br For example an emergency listing of a rare plant growing in a wetland that is scheduled to be filled in for housing construction would be a higher priority br Within another year a final determination a final rule must be made on whether to list the species The final rule time limit may be extended for months and listings may be grouped together according to similar geography threats habitat or taxonomy br The annual rate of listing i e classifying species as threatened or endangered increased steadily from the Ford administration listings per year through Carter listings per year Reagan listings per year George H W Bush listings per year and Clinton listings per year before decline to its lowest rate under George W Bush listings per year as of br The rate of listing is strongly correlated with citizen involvement and mandatory timelines as agency discretion decreases and citizen involvement increases i e filing of petitions and lawsuits the rate of listing increases Citizen involvement has been shown to identify species not moving through the process efficiently and identify more imperiled species The longer species are listed the more likely they are to be classified as recovering by the FWS br br br Public notice comments and judicial review br Public notice is given through legal notices in newspapers and communicated to state and county agencies within the species area Foreign nations may also receive notice of a listing A public hearing is mandatory if any person has requested one within days of the published notice br The purpose of the notice and comment requirement is to provide for meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process summarized the Ninth Circuit court in the case of Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v Babbitt br br br Listing status br br Listing status and its abbreviations used in Federal Register and by federal agencies like the U S Fish and Wildlife Service br br E endangered Sec Sec a any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range other than a species of the Class Insecta determined by the Secretary to constitute a pest br T threatened Sec Sec a any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range br Other categories br C candidate Sec b a species under consideration for official listing br E S A T S A endangered or threatened due to similarity of appearance Sec e a species not endangered or threatened but so closely resembles in appearance a species which has been listed as endangered or threatened that enforcement personnel would have substantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listed and unlisted species br XE XN experimental essential or non essential population Sec j any population including eggs propagules or individuals of an endangered species or a threatened species released outside the current range under authorization of the Secretary Experimental nonessential populations of endangered species are treated as threatened species on public land for consultation purposes and as species proposed for listing on private land br br br Recovery plan br Fish and Wildlife Service FWS and National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS are required to create an Endangered Species Recovery Plan outlining the goals tasks required likely costs and estimated timeline to recover endangered species i e increase their numbers and improve their management to the point where they can be removed from the endangered list The ESA does not specify when a recovery plan must be completed The FWS has a policy specifying completion within three years of the species being listed but the average time to completion is approximately six years The annual rate of recovery plan completion increased steadily from the Ford administration through Carter Reagan Bush I and Clinton but declined under Bush II per year as of br The goal of the law is to make itself unnecessary and recovery plans are a means toward that goal Recovery plans became more specific after when Congress added provisions to Section f of the law that spelled out the minimum contents of a recovery plan Three types of information must be included br br A description of site specific management actions to make the plan as explicit as possible br The objective measurable criteria to serve as a baseline for judging when and how well a species is recovering br An estimate of money and resources needed to achieve the goal of recovery and delisting br The amendment also added public participation to the process There is a ranking order similar to the listing procedures for recovery plans with the highest priority being for species most likely to benefit from recovery plans especially when the threat is from construction or other developmental or economic activity Recovery plans cover domestic and migratory species br br br Downlisting and Delisting br br Downlisting of a species can take place when important threats have been controlled and the population in the wild meets recovery objectives Downlisting entails reclassification from endangered to threatened br To delist a species several factors are considered control or elimination of threats population size and growth in the wild and the stability of habitat quality and quantity Species can also be delisted if an error notably population size is found in the data used for listing in the first place More than a dozen species have been delisted under such circumstances br Two examples of animal species delisted are the Virginia northern flying squirrel subspecies on August which had been listed since and the gray wolf Northern Rocky Mountain DPS On April President Obama signed the Department of Defense and Full Year Appropriations Act of A section of that Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to reissue within days of enactment the final rule published on April that identified the Northern Rocky Mountain population of gray wolf Canis lupus as a distinct population segment DPS and to revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife by removing most of the gray wolves in the DPS br The US Fish and Wildlife Service s delisting report lists four plants that have recovered br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Section State endangered species lists br Section of the Endangered Species Act provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies Subsequently lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state These state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species Examples include Florida Minnesota and Maine br br br Section Cooperation and Consultation br br br Overview br Section of the Endangered Species Act requires cooperation among federal agencies to conserve endangered or threatened species Section a directs the Secretary of the Interior and all federal agencies to proactively use their authorities to conserve such species This directive is often referred to as an affirmative requirement Section a of the Act requires federal agencies to ensure their actions do not jeopardize listed species or adversely modify critical habitat Federal agencies referred to as action agencies must consult with the Secretary of the Interior before taking any action which may affect listed species Section a is often referred to as the consultation process br The two agencies that administer the Act are the National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS and the U S Fish and Wildlife Service FWS These two agencies are often collectively referred to as the Services and lead the consultation process FWS is responsible for the recovery of terrestrial freshwater and catadromous species NMFS is responsible for marine species and anadromous fish NMFS manages recovery for endangered and threatened marine species including foreign species As of January the Services have listed species worldwide as endangered or threatened of these species occur in the United States br br br Section a br Section a requires federal agencies to work with FWS and NMFS to coordinate endangered and threatened species conservation Federal agencies should also account for any effects on endangered or threatened species in planning their activities br An example of the a process is the Army Corps of Engineers management of the Lower Mississippi River Since the early s a division of the U S Army Corps of Engineers has worked with FWS and the states to resolve endangered species and ecosystem management issues ESA listed species in the area include the least tern Sterna antillarum pallid sturgeon Scaphirhynchus albus and the fat pocketbook potamilus capax The goal of this a conservation plan is to protect listed species while allowing the Corps to carry out its civil works responsibilities As part of the plan the Corps undertakes projects that will benefit those species It also considers species ecology as a part of project design All three listed species in the Lower Mississippi River have increased in numbers since the plan was established br br br Section a br An action agency is required to consult with the Services if it has reason to believe that a species listed under the ESA may be present in the proposed project area It also must consult if the agency believes the action will likely affect the species This requirement established by section a is commonly referred to as the consultation process br br br Informal consultation phase br Consultation typically begins informally at the request of an action agency in the early stages of project planning Discussion topics include listed species in the proposed action area and any effect s the action may have on those species If both agencies agree that the proposed action is not likely to affect the species the project moves forward However if the agency s action may affect a listed species the agency is required to prepare a biological assessment br br br Biological assessments br A biological assessment is a document prepared by the action agency It lays out the project s potential effects particularly on listed species The action agency must complete a biological assessment if listed species or critical habitat may be present The assessment is optional if only proposed species or critical habitat are present br As a part of the assessment the action agency conducts on site inspections to see whether protected species are present The assessment will also include the likely effects of the action on such species The assessment should address all listed and proposed species in the action area not only those likely to be affected br The biological assessment may also include conservation measures Conservation measures are actions the agency intends to take to promote the recovery of listed species These actions may also serve to minimize the projects effects on species in the project area br There are three possible conclusions to a biological assessment no effect not likely to adversely affect or likely to adversely affect listed or proposed species br The action agency may reach a no effect conclusion if it determines the proposed action will not affect listed species or designated critical habitat The action agency may reach a not likely to adversely affect decision if the proposed action is insignificant or beneficial The Services will then review the biological assessment and either agree or disagree with the agency s findings If the Services agree the project s potential impacts have been eliminated they will concur in writing The concurrence letter must outline any modifications agreed to during informal consultation If an agreement cannot be reached the Services advise the action agency to initiate formal consultation br If the Services or the action agency finds the action likely to adversely affect protected species this triggers formal consultation br br br Formal consultation br During formal consultation the Services establish the project s effects on listed species Specifically they address whether the project will jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or destroy adversely modify species designated critical habitat br Jeopardy is not defined in the ESA but the Services have defined it in regulation to mean when an action is likely to appreciably reduce a species likelihood of survival and recovery in the wild In other words if an action merely reduces the likelihood of recovery but not survival then the standard of jeopardy is not met br To assess the likelihood of jeopardy the Services will review the species biological and ecological traits These could include the species population dynamics population size variability and stability life history traits critical habitat and how any proposed action might alter its critical habitat They also consider how limited the species range is and whether the threats that led to species listing have improved or worsened since listing br The Services have defined adverse modification as a diminishment of critical habitat that leads to a lower likelihood of survival and recovery for a listed species The diminishment may be direct or indirect To assess the likelihood of adverse modification biologists will first verify the scope of the proposed action This includes identifying the area likely to be affected and considering the proximity of the action to species or designated critical habitat The duration and frequency of any disturbance to the species or its habitat is also assessed br br A formal consultation may last up to days After this time the Services will issue a biological opinion The biological opinion contains findings related to the project s effects on listed and proposed species The Services must complete the biological opinion within days of the conclusion of formal consultation However the Services may extend this timeline if they require more information to make a determination The action agency must agree to the extension br br br Finding of no jeopardy or adverse modification br The Services may issue a finding of no jeopardy or adverse modification if the proposed action does not pose any harm to listed or proposed species or their designated critical habitat Alternatively the Service could find that proposed action is likely to harm listed or proposed species or their critical habitat but does not reach the level of jeopardy or adverse modification In this case the Services will prepare an incidental take statement Under most circumstances the ESA prohibits take of listed species Take includes harming killing or harassing a listed species However the ESA allows for incidental take that results from an otherwise lawful activity that is not the direct purpose of the action br An incidental take statement will be agreed to between the Services and the action agency The statement should describe the amount of anticipated take due to the proposed action It will also include reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the take Incidental take cannot pose jeopardy or potential extinction to species br br br Finding of jeopardy or adverse modification br Following formal consultation the Services may determine that the action will result in jeopardy or adverse modification to critical habitat If this is the case this finding will be included in the biological opinion br However during consultation the Services may find there are actions that the agency may take to avoid this These actions are known as reasonable and prudent alternative actions In the event of a jeopardy or adverse modification finding the agency must adopt reasonable and prudent alternative actions However the Services retain final say on which are included in the biological opinion br According to regulation reasonable and prudent alternative actions must br br Be consistent with the purpose of the proposed project br Be consistent with the action agency s legal authority and jurisdiction br Be economically and technically feasible br In the opinion of the Services avoid jeopardy br Given a finding of jeopardy or adverse modification the action agency has several options br br Adopt one or more of the reasonable and prudent alternative actions and move forward with the modified project br Elect not to grant the permit fund the project or undertake the action br Request an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee Another possibility is to re initiate consultation The action agency would do this by first proposing to modify the action br Propose reasonable and prudent alternatives not yet considered br The action agency must notify the Services of its course of action on any project that receives a jeopardy or adverse modification opinion br In the past ten years FWS has made jeopardy determinations in three cases delta smelt aquatic species in Idaho and South Florida water management each of which has included reasonable and prudent alternatives No project has been stopped as a result of FWS finding a project had no available path forward br In rare cases no alternatives to avoid jeopardy or adverse modification will be available An analysis of FWS consultations from to found only were blocked or canceled because of a jeopardy or adverse modification opinion with no reasonable and prudent alternatives In this scenario the only option that the action agency and applicant are left with is to apply for an exemption Exemptions are decided upon by the Endangered Species Committee br br br Exemptions br An action agency may apply for an exemption if it believes it cannot comply with the requirements of the biological opinion or formal consultation yields no reasonable and prudent alternative actions The exemption application must be submitted to the Secretary of the Interior within days of the conclusion of formal consultation br The Secretary can then recommend the application to the Endangered Species Committee informally known as The God Squad This committee is composed of several Cabinet level members br br The Secretary of Agriculture br The Secretary of the Army br The Secretary of the Interior br The Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers br The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency br The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration br One representative from each affected State appointed by the President of the United States br br br Endangered Species Committee decisions br br The governor of each affected state is notified of any exemption applications The governor will recommend a representative to join the committee for this application decision Within days of recommending an exemption the Secretary should submit to the committee a report that gives br br The availability of reasonable and prudent alternatives br A comparison of the benefits of the proposed action to any alternative courses of action br Whether the proposed action is in the public interest or is of national or regional significance br Available mitigation measures to limit the effects on listed species br Whether the action agency made any irreversible or irretrievable commitment of resources br Once this information is received the committee and the secretary will hold a public hearing The committee has days from the time of receiving the above report to make a decision In order for the exemption to be granted five out of the seven members must vote in favor of the exemption The findings can be challenged in federal court In one such challenge was the case of Portland Audubon Society v Endangered Species Committee heard in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals br The court found that three members had been in illegal ex parte contact with the then President George H W Bush a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act The committee s exemption was for the Bureau of Land Management s timber sale and incidental takes of the endangered northern spotted owl in Oregon br Rarely does the Endangered Species Committee consider projects for exemption The Endangered Species Committee has only met three times since the inception of the ESA An exemption was granted on two of these occasions br br br Section Permitting Conservation Agreements and Experimental Populations br Section of the ESA provides a permit system that may allow acts prohibited by Section This includes scientific and conservation activities For example the government may let someone move a species from one area to another This would otherwise be a prohibited taking under Section Before the law was amended in a listed species could be taken only for scientific or research purposes The combined result of the amendments to the Endangered Species Act have created a more flexible ESA br More changes were made in the s in an attempt by Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to shield the ESA from a Congress hostile to the law He instituted incentive based strategies that would balance the goals of economic development and conservation br br br Habitat conservation plans br Section may also allow activities that can unintentionally impact protected species A common activity might be construction where these species live More than half of habitat for listed species is on non federal property Under section impacted parties can apply for an incidental take permit ITP An application for an ITP requires a Habitat Conservation Plan HCP HCPs must minimize and mitigate the impacts of the activity HCPs can be established to provide protections for both listed and non listed species Such non listed species include species that have been proposed for listing Hundreds of HCPs have been created However the effectiveness of the HCP program remains unknown br If activities may unintentionally take a protected species an incidental take permit can be issued The applicant submits an application with an habitat conservation plan HCP If approved by the agency FWS or NMFS they are issued an Incidental Take Permit ITP The permit allows a certain number of the species to be taken The Services have a No Surprises policy for HCPs Once an ITP is granted the Services cannot require applicants to spend more money or set aside additional land or pay more br To receive the benefit of the permit the applicant must comply with all the requirements of the HCP Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party it is a federal action Other federal laws will apply such as the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA and Administrative Procedure Act APA A notice of the permit application action must be published in the Federal Register and a public comment period of to days offered br br br Safe Harbor Agreements br The Safe Harbor agreement SHA is similar to an HCP It is voluntary between the private landowner and the Services The landowner agrees to alter the property to benefit a listed or proposed species In exchange the Services will allow some future takes through an Enhancement of Survival Permit A landowner can have either a Safe Harbor agreement or an HCP or both The policy was developed by the Clinton administration Unlike an HCP the activities covered by a SHA are designed to protect species The policy relies on the enhancement of survival provision of Section a A Safe harbor agreements are subject to public comment rules of the APA br br br Candidate Conservation Agreements With Assurances br HCPs and SHAs are applied to listed species If an activity may take a proposed or candidate species parties can enter into Candidate Conservation Agreements With Assurances CCAA A party must show the Services they will take conservation measures to prevent listing If a CCAA is approved and the species is later listed the party with a CCAA gets an automatic enhancement of survival permit under Section a A CCAAs are subject to the public comment rules of the APA br br br Experimental populations br Experimental populations are listed species that have been intentionally introduced to a new area They must be separate geographically from other populations of the same species Experimental populations can be designated essential or non essential Essential populations are those whose loss would appreciably reduce the survival of the species in the wild Non essential populations are all others Nonessential experimental populations of listed species typically receive less protection than populations in the wild br br br Penalties br There are different degrees of violation with the law The most punishable offenses are trafficking and any act of knowingly taking which includes harming wounding or killing an endangered species br The penalties for these violations can be a maximum fine of up to or imprisonment for one year or both and civil penalties of up to per violation may be assessed Lists of violations and exact fines are available through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration web site br One provision of this law is that no penalty may be imposed if by a preponderance of the evidence that the act was in self defense The law also eliminates criminal penalties for accidentally killing listed species during farming and ranching activities br In addition to fines or imprisonment a license permit or other agreement issued by a federal agency that authorized an individual to import or export fish wildlife or plants may be revoked suspended or modified Any federal hunting or fishing permits that were issued to a person who violates the ESA can be canceled or suspended for up to a year br br br Use of money received through violations of the ESA br A reward will be paid to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest conviction or revocation of a license so long as they are not a local state or federal employee in the performance of official duties The Secretary may also provide reasonable and necessary costs incurred for the care of fish wildlife and forest service or plant pending the violation caused by the criminal If the balance ever exceeds the Secretary of the Treasury is required to deposit an amount equal to the excess into the cooperative endangered species conservation fund br br br See also br Critical habitat br Endangered
