Nekhen Ancient Egyptian n n also known as Hierakonpolis Greek romanized Hier k n p lis either City of the Hawk or City of the Falcon a reference to Horus Egyptian Arabic romanized el K m el A mar lit the Red Mound was the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at the end of prehistoric Egypt c BC and probably also during the Early Dynastic Period c BC br The oldest known tomb with painted decoration a mural on its plaster walls is located in Nekhen and is thought to date to c BC It shares distinctive imagery with artifacts from the Gerzeh culture br br br Horus cult center br br Nekhen was the center of the cult of a hawk deity Horus of Nekhen which raised one of the most ancient Egyptian temples in this city It retained its importance as the cultic center for this divine patron of the kings long after the site had otherwise declined br The first settlement at Nekhen dates from either the predynastic Amratian culture c BC or perhaps during the late Badari culture c BC At its height from c BC Nekhen had at least and possibly as many as inhabitants Most of Upper Egypt then became unified under rulers from Abydos during the Naqada III period BCE at the expense of rival cities especially Nekhen Hierakonpolis The conflicts leading to the supremacy of Abydos may appear on numerous reliefs of the Naqada II period such as the Gebel el Arak Knife or the frieze of Tomb at Nekhen Hierakonpolis br The ruins of the city originally were excavated toward the end of the nineteenth century by the English archaeologists James Quibell and Frederick W Green br br Quibell and Green discovered the Main Deposit a foundation deposit beneath the temple in Quibell originally was trained under Flinders Petrie the father of modern Egyptology however he failed to follow Petrie s methods The temple was a difficult site to excavate to begin with so his excavation was poorly conducted and then poorly documented Specifically the situational context of the items therein is poorly recorded and often the reports of Quibell and Green are in contradiction br The most famous artifact commonly associated with the main deposit the Narmer Palette now is thought probably not to have been in the main deposit at all Quibell s report made in put the palette in the deposit but Green s report in put it about one to two yards away Green s version is substantiated by earlier field notes Quibell kept none so it is now the accepted record of events br br The main deposit dates to the early Old Kingdom but the artistic style of the objects in the deposit indicate that they were from Naqada III and were moved into the deposit at a later date The other important item in the deposit clearly dates to the late prehistoric This object the Scorpion Macehead depicts a king known only by the ideogram for scorpion now called Scorpion II participating in what seems to be a ritual irrigation ceremony Although the Narmer Palette is more famous because it shows the first king to wear both the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt the Scorpion Macehead indicates some early military hostility with the north by showing dead lapwings the symbol of Lower Egypt hung from standards br John Garstang excavated at Nekhen in He initially hoped to excavate the town site but encountered difficulties working there and soon turned his attention to the area he misidentified as a fort instead That site dates to the second dynasty King Khasekhemwy Beneath that area Garstang excavated a Predynastic cemetery consisting of graves which served the bulk of the city population during the late Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods revealing the burial practices of the non elite Egyptians living at Nekhen br More recently the concession was excavated further by a multinational team of archaeologists Egyptologists geologists and members of other sciences which was coordinated by Michael Hoffman until his death in then by Barbara Adams of University College London and Dr Renee Friedman representing the University of California Berkeley and the British Museum until Barbara Adams s death in and by Ren e Friedman thereafter br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Possible ritual structures br The structure at Nekhen known by the misnomer fort is a massive mud brick enclosure built by King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty It appears to be similar in structure and ritual purpose as the similarly misidentified forts constructed at Abydos all without apparent military function The true function of these structures is unknown but they seem to be related to the rituals of kingship and the culture Religion was interwoven inexorably with kingship in Ancient Egypt br The ritual structure at Nekhen was built on a prehistoric cemetery The excavations there as well as the work of later brick robbers have seriously undermined the walls and led to the near collapse of the structure For two years during and the team led by Friedman attempted to stabilize the existing structure and support the endangered areas of the structure with new mudbricks br Excavations at Hierakonpolis Upper Egypt in found archaeological evidence of ritual masks similar to those used in locations further south of Egypt and significant amounts of obsidian which were linked to Ethiopian quarry sites br br br Oldest known Egyptian painted tomb br br Other discoveries at Nekhen include Tomb the oldest known tomb with a mural painted on its plaster walls The sepulchre is thought to date to the Gerzeh culture c BC br It is presumed that the mural shows religious scenes and images It includes figures featured in Egyptian culture for three thousand years a funerary procession of barques presumably a goddess standing between two upright lionesses a wheel of various horned quadrupeds several examples of a staff that became associated with the deity of the earliest cattle culture and one being held up by a heavy breasted goddess Animals depicted include onagers or zebras ibexes ostriches lionesses impalas gazelles and cattle br Several interpretations of the themes and designs visible in the Nekhen fresco have been associated with a distinctly foreign artifact found in Egypt the Gebel el Arak Knife c BCE with a Mesopotamian scene described as the Master of animals showing a presumed figure between two lions presumed fighting scenes or the boats br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Oldest known zoo br br The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at Nekhen in of a menagerie that dates to c BC The animals numbering in totality fourteen during May include a leopard two crocodiles hippopotami hartebeest two elephants baboons and African wildcats Animals discovered at the cemetery site were found to have had broken bones br br br Continuous activity br There are later tombs at Nekhen dating to the Middle Kingdom Second Intermediate Period and New Kingdom In the painted tomb of Horemkhauef a biographical inscription reporting a journey to the capital by him was found He lived during the Second Intermediate Period br Because it had a strong association with Egyptian religious ideas about kingship the temple of Horus at Nekhen was used as late as the Ptolemaic Kingdom persisting as a religious center throughout the thousands of years of Ancient Egyptian culture br br br Artifacts br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
