Trypanosoma is a genus of kinetoplastids class Trypanosomatidae a monophyletic group of unicellular parasitic flagellate protozoa Trypanosoma is part of the phylum Euglenozoa The name is derived from the Greek trypano borer and soma body because of their corkscrew like motion Most trypanosomes are heteroxenous requiring more than one obligatory host to complete life cycle and most are transmitted via a vector The majority of species are transmitted by blood feeding invertebrates but there are different mechanisms among the varying species Trypanosoma equiperdum is spread between horses and other equine species by sexual contact They are generally found in the intestine of their invertebrate host but normally occupy the bloodstream or an intracellular environment in the vertebrate host br Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei and Chagas disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi br The mitochondrial genome of the Trypanosoma as well as of other kinetoplastids known as the kinetoplast is made up of a highly complex series of catenated circles and minicircles and requires a cohort of proteins for organisation during cell division br br br History br In Gabriel Valentin found flagellates that today are included in Trypanoplasma in the blood of trout br The genus T sanguinis was named by Gruby in after parasites in the blood of frogs br In David Bruce identified the protozoan parasite and the tsetse fly vector of African trypanosomiasis br br br Taxonomy br A number of different methods demonstrate that the traditional Trypanosoma genus is not monophyletic with the biflagellate Bodonida nested within The American and African trypanosomes constitute distinct clades implying that the major human disease agents T cruzi cause of Chagas disease and T brucei cause of African sleeping sickness are not closely related to each other br Phylogenetic analyses suggest an ancient split between a branch containing all Salivarian trypanosomes and a branch containing all non Salivarian lineages The latter branch in turn splits into a clade containing bird reptilian and the Stercorarian trypanosomes infecting mammals and a clade with a branch of fish trypanosomes and a branch of reptilian or amphibian lineages br Salivarians are trypanosomes of the subgenera of Duttonella Trypanozoon Pycnomonas and Nannomonas which are passed to the vertebrate recipient in the saliva of the tsetse fly Glossina spp Antigenic variation is a characteristic shared by the Salivaria which has been particularly well studied in T brucei The Trypanozoon subgenus contains the species Trypanosoma brucei T rhodesiense and T equiperdum The subgenus Duttonella contains the species T vivax Nannomonas contains T congolense br Stercorians are trypanosomes passed to the recipient in the feces of insects from the subfamily Triatominae most importantly Triatoma infestans This group includes Trypanosoma cruzi T lewisi T melophagium T nabiasi T rangeli T theileri T theodori The subgenus Herpetosoma contains the species T lewisi br The subgenus Schizotrypanum contains T cruzi and a number of bat trypanosomes The bat species include Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei Trypanosoma dionisii Trypanosoma erneyi Trypanosoma livingstonei and Trypanosoma wauwau Other related species include Trypanosoma conorhini and Trypanosoma rangeli br br br Evolution br The ancestor of modern trypanosomes absorbed a green alga around one billion years ago and co opted some of its genetic material This has resulted in modern trypanosomes such as T brucei containing essential genes for the breakdown of sugars that are most closely related to plants This difference may be used as the target of therapies br The relationships between the species have not been worked out to date It has been suggested that T evansi arose from a clone of T equiperdum which lost its maxicircles It has also been proposed that T evansi should be classified as a subspecies of T brucei br It has been shown that T equiperdum has emerged at least once in Eastern Africa and T evansi at two independent occasions in Western Africa br br br Selected species br Species of Trypanosoma include the following br br T ambystomae in amphibians br T antiquus extinct Fossil in Miocene amber br T avium which infects birds and blackflies br T bennetti which infects birds and biting midges br T boissoni in elasmobranch br T brucei which causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle br T cruzi which causes Chagas disease in humans br Trypanosoma culicavium which infects birds and mosquitoes br T congolense which causes nagana in ruminant livestock horses and a wide range of wildlife br T equinum in South American horses transmitted via Tabanidae br T equiperdum which causes dourine or covering sickness in horses and other Equidae it can be spread through coitus br T evansi which causes one form of the disease surra in certain animals including camels a single case report of human infection in in India was successfully treated with suramin br T everetti in birds br T hosei in amphibians br T irwini in koalas br T lewisi in rats br T melophagium in sheep transmitted via Melophagus ovinus br T parroti in amphibians br T percae in the species Perca fluviatilis br T phedinae br T rangeli believed to be nonpathogenic to humans br T rotatorium in amphibians br T rugosae in amphibians br T sergenti in amphibians br T simiae which causes nagana in pigs Its main reservoirs are warthogs and bush pigs br T sinipercae in fishes br T suis which causes a different form of surra br T theileri a large trypanosome infecting ruminants and transmitted by a variety of vectors including tabanids and mosquitoes br T thomasbancrofti an avian trypanosome with culicine mosquito vector br T triglae in marine teleosts br T tungarae in frogs br T vivax which causes the disease nagana mainly in West Africa although it has spread to South America br br br Hosts life cycle and morphologies br br Two different types of trypanosomes exist and their life cycles are different the salivarian species and the stercorarian species br Stercorarian trypanosomes infect insects most often the triatomid kissing bug by developing in the posterior gut followed by release into the feces and subsequent depositing on the skin of the vertebrate host The organism then penetrates and can disseminate throughout the body Insects become infected when taking a blood meal br Salivarian trypanosomes develop in the anterior gut of insects most importantly the Tsetse fly and infective organisms are inoculated into the host by the insect bite before it feeds br As trypanosomes progress through their life cycle they undergo a series of morphological changes as is typical of trypanosomatids The life cycle often consists of the trypomastigote form in the vertebrate host and the trypomastigote or promastigote form in the gut of the invertebrate host Intracellular lifecycle stages are normally found in the amastigote form The trypomastigote morphology is unique to species in the genus Trypanosoma br br br Meiosis br Evidence has been obtained for meiosis in T cruzi and for genetic exchange T brucei is able to undergo meiosis within the salivary glands of its tsetse fly host and meiosis is considered to be an intrinsic part of the T brucei developmental cycle An adaptive benefit of meiosis for T crucei and T brucei may be the recombinational repair of DNA damages that are acquired in the hostile environment of their respective hosts br br br br br br External links br Trypanosoma reviewed and published by Wikivet accessed br br Trykipedia Trypanosomatid
