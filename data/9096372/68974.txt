Frederick II German Friedrich Italian Federico Latin Fridericus December December was King of Sicily from King of Germany from King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor from and King of Jerusalem from He was the son of Emperor Henry VI of the Hohenstaufen dynasty the second son of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Queen Constance of Sicily of the Hauteville dynasty br He ruled a vast area beginning with Sicily and stretching through Italy all the way north to Germany As the Crusades progressed he acquired control of Jerusalem and styled himself its king However the Papacy became his enemy and it eventually prevailed Viewing himself as a direct successor to the Roman emperors of antiquity he was Emperor of the Romans from his papal coronation in until his death he was also a claimant to the title of King of the Romans from and unopposed holder of that monarchy from As such he was King of Germany of Italy and of Burgundy At the age of three he was crowned King of Sicily as a co ruler with his mother Constance of Hauteville the daughter of Roger II of Sicily His other royal title was King of Jerusalem by virtue of marriage and his connection with the Sixth Crusade Frequently at war with the papacy which was hemmed in between Frederick s lands in northern Italy and his Kingdom of Sicily the Regno to the south he was excommunicated three times and often vilified in pro papal chronicles of the time and after Pope Gregory IX went so far as to declare him preambulus Antichristi predecessor of the Antichrist br Speaking six languages Latin Sicilian Middle High German Old French Greek and Arabic Frederick has a reputation as a Renaissance man avant la lettre as scientist scholar architect poet and composer As an avid patron of science and the arts he played a major role in promoting literature through the Sicilian School of poetry His Sicilian royal court in Palermo beginning around saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo Romance language Sicilian The poetry that emanated from the school had a significant influence on literature and on what was to become the modern Italian language He was also the first king to formally outlaw trial by ordeal which had come to be viewed as superstitious br After his death his line did not survive and the House of Hohenstaufen came to an end Furthermore the Holy Roman Empire entered a long period of decline during the Great Interregnum His complex political and cultural legacy has attracted fierce debates until this day br br br Birth and naming br br Born in Jesi near Ancona Italy on December Frederick was the son of Henry VI Holy Roman Emperor He was known as the puer Apuliae son of Apulia His mother was Constance of Sicily Frederick was baptised in Assisi in the church of San Rufino br At birth Frederick was named Constantine by his mother This name a masculine form of his mother s name served to identify him closely with both his Norman heritage and his imperial heritage through Constantine the Great the first Christian emperor It was still his name at the time of his election as King of the Romans He was only given his grandfathers names becoming Frederick Roger or Roger Frederick at his baptism when he was two years old This dual name served the same purpose as Constantine emphasising his dual heritage br Frederick s birth was accompanied by gossip and rumour on account of his mother s advanced age According to Albert of Stade and Salimbene he was not the son of Henry and Constance but was presented to Henry as his own after a faked pregnancy His real father was variously described as a butcher of Jesi a physician a miller or a falconer Frederick s birth was also associated with a prophecy of Merlin According to Andrea Dandolo writing at some distance but probably recording contemporary gossip Henry doubted reports of his wife s pregnancy and was only convinced by consulting Joachim of Fiore who confirmed that Frederick was his son by interpretation of Merlin s prophecy and the Erythraean Sibyl A later legend claims that Constance gave birth in the public square of Jesi to silence doubters Constance took unusual measures to prove her pregnancy and its legitimacy and Roger of Howden reports that she swore on the gospels before a papal legate that Frederick was her son by Henry It is probable that these public acts of affirmation on account of her age gave rise to some false rumours br In the spring of a few months after Henry VI had been crowned king of Sicily and not long after the birth of her son Constance the empress continued her journey to Palermo After the unexpected death of Tancred of Lecce an illegitimate son of Roger eldest son of Roger II of Sicily Henry had hurried over to assume power and to have himself crowned king Frederick was entrusted to the care of the duchess of Spoleto the wife of the Swabian noble Conrad I of Urslingen who was named duke of Spoleto by Frederick Barbarossa Frederick II stayed in Foligno a place located in papal territory and so under papal jurisdiction until the death of his father on September in br br br Minority br br In at Frankfurt am Main the infant Frederick was elected King of the Romans and thus heir to his father s imperial crown His rights in Germany were to end up disputed by Henry s brother Philip of Swabia and Otto of Brunswick At the death of his father Henry VI in Frederick was in Italy traveling towards Germany when the bad news reached his guardian Conrad of Spoleto Frederick was hastily brought back to his mother Constance in Palermo Sicily where he was crowned King of Sicily on May at just three years of age Originally his title had been Romanorum et Sicilie rex King of the Romans and Sicily but in after Constance who kept using title of Empress found out that Philip of Swabia had been recognized by the Staufer supporters in Germany she had her son renounce the title King of the Romans She probably agreed with Philip that Frederick s prospects in Germany were hopeless The decision strengthened Frederick s position in Sicily as this satisfied both Philip of Swabia and the Pope who did not like the idea of a ruler who had authority in both Sicily and the North Alpine realm br Constance of Sicily was in her own right queen of Sicily and she established herself as regent Constance sided with the Pope who preferred that Sicily and the Germans were under separate governments She renounced the authority over the Sicilian state church to the papal side but only as Sicilian queen and not as empress seemingly with the intention of keeping options open for Frederick Upon Constance s death in Pope Innocent III succeeded as Frederick s guardian Frederick s tutor during this period was Cencio who would become Pope Honorius III Markward of Annweiler with the support of Henry s brother Philip of Swabia reclaimed the regency for himself and soon after invaded the Kingdom of Sicily In with the help of Genoese ships he landed in Sicily and one year later seized the young Frederick He thus ruled Sicily until when he was succeeded by another German captain William of Capparone who kept Frederick under his control in the royal palace of Palermo until Frederick was subsequently under tutor Walter of Palearia until in he was declared of age At that time he spoke five languages Greek Arabic Latin Proven al and Sicilian His first task was to reassert his power over Sicily and southern Italy where local barons and adventurers had usurped most of the authority Pope Innocent was in search of a diplomatic match for his protege Frederick to enable him successful future alliances Eventually Constance of Aragon a widow of the late King of Hungary and double his age was found br br br Reign prior to the conflict with the pope br br Otto of Brunswick had been crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Innocent III in October In southern Italy Otto became the champion of those noblemen and barons who feared Frederick s increasingly strong measures to check their power such as the dismissal of the pro noble Walter of Palearia The new emperor invaded Italy where he reached Calabria without meeting much resistance br In response Innocent sided against Otto and in September at the Diet of Nuremberg Frederick was elected in absentia as German King by a rebellious faction backed by the pope Innocent also excommunicated Otto who was forced to return to Germany Frederick sailed to Gaeta with a small following He agreed with the pope on a future separation between the Sicilian and Imperial titles and named his wife Constance as regent Passing through Lombardy and Engadin he reached Konstanz in September preceding Otto by a few hours br Frederick was crowned king on December in Mainz Frederick s authority in Germany remained tenuous and he was recognized only in southern Germany In the region of northern Germany the center of Guelph power Otto continued to hold the reins of royal and imperial power despite his excommunication Otto s decisive military defeat at the Bouvines forced him to withdraw to the Guelph hereditary lands where virtually without supporters he died in br The German princes supported by Innocent III again elected Frederick king of Germany in and he was crowned king in Aachen in mid July by one of the three German archbishops Frederick then astonished the crowd by taking the cross and calling upon the nobles present to do the same It was not until another five years had passed and only after further negotiations between Frederick Innocent III and Honorius III who succeeded to the papacy after Innocent s death in that Frederick was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome by Honorius III on November At the same time Frederick s oldest son Henry took the title of King of the Romans br Unlike most Holy Roman emperors Frederick spent few years in Germany In he helped King Philip II of France and Odo III Duke of Burgundy to bring an end to the War of Succession in Champagne France by invading Lorraine capturing and burning Nancy capturing Theobald I Duke of Lorraine and forcing him to withdraw his support from Erard of Brienne Ramerupt After his coronation in Frederick remained either in the Kingdom of Sicily or on Crusade until when he made his last journey to Germany He returned to Italy in and stayed there for the remaining thirteen years of his life represented in Germany by his son Conrad br In the Kingdom of Sicily he built on the reform of the laws begun at the Assizes of Ariano in by his grandfather Roger II His initiative in this direction was visible as early as the Assizes of Capua issued soon after his coronation in Rome but came to fruition in his promulgation of the Constitutions of Melfi also known as Liber Augustalis a collection of laws for his realm that was remarkable for its time and was a source of inspiration for a long time after It made the Kingdom of Sicily an absolutist monarchy it also set a precedent for the primacy of written law With relatively small modifications the Liber Augustalis remained the basis of Sicilian law until br In Frederick tried Bishop Aldoin of Cefal for maladministration The trial was nullified by the pope on procedural grounds br br br Foreign policy and wars br br br The Fifth Crusade and early policies in northern Italy br br At the time he was elected King of the Romans Frederick promised to go on crusade He continually delayed however and in spite of his renewal of this vow at his coronation as the King of Germany he did not travel to Egypt with the armies of the Fifth Crusade in He sent forces to Egypt under the command of Louis I Duke of Bavaria but constant expectation of his arrival caused papal legate Pelagius to reject Ayyubid sultan Al Kamil s offer to restore the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem to the crusaders in exchange for their withdrawal from Egypt and caused the Crusade to continually stall in anticipation of his ever delayed arrival The crusade ended in failure with the loss of Damietta in Frederick was blamed by both Pope Honorius III and the general Christian populace for this calamitous defeat br In after agreeing with Pope Honorius to launch a Crusade before Frederick summoned an imperial Diet at Cremona the main pro imperial city in Lombardy the main arguments for holding the Diet would be to continue the struggle against heresy to organize the crusade and above all to restore the imperial power in northern Italy which had long been usurped by the numerous communes located there Those assembled responded with the reformation of the Lombard League which had already defeated his grandfather Frederick Barbarossa in the th century and again Milan was chosen as the league s leader The Diet was cancelled however and the situation was stabilized only through a compromise reached by Honorius between Frederick and the league During his sojourn in northern Italy Frederick also invested the Teutonic Order with the territories in what would become East Prussia starting what was later called the Northern Crusade br Frederick was distracted with the League when in June Louis VIII of France laid siege to Avignon an imperial city The barons of the French army sent a letter to Frederick defending their action as a military necessity and a few days after the start of the siege Henry VII ratified an alliance with France that had been signed in br br br The Sixth Crusade br br Problems of stability within the empire delayed Frederick s departure on crusade It was not until when by proxy Frederick had married Isabella II of Jerusalem heiress to the Kingdom of Jerusalem that his departure seemed assured Frederick immediately saw to it that his new father in law John of Brienne the current king of Jerusalem was dispossessed and his rights transferred to the emperor In August Frederick set out for the Holy Land from Brindisi but was forced to return when he was struck down by an epidemic that had broken out Even the master of the Teutonic Knights Hermann of Salza recommended that he return to the mainland to recuperate On September Frederick was excommunicated by Pope Gregory IX for failing to honor his crusading pledge br Many contemporary chroniclers doubted the sincerity of Frederick s illness and their attitude may be explained by their pro papal leanings Roger of Wendover a chronicler of the time wrote br br he went to the Mediterranean sea and embarked with a small retinue but after pretending to make for the holy land for three days he said that he was seized with a sudden illness this conduct of the emperor redounded much to his disgrace and to the injury of the whole business of the crusade br Frederick eventually sailed again from Brindisi in June The pope still Gregory IX regarded that action as a provocation since as an excommunicate Frederick was technically not capable of conducting a crusade and he excommunicated the emperor a second time Frederick reached Acre in September Many of the local nobility the Templars and Hospitallers were therefore reluctant to offer overt support Since the crusading army was already a small force Frederick negotiated along the lines of a previous agreement he had intended to broker with the Ayyubid sultan Al Kamil The treaty signed in February resulted in the restitution of Jerusalem Nazareth Bethlehem and a small coastal strip to the Kingdom of Jerusalem though there are disagreements as to the extent of the territory returned br The treaty also stipulated that the Dome of the Rock and al Aqsa Mosque were to remain under Muslim control and that the city of Jerusalem would remain without fortifications Virtually all other crusaders including the Templars and Hospitallers condemned this deal as a political ploy on the part of Frederick to regain his kingdom while betraying the cause of the Crusaders Al Kamil who was nervous about possible war with his relatives who ruled Syria and Mesopotamia wished to avoid further trouble from the Christians at least until his domestic rivals were subdued br The crusade ended in a truce and in Frederick s coronation as King of Jerusalem on March although this was technically improper Frederick s wife Isabella the heiress had died leaving their infant son Conrad as rightful king There is also disagreement as to whether the coronation was a coronation at all as a letter written by Frederick to Henry III of England suggests that the crown he placed on his own head was in fact the imperial crown of the Romans br At his coronation he may have worn the red silk mantle that had been crafted during the reign of Roger II It bore an Arabic inscription indicating that the robe dated from the year in the Muslim calendar and incorporated a generic benediction wishing its wearer vast prosperity great generosity and high splendor fame and magnificent endowments and the fulfillment of his wishes and hopes May his days and nights go in pleasure without end or change This coronation robe can be found today in the Schatzkammer of the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna br In any case Gerald of Lausanne the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem did not attend the ceremony indeed the next day the Bishop of Caesarea arrived to place the city under interdict on the patriarch s orders Frederick s further attempts to rule over the Kingdom of Jerusalem were met by resistance on the part of the barons led by John of Ibelin Lord of Beirut In the mid s Frederick s viceroy was forced to leave Acre and in following a siege Jerusalem itself was lost again to a new Muslim offensive br Whilst Frederick s seeming bloodless recovery of Jerusalem for the cross brought him great prestige in some European circles his decision to complete the crusade while excommunicated provoked Church hostility Although in the Pope lifted Frederick s excommunication this decision was taken for a variety of reasons related to the political situation in Europe Of Frederick s crusade Philip of Novara a chronicler of the period said The emperor left Acre after the conclusion of the truce hated cursed and vilified Overall this crusade arguably the first successful one since the First Crusade was adversely affected by the manner in which Frederick carried out negotiations without the support of the church He left behind a kingdom in the Levant torn between his agents and the local nobility a civil war known as the War of the Lombards br The itinerant Joachimite preachers and many radical Franciscans the Spirituals supported Frederick Against the interdict pronounced on his lands the preachers condemned the Pope and continued to minister the sacraments and grant absolutions Brother Arnold in Swabia proclaimed the Second Coming for at which time Frederick would then confiscate the riches of Rome and distribute them among the poor the only true Christians br br br War of the Keys br br During Frederick s stay in the Holy Land his regent Rainald of Spoleto had attacked the March of Ancona and the Duchy of Spoleto Gregory IX recruited an army under John of Brienne and in invaded southern Italy His troops overcame an initial resistance at Montecassino and reached into Campania as far as the Volturno Irpino Frederick arrived at Brindisi in June He quickly recovered the lost territories and tried and condemned the rebel barons but avoided crossing the borders of the Papal States br The war came to an end with the Treaty of San Germano in July On August in a public ceremony in Ceprano the papal legates Thomas of Capua and Giovanni Colonna absolved Frederick and lifted his excommunication The emperor personally met Gregory IX at Anagni making some concessions to the church in Sicily He also issued the Constitutions of Melfi August as an attempt to solve the political and administrative problems of the country which had dramatically been shown by the recent war br br br Henry s revolt br While he may have temporarily made his peace with the pope Frederick found the German princes another matter Frederick s son Henry VII who was born in Sicily son of Frederick s first wife Constance of Aragon had caused their discontent with an aggressive policy against their privileges This forced Henry to a complete capitulation and the Statutum in favorem principum Statutes in favor of the princes issued at Worms deprived the emperor of much of his sovereignty in Germany Frederick summoned Henry to a meeting which was held at Aquileia in Henry confirmed his submission but Frederick was nevertheless compelled to confirm the Statutum at Cividale soon afterwards br The situation for Frederick was also problematic in Lombardy after all the emperor s attempts to restore the imperial authority in Lombardy with the help of Gregory IX at the time ousted from Rome by a revolt turned to nothing in In the meantime Henry in Germany had returned to an anti princes policy against his father s will Frederick thus obtained his excommunication from Gregory IX July Henry tried to muster an opposition in Germany and asked the Lombard cities to block the Alpine passes In May Frederick went to Germany taking no army with him as soon as July however he was able to force his son to renounce to the crown all his lands at Worms and then imprisoned him br In Germany the Hohenstaufen and the Guelphs reconciled in Otto the Child the grandson of Henry the Lion had been deposed as Duke of Bavaria and Saxony in conveying the allodial Guelphic possessions to Frederick who in return enfeoffed Otto with the same lands and additional former imperial possessions as the newly established Duke of Brunswick L neburg ending the unclear status of the German Guelphs who had been left without title and rank after br br br The war for Lombardy and Italy br br With peace north of the Alps Frederick raised an army from the German princes to suppress the rebel cities in Lombardy Gregory tried to stop the invasion with diplomatic moves but in vain During his descent to Italy Frederick had to divert his troops to quell a rebellion of Frederick II Duke of Austria At Vienna in February he obtained the title of King of the Romans for his year old son Conrad br After the failure of the negotiations between the Lombard cities the pope and the imperial diplomats Frederick invaded Lombardy from Verona In November he won the decisive battle in Cortenuova over the Lombard League Frederick celebrated it with a triumph in Cremona in the manner of an ancient Roman emperor with the captured carroccio later sent to the commune of Rome and an elephant He rejected any suit for peace even from Milan which had sent a great sum of money This demand of total surrender spurred further resistance from Milan Brescia Bologna and Piacenza and in October he was forced to raise the siege of Brescia in the course of which his enemies had tried unsuccessfully to capture him br Frederick received the news of his excommunication by Gregory IX in the first months of while his court was in Padua The emperor responded by expelling the Franciscans and the Dominicans from Lombardy and electing his son Enzo as Imperial vicar for Northern Italy Enzo soon annexed the Romagna Marche and the Duchy of Spoleto nominally part of the Papal States The father announced he was to destroy the Republic of Venice which had sent some ships against Sicily In December of that year Frederick entered Tuscany and spent Christmas in Pisa In January Frederick triumphantly entered Foligno followed by Viterbo whence he aimed to finally conquer Rome to restore the ancient splendours of the Empire Frederick s plan to attack Rome at that time however did not come to fruition as he chose to leave for southern Italy where a papal incited rebellion flared in Apulia In southern Italy Frederick attacked and razed St Angelo and Benevento br In the meantime the Ghibelline city of Ferrara had fallen and Frederick swept his way northwards capturing Ravenna and after another long siege Faenza The people of Forl which had kept its Ghibelline stance even after the collapse of Hohenstaufen power offered their loyal support during the capture of the rival city as a sign of gratitude they were granted an augmentation of the communal coat of arms with the Hohenstaufen eagle together with other privileges This episode shows how the independent cities used the rivalry between Empire and Pope as a means to obtain maximum advantage for themselves br At this time Gregory considered yielding A truce occurred and peace negotiations began Direct peace negotiations ultimately failed and Gregory called for a General Council Frederick and his allies however dashed Gregory s plan for a General Council when they intercepted a delegation of prelates traveling to Rome in a Genoese fleet at the Battle of Giglio br Frederick then directed his army toward Rome and the Pope burning and destroying Umbria as he advanced Then just as the Emperor s forces were ready to attack Rome Gregory died on August Frederick then attempted to show that the war was not directed against the Church of Rome but against the Pope by withdrawing his troops and freeing from prison in Capua two cardinals he had captured at Giglio Otto of Tonengo and James of Pecorara Frederick then traveled to Sicily to wait for the election of a new pope br br br Mongol raids br br In the forces of the Mongol Empire decisively defeated the armies of Hungary and Poland and devastated their countryside and all their unfortified settlements King B la IV of Hungary appealed to Frederick for aid but Frederick being in dispute with the Hungarian king for some time as Bela had sided with the Papacy against him and not wanting to commit to a major military expedition so readily refused He was unwilling to cross into Hungary and although he went about unifying his magnates and other monarchs to potentially face a Mongol invasion he specifically took his vow for the defense of the empire on this side of the Alps br Frederick was aware of the danger the Mongols posed and grimly assessed the situation but also tried to use it as leverage over the Papacy to frame himself as the protector of Christendom While he called them traitorous pagans Frederick expressed an admiration for Mongol military prowess after hearing of their deeds in particular their able commanders and fierce discipline and obedience judging the latter to be the greatest source of their success He called a levy throughout Germany while the Mongols were busy raiding Hungary In mid Frederick dispersed his army back to their holdfasts as the Mongols preoccupied themselves with the lands east of the Danube attempting to smash all Hungarian resistance He subsequently ordered his vassals to strengthen their defenses adopt a defensive posture and gather large numbers of crossbowmen br A chronicler reports that Frederick received a demand of submission from Batu Khan at some time which he ignored He apparently kept up to date on the Mongols activities as a letter from Frederick II dated June comments that the Mongols were now using looted Hungarian armor A letter written by Emperor Frederick II found in the Regesta Imperii dated to June and intended for all his vassals in Swabia Austria and Bohemia included a number of specific military instructions His forces were to avoid engaging the Mongols in field battles hoard all food stocks in every fortress and stronghold and arm all possible levies as well as the general populace br Thomas of Split comments that there was a frenzy of fortifying castles and cities throughout the Holy Roman Empire including Italy Either following the Emperor s instructions or on their own initiative Frederick II Duke of Austria paid to have his border castles strengthened at his own expense King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia had every castle strengthened and provisioned as well as providing soldiers and armaments to monasteries in order to turn them into refuges for the civilian population br Mongol probing attacks materialised on the Holy Roman Empire s border states a force was repulsed in a skirmish near K odzko Mongol troops were killed in a battle near Vienna to Austrian losses according to the Duke of Austria and a Mongol raiding party was destroyed by Austrian knights in the district of Theben after being backed to the border of the River March As the Holy Roman Empire seemed now the target of the Mongols Frederick II sent letters to Henry III of England and Louis IX of France in order to organise a crusade against the Mongol Empire br A full scale invasion never occurred as the Mongols spent the next year pillaging Hungary before withdrawing After the Mongols withdrew from Hungary back to Russia Frederick turned his attention back towards Italian matters The danger represented by the presence of the Mongols in Europe was debated again at the First Council of Lyon in but Frederick II was excommunicated by that very diet in the context of his struggle with the Papacy and ultimately abandoned the possibility of a crusade against the Mongol Empire br br br Innocent IV br br A new pope Innocent IV was elected on June He was a member of a noble Imperial family and had some relatives in Frederick s camp so the Emperor was initially happy with his election Innocent however was to become his fiercest enemy Negotiations began in the summer of but the situation changed as Viterbo rebelled instigated by the intriguing local cardinal Ranieri Capocci Frederick could not afford to lose his main stronghold near Rome so he besieged Viterbo br Innocent convinced the rebels to sign a peace but after Frederick withdrew his garrison Ranieri had them slaughtered on November Frederick was enraged The new Pope was a master diplomat and Frederick signed a peace treaty which was soon broken Innocent together with most of the Cardinals fled via Genoese galleys to Liguria arriving on July His aim was to reach Lyon where a new council was being held since June br Despite initially appearing that the council could end with a compromise the intervention of Ranieri who had a series of insulting pamphlets published against Frederick in which among other things he defined the emperor as a heretic and an Antichrist led the prelates towards a less accommodating solution One month later Innocent IV declared Frederick to be deposed as emperor characterising him as a friend of Babylon s sultan of Saracen customs provided with a harem guarded by eunuchs like the schismatic emperor of Byzantium and in sum a heretic br The Pope backed Heinrich Raspe landgrave of Thuringia as rival for the imperial crown and set in motion a plot to kill Frederick and Enzo with the support of the pope s brother in law Orlando de Rossi another friend of Frederick The plotters were unmasked by the count of Caserta however and the city of Altavilla where they had found shelter was razed The guilty were blinded mutilated and burnt alive or hanged An attempt to invade the Kingdom of Sicily under the command of Ranieri was halted at Spello by Marino of Eboli Imperial vicar of Spoleto br Innocent also sent a flow of money to Germany to cut off Frederick s power at its source The archbishops of Cologne and Mainz also declared Frederick deposed and in May Heinrich Raspe was chosen as the new king On August Heinrich thanks to the Pope s money managed to defeat an army of Conrad son of Frederick near Frankfurt Frederick strengthened his position in Southern Germany however acquiring the Duchy of Austria whose duke had died without heirs A year later Heinrich died and the new anti king was William II of Holland br Between February and March Frederick settled the situation in Italy by means of the diet of Terni naming his relatives or friends as vicars of the various lands He married his son Manfred to the daughter of Amedeo di Savoia and secured the submission of the marquis of Monferrato On his part Innocent asked protection from the King of France Louis IX but the king was a friend of the Emperor and believed in his desire for peace A papal army under the command of Ottaviano degli Ubaldini never reached Lombardy and the Emperor accompanied by a massive army held the next diet in Turin br br br Setbacks and death br br An unexpected event was to change the situation dramatically In June the important Lombard city of Parma expelled the Imperial functionaries and sided with the Guelphs Enzo was not in the city and could do nothing more than ask for help from his father who came back to lay siege to the rebels together with his friend Ezzelino III da Romano tyrant of Verona The besieged languished as the Emperor waited for them to surrender from starvation He had a wooden city which he called Vittoria built around the walls br On February during one of these absences the camp was suddenly assaulted and taken and in the ensuing Battle of Parma the Imperial side was routed Frederick lost the Imperial treasure and with it any hope of maintaining the impetus of his struggle against the rebellious communes and against the pope who began plans for a crusade against Sicily Frederick soon recovered and rebuilt an army but this defeat encouraged resistance in many cities that could no longer bear the fiscal burden of his regime Romagna Marche and Spoleto were lost br In February Frederick fired his advisor and prime minister the famous jurist and poet Pier delle Vigne on charges of peculation and embezzlement Some historians suggest that Pier was planning to betray the Emperor who according to Matthew of Paris cried when he discovered the plot Pier blinded and in chains died in Pisa possibly by his own hand Even more shocking for Frederick was the capture of his natural son Enzo of Sardinia by the Bolognese at the Battle of Fossalta in May Enzo was held in a palace in Bologna where he remained captive until his death in br Frederick lost another son Richard of Chieti The struggle continued the Empire lost Como and Modena but regained Ravenna An army sent to invade the Kingdom of Sicily under the command of Cardinal Pietro Capocci was crushed in the Marche at the Battle of Cingoli in In the first month of that year the indomitable Ranieri of Viterbo died and the Imperial condottieri again reconquered Romagna the Marche and Spoleto and Conrad King of the Romans scored several victories in Germany against William of Holland br Frederick did not take part in of any of these campaigns He had been ill and likely felt tired Despite the betrayals and the setbacks he had faced in his last years Frederick died peacefully wearing the habit of a Cistercian monk on December in Castel Fiorentino territory of Torremaggiore in Apulia after an attack of dysentery br At the time of his death his preeminent position in Europe was challenged but not lost his testament left his legitimate son Conrad the Imperial and Sicilian crowns Manfred received the principality of Taranto and regency over the Kingdom of Sicily while his half brother remained in Germany Henry received the Kingdom of Arles or that of Jerusalem while the son of Henry VII was entrusted with the Duchy of Austria and the March of Styria Frederick s will stipulated that all the lands he had taken from the Church were to be returned to it all the prisoners freed and the taxes reduced provided this did not damage the Empire s prestige br However upon Conrad s death a mere four years later the Hohenstaufen dynasty fell from power and the Great Interregnum began lasting until one year after the last Hohenstaufen Enzo had died in his prison During this time a legend developed that Frederick was not truly dead but merely sleeping in the Kyffh user Mountains and would one day awaken to reestablish his empire Over time this legend largely transferred itself to his grandfather Frederick I also known as Barbarossa Redbeard br His sarcophagus made of red porphyry lies in the cathedral of Palermo beside those of his parents Henry VI and Constance as well as his grandfather the Norman king Roger II of Sicily He is wearing a funerary alb with a Thuluth style inscribed cuff A bust of Frederick sits in the Walhalla temple built by Ludwig I of Bavaria His sarcophagus was opened in the nineteenth century and various items can be found in the British Museum s collection including a small piece of funerary crown br br br br br br br br br br br br Personality and religion br br Frederick s contemporaries called him stupor mundi the astonishment of the world the majority of his contemporaries were indeed astonished and sometimes repelled by the pronounced unorthodoxy of the Hohenstaufen emperor and his temperamental stubbornness br Maehl argues that Frederick inherited German Norman and Sicilian blood but by training lifestyle and temperament he was most of all Sicilian To the end of his life he remained above all a Sicilian grand signore and his whole imperial policy aimed at expanding the Sicilian kingdom into Italy rather than the German kingdom southward And according to Cantor Frederick had no intention of giving up Naples and Sicily which were the real strongholds of its power He was in fact uninterested in Germany br Frederick was a religious sceptic to an extent unusual for his era His papal enemies used it against him at every turn Pope Innocent IV declared him preambulus Antichristi predecessor of the Antichrist on July As Frederick allegedly did not respect the privilegium potestatis of the Church he was excommunicated His rationalistic mind took pleasure in the strictly logical character of Christian dogma He was not however a champion of rationalism nor had he any sympathy with the mystico heretical movements of the time in fact he joined in suppressing them It was not the Church of the Middle Ages that he antagonized but its representatives br For his supposed Epicureanism paganism Frederick II is listed as a representative member of the sixth region of Dante s Inferno that of the heretics who are burned in tombs br Worried by the independent rule the Muslim population developed since his departure in he deported the Muslim population of Sicily to Lucera on mainland Italy in In Lucera he assumed surveillance was better in order to control them and the Muslims acknowledged that they were left with their religious freedom He also enlisted some in the army and six hundred as his personal bodyguards because as Muslim soldiers they had the advantage of immunity from papal excommunication br br br Literature and science br br Frederick had a great thirst for knowledge and learning Frederick employed Jews from Sicily who had migrated there from the holy land at his court to translate Greek and Arabic works He also introduced paper into an european court br He played a major role in promoting literature through the Sicilian School of poetry His Sicilian royal court in Palermo saw the first use of a literary form of an Italo Romance language Sicilian Through the mix of Arabic Hebrew Latin Greek and Sicilian language poems and art at the court Arabic muwashshahat or girdle poems influenced the birth of the sonnet The language developed by Giacomo da Lentini and Pier delle Vigne in the Sicilian School of Poetry gathering around Frederick II of Swabia in the first half of the thirteenth century had a decisive influence on Dante Alighieri and then on the development of Italian language itself The school and its poetry were saluted by Dante and his peers and predate by at least a century the use of the Tuscan idiom as the elite literary language of Italy br Frederick II is the author of the first treatise on the subject of falconry De Arte Venandi cum Avibus The Art of Hunting with Birds In the words of the historian Charles Homer Haskins br br It is a scientific book approaching the subject from Aristotle but based closely on observation and experiment throughout Divisivus et Inquisitivus in the words of the preface it is at the same time a scholastic book minute and almost mechanical in its divisions and subdivisions It is also a rigidly practical book written by a falconer for falconers and condensing a long experience into systematic form for the use of others br For this book he drew from sources in the Arabic language Frederick s pride in his mastery of the art is illustrated by the story that when he was ordered to become a subject of the Great Khan Batu and receive an office at the Khan s court he remarked that he would make a good falconer for he understood birds very well He maintained up to fifty falconers at a time in his court and in his letters he requested Arctic gyrfalcons from L beck and even from Greenland One of the two existing versions was modified by his son Manfred also a keen falconer br David Attenborough in Natural Curiosities notes that Frederick fully understood the migration of some birds at a time when all sorts of now improbable theories were common br Frederick loved exotic animals in general his menagerie with which he impressed the cold cities of Northern Italy and Europe included hounds giraffes cheetahs lynxes leopards exotic birds and an elephant br He was also alleged to have carried out a number of experiments on people These experiments were recorded by the monk Salimbene di Adam in his Chronicles Among the experiments were shutting a prisoner up in a cask to see if the soul could be observed escaping through a hole in the cask when the prisoner died feeding two prisoners having sent one out to hunt and the other to bed and then having them disemboweled to see which had digested his meal better imprisoning children and then denying them any human contact to see if they would develop a natural language br In the language deprivation experiment young infants were raised without human interaction in an attempt to determine if there was a natural language that they might demonstrate once their voices matured It is claimed he was seeking to discover what language would have been imparted unto Adam and Eve by God In his Chronicles Salimbene wrote that Frederick bade foster mothers and nurses to suckle and bathe and wash the children but in no ways to prattle or speak with them for he would have learnt whether they would speak the Hebrew language which had been the first or Greek or Latin or Arabic or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been born But he laboured in vain for the children could not live without clappings of the hands and gestures and gladness of countenance and blandishments br Frederick was also interested in the stars and his court was host to many astrologers and astronomers including Michael Scot and Guido Bonatti He often sent letters to the leading scholars of the time not only in Europe asking for solutions to questions of science mathematics and physics br In he founded the University of Naples the world s oldest state university now called Universit Federico II br br br Appearance br A Damascene chronicler Sibt ibn al Jawzi left a physical description of Frederick based on the testimony of those who had seen the emperor in person in Jerusalem The Emperor was covered with red hair was bald and myopic Had he been a slave he would not have fetched dirhams at market Frederick s eyes were described variously as blue or green like those of a serpent br br br Law reforms br His Edict of Salerno sometimes called Constitution of Salerno made the first legally fixed separation of the occupations of physician and apothecary Physicians were forbidden to double as pharmacists and the prices of various medicinal remedies were fixed This became a model for regulation of the practice of pharmacy throughout Europe br He was not able to extend his legal reforms beyond Sicily to the Empire In he was forced by the German princes to promulgate the Statutum in favorem principum statute in favor of princes It was a charter of liberties for the leading German princes at the expense of the lesser nobility and the entirety of the commoners The princes gained whole power of jurisdiction and the power to strike their own coins The emperor lost his right to establish new cities castles and mints over their territories The Statutum severely weakened central authority in Germany From the vassals of the emperor had a veto over imperial legislative decisions Every new law established by the emperor had to be approved by the princes br br br Significance and legacy br br Historians rate Frederick II as a highly significant European monarch of the Middle Ages This reputation was present even in Frederick s era Lansing and English two British historians argue that medieval Palermo has been overlooked in favor of Paris and London br br One effect of this approach has been to privilege historical winners and aspects of medieval Europe that became important in later centuries above all the nation state Arguably the liveliest cultural innovation in the th century was Mediterranean centered on Frederick II s polyglot court and administration in Palermo Sicily and the Italian South in later centuries suffered a long slide into overtaxed poverty and marginality Textbook narratives therefore focus not on medieval Palermo with its Muslim and Jewish bureaucracies and Arabic speaking monarch but on the historical winners Paris and London br Modern medievalists no longer accept the notion sponsored by the popes of Frederick as an anti Christian They argue that Frederick understood himself as a Christian monarch in the sense of a Byzantine emperor thus as God s viceroy on earth Whatever his personal feelings toward religion certainly submission to the pope did not enter into the matter in the slightest This was in line with the Hohenstaufen Kaiser Idee the ideology claiming the Holy Roman Emperor to be the legitimate successor to the Roman Emperors As his father Henry VI Frederick established a cosmopolitan court such as with the black treasury custodian Johannes Morus and depiction of the different peoples under their rule which persisted throughout the starting Late Middle Ages br century treatments of Frederick vary from the sober Wolfgang St rner to the dramatic Ernst Kantorowicz However all agree on Frederick II s significance as Holy Roman Emperor In the judgment of British historian Geoffrey Barraclough Frederick s extensive concessions to German princes which he made in the hopes of securing his base for his Italian projects undid the political power of his predecessors and postponed German unity for centuries The modern approach to Frederick II tends to be focused on the continuity between Frederick and his predecessors as Kings of Sicily and Holy Roman Emperors and the similarities between him and other thirteenth century monarchs David Abulafia in a biography subtitled A Medieval Emperor argues that Frederick s reputation as an enlightened figure ahead of his time is undeserved and that Frederick was mostly a conventionally Christian monarch who sought to rule in a conventional medieval manner br br br Family br Frederick left numerous
