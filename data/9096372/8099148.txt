The Paris Colonial Exhibition or Exposition coloniale internationale International Colonial Exhibition was a six month colonial exhibition held in Paris France in that attempted to display the diverse cultures and immense resources of France s colonial possessions br br br History br br The exposition opened on May in the Bois de Vincennes on the eastern outskirts of Paris The scale was enormous It is estimated that from to million visitors came from over the world The French government brought people from the colonies to Paris and had them create native arts and crafts and perform in grandly scaled reproductions of their native architectural styles such as huts or temples Other nations participated in the event including the Netherlands Belgium Italy with a pavilion designed by Armando Brasini Japan Portugal and the United States br Politically France hoped the exposition would paint its colonial empire in a beneficial light showing the mutual exchange of cultures and the benefit of France s efforts overseas This would thus negate German criticisms that France was the exploiter of colonial societies and the agent of miscegenation and decadence The exposition highlighted the endemic cultures of the colonies and downplayed French efforts to spread its own language and culture abroad thus advancing the notion that France was associating with colonised societies not assimilating them br The Colonial Exposition provided a forum for the discussion of colonialism in general and of French colonies specifically French authorities published over reports during the six month period and held over congresses The exposition served as a vehicle for colonial writers to publicise their works and it created a market in Paris for various ethnic cuisines particularly North African and Vietnamese Filmmakers chose French colonies as the subjects of their works The Permanent Colonial Museum today the Cit nationale de l histoire de l immigration opened at the end of the exposition The colonial service experienced a boost in applications br territories of the empire participated in the Colonial Exposition Issue of postage stamps issued in conjunction with the Exposition br br br The Dutch colonial pavilion fire incident br br As one of the important colonial powers at that time the Dutch Empire participated in the Exhibition The Netherlands presented a cultural synthesis from their colony the Dutch East Indies now Indonesia However on June a fire burnt down the Dutch pavilion along with all cultural objects displayed inside br Only a few artefacts could be salvaged including an ancient Javanese bronze Shiva statue which is now kept in the National Museum of Indonesia The cause of this massive fire was never identified and there was speculation at the time that it may have been caused by a short circuit by flammable building materials that were a fire hazard or by arsonist sabotage The material and cultural losses were estimated to be around almost million francs It was said that the French government paid the Netherlands Indies colonial government for its losses The money was then used for an expansion of the Bataviaasch Genootschap museum br br br Communist counter exhibition br At the request of the Communist International Comintern a smaller counter exhibition entitled The Truth About the Colonies organized by the Communist Party and the CGTU attracted very few visitors in months The first section was dedicated to abuses committed during the colonial conquests and quoted Albert Londres and Andr Gide s criticisms of forced labour in the colonies while the second one made a comparison of Soviet nationalities policy to imperialist colonialism br br br Posterity br Some of these buildings were preserved or moved br
