designed by sculptor Paul Manship in and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in br The zoo opened on November featuring animals in exhibits Its first director was William Temple Hornaday who served as director for years From its inception the zoo has played a vital role in animal conservation In the American Bison Society was created in an attempt to save the American bison which had been depleted from tens of millions of animals to only a few hundred from extinction Two years later they were successfully reintroduced into the wild In the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild The breeding was a milestone in the zoo s year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China br Today the Bronx Zoo is world renowned for its large and diverse animal collection and its award winning exhibitions The zoo is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society WCS and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA br br br History br br br Early years br br In a group made up largely of members of the Boone and Crockett Club founded the New York Zoological Society later renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society for the purposes of founding a zoo promoting the study of zoology and preserving wildlife Credit for this belonged chiefly to Club members Madison Grant and C Grant LaFarge br The zoo sometimes called the Bronx Zoological Park and the Bronx Zoological Gardens opened its doors to the public on November featuring animals in exhibits Its first director was William Temple Hornaday who had years of service at the zoo br Heins LaFarge designed the original permanent buildings known as Astor Court as a series of Beaux Arts pavilions grouped around the large circular sea lion pool In the Rainey Memorial Gates designed by sculptor Paul Manship were dedicated as a memorial to noted big game hunter Paul James Rainey The gates were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in br The Rockefeller Fountain which today adorns the gardens just inside the Fordham Road Gate was once a landmark in Como Italy Originally built by Biagio Catella in it stood in the main square Piazza Cavour by the lakeside Bought by William Rockefeller in for lire the estimated equivalent then of and today of around it was installed at the zoo in In the fountain was designated an official New York City landmark and is one of the few local monuments to be honored in this way br The New York Zoological Society s seal was designed by famed wildlife artist Charles R Knight It depicted a ram s head and an eagle to reflect the society s interest in preserving North American wildlife While no longer in use the seal can still be found on the lawn in the center of Astor Court br br On December the zoo became one of the seven zoos outside of Australia and one of only two in the United States to ever hold the now extinct thylacine The first was a male obtained from German animal dealer Carl Hagenbeck It died on August The zoo received a second male on January from the Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania who later died on November of that year The zoo received its final two animals from Sydney animal dealer Ellis S Joseph The first was an unsexed individual who arrived on November in poor condition and died seven days later The second and final animal was a female purchased from the Beaumaris Zoo by Joseph for and then was resold to the zoo arriving on July On a visit the director of the Melbourne Zoo Mr Le Souef said upon seeing the animal br br I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen for when it is gone you never will get another The species soon will be extinct br The thylacine died on September br In early the zoo was gifted a pair of Barbary lions a subspecies which is extinct in the wild The female was named Bedouin Maid and male Sultan who went on to become one of the zoo s most popular animals Displayed in the Lion House Sultan was four years old at the time and described as being both a perfect specimen and unusually good tempered In May the pair produced three cubs the first to be born at the zoo On October Charles R Knight painted a portrait of Sultan and the animal went on to be the focus of many of the zoo s postcards Sultan was also the model for the lion which sits atop the Rainey Memorial Gates br In the zoo built the world s first animal hospital located at a zoo br In the Bronx Zoo and the Smithsonian Institution s National Zoological Park simultaneously became the first in the country to exhibit shoebills br The same year W Douglas Burden F J Defosse and Emmett Reid Dunn collected two live adult Komodo dragons the first in America for the zoo br In the zoo became the first in North America to exhibit okapi br br br Recent years br br In the zoo became the first in the world to keep a James s flamingo a species which had been thought to be extinct until They were imported along with the similar Andean flamingo br The zoo was one of the few in the world to exhibit proboscis monkeys outside of Southeast Asia and in the International Zoo Yearbook the zoo reported having eight monkeys seven of which were born at the zoo As of March it only had two monkeys left these two being the last members of their species kept in the United States In the pair were sent to the Singapore Zoo br On June the zoo received a female Sumatran rhinoceros named Rapunzel At the time the zoo was one of only three in North America to hold the critically endangered species with the Cincinnati and San Diego Zoos being the others holding one female each The three institutions were a part of the Sumatran Rhino Trust s plan to start a captive breeding program for the species Rapunzel was born in the wild in Sumatra and rescued from an area of rainforest that was slated to be cleared for a palm oil plantation in Though it s believed she bred in the wild she never produced any calves in captivity It was eventually determined that she was past reproductive age at which point she was returned to the zoo in having been brought out for breeding purposes She lived in the Zoo Center until her death in December in her s br In November the zoo opened up brand new eco friendly restrooms outside the Bronx River Gate According to Clivus Multrum which built the composting toilets chosen by the zoo these facilities can serve people and save U S gal L of water a year br In March the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Fordham University Graduate School of Education announced they would offer a joint program leading to a Master of Science degree in education and New York State initial teacher certification in adolescent science education biology grades The program began the next year and is the first joint degree program of its kind br br In New York City cut funding for the state s zoos aquariums and botanical gardens The Wildlife Conservation Society as a whole suffered a million deficit and the zoo was forced to downsize its staff and animal collection The budget cuts forced the buyouts of over employees and layoffs of dozens more as well as the closure of four sections of the zoo World of Darkness Rare Animal Range the Skyfari and a small section of the overall still open African Plains exhibit which featured endangered antelope In the end staff positions were cut within the WCS In Mayor Michael Bloomberg passed another budget cut that took million from the funding of the zoo and the New York Aquarium also run by the WCS This cut represented more than half of what the collections were receiving However Bloomberg also passed an energy subsidy that brought the cuts down to million br In the summer of New York Representative Carolyn B Maloney visited the Chengdu Panda Base in Sichuan China and announced her plan to bring giant pandas to New York City Initially she aimed to exhibit them at the Central Park Zoo though switched her attention to the Bronx after deciding the acre zoo didn t have the resources to care for the animals Maloney and her supporters which included Maurice R Greenberg Newt Gingrich and John A Catsimatidis were met with many obstacles throughout their campaign Initially the largest issues were the lack of support from Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Hall and Chinese officials insisting that no more pandas be brought to the United States However in October Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai announced that his country was willing to enter preliminary talks with the city over the matter and soon after de Blasio and City Hall signed a letter appealing to Chinese officials drafted by Maloney in Despite her efforts Maloney s campaign still has yet to overcome two critical steps in acquiring pandas funding and the zoo s consent Both de Blasio and the Wildlife Conservation Society refuse to fund the project not wanting taxpayer or vital zoo money to go towards the highly expensive project David Towne chairman of the American based Giant Panda Conservation Foundation estimated that the cost of bringing pandas to the city would be around million br The foundation has also said that the cost of keeping just one such animal is about million a year including food trainers and habitat upkeep Additionally China loans out their pandas for a hefty fee A study published by The Washington Post in found that the four U S zoos holding pandas the Memphis Zoo the San Diego Zoo the National Zoological Park located in Washington D C and Front Royal Virginia and Zoo Atlanta had spent million more on their animals than revenue made off of them between and Despite the figures Maloney believes pandas in her city will do better since the city has a higher population than those four cities combined and received a record breaking million visitors in Still the WCS continues to steer away from bringing in these pandas In a senior official from the WCS said Maloney s campaign had reached a new level of absurdity when it was announced she intended to bring a Chinese delegation to the Central Park Zoo In November Jim Breheny WCS Executive Vice President and Bronx Zoo Director released a statement saying br br The concept of bringing Giant Pandas to New York which the Congresswoman is proposing is complex and would require that a number of complicated issues be considered and resolved before any such plan could be implemented br Any decision to bring giant pandas to New York would need to be based on positively contributing to the conservation of giant pandas in the wild and a determination that all the requirements necessary to keep the animals well in New York could be met br br Very importantly there is no funding for this initiative Building and maintenance of such a exhibit would be an ongoing effort that would require tens of millions of dollars up front and annual support monies for pandas for however long they would be in the city Any agreement to exhibit pandas would have to come with a guarantee of provision for the necessary funds br br br Exhibits and attractions br The zoo has two types of displays free exhibits accessible with a General Admission ticket and premium exhibits which require additional fees br br br Free exhibits and attractions br br As of the Bronx Zoo is home to more than animals of species many of which are endangered or

donation per adult senior participant The event offers free prizes for donors based on donation size ranging from a Run for the Wild T shirt to a special animal experience at the zoo All donations are tax deductible All participants are also offered free all day entry to the zoo and its paid exhibits attractions The yearly event takes place at the end of April and originally began at am for those wishing to actually run and for those who wish to simply walk or jog the start times were changed to am and am in later years br The event takes participants through the zoo before opening hours starting at the Bronx River Parkway Entrance through the Asian Plaza and African Plains and ending by the Rockefeller Fountain near Astor Court The trail also takes runners through the now closed section of the zoo where the Rare Animal Range once stood Each year the event focuses on a specific endangered species or animal group to help raise funds for s run was for gorillas focused on tigers helped raise funds to protect the Punta Tombo peninsula of Argentina for Magellanic penguins focused on lions both and focused on elephants once again was for gorillas and s run will allow participants to run on behalf of their favorite animal br In another WCS institute the New York Aquarium held its own Run for the Wild event for sea turtles in early October The k run began at the aquarium and led down the Riegelmann Boardwalk on Coney Island The aquarium held a second run the following year for walruses The event has not returned to the aquarium since br br br Conservation br In the zoo s first director William T Hornaday along with President Theodore Roosevelt and other conservationists created the American Bison Society ABS in an attempt to save the American bison from extinction The bison had been depleted from tens of millions of animals to only a few hundred by the end of the th century due to westward expansion The society worked to breed the species in captivity as well as raise public awareness raise money to create protected reserves and reintroduce bison back into the wild On October the first reintroduction of bison began when the zoo sent six males and nine females by rail to the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma Seven days later the animals were successfully reintroduced to the park By the society who had successfully carried out several more reintroductions from bison kept in zoos and ranches considered their work done and disbanded that year br In the Wildlife Conservation Society resurrected and re purposed the ABS to help build the social and scientific foundations for the ecological restoration of bison and restore bison ecologically not just animals in pens but actual functioning animals in the larger landscape Keith Aune WCS bison coordinator According to a study published in virtually all wild and captive bison in the United States are hybrids with cattle genes with the exception of the two distinct breeding populations within Yellowstone National Park and their descendants The cattle genes entered the bison population due to private ranchers hybridizing their bison to make them more docile with some of these animals being accidentally reintroduced by the ABS In response in the fall of the WCS arranged for a herd of female bison originating from the American Prairie Reserve to be sent to the Colorado State University s Animal Reproduction Biotechnology Laboratory to be used as surrogates in an attempt to transfer the fertilized embryos of genetically pure bison After an ultrasound showed one female to be pregnant the herd was moved to the zoo where on June the calf was born The herd is kept in an off exhibit section of the zoo and the goal is to eventually create a breeding herd of genetically pure bison through embryo transfers with the surrogate hybrid bison br In the zoo successfully implanted a gaur embryo into a Holstein cow in an attempt to clone the endangered species br In the zoo experienced a pest problem with the Canada goose The park had become so over crowded with the geese that the zoo had to take action to decrease their numbers Apart from their presence the geese were very aggressive towards other birds and occasionally carried diseases into the park To cope with the problem the zoo hired a sharpshooter who killed geese Zoo workers also destroyed eggs found on the property In the zoo employed a gentler method of sterilizing the birds br In the zoo sent the frozen sperm of a male Indian rhinoceros to the Cincinnati Zoo where four years later in it was thawed out and used in the first successful artificial insemination of the species when a calf was born in late The calf did not survive long term br In August the zoo adopted an orphaned snow leopard cub named Leo The month old cub was found stuck in mud following a landslide in Naltar Valley in Pakistan The landslide had killed the cub s mother A Pakistani shepherd in the area found the cub with its female sibling but the female had died a week later due to malnutrition He then handed over the male cub to Pakistani authorities to care for him Since there are no captive breeding programs or rehabilitation centers for snow leopards in Pakistan the authorities decided to send the cub to the Bronx Zoo The cat will be returned to its place of birth following construction of a rehab facility in the Naltar Valley with cooperation from the United States On April Leo sired a cub He was the first cub of Leo br In the zoo successfully reintroduced three Chinese alligators into the wild In July the zoo announced that the reintroduced alligators had begun breeding naturally in the wild producing hatchlings The breeding was a milestone in the zoo s year effort to reintroduce the species to the Yangtze River in China br In January the zoo adopted four abandoned brown bear cubs Three of the bears two males and one female were siblings born in and rescued from the ABC Islands in Alaska The cubs were named Kootz Denali and Sitka The fourth cub a grizzly bear born in was rescued from Glacier National Park in Montana and named Glacier after the park In two other rescued grizzly bears who had been at the zoo since were sent to one of the zoo s partner institutions the Central Park Zoo br The next month an assurance colony of Kihansi spray toads was placed in the zoo The species disappeared in their native Tanzania home br In February the zoo took in two bald eagles that were rescued in Wyoming The year old male was found in and was believed to have been hit by a car The year old female was believed to have been injured during a storm The birds were taken in by the U S Fish and Wildlife Service and sent to the Woodford Cedar Run Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey for evaluation and care where it was decided they were unable to survive in the wild br In December five Chinese yellow headed box turtles a critically endangered species were born br In December the zoo rescued a juvenile Indian cobra which had stowed away on a cargo ship destined for New Jersey The snake was found in poor condition being dehydrated cold and exposed to oil residue The animal was brought to the zoo for recovery It s unclear how the snake got onto the ship since it set out from Singapore which is outside of the species natural range br br br Incidents br br br Human fatality br On July two female Siberian tigers killed year old animal keeper Robin Silverman after she entered their enclosure with a volunteer aide It was unclear why Silverman entered the enclosure the zoo s general curator suspected a lapse in Silverman s concentration while her family suspected a failure on the part of the zoo It was the first and only human fatality in the zoo s history br br br Non human deaths br In the early s the zoo added a troop of Javan langurs to JungleWorld and mixed them with oriental small clawed otters The otters had previously mixed with other primate species in the enclosure without any problems However the new langurs made a habit of constantly bothering and attacking the otters In June a group of otters grabbed a langur that was sitting at the water s edge and proceeded to overpower then drown it in full view of visitors A keeper on the viewing deck attempted to break up the fight by whistling and yelling at the otters to no avail After killing the langur the otters left the body floating in the pool It was later removed by keepers Part of the incident was recorded and uploaded to YouTube br Soon after the incident the otters were removed from the enclosure and given their own in the Children s Zoo and elsewhere in JungleWorld br br br Animal escapes br In a seven month old male jaguar broke out of his cage and escaped br In July a platypus named Penelope who had recently made headlines for faking a pregnancy disappeared abandoning her mate Cecil Zookeepers searched the premises but found no evidence of her br In February the zoo s De Jur Aviary collapsed during a snowstorm with about seabirds including Inca terns and gulls inside During the collapse some of the residents flew off and escaped In total about birds were lost br On March the Bronx Zoo announced that World of Reptiles was closed after a venomous adolescent cobra was discovered missing from its off exhibit enclosure on March Zoo officials were confident the missing cobra would be found in the building and not outside since the species is known to be uncomfortable in open areas The missing snake quickly sparked a popular Twitter parody account BronxZoosCobra which narrated the daily hijinks of the cobra On March zoo authorities found the snake in a non public area of the reptile house br On May a female green peafowl escaped from the zoo before being caught on May br On September a lesser kudu escaped from its enclosure for about half an hour and then returned to its enclosure once a zoo worker opened the gate br On April an Indian peafowl given the nickname Raul escaped from the zoo and reportedly bit a man although those reports were never confirmed Raul flew back into the zoo at a m the next day br br br Happy the Elephant br br In the early s seven Indian elephants named after the Seven Dwarfs from Snow White were captured as calves in Thailand and dispersed among multiple U S zoos and circuses Two of those calves Grumpy and Happy both females were brought to the zoo in Over the next years the pair lived together separated from the zoo s other elephants In July the zoo attempted to mix the pair with two other females Patty and Maxine However the introduction failed when Patty and Maxine attacked the pair and injured Grumpy Over the next several months the elephant s injuries worsened and in October of that year the zoo was forced to euthanize her With her lifelong companion gone Happy was paired with the zoo s younger female Sammy whose companion Tus had also died in The two got along very well until Sammy developed severe liver disease and was also euthanized in early This left Patty Maxine and Happy as the zoo s only remaining elephants br Despite the fact that elephants are highly social animals the zoo decided that making a second attempt at introducing Happy to the others was too risky with there being too high a chance that she would be attacked She has since lived without the company of other elephants Due to this the zoo has been criticized by multiple animal rights organizations for supposedly mistreating Happy People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA filed a formal complaint against the zoo with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums AZA calling for them to strip the zoo of its accreditation In Defense of Animals IDA has named the zoo the Hall of Shame Winner on their and Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants IDA listed the zoo fourth on their list fifth on their and lists and eighth on their list The organizations as well as many online petitions some of which gain up to supporters have called on the zoo to send Happy to an elephant sanctuary However the zoo said that moving her at this stage in her life might be potentially traumatizing for her and that she has very strong bonds with her keepers and is well adjusted to the zoo where she has spent well over thirty years of her life br In a reporter for the New York Post wrote that she is kept inside all year and in solitary confinement The zoo claims that she and the other two elephants have equal access to outdoor yards and that the three elephants have limited interactions with each other and extensive interactions with zoo keepers All three animals share the same barn but Happy lives in separate stalls and yards In late one of the zoo s other elephants Maxine was euthanized due to complications with her liver and kidneys br A lawsuit against the Bronx Zoo stating that Happy was legally a person with a right to be free was dismissed in February by a judge of the Bronx County Supreme Court However in May the New York Court of Appeals agreed to hear the appeal filed on behalf of Happy by the Nonhuman Rights Project In June the Court of Appeals also ruled in favor of the zoo saying in a decision that the writ of habeas corpus did not apply to nonhuman animals br br br Ota Benga br br In Ota Benga a man from the Mbuti pygmy ethnic group was brought to the zoo by the American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner and displayed there as an exhibit though he was allowed to roam the grounds freely He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong the presiding genius of the Monkey House who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior The events leading to his exhibition alongside Dohong were gradual Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit where the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target On the first day of the exhibit September visitors found Benga in the Monkey House Soon a sign on the exhibit read br br The African Pigmy Ota Benga br Age years Height feet inches br Weight pounds Brought from the br Kasai River Congo Free State South br Central Africa by Dr Samuel P Verner br Exhibited each afternoon during September br br Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors he was supported by Madison Grant secretary of the New York Zoological Society who lobbied to put Benga on display alongside apes at the zoo A decade later Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist br African American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit James H Gordon said Our race we think is depressed enough without exhibiting one of us with the apes We think we are worthy of being considered human beings with souls Gordon also thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and a promotion of Darwinism The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted A number of clergymen backed Gordon In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human an editorial in The New York Times suggested br br We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering The pygmies are very low in the human scale and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place from which he could draw no advantage whatever The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date br Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo In response to the situation as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds he became more mischievous and somewhat violent Chapter on Ota Benga Around this time Rev Dr R MacArthur of Calvary Baptist Church was quoted in The New York Times saying It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people and then we bring one here to brutalize him Soon the zoo removed Benga from the grounds Benga died by suicide in at the age of In WCS apologized for the zoo s treatment of Benga and promotion
