id: 102566
John Nash January May was one of the foremost British architects of the Georgian and Regency eras during which he was responsible for the design in the neoclassical and picturesque styles of many important areas of London His designs were financed by the Prince Regent and by the era s most successful property developer James Burton Nash also collaborated extensively with Burton s son Decimus Burton br Nash s best known solo designs are the Royal Pavilion Brighton Marble Arch and Buckingham Palace His best known collaboration with James Burton is Regent Street and his best known collaborations with Decimus Burton are Regent s Park and its terraces and Carlton House Terrace The majority of his buildings including those that the Burtons did not contribute to were built by James Burton s company br br br Background and early career br Nash was born in probably in Lambeth south London His father was a millwright also called John From or Nash trained with the architect Sir Robert Taylor The apprenticeship was completed in or br br On April at the now demolished church of St Mary Newington Nash married his first wife Jane Elizabeth Kerr daughter of a surgeon Initially he seems to have pursued a career as a surveyor builder and carpenter This gave him an income of around a year in money The couple set up home at Royal Row Lambeth br He established his own architectural practice in as well as being in partnership with a timber merchant Richard Heaviside The couple had two children both were baptised at St Mary at Lambeth John on June and Hugh on April br In June Nash by the ill conduct of his wife found it necessary to send her into Wales in order to work a reformation on her The cause of this appears to have been the claim that Jane Nash had imposed two spurious children on him as his and her own notwithstanding she had then never had any child and she had contracted several debts unknown to her husband including one for milliners bills of The claim that Jane had faked her pregnancies and then passed babies she had acquired off as her own was brought before the Consistory court of the Bishop of London His wife was sent to Aberavon to lodge with Nash s cousin Ann Morgan but she developed a relationship with a local man Charles Charles In an attempt at reconciliation Jane returned to London in June but she continued to act extravagantly so he sent her to another cousin Thomas Edwards of Neath She gave birth just after Christmas and acknowledged Charles Charles as the father In Nash instigated action against Jane for separation on grounds of adultery The case was tried at Hereford in Charles who was found guilty was unable to pay the damages of in money and subsequently died in prison The divorce was finally read January br His career was initially unsuccessful and short lived After inheriting in money in from his uncle Thomas he invested the money in his first independent works Bloomsbury Square and Great Russell Street in Bloomsbury However the property failed to let and he was declared bankrupt on September His debts were in money including he had been lent by Robert Adam and his brothers A blue plaque commemorating Nash was placed on Great Russell Street by English Heritage in br br br Wales br br Nash left London in to live in Carmarthen to where his mother had retired her family being from the area In he and a local man Samuel Simon Saxon re roofed the town s church for guineas Nash and Saxon seem to have worked as building contractors and suppliers of building materials Nash s London buildings had been standard Georgian terraced houses and it was in Wales that he matured as an architect His first major work in the area was the first of three prisons he would design Carmarthen This was planned by the penal reformer John Howard and Nash developed this into the finished building He went on to design the prisons at Cardigan and Hereford It was at Hereford that Nash met Richard Payne Knight whose theories on the picturesque as applied to architecture and landscape would influence Nash The commission for Hereford Gaol came after the death of William Blackburn who was to have designed the building Nash s design was accepted after James Wyatt approved of the design br In St Davids Cathedral was suffering from structural problems the west front was leaning forward by one foot Nash was called in to survey the structure and develop a plan to save the building His solution completed in was to demolish the upper part of the fa ade and rebuild it with two large but inelegant flying buttresses In Nash met Uvedale Price of Downtown Castle whose theories of the Picturesque would influence Nash s town planning Price commissioned Nash to design Castle House Aberystwyth Its plan took the form of a right angled triangle with an octagonal tower at each corner sited on the very edge of the sea br One of Nash s most important developments were a series of medium sized country houses that he designed in Wales which developed the villa designs of his teacher Sir Robert Taylor Most of these villas consist of a roughly square plan with a small entrance hall and a staircase offset in the middle to one side around which are placed the main rooms There is then a less prominent servants quarters in a wing attached to one side of the villa The buildings are usually only two floors in height and the elevations of the main block are usually symmetrical One of the finest of these villas is Llanerchaeron but at least a dozen villas were designed throughout south Wales Others in Pembrokeshire include Ffynone built for the Colby family at Boncath near Manordeifi and Foley House built for the lawyer Richard Foley brother of Admiral Sir Thomas Foley at Goat Street in Haverfordwest br br From Nash spent most of his time working in London this was a prelude to his return to the capital in At this time Nash designed the delicate Gothic revival gateway to Clytha Park near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire and also his alterations in Gothic Revival style in to Hafod Uchtryd for Thomas Johnes at Devil s Bridge Cardiganshire Also in c he advised on the paving lighting and water supply in Abergavenny and designed an elegant market building Other work included Whitson Court near Newport After his return to London Nash continued to design houses in Wales including Harpton Court in Radnorshire which was demolished apart from the service wing in In he drew up plans for the re building of Hawarden Castle with Gothic battlements and towers but the plan appears to have been modified by another architect when it was carried out About he designed Monachty near Aberaeron and later drew up plans for work at Nanteos br He met Humphry Repton at Stoke Edith in and formed a successful partnership with the landscape garden designer One of their early commissions was at Corsham Court in The pair would collaborate to carefully place the Nash designed building in grounds designed by Repton The partnership ended in under recriminations Repton accusing Nash of exploiting their partnership to his own advantage As Nash developed his architectural practice it became necessary to employ draughtsmen the first in the early s was Augustus Charles Pugin and later in John Adey Repton son of Humphry br br br Return to London br br In June Nash moved into Dover Street a building of his own design He built a larger house next door at into which he moved the following year Nash married year old Mary Anne Bradley on December at St George s Hanover Square In he purchased a plot of land of acres ha at East Cowes on which he erected East Cowes Castle as his residence It was the first of a series of picturesque Gothic castles that he would design br Nash s final home in London was Regent Street which he designed and built Number was built at the same time for the home of Nash s cousin John Edwards a lawyer who handled all of Nash s legal affairs Located in lower Regent Street near Waterloo Place both houses formed a single design around an open courtyard Nash s drawing office was on the ground floor and on the first floor was the finest room in the house the foot long picture and sculpture gallery it linked the drawing room at the front of the building with the dining room at the rear The house was sold in and the gallery interior moved to East Cowes Castle br The finest of the dozen country houses that Nash designed as picturesque castles include the relatively small Luscombe Castle Devon Ravensworth Castle Tyne and Wear begun in but only finally completed in which was one of the largest houses by Nash Caerhays Castle in Cornwall and Shanbally Castle County Tipperary which was the last of these castles to be built These buildings all represented Nash s continuing development of an asymmetrical and picturesque architectural style that had begun during his years in Wales at both Castle House Aberystwyth and his alterations to Hafod Uchtryd br This process would be extended by Nash in planning groups of buildings the first example being Blaise Hamlet There a group of nine asymmetrical cottages was laid out around a village green Nikolaus Pevsner described the hamlet as the ne plus ultra of the Picturesque movement The hamlet has also been described as the first fully realized exemplar of the garden suburb Nash developed the asymmetry of his castles in his Italianate villas His first such exercise was Cronkhill and others included Sandridge Park and Southborough Place Surbiton br He advised on work to the buildings of Jesus College Oxford in for which he required no fee but asked that the college commission a portrait of him from Sir Thomas Lawrence to hang in the college hall br br br Architect to the Prince Regent br br Nash was a dedicated Whig and was a friend of Charles James Fox through whom Nash probably came to the attention of the Prince Regent later King George IV In Nash was appointed architect to the Surveyor General of Woods Forests Parks and Chases From Nash would take very few private commissions and for the rest of his career he would largely work for the Prince His employment by the Prince Regent enabled Nash to embark upon a number of grand architectural projects br His first major commissions in from the Prince were Regent Street and the development of an area then known as Marylebone Park With the Regent s backing Nash created a master plan for the area put into effect from onwards which stretched from St James s northwards and included Regent Street Regent s Park and its neighbouring streets terraces and crescents of elegant townhouses and villas Nash did not design all the buildings himself In some instances these were left in the hands of other architects such as James Pennethorne and the young Decimus Burton br Nash went on to re landscape St James s Park reshaping the formal canal into the present lake and giving the park its present form A characteristic of Nash s plan for Regent Street was that it followed an irregular path linking Portland Place to the north with Carlton House London replaced by Nash s Carlton House Terrace to the south At the northern end of Portland Place Nash designed Park Crescent London and this opens into Nash s Park Square London this only has terraces on the east and west the north opens into Regent s Park br The terraces that Nash designed around Regent s Park though conforming to the earlier form of appearing as a single building as developed by John Wood the Elder are unlike earlier examples set in gardens and are not orthogonal in their placing to each other This was part of Nash s development of planning this found it is a most extreme example when he set out Park Village East and Park Village West to the north east of Regent s Park here a mixture of detached villas semi detached houses both symmetrical and asymmetrical in their design are set out in private gardens railed off from the street the roads loop and the buildings are both classical and gothic in style No two buildings were the same and or even in line with their neighbours The park villages can be seen as the prototype for the Victorian suburbs br br Nash was employed by the Prince from to develop his Marine Pavilion in Brighton originally designed by Henry Holland By Nash had finished his work on the Marine Pavilion which was now transformed into the Royal Pavilion The exterior was based on Mughal architecture giving the building its exotic form the Chinoiserie style interiors are largely the work of Frederick Crace br Nash was also a director of the Regent s Canal Company set up in to provide a canal link from west London to the River Thames in the east Nash s master plan provided for the canal to run around the northern edge of Regent s Park as with other projects he left its execution to one of his assistants in this case James Morgan The first phase of the Regent s Canal was completed in and finally completed in br Together with Robert Smirke and Sir John Soane he became an official architect to the Office of Works in although the appointment ended in at a salary of per annum in money Following the death in September of that year of James Wyatt this marked the high point in his professional life As part of Nash s new position he was invited to advise the Parliamentary Commissioners on the building of new churches from onwards Nash produced ten church designs each estimated to cost around million in money with seating for people the style of the buildings were both classical and gothic In the end Nash only built two churches for the Commission the classical All Souls Church Langham Place terminating the northern end of Regent Street and the gothic St Mary s Haggerston bombed during The Blitz in br br Nash was involved in the design of two of London s theatres both in Haymarket The King s Opera House now rebuilt as Her Majesty s Theatre where he and George Repton remodelled the theatre with arcades and shops around three sides of the building the fourth being the still surviving Royal Opera Arcade The other theatre was the Theatre Royal Haymarket with its fine hexastyle Corinthian order portico which still survives facing down Charles II Street to St James s Square Nash s interior no longer survives the interior now dates from br In a scandal broke when a cartoon was published showing a half dressed King George IV embracing Nash s wife with a speech bubble coming from the King s mouth containing the words I have great pleasure in visiting this part of my dominions Whether this was based on just a rumour put about by people who resented Nash s success or if there is substance behind is not known Further London commissions for Nash followed including the remodelling of Buckingham House to create Buckingham Palace br and for the Royal Mews and Marble Arch The arch was originally designed as a triumphal arch to stand at the entrance to Buckingham Palace It was moved when the east wing of the palace designed by Edward Blore was built at the request of Queen Victoria whose growing family required additional domestic space Marble Arch became the entrance to Hyde Park and the Great Exhibition br br br Work with James and Decimus Burton br br The parents of John Nash and Nash himself during his childhood lived in Southwark where James Burton worked as an Architect and Builder and developed a positive reputation for prescient speculative building between and Burton built the Blackfriars Rotunda in Great Surrey Street now Blackfriars Road to house the Leverian Museum for land agent and museum proprietor James Parkinson However whereas Burton was vigorously industrious and quickly became most gratifyingly rich Nash s early years in private practice and his first speculative developments which failed either to sell or let were unsuccessful and his consequent financial shortage was exacerbated by the crazily extravagant wife whom he had married before he had completed his training until he was declared bankrupt in br To repair his finances Nash cultivated the acquaintance of James Burton who consented to patronize him James Burton responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of Nash s London designs in addition to for their construction Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style John Nash needed the son s aid as well as the father s br Subsequent to the Crown Estate s refusal to finance them James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of Nash at Regent s Park which he had already been commissioned to construct Consequently in Burton purchased many of the leases of the proposed terraces around and proposed villas within Regent s Park and in Burton purchased the leases of five of the largest blocks on Regent Street The first property to be constructed in or around Regent s Park by Burton was his own mansion The Holme which was designed by his son Decimus Burton and completed in Burton s extensive financial involvement effectively guaranteed the success of the project In return Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton br br Nash was a vehement advocate of the neoclassical revival endorsed by John Soane although he had lost interest in the plain stone edifices typical of the Georgian style and instead advocated the use of stucco Decimus Burton entered the office of Nash in where he worked alongside Augustus Charles Pugin who detested the neoclassical style Burton established his own architectural practice in In Nash invited Decimus Burton to design Cornwall Terrace in Regent s Park and he was also invited by George Bellas Greenough a close friend of the Prince Regent Humphry Davy and Nash to design Grove House in Regent s Park br Greenough s invitation to Decimus Burton was virtually a family affair for Greenough had dined frequently with Decimus parents and brothers including the physician Henry Burton Greenough and Decimus finalized their designs during numerous meetings at the opera The design when the villa had been completed was described in The Proceedings of the Royal Society as one of the most elegant and successful adaptations of the Grecian style to purposes of modern domestic architecture to be found in this or any country br Subsequently Nash invited Decimus to design Clarence Terrace Regent s Park Such were Decimus Burton s contributions to the Regent s Park project that the Commissioners of Woods described Burton not Nash as the architect of Regent s Park Contrary to popular belief the dominant architectural influence in many of the Regent s Park projects including Cornwall Terrace York Terrace Chester Terrace Clarence Terrace and the villas of the Inner Circle including The Holme and the London Colosseum attraction the latter to Thomas Hornor s specifications all of which were constructed by James Burton s company was Decimus Burton not John Nash who was appointed architectural overseer for Burton Jr s projects br Decimus Burton to Nash s chagrin developed the Terraces according to his own style to the extent that Nash sought unsuccessfully to demolish and completely rebuild Chester Terrace Decimus subsequently eclipsed his master and emerged as the dominant force in the design of Carlton House Terrace where he exclusively designed No and No He also designed some of the villas of the Inner Circle his villa for the Marquess of Hertford has been described as decorated simplicity such as the hand of taste aided by the purse of wealth can alone execute br br br Retirement and death br Nash s career effectively ended with the death of George IV in The King s notorious extravagance had generated much resentment and Nash was now without a protector The Treasury started to look closely at the cost of Buckingham Palace Nash s original estimate of the building s cost had been but this had risen to in the actual cost was million in money and the building was still unfinished This controversy ensured that Nash would not receive any more official commissions nor would he be awarded the knighthood that other contemporary architects such as Jeffry Wyattville John Soane and Robert Smirke received Nash retired to the Isle of Wight to his home East Cowes Castle br br On March Nash was described as very poorly and faint This was the beginning of the end On May Nash s solicitor John Wittet Lyon was summonsed to East Cowes Castle to finalise his will By May he was described as very ill indeed all day he died at his home on May His funeral took place at St James s Church East Cowes on May where he was buried in the churchyard with a monument in the form of a stone sarcophagus His widow acted to clear Nash s debts some million in money she held a sale of the Castle s contents including three paintings by J M W Turner painted on the Isle of Wight four by Benjamin West and several copies of old master paintings by Richard Evans These artworks were sold at Christie s on July for in money His books medals drawings and engravings were bought by a bookseller named Evans for on July in money The Castle itself was sold for a reported figure of million in money to Henry Boyle rd Earl of Shannon within the year Nash s widow retired to a property Nash had bequeathed to her in Hampstead where she lived until her death in she was buried with her husband on the Isle of Wight br br br Assistants and pupils br Nash had many pupils and assistants including Decimus Burton Humphry Repton s sons John Adey Repton and George
