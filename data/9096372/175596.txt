id: 175596
Animal testing also known as animal experimentation animal research and in vivo testing is the use of non human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables that affect the behavior or biological system under study This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments or habitats Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities medical schools pharmaceutical companies defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal testing services to the industry The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism to applied research which may focus on answering some questions of great practical importance such as finding a cure for a disease Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments breeding defense research and toxicology including cosmetics testing In education animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries br It was estimated in that the annual use of vertebrate animals from zebrafish to non human primates ranges from tens to over million In the European Union vertebrate species represent of animals used in research and million animals were used there in By one estimate the number of mice and rats used in the United States alone in was million In it was reported that mammals mice and rats fish amphibians and reptiles together accounted for over of research animals In a law was passed in the United States that eliminated the FDA requirement that all drugs be tested on animals br Animal testing is regulated differently in different countries in some cases it is strictly controlled while others have more relaxed regulations There are ongoing debates about the ethics and necessity of animal testing Proponents argue that it has led to significant advancements in medicine and other fields while opponents raise concerns about cruelty towards animals and question its effectiveness br There are efforts underway to find alternatives to animal testing such as computer simulation models organs on chips technology that mimics human organs for lab tests microdosing techniques which involve administering small doses of test compounds to volunteers instead of animals for safety tests or drug screenings positron emission tomography PET scans which allow scanning of the human brain without harming humans comparative epidemiological studies among human populations simulators and computer programs for teaching purposes among others br Animal testing can be inaccurate because experiments on animals do not always correctly mimic human body responses br br br Definitions br The terms animal testing animal experimentation animal research in vivo testing and vivisection have similar denotations but different connotations Literally vivisection means live sectioning of an animal and historically referred only to experiments that involved the dissection of live animals The term is occasionally used to refer pejoratively to any experiment using living animals for example the Encyclop dia Britannica defines vivisection as Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes more broadly all experimentation on live animals although dictionaries point out that the broader definition is used only by people who are opposed to such work The word has a negative connotation implying torture suffering and death The word vivisection is preferred by those opposed to this research whereas scientists typically use the term animal experimentation br The following text excludes as much as possible practices related to in vivo veterinary surgery which is left to the discussion of vivisection br br br History br br The earliest references to animal testing are found in the writings of the Greeks in the nd and th centuries BCE Aristotle and Erasistratus were among the first to perform experiments on living animals Galen a nd century Roman physician performed post mortem dissections of pigs and goats Avenzoar a th century Arabic physician in Moorish Spain introduced an experimental method of testing surgical procedures before applying them to human patients br Animals have repeatedly been used throughout the history of biomedical research In the founders of the Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession who were interested in studying animals while they were alive and when they were dead In the s Louis Pasteur convincingly showed the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep In the s Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis In the s Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning In World War I German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine glanders disease Between and the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces resulting in the death of mules Insulin was first isolated from dogs in and later revolutionized the treatment of diabetes On November a Soviet dog Laika became the first of many animals to orbit the Earth In the s antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos then given to humans The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took an enormous step forward in when Rudolf Jaenisch could produce the first transgenic mammal by integrating DNA from simians into the genome of mice This genetic research progressed rapidly and in Dolly the sheep was born the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell br Toxicology testing became important in the th century In the th century laws regulating drugs were more relaxed For example in the US the government could only ban a drug after they had prosecuted a company for selling products that harmed customers However in response to the Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of in which the eponymous drug killed over users the US Congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed Other countries enacted similar legislation In the s in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold br br br Historical debate br br As the experimentation on animals increased especially the practice of vivisection so did criticism and controversy In the advocate of Galenic physiology Edmund O Meara said that the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state O Meara and others argued pain could affect animal physiology during vivisection rendering results unreliable There were also objections ethically contending that the benefit to humans did not justify the harm to animals Early objections to animal testing also came from another angle many people believed animals were inferior to humans and so different that results from animals could not be applied to humans br On the other side of the debate those in favor of animal testing held that experiments on animals were necessary to advance medical and biological knowledge Claude Bernard who is sometimes known as the prince of vivisectors and the father of physiology and whose wife Marie Fran oise Martin founded the first anti vivisection society in France in famously wrote in that the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen Arguing that experiments on animals are entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of man T he effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals save for differences in degree Bernard established animal experimentation as part of the standard scientific method br In the physiologist and physician Dr Walter B Cannon said The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said Common sense without conscience may lead to crime but conscience without common sense may lead to folly which is the handmaiden of crime These divisions between pro and anti animal testing groups first came to public attention during the Brown Dog affair in the early s when hundreds of medical students clashed with anti vivisectionists and police over a memorial to a vivisected dog br br In the first animal protection law was enacted in the British parliament followed by the Cruelty to Animals Act the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin who wrote to Ray Lankester in March You ask about my opinion on vivisection I quite agree that it is justifiable for proper investigations on physiology but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity It is a subject which makes me sick with horror so I will not say another word about it else I shall not sleep to night In response to the lobbying by anti vivisectionists several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research The Physiological Society was formed in to give physiologists mutual benefit and protection the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in and focused on policy making and the Research Defence Society now Understanding Animal Research was formed in to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them br Opposition to the use of animals in medical research first arose in the United States during the s when Henry Bergh founded the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ASPCA with America s first specifically anti vivisection organization being the American AntiVivisection Society AAVS founded in Antivivisectionists of the era generally believed the spread of mercy was the great cause of civilization and vivisection was cruel However in the USA the antivivisectionists efforts were defeated in every legislature overwhelmed by the superior organization and influence of the medical community Overall this movement had little legislative success until the passing of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act in br Real progress in thinking about animal rights build on the theory of justice by the philosopher John Rawls and work on ethics by philosopher Peter Singer br br br Care and use of animals br br br Regulations and laws br br The regulations that apply to animals in laboratories vary across species In the U S under the Animal Welfare Act and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals the Guide published by the National Academy of Sciences any procedure can be performed on an animal if it can be successfully argued that it is scientifically justified Researchers are required to consult with the institution s veterinarian and its Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC which every research facility is obliged to maintain The IACUC must ensure that alternatives including non animal alternatives have been considered that the experiments are not unnecessarily duplicative and that pain relief is given unless it would interfere with the study The IACUCs regulate all vertebrates in testing at institutions receiving federal funds in the USA Although the Animal Welfare Act does not include purpose bred rodents and birds these species are equally regulated under Public Health Service policies that govern the IACUCs The Public Health Service policy oversees the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC The CDC conducts infectious disease research on nonhuman primates rabbits mice and other animals while FDA requirements cover use of animals in pharmaceutical research Animal Welfare Act AWA regulations are enforced by the USDA whereas Public Health Service regulations are enforced by OLAW and in many cases by AAALAC br According to the U S Department of Agriculture Office of the Inspector General OIG report which looked at the oversight of animal use during a three year period some Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees did not adequately approve monitor or report on experimental procedures on animals The OIG found that as a result animals are not always receiving basic humane care and treatment and in some cases pain and distress are not minimized during and after experimental procedures According to the report within a three year period nearly half of all American laboratories with regulated species were cited for AWA violations relating to improper IACUC oversight The USDA OIG made similar findings in a report With only a broad number of inspectors the United States Department of Agriculture USDA oversees more than facilities involved in research exhibition breeding or dealing of animals Others have criticized the composition of IACUCs asserting that the committees are predominantly made up of animal researchers and university representatives who may be biased against animal welfare concerns br Larry Carbone a laboratory animal veterinarian writes that in his experience IACUCs take their work very seriously regardless of the species involved though the use of non human primates always raises what he calls a red flag of special concern A study published in Science magazine in July confirmed the low reliability of IACUC reviews of animal experiments Funded by the National Science Foundation the three year study found that animal use committees that do not know the specifics of the university and personnel do not make the same approval decisions as those made by animal use committees that do know the university and personnel Specifically blinded committees more often ask for more information rather than approving studies br Scientists in India are protesting a recent guideline issued by the University Grants Commission to ban the use of live animals in universities and laboratories br br br Numbers br Accurate global figures for animal testing are difficult to obtain it has been estimated that million vertebrates are experimented on around the world every year million of them in the EU The Nuffield Council on Bioethics reports that global annual estimates range from to million animals None of the figures include invertebrates such as shrimp and fruit flies br The USDA APHIS has published the animal research statistics Overall the number of animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act used in research in the US rose from to This includes both public and private institutions By comparing with EU data where all vertebrate species are counted Speaking of Research estimated that around million vertebrates were used in research in the US in A article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies br In researchers at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that million animals were used in American laboratories in a reduction from a high of million used in In the U S Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U S range from million to upwards of million each year and that their own best estimate was at least million to million In the Department of Agriculture listed dogs cats non human primates guinea pigs hamsters rabbits farm animals and other mammals a total of a figure that includes all mammals except purpose bred mice and rats The use of dogs and cats in research in the U S decreased from to from to and from to respectively br In the UK Home Office figures show that million procedures were carried out in procedures used non human primates down over since A procedure refers here to an experiment that might last minutes several months or years Most animals are used in only one procedure animals are frequently euthanized after the experiment however death is the endpoint of some procedures br The procedures conducted on animals in the UK in were categorised as br br million were assessed as sub threshold br million were assessed as non recovery br million were assessed as mild br million were assessed as moderate br million were assessed as severe br A severe procedure would be for instance any test where death is the end point or fatalities are expected whereas a mild procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan br br br The Three Rs br br The Three Rs Rs are guiding principles for more ethical use of animals in testing These were first described by W M S Russell and R L Burch in The Rs state br br Replacement which refers to the preferred use of non animal methods over animal methods whenever it is possible to achieve the same scientific aims These methods include computer modeling br Reduction which refers to methods that enable researchers to obtain comparable levels of information from fewer animals or to obtain more information from the same number of animals br Refinement which refers to methods that alleviate or minimize potential pain suffering or distress and enhance animal welfare for the animals used These methods include non invasive techniques br The Rs have a broader scope than simply encouraging alternatives to animal testing but aim to improve animal welfare and scientific quality where the use of animals can not be avoided These Rs are now implemented in many testing establishments worldwide and have been adopted by various pieces of legislation and regulations br Despite the widespread acceptance of the Rs many countries including Canada Australia Israel South Korea and Germany have reported rising experimental use of animals in recent years with increased use of mice and in some cases fish while reporting declines in the use of cats dogs primates rabbits guinea pigs and hamsters Along with other countries China has also escalated its use of GM animals resulting in an increase in overall animal use br br br Invertebrates br br Although many more invertebrates than vertebrates are used in animal testing these studies are largely unregulated by law The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster a fruit fly and Caenorhabditis elegans a nematode worm In the case of C elegans the worm s body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism s cells is known while studies in the fly D melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing including their short life cycle and the ease with which large numbers may be housed and studied However the lack of an adaptive immune system and their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development Similarly the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates however fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds br Several invertebrate systems are considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early stage discovery screens Because of similarities between the innate immune system of insects and mammals insects can replace mammals in some types of studies Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput br br br Vertebrates br br In the U S the numbers of rats and mice used is estimated to be from million to between and million a year Other rodents commonly used are guinea pigs hamsters and gerbils Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species because of their size low cost ease of handling and fast reproduction rate Mice are widely considered to be the best model of inherited human disease and share of their genes with humans With the advent of genetic engineering technology genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can provide models for a range of human diseases Rats are also widely used for physiology toxicology and cancer research but genetic manipulation is much harder in rats than in mice which limits the use of these rodents in basic science br Over fish and amphibians were used in the UK in The main species used is the zebrafish Danio rerio which are translucent during their embryonic stage and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis Over rabbits were used for animal testing in the UK in Albino rabbits are used in eye irritancy tests Draize test because rabbits have less tear flow than other animals and the lack of eye pigment in albinos make the effects easier to visualize The numbers of rabbits used for this purpose has fallen substantially over the past two decades In there were procedures on rabbits for eye irritation in the UK and in this number was just Rabbits are also frequently used for the production of polyclonal antibodies br br br Cats br Cats are most commonly used in neurological research In cats were used in the United States alone around a third of which were used in experiments which have the potential to cause pain and or distress though only of cat experiments involved potential pain which was not relieved by anesthetics analgesics In the UK just procedures were carried out on cats in The number has been around for most of the last decade br br br Dogs br br Dogs are widely used in biomedical research testing and education particularly beagles because they are gentle and easy to handle and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles a Reduction technique They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology endocrinology and bone and joint studies research that tends to be highly invasive according to the Humane Society of the United States The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents in accordance with the regulations set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use One of the most significant advancements in medical science involves the use of dogs in developing the answers to insulin production in the body for diabetics and the role of the pancreas in this process They found that the pancreas was responsible for producing insulin in the body and that removal of the pancreas resulted in the development of diabetes in the dog After re injecting the pancreatic extract insulin the blood glucose levels were significantly lowered The advancements made in this research involving the use of dogs has resulted in a definite improvement in the quality of life for both humans and animals br The U S Department of Agriculture s Animal Welfare Report shows that dogs were used in USDA registered facilities in In the UK according to the UK Home Office there were procedures on dogs in Of the other large EU users of dogs Germany conducted procedures on dogs in and France conducted procedures in In both cases this represents under of the total number of procedures conducted on animals in the respective countries br br br Zebrafish br Zebrafish are commonly used for the basic study and development of various cancers Used to explore the immune system and genetic strains They are low in cost small size fast reproduction rate and able to observe cancer cells in real time Humans and zebrafish share neoplasm similarities which is why they are used for research The National Library of Medicine shows many examples of the types of cancer zebrafish are used in The use of zebrafish have allowed them to find differences between MYC driven pre B vs T ALL and be exploited to discover novel pre B ALL therapies on acute lymphocytic leukemia br The National Library of Medicine also explains how a neoplasm is difficult to diagnose at an early stage Understanding the molecular mechanism of digestive tract tumorigenesis and searching for new treatments is the current research Zebrafish and humans share similar gastric cancer cells in the gastric cancer xenotransplantation model This allowed researchers to find that Triphala could inhibit the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer cells Since zebrafish liver cancer genes are related with humans they have become widely used in liver cancer search as will as many other cancers br br br Non human primates br br Non human primates NHPs are used in toxicology tests studies of AIDS and hepatitis studies of neurology behavior and cognition reproduction genetics and xenotransplantation They are caught in the wild or purpose bred In the United States and China most primates are domestically purpose bred whereas in Europe the majority are imported purpose bred The European Commission reported that in monkeys were experimented on in European laboratories According to the U S Department of Agriculture there were monkeys in U S laboratories in monkeys were imported into the U S in including who were caught in the wild Most of the NHPs used in experiments are macaques but marmosets spider monkeys and squirrel monkeys are also used and baboons and chimpanzees are used in the US As of there are approximately chimpanzees in U S laboratories br In a survey in it was found that of singly housed primates exhibited self injurious or abnormal stereotypyical behaviors including pacing rocking hair pulling and biting among others br The first transgenic primate was produced in with the development of a method that could introduce new genes into a rhesus macaque This transgenic technology is now being applied in the search for a treatment for the genetic disorder Huntington s disease Notable studies on non human primates have been part of the polio vaccine development and development of Deep Brain Stimulation and their current heaviest non toxicological use occurs in the monkey AIDS model SIV In a proposal to ban all primates experiments in the EU has sparked a vigorous debate br br br Sources br br Animals used by laboratories are largely supplied by specialist dealers Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves using strains and mutants supplied from a few main stock centers For vertebrates sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose bred and wild caught animals businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds auctions and newspaper ads Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals the International Knockout Mouse Consortium for example aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome br br In the U S Class A breeders are licensed by the U S Department of Agriculture USDA to sell animals for research purposes while Class B dealers are licensed to buy animals from random sources such as auctions pound seizure and newspaper ads Some Class B dealers have been accused of kidnapping pets and illegally trapping strays a practice known as bunching It was in part out of public concern over the sale of pets to research facilities that the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act was ushered in the Senate Committee on Commerce reported in that stolen pets had been retrieved from Veterans Administration facilities the Mayo Institute the University of Pennsylvania Stanford University and Harvard and Yale Medical Schools The USDA recovered at least a dozen stolen pets during a raid on a Class B dealer in Arkansas in br Four states in the U S Minnesota Utah Oklahoma and Iowa require their shelters to provide animals to research facilities Fourteen states explicitly prohibit the practice while the remainder either allow it or have no relevant legislation br In the European Union animal sources are governed by Council Directive EEC which requires lab animals to be specially bred unless the animal has been lawfully imported and is not a wild animal or a stray The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement In the Directive was revised with EU Directive EU In the UK most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the Animal Protection Act but wild caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established The United States also allows the use of wild caught primates between and wild baboons were imported into the U S Over half the primates imported between and were handled by Charles River Laboratories or by Covance which is the single largest importer of primates into the U S br br br Pain and suffering br br The extent to which animal testing causes pain and suffering and the capacity of animals to experience and comprehend them is the subject of much debate br According to the USDA in animals not including rats mice birds or invertebrates were used in procedures that did not include more than momentary pain or distress animals were used in procedures in which pain or distress was relieved by anesthesia while were used in studies that would cause pain or distress that would not be relieved br Since in the UK every research procedure was retrospectively assessed for severity The five categories are sub threshold mild moderate severe and non recovery the latter being procedures in which an animal is anesthetized and subsequently killed without recovering consciousness In million were assessed as sub threshold million were assessed as non recovery million were assessed as mild million were assessed as moderate and million were assessed as severe br The idea that animals might not feel pain as human beings feel it traces back to the th century French philosopher Ren Descartes who argued that animals do not experience pain and suffering because they lack consciousness Bernard Rollin of Colorado State University the principal author of two U S federal laws regulating pain relief for animals writes that researchers remained unsure into the s as to whether animals experience pain and that veterinarians trained in the U S before were simply taught to ignore animal pain In his interactions with scientists and other veterinarians he was regularly asked to prove that animals are conscious and to provide scientifically acceptable grounds for claiming that they feel pain Carbone writes that the view that animals feel pain differently is now a minority view Academic reviews of the topic are more equivocal noting that although the argument that animals have at least simple conscious thoughts and feelings has strong support some critics continue to question how reliably animal mental states can be determined However some canine experts are stating that while intelligence does differ animal to animal dogs have the intelligence of a two to two and a half year old This does support the idea that dogs at the very least have some form of consciousness The ability of invertebrates to experience pain and suffering is less clear however legislation in several countries e g U K New Zealand Norway protects some invertebrate species if they are being used in animal testing br In the U S the defining text on animal welfare regulation in animal testing is the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals This defines the parameters that govern animal testing in the U S It states The ability to experience and respond to pain is widespread in the animal kingdom Pain is a stressor and if not relieved can lead to unacceptable levels of stress and distress in animals The Guide states that the ability to recognize the symptoms of pain in different species is vital in efficiently applying pain relief and that it is essential for the people caring for and using animals to be entirely familiar with these symptoms On the subject of analgesics used to relieve pain the Guide states The selection of the most appropriate analgesic or anesthetic should reflect professional judgment as to which best meets clinical and humane requirements without compromising the scientific aspects of the research protocol Accordingly all issues of animal pain and distress and their potential treatment with analgesia and anesthesia are required regulatory issues in receiving animal protocol approval Currently traumatic methods of marking laboratory animals are being replaced with non invasive alternatives br In Katrien Devolder and Matthias Eggel proposed gene editing research animals to remove the ability to feel pain This would be an intermediate step towards eventually stopping all experimentation on animals and adopting alternatives Additionally this would not stop research animals from experiencing psychological harm br br br Euthanasia br br Regulations require that scientists use as few animals as possible especially for terminal experiments However while policy makers consider suffering to be the central issue and see animal euthanasia as a way to reduce suffering others such as the RSPCA argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering not whether their death is undesirable in itself The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post mortem examination during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable such as depression infection that is unresponsive to treatment or the failure of large animals to eat for five days or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason br Methods of euthanizing laboratory animals are chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians The animal can be made to inhale a gas such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide by being placed in a chamber or by use of a face mask with or without prior sedation or anesthesia Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously or inhalant anesthetics may be used Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine Physical methods are also used with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method Recommended methods include decapitation beheading for small rodents or rabbits Cervical dislocation breaking the neck or spine may be used for birds mice rats and rabbits depending on the size and weight of the animal High intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than second but this is currently only used on rodents Captive bolts may be used typically on dogs ruminants horses pigs and rabbits It causes death by a concussion to the brain Gunshot may be used but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious Electrocution may be used for cattle sheep swine foxes and mink after the animals are unconscious often by a prior electrical stun Pithing inserting a tool into the base of the brain is usable on animals already unconscious Slow or rapid freezing or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness br br br Research classification br br br Pure research br Basic or pure research investigates how organisms behave develop and function Those opposed to animal testing object that pure research may have little or no practical purpose but researchers argue that it forms the necessary basis for the development of applied research rendering the distinction between pure and applied research research that has a specific practical aim unclear Pure research uses larger numbers and a greater variety of animals than applied research Fruit flies nematode worms mice and rats together account for the vast majority though small numbers of other species are used ranging from sea slugs through to armadillos Examples of the types of animals and experiments used in basic research include br br Studies on embryogenesis and developmental biology Mutants are created by adding transposons into their genomes or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting By studying the changes in development these changes produce scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop and what can go wrong in this process These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development such as the homeobox genes have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man br Experiments into behavior to understand how organisms detect and interact with each other and their environment in which fruit flies worms mice and rats are all widely used Studies of brain function such as memory and social behavior often use rats and birds For some species behavioral research is combined with enrichment strategies for animals in captivity because it allows them to engage in a wider range of activities br Breeding experiments to study evolution and genetics Laboratory mice flies fish and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics These provide animals of a known genetic background an important tool for genetic analyses Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals such as dog or cattle breeds for comparative purposes Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives their niche produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology As an example sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals morphology during the evolution of new species br br br Applied research br Applied research aims to solve specific and practical problems These may involve the use of animal models of diseases or conditions which are often discovered or generated by pure research programmes In turn such applied studies may be an early stage in the drug discovery process Examples include br br Genetic modification of animals to study disease Transgenic animals have specific genes inserted modified or removed to mimic specific conditions such as single gene disorders such as Huntington s disease Other models mimic complex multifactorial diseases with genetic components such as diabetes or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer These models allow investigations on how and why the disease develops as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient Smaller numbers of other animals are also used including rats pigs sheep fish birds and amphibians br Studies on models of naturally occurring disease and condition Certain domestic and wild animals have a natural propensity or predisposition for certain conditions that are also found in humans Cats are used as a model to develop immunodeficiency virus vaccines and to study leukemia because their natural predisposition to FIV and Feline leukemia virus Certain breeds of dog experience narcolepsy making them the major model used to study the human condition Armadillos and humans are among only a few animal species that naturally have leprosy as the bacteria responsible for this disease cannot yet be grown in culture armadillos are the primary source of bacilli used in leprosy vaccines br Studies on induced animal models of human diseases Here an animal is treated so that it develops pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease Examples include restricting blood flow to the brain to induce stroke or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson s disease Much animal research into potential treatments for humans is wasted because it is poorly conducted and not evaluated through systematic reviews For example although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson s disease the British anti vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms without the same time course or cellular pathology In contrast scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson s disease as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson s Appeal state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy new drug treatments such as levodopa and later deep brain stimulation br Animal testing has also included the use of placebo testing In these cases animals are treated with a substance that produces no pharmacological effect but is administered in order to determine any biological alterations due to the experience of a substance being administered and the results are compared with those obtained with an active compound br br br Xenotransplantation br br Xenotransplantation research involves transplanting tissues or organs from one species to another as a way to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates immune response against the pig tissue Although transplant rejection remains a problem recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people s need for insulin br Documents released to the news media by the animal rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that between and wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd a subsidiary of Novartis Pharma AG in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences to be used in experiments that involved grafting pig tissues had serious and sometimes fatal injuries A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation br br br Toxicology testing br br Toxicology testing also known as safety testing is conducted by pharmaceutical companies testing drugs or by contract animal testing facilities such as Huntingdon Life Sciences on behalf of a wide variety of customers According to EU figures around one million animals are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests which are about of all procedures According to Nature animals are used for each chemical being tested with needed to test pesticides The tests are conducted without anesthesia because interactions between drugs can affect how animals detoxify chemicals and may interfere with the results br Toxicology tests are used to examine finished products such as pesticides medications food additives packing materials and air freshener or their chemical ingredients Most tests involve testing ingredients rather than finished products but according to BUAV manufacturers believe these tests overestimate the toxic effects of substances they therefore repeat the tests using their finished products to obtain a less toxic label br The substances are applied to the skin or dripped into the eyes injected intravenously intramuscularly or subcutaneously inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them or by placing them in an inhalation chamber or administered orally through a tube into the stomach or simply in the animal s food Doses may be given once repeated regularly for many months or for the lifespan of the animal br There are several different types of acute toxicity tests The LD Lethal Dose test is used to evaluate the toxicity of a substance by determining the dose required to kill of the test animal population This test was removed from OECD international guidelines in replaced by methods such as the fixed dose procedure which use fewer animals and cause less suffering Abbott writes that as of the LD acute toxicity test still accounts for one third of all animal toxicity tests worldwide br Irritancy can be measured using the Draize test where a test substance is applied to an animal s eyes or skin usually an albino rabbit For Draize eye testing the test involves observing the effects of the substance at intervals and grading any damage or irritation but the test should be halted and the animal killed if it shows continuing signs of severe pain or distress The Humane Society of the United States writes that the procedure can cause redness ulceration hemorrhaging cloudiness or even blindness This test has also been criticized by scientists for being cruel and inaccurate subjective over sensitive and failing to reflect human exposures in the real world Although no accepted in vitro alternatives exist a modified form of the Draize test called the low volume eye test may reduce suffering and provide more realistic results and this was adopted as the new standard in September However the Draize test will still be used for substances that are not severe irritants br The most stringent tests are reserved for drugs and foodstuffs For these a number of tests are performed lasting less than a month acute one to three months subchronic and more than three months chronic to test general toxicity damage to organs eye and skin irritancy mutagenicity carcinogenicity teratogenicity and reproductive problems The cost of the full complement of tests is several million dollars per substance and it may take three or four years to complete br These toxicity tests provide in the words of a United States National Academy of Sciences report critical information for assessing hazard and risk potential Animal tests may overestimate risk with false positive results being a particular problem but false positives appear not to be prohibitively common Variability in results arises from using the effects of high doses of chemicals in small numbers of laboratory animals to try to predict the effects of low doses in large numbers of humans Although relationships do exist opinion is divided on how to use data on one species to predict the exact level of risk in another br Scientists face growing pressure to move away from using traditional animal toxicity tests to determine whether manufactured chemicals are safe br Among variety of approaches to toxicity evaluation the ones which have attracted increasing interests are in vitro cell based sensing methods applying fluorescence br br br Cosmetics testing br br Cosmetics testing on animals is particularly controversial Such tests which are still conducted in the U S involve general toxicity eye and skin irritancy phototoxicity toxicity triggered by ultraviolet light and mutagenicity br Cosmetics testing on animals is banned in India the United Kingdom the European Union Israel and Norway while legislation in the U S and Brazil is currently considering similar bans In after years of discussion the European Union agreed to phase in a near total ban on the sale of animal tested cosmetics by and to ban all cosmetics related animal testing France which is home to the world s largest cosmetics company L Oreal has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg asking that the ban be quashed The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients which represents companies in Switzerland Belgium France Germany and Italy In October India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals br br br Drug testing br Before the early th century laws regulating drugs were lax Currently all new pharmaceuticals undergo rigorous animal testing before being licensed for human use Tests on pharmaceutical products involve br br metabolic tests investigating pharmacokinetics how drugs are absorbed metabolized and excreted by the body when introduced orally intravenously intraperitoneally intramuscularly or transdermally br toxicology tests which gauge acute sub acute and chronic toxicity Acute toxicity is studied by using a rising dose until signs of toxicity become apparent Current European legislation demands that acute toxicity tests must be carried out in two or more mammalian species covering at least two different routes of administration Sub acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning in order to discover if any toxic drug metabolites build up over time Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and in the European Union is required to involve two species of mammals one of which must be non rodent br efficacy studies which test whether experimental drugs work by inducing the appropriate illness in animals The drug is then administered in a double blind controlled trial which allows researchers to determine the effect of the drug and the dose response curve br Specific tests on reproductive function embryonic toxicity or carcinogenic potential can all be required by law depending on the result of other studies and the type of drug being tested br br br Education br It is estimated that million animals are used annually for educational purposes in the United States including classroom observational exercises dissections and live animal surgeries Frogs fetal pigs perch cats earthworms grasshoppers crayfish and starfish are commonly used in classroom dissections Alternatives to the use of animals in classroom dissections are widely used with many U S States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species India banned dissections in br The Sonoran Arthropod Institute hosts an annual Invertebrates in Education and Conservation Conference to discuss the use of invertebrates in education There also are efforts in many countries to find alternatives to using animals in education The NORINA database maintained by Norecopa lists products that may be used as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education and in the training of personnel who work with animals These include alternatives to dissection in schools InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system br In November the U S based company Backyard Brains released for sale to the public what they call the Roboroach an electronic backpack that can be attached to cockroaches The operator is required to amputate a cockroach s antennae use sandpaper to wear down the shell insert a wire into the thorax and then glue the electrodes and circuit board onto the insect s back A mobile phone app can then be used to control it via Bluetooth It has been suggested that the use of such a device may be a teaching aid that can promote interest in science The makers of the Roboroach have been funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and state that the device is intended to encourage children to become interested in neuroscience br br br Defense br Animals are used by the military to develop weapons vaccines battlefield surgical techniques and defensive clothing For example in the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency used live pigs to study the effects of improvised explosive device explosions on internal organs especially the brain br In the US military goats are commonly used to train combat medics Goats have become the main animal species used for this purpose after the Pentagon phased out using dogs for medical training in the s While modern mannequins used in medical training are quite efficient in simulating the behavior of a human body some trainees feel that the goat exercise provide s a sense of urgency that only real life trauma can provide Nevertheless in the U S Coast Guard announced that it would reduce the number of animals it uses in its training exercises by half after PETA released video showing Guard members cutting off the limbs of unconscious goats with tree trimmers and inflicting other injuries with a shotgun pistol ax and a scalpel That same year citing the availability of human simulators and other alternatives the Department of Defense announced it would begin reducing the number of animals it uses in various training programs In several Navy medical centers stopped using ferrets in intubation exercises after complaints from PETA br Besides the United States six out of NATO countries including Poland and Denmark use live animals for combat medic training br br br Ethics br Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species most animals are purpose bred while a minority are caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds Supporters of the use of animals in experiments such as the British Royal Society argue that virtually every medical achievement in the th century relied on the use of animals in some way The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules cells tissues organs organisms and the environment Animal rights organizations such as PETA and BUAV question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated that medical progress is actually held back by misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans that some of the tests are outdated that the costs outweigh the benefits or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation br br br Viewpoints br br The moral and ethical questions raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the th century There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species br A Gallup poll found that of Americans were very concerned or somewhat concerned about animals used in research A Pew poll taken the same year found of American adults opposed the use of animals in research br Still a wide range of viewpoints exist The view that animals have moral rights animal rights is a philosophical position proposed by Tom Regan among others who argues that animals are beings with beliefs and desires and as such are the subjects of a life with moral value and therefore moral rights Regan still sees ethical differences between killing human and non human animals and argues that to save the former it is permissible to kill the latter Likewise a moral dilemma view suggests that avoiding potential benefit to humans is unacceptable on similar grounds and holds the issue to be a dilemma in balancing such harm to humans to the harm done to animals in research In contrast an abolitionist view in animal rights holds that there is no moral justification for any harmful research on animals that is not to the benefit of the individual animal Bernard Rollin argues that benefits to human beings cannot outweigh animal suffering and that human beings have no moral right to use an animal in ways that do not benefit that individual Donald Watson has stated that vivisection and animal experimentation is probably the cruelest of all Man s attack on the rest of Creation Another prominent position is that of philosopher Peter Singer who argues that there are no grounds to include a being s species in considerations of whether their suffering is important in utilitarian moral considerations Malcolm Macleod and collaborators argue that most controlled animal studies do not employ randomization allocation concealment and blinding outcome assessment and that failure to employ these features exaggerates the apparent benefit of drugs tested in animals leading to a failure to translate much animal research for human benefit br Governments such as the Netherlands and New Zealand have responded to the public s concerns by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non human primates particularly the great apes In captive chimpanzees in the U S were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them Similarly citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods the U S NIH announced in that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees br The British government has required that the cost to animals in an experiment be weighed against the gain in knowledge Some medical schools and agencies in China Japan and South Korea have built cenotaphs for killed animals In Japan there are also annual memorial services Ireisai for animals sacrificed at medical school br br Various specific cases of animal testing have drawn attention including both instances of beneficial scientific research and instances of alleged ethical violations by those performing the tests The fundamental properties of muscle physiology were determined with work done using frog muscles including the force generating mechanism of all muscle the length tension relationship and the force velocity curve and frogs are still the preferred model organism due to the long survival of muscles in vitro and the possibility of isolating intact single fiber preparations not possible in other organisms Modern physical therapy and the understanding and treatment of muscular disorders is based on this work and subsequent work in mice often engineered to express disease states such as muscular dystrophy In February a team at the Roslin Institute in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep the first mammal to be cloned from an adult somatic cell br Concerns have been raised over the mistreatment of primates undergoing testing In the case of Britches a macaque monkey at the University of California Riverside gained public attention He had his eyelids sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head as part of an experiment to test sensory substitution devices for blind people The laboratory was raided by Animal Liberation Front in removing Britches and other animals The National Institutes of Health conducted an eight month investigation and concluded however that no corrective action was necessary During the s other cases have made headlines including experiments at the University of Cambridge and Columbia University in In and undercover footage of staff of Covance s a contract research organization that provides animal testing services Virginia lab was shot by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA Following release of the footage the U S Department of Agriculture fined Covance for citations three of which involved lab monkeys the other citations involved administrative issues and equipment br br br Threats to researchers br Threats of violence to animal researchers are not uncommon br In a primate researcher at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA shut down the experiments in his lab after threats from animal rights activists The researcher had received a grant to use macaque monkeys for vision experiments each monkey was anesthetized for a single physiological experiment lasting up to hours and then euthanized The researcher s name phone number and address were posted on the website of the Primate Freedom Project Demonstrations were held in front of his home A Molotov cocktail was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher instead it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university The Animal Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the attack As a result of the campaign the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating you win and please don t bother my family anymore In another incident at UCLA in June the Animal Liberation Brigade placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children s ophthalmologist who experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate br In PETA filmed staff from Huntingdon Life Sciences showing dogs being mistreated The employees responsible were dismissed with two given community service orders and ordered to pay costs the first lab technicians to have been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign used tactics ranging from non violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS s clients and investors The Southern Poverty Law Center which monitors US domestic extremism has described SHAC s modus operandi as frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti abortion extremists and in an official with the FBI s counter terrorism division referred to SHAC s activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats members of SHAC were jailed for between months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers br These attacks as well as similar incidents that caused the Southern Poverty Law Center to declare in that the animal rights movement had clearly taken a turn toward the more extreme prompted the US government to pass the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act and the UK government to add the offense of Intimidation of persons connected with animal research organisation to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act Such legislation and the arrest and imprisonment of activists may have decreased the incidence of attacks br br br Scientific criticism br Systematic reviews have pointed out that animal testing often fails to accurately mirror outcomes in humans For instance a review noted that some vaccines have been shown to prevent HIV in animals yet none of them have worked on humans Effects seen in animals may not be replicated in humans and vice versa Many corticosteroids cause birth defects in animals but not in humans Conversely thalidomide causes serious birth defects in humans but not in some animals such as mice however it does cause birth defects in rabbits A paper concluded that much animal research is wasted because systemic reviews are not used and due to poor methodology A review found multiple studies where there were promising results for new drugs in animals but human clinical studies did not show the same results The researchers suggested that this might be due to researcher bias or simply because animal models do not accurately reflect human biology Lack of meta reviews may be partially to blame Poor methodology is an issue in many studies A review noted that many animal experiments did not use blinded experiments a key element of many scientific studies in which researchers are not told about the part of the study they are working on to reduce bias A paper found in a sample of Open Access Alzheimer Disease studies that if the authors omit from the title that the experiment was performed in mice the News Headline follow suit and that also the Twitter repercussion is higher br br br Activism br There are various examples of activists utilizing Freedom of Information Act FOIA requests to obtain information about taxpayer funding of animal testing For example the White Coat Waste Project a group of activists that hold that taxpayers should not have br br to pay billion every year for experiments on animals highlighted that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided in taxpayer money to fund experiments in which beagles were infected by disease causing parasites The White Coat Project found reports that said dogs taking part in the experiments were vocalizing in pain after being injected with foreign substances Following public outcry People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA made a call to action that all members of the National Institute of Health resign effective immediately and that there is a need to find a new NIH director to replace the outgoing Francis Collins who will shut down research that violates the dignity of nonhuman animals br br br Alternatives br br Most scientists and governments state that animal testing should cause as little suffering to animals as possible and that animal tests should only be performed where necessary The Three Rs are guiding principles for the use of animals in research in most countries Whilst replacement of animals i e alternatives to animal testing is one of the principles their scope is much broader Although such principles have been welcomed as a step forwards by some animal welfare groups they have also been criticized as both outdated by current research and of little practical effect in improving animal welfare The scientists and engineers at Harvard s Wyss Institute have created organs on a chip including the lung on a chip and gut on a chip Researchers at cellasys in Germany developed a skin on a chip These tiny devices contain human cells in a dimensional system that mimics human organs The chips can be used instead of animals in in vitro disease research drug testing and toxicity testing Researchers have also begun using D bioprinters to create human tissues for in vitro testing br Another non animal research method is in silico or computer simulation and mathematical modeling which seeks to investigate and ultimately predict toxicity and drug effects on humans without using animals This is done by investigating test compounds on a molecular level using recent advances in technological capabilities with the ultimate goal of creating treatments unique to each patient Microdosing is another alternative to the use of animals in experimentation Microdosing is a process whereby volunteers are administered a small dose of a test compound allowing researchers to investigate its pharmacological affects without harming the volunteers Microdosing can replace the use of animals in pre clinical drug screening and can reduce the number of animals used in safety and toxicity testing Additional alternative methods include positron emission tomography PET which allows scanning of the human brain in vivo and comparative epidemiological studies of disease risk factors among human populations Simulators and computer programs have also replaced the use of animals in dissection teaching and training exercises br Official bodies such as the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Test Methods of the European Commission the Interagency Coordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods in the US ZEBET in Germany and the Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods among others also promote and disseminate the Rs These bodies are mainly driven by responding to regulatory requirements such as supporting the cosmetics testing ban in the EU by validating alternative methods The European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing serves as a liaison between the European Commission and industries The European Consensus Platform for Alternatives coordinates efforts amongst EU member states Academic centers also investigate alternatives including the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the Johns Hopkins University and the NC Rs in the UK br br br See also br br br br br br Citations br br br Works cited br Carbone L What animals want expertise and advocacy in laboratory
