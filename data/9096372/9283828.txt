A public aquarium pl aquaria or public water zoo is the aquatic counterpart of a zoo which houses living aquatic animal and plant specimens for public viewing Most public aquariums feature tanks larger than those kept by home aquarists as well as smaller tanks br Since the first public aquariums were built in the mid th century they have become popular and their numbers have increased Most modern accredited aquariums stress conservation issues and educating the public br br br History br br The first public aquarium was opened in London Zoo in May the Fish House as it came to be known was constructed much like a greenhouse P T Barnum quickly followed in with the first American aquarium as part of his established Barnum s American Museum which was located on Broadway in New York City before it burned down In the Aquarial Gardens were founded in Boston A number of aquariums then opened in Europe such as the Jardin d Acclimatation in Paris and the Viennese Aquarium Salon both founded the Marine Aquarium Temple as part of the Zoological Garden of Hamburg in Hamburg as well as aquariums in Berlin and Brighton br The old Berlin Aquarium opened in The building site was to be Unter den Linden along a major avenue in the centre of town not at the Berlin Zoo The aquarium s first director Alfred Brehm former director of the Hamburg Zoo from to served until With its emphasis on education the public aquarium was designed like a grotto part of it made of natural rock The Geologische Grotte depicted the strata of the earth s crust The grotto also featured birds and pools for seals The Aquarium Unter den Linden was a three story building Machinery and water tanks were on the ground floor and aquarium basins for the fish on the first floor Because of Brehm s special interest in birds a huge aviary with cages for mammals placed around it was located on the second floor The facility closed in br The Artis aquarium at Amsterdam Zoo was constructed inside a Victorian building in and was renovated in At the end of the th century the Artis aquarium was considered state of the art as it was again at the end of the th century br Before its closing on September the oldest American aquarium was the National Aquarium in Washington D C founded in This was followed by the opening of other public aquariums San Francisco Woodward s Gardens Woods Hole Woods Hole Science Aquarium New York City New York Aquarium present San Diego Scripps Honolulu Waikiki Aquarium present Detroit Belle Isle Aquarium Present Philadelphia Philadelphia Aquarium San Francisco Steinhart Aquarium Chicago Shedd Aquarium For many years the Shedd Aquarium was the largest in the United States until the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta opened in Entertainment and aquatic circus exhibits were combined as themes in Philadelphia s Aquarama Aquarium Theater of the Sea and Camden s re invented Adventure Aquarium formerly the New Jersey State Aquarium br The first Japanese public aquarium a small freshwater aquarium called Uonozoki now Tokyo Sea Life Park was opened at the Ueno Zoo in br br br Public aquariums today br br Modern aquarium tanks can hold millions of litres of water and can house large species including dolphins sharks or beluga whales This is accomplished through thick clear acrylic glass windows Aquatic and semiaquatic mammals including otters and seals are often cared for at aquariums Some establishments such as the Oregon Coast Aquarium or the Florida Aquarium have aquatic aviaries Modern aquariums also include land animals and plants that spend time in or near the water br For marketing purposes many aquariums promote special exhibits in addition to their permanent collections Some have aquatic versions of a petting zoo The National Aquarium in Baltimore Maryland houses several exhibits including the Upland Tropical Rain Forest and a multiple story Atlantic Coral Reef The Monterey Bay Aquarium has a shallow tank filled with common types of rays which visitors are encouraged to touch The South Carolina Aquarium lets visitors feed the rays in their Saltmarsh Aviary exhibit br The largest public aquarium is the Chimelong Ocean Kingdom theme park opened in in Hengqin Zhuhai with a total of million litres million US gal of water The second largest is the Marine Life Park in southern Singapore with a total of million litres million US gal of water for more than marine animals of over species br br br Logistics br br Most public aquariums are located close to the ocean for a steady supply of natural seawater An inland pioneer was Chicago s Shedd Aquarium that received seawater shipped by rail in special tank cars The early Philadelphia Aquarium built in the city s disused water works had to switch to treated city water when the nearby river became too contaminated Similarly the recently opened Georgia Aquarium filled its tanks with fresh water from the city water system and salinated its saltwater exhibits using the same commercial salt and mineral additives available to home aquarists The South Carolina Aquarium pulls the salt water for their exhibits right out of the Charleston harbour br In January Kelly Tarlton began construction of the first aquarium to include a large transparent acrylic tunnel Kelly Tarlton s Underwater World in Auckland New Zealand Construction took months and cost NZ million The metre ft tunnel was built from one tonne lb slabs of German sheet plastic that were shaped locally in an oven A moving walkway now transports visitors through and groups of school children occasionally hold sleepovers there beneath the swimming sharks and rays br According to Samantha Muka creating new public aquariums is an expensive process that can become so expensive as to render the project economically unsustainable due to the logistical demands of creating environments in which aquatic animals can survive br br br Activities br br Public aquariums are often affiliated with oceanographic research institutions or conduct their research programs and sometimes specialise in species and ecosystems that can be found in local waters For example the Vancouver Aquarium in Vancouver British Columbia is a centre for marine research conservation and marine animal rehabilitation particularly for the ecosystem of the Pacific Northwest In the Vancouver Aquarium became the second aquarium to capture an orca Moby Doll He survived in captivity for just under three months and the aquarium put him on display to the public for a day but gave greater emphasis to groundbreaking scientific research The aquarium also captured other orcas belugas narwhals and dolphins The Monterey Bay Aquarium was the first public aquarium to display a great white shark Beginning in September the Outer Bay exhibit now the Open Sea galleries was the home to the first in a series of great white sharks The shark was at the aquarium for days the previous record was days The shark was released on March The Adventure Aquarium in New Jersey has hippos The Aquarium du Qu bec houses polar bears br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
