title: In-situ conservation
id: 186351
In situ conservation is the on site conservation or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of plant or animal species such as forest genetic resources in natural populations of tree species This process protects the inhabitants and ensures the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem br Its converse is ex situ conservation where threatened species are moved to another location These can include places like seed libraries gene banks and more where they are protected through human intervention br br br Methods br br br Nature reserves br br Nature reserves or biosphere reserves cover very large areas often more than km They are used to protect species for a long time There are different classifications for these reserves br br Strict Natural Areas br Managed Natural Areas br Wilderness Areas br Strict natural areas are creates to protect the state of nature in a given region It is not made for the purpose of protecting any species within its limits managed natural areas alternatively are made specifically for the purpose of protecting a certain species or community that is at the point it may be at risk being in a strict natural area This is a more controlled environment that is created to be the most optimal habitat for the species concerned to thrive Finally a wilderness area serves a dual purpose of providing a protection for the natural region as well as providing recreational opportunities for patrons excluding motorized transport br br br National parks br A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment A national park is an area which is used to conserve scenery natural and historical objects It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about to square kilometers Within biosphere reserves one or more national parks may also exist br br br Wildlife sanctuaries br Wildlife sanctuaries can provide a higher quality of life for animals who are moved there These animals are placed in specialized habitats that allows for more species specific behaviors to take place Wildlife sanctuaries are often used for animals that have been in zoos circuses laboratories and more for a long time and then live the rest of their lives with greater autonomy in these habitats br br br Biodiversity hotspots br br Several international organizations focus their conservation work on areas designated as biodiversity hotspots br According to Conservation International to qualify as a biodiversity hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria br br it must contain at least species of vascular plants of the world s total as endemics br it has to have lost at least of its original habitat br Biodiversity hotspots make up of the earth s land area yet they contain more than half of our planets species br br br Gene sanctuary br A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks Biosphere reserves are developed to be both a place for biodiversity conservation as well as sustainable development The concept was first developed in the s and include a core buffer and transition zones These zones act together to harmonize the conservation and development aspects of the biosphere br Since and years following the invention of the biosphere reserve concept there have been about conservation areas developed in countries br br br Benefits br One benefit of in situ conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments As a last resort ex situ conservation may be used on some or all of the population when in situ conservation is too difficult or impossible The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought floods forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient br br br Reserves br Wildlife and livestock conservation involves the protection of wildlife habitats Sufficiently large reserves must be maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary genetic diversity to survive so that it has a good chance of continuing to adapt and evolve over time This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man and against other catastrophes br br br Agriculture br In agriculture in situ conservation techniques are an effective way to improve maintain and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers experience and field work br First the accessions of a variety stored at a germplasm bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory under different situations and stresses Thus the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced Later the best tested accessions are crossed mixed and multiplied under replicable situations At last these improved accessions are supplied to the producers Thus farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas where commercial varieties are not expedient due to climate and soil fertility constraints or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields br br br In India br About of the total geographical area of India is used for in situ conservation br There are biosphere reserves in India including Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand Nokrek in Meghalaya Manas National Park in Assam and Sundarban in West Bengal br There are national parks in India including The Kaziranga National Park which conserves The one horned rhino Periyar National Park conserving the tiger and elephant and Ranthambore National Park conserving the tiger br There are wildlife sanctuaries in India br Biodiversity hotspots include the Himalayas the Western Ghats the Indo Burma region and the Sundaland br India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana sugarcane rice and mango br Community reserves were established as a type of protected area in India in the Wildlife Protection Amendment Act to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary br Sacred groves are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection br br br In China br China has up to nature reserves which cover of the entire country br The majority of in situ conservation areas are concentrated in the regions of Tibet Qinghai and Xinjiang These provinces all in western China take up about of the nature reserves in the country br Eastern and southern China contain of the country s population and in these areas there are few nature reserves In these regions nature reserves actively compete with human development projects to support a growing demand for infrastructure One consequence of this competing development has been the movement of the South China tiger out of its natural habitat br In eastern and southern China many natural landscapes that remain undeveloped are fragmented however nature reserves may provide crucial refuge for key species as well as ecosystem services br br br See also br br Arid Forest Research Institute br
