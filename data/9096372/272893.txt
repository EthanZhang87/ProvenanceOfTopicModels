The black crowned night heron Nycticorax nycticorax or black capped night heron commonly shortened to just night heron in Eurasia is a medium sized heron found throughout a large part of the world including parts of Europe Asia and North and South America In Australasia it is replaced by the closely related nankeen night heron N caledonicus with which it has hybridized in the area of contact br br br Taxonomy and name br The black crowned night heron was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae He placed it with herons cranes and egrets in the genus Ardea and coined the binomial name Ardea nicticorax It is now placed in the genus Nycticorax that was introduced in by the English naturalist Thomas Forster for this species The epithet nycticorax is from Ancient Greek and combines nux nuktos meaning night and korax meaning raven The word was used by authors such as Aristotle and Hesychius of Miletus for a bird of ill omen perhaps an owl The word was used by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner in and then by subsequent authors for a black crowned night heron br Four subspecies are recognised br br N n nycticorax Linnaeus Eurasia south to Africa and Madagascar and east to east Asia Philippines and Indonesian Archipelago br N n hoactli Gmelin south Canada to north Argentina and Chile Hawaii br N n obscurus Bonaparte Chile and southwest Argentina br N n falklandicus Hartert EJO Falkland Islands br In the Falkland Islands the bird is called quark which is an onomatopoeia similar to its name in many other languages like qua bird in English kwak in Dutch and West Frisian kvako no n in Czech in Ukrainian in Russian v c in Vietnamese kowak malam in Indonesian and waqwa in Quechua br br br Description br Adults have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey red eyes and short yellow legs They have pale grey wings and white under parts Two or three long white plumes erected in greeting and courtship displays extend from the back of the head The sexes are similar in appearance although the males are slightly larger Black crowned night herons do not fit the typical body form of the heron family They are relatively stocky with shorter bills legs and necks than their more familiar cousins the egrets and day herons Their resting posture is normally somewhat hunched but when hunting they extend their necks and look more like other wading birds br Immature birds have dull grey brown plumage on their heads wings and backs with numerous pale spots Their underparts are paler and streaked with brown The young birds have orange eyes and duller yellowish green legs They are very noisy birds in their nesting colonies with calls that are commonly transcribed as quok or woc br Measurements br br Length in cm br Weight oz g br Wingspan in cm br br br Distribution br The breeding habitat is fresh and salt water wetlands throughout much of the world The subspecies N n hoactli breeds in North and South America from Canada as far south as northern Argentina and Chile N n obscurus in southernmost South America N n falklandicus in the Falkland Islands and the nominate race N n nycticorax in Europe Asia and Africa Black crowned night herons nest in colonies on platforms of sticks in a group of trees or on the ground in protected locations such as islands or reedbeds Three to eight eggs are laid br This heron is migratory in the northernmost part of its range but otherwise resident even in the cold Patagonia The North American population winters in Mexico the southern United States Central America and the West Indies and the Old World birds winter in tropical Africa and southern Asia br A colony of the herons has regularly summered at the National Zoo in Washington D C for more than a century The birds also prominently live year round in the shores around the San Francisco Bay with the largest rookery in Oakland Their ever presence at Oakland s Lake Merritt and throughout the city s downtown area as well as their resilience to the urban environment and displacement efforts have led to them being named Oakland s official city bird br br br Status in Great Britain br There are two archaeological specimens of the black crowned night heron in Great Britain The oldest is from the Roman London Wall and the more recent from the Royal Navy s late medieval victualling yards in Greenwich It appears in the London poulterers price lists as the Brewe a bird which was thought to have been the Eurasian whimbrel or glossy ibis which has now been shown to refer to the black crowned night heron derived from the medieval French Bihoreau Black crowned night heron may have bred in the far wetter and wider landscape of pre modern Britain They were certainly imported for the table so the bone specimens themselves do not prove they were part of the British avifauna In modern times the black crowned night heron is a vagrant and feral breeding colonies were established at Edinburgh Zoo from into the st century and at Great Witchingham in Norfolk where there were pairs in but breeding was not repeated in or A pair of adults were seen with two recently fledged juveniles in Somerset in which is the first proven breeding record of wild black crowned night herons in Great Britain br br br Behaviour br br These birds stand still at the water s edge and wait to ambush prey mainly at night or early morning They primarily eat small fish leeches earthworms mussels squid crustaceans such as crayfish frogs other amphibians aquatic insects terrestrial insects lizards snakes small mammals such as rodents small birds eggs carrion plant material and garbage and refuse at landfills They are among the seven heron species observed to engage in bait fishing luring or distracting fish by tossing edible or inedible buoyant objects into water within their striking range a rare example of tool use among birds During the day they rest in trees or bushes N n hoactli is more gregarious outside the breeding season than the nominate race br br br Parasites br A thorough study performed by J Sitko and P Heneberg in the Czech Republic in suggested that the central European black crowned night herons host helminth species The dominant species consisted of Neogryporhynchus cheilancristrotus prevalence Contracaecum microcephalum prevalence and Opistorchis longissimus prevalence The mean number of helminth species recorded per host individual reached In Ukraine other helminth species are often found in black crowned night herons too namely Echinochasmus beleocephalus Echinochasmus ruficapensis Clinostomum complanatum and Posthodiplostomum cuticola br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
