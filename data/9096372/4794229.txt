A marine mammal park also known as marine animal park and sometimes oceanarium is a commercial theme park or aquarium where marine mammals such as dolphins beluga whales and sea lions are kept within water tanks and displayed to the public in special shows A marine mammal park is more elaborate than a dolphinarium because it also features other marine mammals and offers additional entertainment attractions It is thus seen as a combination of a public aquarium and an amusement park Marine mammal parks are different from marine parks which include natural reserves and marine wildlife sanctuaries such as coral reefs particularly in Australia br br br History br Sea Lion Park opened in at Coney Island in Brooklyn New York with an aquatic show featuring sea lions It closed in br The second marine mammal park then called an oceanarium was established in St Augustine Florida in It was initially a large water tank used to exhibit marine mammals for filming underwater movies and only later became a public attraction Today Marineland of Florida claims to be the world s first oceanarium br In November Marineland of the Pacific on the Palos Verdes Peninsula near Los Angeles became the first park to display an orca in captivity although the orca named Wanda died after two days The Vancouver Aquarium had the second orca held alive in captivity Moby Doll for three months in br Between the s and the s technical advances and the public s increasing interest in aquatic environments prompted a shift to large marine mammal parks with cetaceans mostly orcas and other species of dolphin as attractions Within this time SeaWorld USA emerged with operations in Orlando Florida San Diego California San Antonio Texas and Aurora Ohio the Ohio location has since ceased operations br On July P T Barnum s museum in New York City caught fire and killed two captive beluga whales which were boiled alive in their tank br br br List of parks br br br Asia br br br Australia br br br Europe br br br North America br br br South America br br br Criticism and animal welfare br br Many animal welfare groups such as the WSPA consider keeping whales and dolphins in captivity a form of abuse The main argument is that whales and dolphins do not have enough freedom of movement within their artificial environments The existence of marine mammal parks is thus very controversial br Although sizable pools for whales and dolphins require an extraordinarily technical and financial expenditure and are thus very difficult to maintain many marine mammal parks endeavour to improve the conditions of captivity and attempt to engage in public education as well as scientific studies For that purpose many marine mammal parks joined the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums an international association dedicated to a high standard of care of marine mammals It was founded in and established offices near Washington D C in One report found that there is little objective evidence to indicate that marine mammal parks further public knowledge br In the practice of keeping animals in captivity as trained show performers was heavily criticized when a trainer was killed by an orca whale at SeaWorld Orlando in Florida Orca attacks were documented in the film Blackfish In the California Coastal Commission banned the breeding of captive killer whales br br br Captivity of marine mammals br Animal captivity is the capturing and holding of an animal Animals have been held captive for entertainment purposes and domestication As of whales and dolphins who are held captive have significantly less space than they would have in the wild Marine mammals in captivity have demonstrated behavioral changes in response to the death or separation of a pod mate or family member br br br Dolphins br Captive dolphins are six times more likely to die than those in the wild because of the stress and poor treatment that they endure living on average years less in captivity than they would in the wild The stress of captivity prevents dolphin reproduction with rare exceptions Dolphins in their natural habitat spend approximately of their time deep underwater and swim about miles per day Dolphins in captivity spend about of their time above water and swim just a few miles per day br br br Orcas br br In the wild orcas swim about miles per day and only spend approximately of their lives at the surface of the ocean In captivity orcas cannot swim to their necessary depth causing sunburn and blisters The extended exposure to open air can cause the dorsal fin to collapse As of orcas are in captivity in the U S Studies show that nearly all captive orcas die for reasons other than old age Twelve orcas have died at Sea World since SeaWorld San Diego has recorded orca deaths since The orcas often die from pregnancy disease and stress br The orca brain is among the largest and most complex of all marine mammals Orcas appear to understand that they are in captivity under human care and they depend on their pod mates and family for survival it is rare for them to survive on their own An orca named Loita at the Miami Seaquarium captured at four years old and in captivity for almost years was set to be released but died in the summer of before she could be freed br br br Prevention of captivity br The U S Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act of to protect animals who are under human care The Marine Mammal Protection Act signed into law in by President Richard Nixon prohibits the capture of marine mammals br br br See also br Animal theme park br List
