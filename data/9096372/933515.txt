id: 933515
Horse meat forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many countries particularly in Eurasia The eight countries that consume the most horse meat consume about million horses a year For the majority of humanity s early existence wild horses were hunted as a source of protein br br br History br During the Paleolithic wild horses formed an important source of food for humans In many parts of Europe the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times despite a ban on horse meat by Pope Gregory III in Horse meat was also eaten as part of Germanic pagan religious ceremonies in Northern Europe br The earliest horses evolved on the North American continent and by about BC they had migrated to other parts of the world becoming extinct in the Americas The now extinct Hagerman horse of Idaho about the size of a modern day large pony is one example of an indigenous New World horse species In the th and th centuries Spaniards followed by other European settlers reintroduced horses to the Americas Some horses became feral and began to be hunted by the indigenous Pehuenche people of what is now Chile and Argentina Initially early humans hunted horses as they did other games later they began to raise them for meat milk and transport The meat was and still is preserved by being sun dried in the high Andes into a product known as charqui br France dates its taste for horse meat to the Revolution With the fall of the aristocracy its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence The horses formerly maintained by the aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up being used to alleviate the hunger of the masses During the Napoleonic campaigns the surgeon in chief of Napoleon s Grand Army Baron Dominique Jean Larrey advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses At the siege of Alexandria the meat of young Arab horses relieved an epidemic of scurvy At the battle of Eylau in Larrey served horse as soup and as b uf la mode At Aspern Essling cut off from the supply lines the cavalry used the breastplates of fallen cuirassiers as cooking pans and gunpowder as seasoning thus founding a practice that carried on until at least the Waterloo campaign br br Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in French cuisine during the later years of the Second French Empire The high cost of living in Paris prevented many working class citizens from buying meat such as pork or beef in the French government legalized the eating of horse meat and the first butcher s shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris providing quality meat at lower prices br During the siege of Paris horse meat along with the meat of donkeys and mules was eaten by anyone who could afford it partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city and also because horses were eating grain that was needed by the human populace Though large numbers of horses were in Paris estimates suggested between and were butchered and eaten during the siege the supply was ultimately limited Not even champion racehorses were spared two horses presented to Napoleon III of France by Alexander II of Russia were slaughtered but the meat became scarce Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege and after the war ended horse meat remained popular Likewise in other places and times of siege or starvation horses are viewed as a food source of last resort br Despite the general Anglophone taboo horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain especially in Yorkshire until the s and in times of postwar food shortages surged in popularity in the United States and was considered for use as hospital food A Time magazine article about horse meat brought to the United States from Canada described the meat as a sweet rich superlean oddly soft meat and closer to beef than to venison br br br Nutrition br Horse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of beef Many consumers allege not being able to tell the difference between beef and horse meat br Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color while older horses produce richer color and flavor as with most mammals Horse meat can be used to replace beef pork mutton venison and any other meat in virtually any recipe Horse meat is usually very lean Jurisdictions that allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions so many are quite young some even as young as to months old br br br Production br br In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle i e in large scale factory slaughter houses abattoirs where they are stunned with a captive bolt gun and bled to death In countries with a less industrialized food production system horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed in or near the village where they will be consumed br br In the eight principal horse meat producing countries produced over tonnes of it In the five biggest horse meat consuming countries were China tonnes Mexico Russia Italy and Kazakhstan tonnes In Mexico produced tonnes China tonnes and Kazakhstan tonnes br br br Use br As horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle in the western countries they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat Instead horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as riding or work animals is low but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat for example in the routine export of the southern English ponies from the New Forest Exmoor and Dartmoor British law requires the use of equine passports even for semiferal horses to enable traceability also known as provenance so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported meaning that the animals travel as carcasses rather than live Ex racehorses riding horses and other horses sold at auction may also enter the food chain sometimes these animals have been stolen or purchased under false pretenses Even prestigious horses may end up in the slaughterhouse the Kentucky Derby winner and Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner Ferdinand is believed to have been slaughtered in Japan probably for pet food br A misconception exists that horses are commonly slaughtered for pet food In many countries such as the United States horse meat was outlawed for use in pet food in the s American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan and its cost is in line with veal so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food br Meat from horses that veterinarians have put down with a lethal injection is not suitable for human consumption as the toxin remains in the meat the carcasses of such animals are sometimes cremated most other means of disposal are problematic due to the toxin Remains of euthanized animals can be rendered which maintains the value of the skin bones fats etc for such purposes as fish food This is commonly done for lab specimens e g pigs euthanized by injection The amount of drug e g a barbiturate is insignificant after rendering br Carcasses of horses treated with some drugs are considered edible in some jurisdictions For example according to Canadian regulation hyaluron used in treatment of particular disorders in horses in HY preparation should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat In Europe however the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect and edibility of the horse meat is not affected br br br Attitudes towards horse meat br br Horse meat is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia It is not a generally available food in some English speaking countries such as the United Kingdom South Africa Australia the United States and English Canada It is also taboo in Brazil Ireland Poland and Israel and among the Romani Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain except in the north but the country exports horses both as live animals and as slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries but is illegal in some others The Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of meat does not include horse In Tonga horse meat is eaten nationally and Tongan emigrants living in the United States New Zealand and Australia have retained a taste for it claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them br Earlier in Islam consuming horse meat is not haram but makruh which means it should be avoided but eating it is not a sin like the eating of pork due to its other important usage The consumption of horse meat has been common in Central Asian societies past or present due to the abundance of steppes suitable for raising horses In North Africa horse meat has been occasionally consumed but almost exclusively by the Hanafi Sunnis it has never been eaten in the Maghreb br Horse meat is forbidden by Jewish dietary laws because horses are not ruminants and do not have cloven hooves and are therefore not kosher br In the eighth century Popes Gregory III and Zachary instructed Saint Boniface missionary to the Germans to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted due to its association with Germanic pagan ceremonies The people of Iceland allegedly expressed reluctance to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat Horse meat is now currently consumed in Iceland and many horses are raised for this purpose The culturally close people of Sweden still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat said to stem from this edict br Henry Mayhew describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass between London and Paris in London Labour and the London Poor Horse meat was rejected by the British but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany where knackers often sold horse carcasses despite the papal ban Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of Westphalia Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages and that offal sold as that of oxen was in fact equine br While no taboo on eating horse meat exists per se it is generally considered by ethnic Russians to be a low quality meat with poor taste and it is rarely found in stores It is popular among such historically nomadic peoples as the Tatars Kyrgyz and Kazakhs br br br Taboos br br In AD Pope Gregory III began a concerted effort to stop the ritual consumption of horse meat in pagan practice In some countries the effects of this prohibition by the Catholic Church have lingered and horse meat prejudices have progressed from taboos to avoidance to abhorrence In a study conducted by Fred Simoons the avoidance of horse meat in American culture is less likely due to lingering feelings from Gregory s prohibition but instead due to an unfamiliarity with the meat compared to more mainstream offerings In other parts of the world horse meat has the stigma of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats such as pork and beef In any case Pope Gregory s law is no longer in force so there is no prohibition now for Catholics to eat horse meat other than on abstinence days br According to the anthropologist Marvin Harris some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than ruminants br Totemistic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption Roman sources state that the goddess Epona was widely worshipped in Gaul and southern Britain Epona a triple aspect goddess was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers and horses were sacrificed to her she was paralleled by the Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon In The White Goddess Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona and even earlier rites The Uffington White Horse is probable evidence of ancient horse worship The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifices and horse meat consumption one of which is Ashwamedha Yajna as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana and Mahabharata but in the context of the ritual sacrifice it is not killed but instead smothered to death Also Ancient Indians consumed horse meat In the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice br In ancient Scandinavia the horse was very important as a living working creature as a sign of the owner s status and symbolically within Old Norse religion Horses were slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts When the Nordic countries were Christianized eating horse meat was regarded as a sign of paganism and prohibited A reluctance to eat horse meat is common in these countries even today br br br Opposition to production br The killing of horses for human consumption is widely opposed in countries such as the U S the UK and Greece where horses are generally considered to be companion and sporting animals only In ancient Greece horses were revered and horse slaughter is forbidden by law also in modern Greece as horses are considered companions and a symbol of beauty strength and pride For horses going to slaughter no period of withdrawal the time between administration of the drug and the time they are butchered is required French former actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat However the opposition is far from unanimous a readers poll in the London magazine Time Out showed that of respondents supported chef Gordon Ramsay s decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants br br br Around the world br br br South America br br br Argentina br Argentina is a producer and exporter of horse meat but it is not used in local consumption and is considered taboo br br br Chile br In Chile it is used in charqui Also in Chile horse meat became the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes which promptly switched from a guanaco based economy to a horse based one after the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral br Although not nearly as common as beef meat horse meat can be readily available in some butcheries throughout the country It is generally less expensive than beef and somewhat associated with lower social strata br br br Uruguay br In Uruguay horses are appreciated for their companionship and horse meat shouldn t be consumed as it constitutes a taboo that dates back from Spaniard ancestry at colony times There s a saying that preaches a lomo de caballo criollo se hizo la patria on criollo horse back the nation was made However the country produces horse meat to be exported to France and China Also a common belief is that horse meat is locally used to make salami Slaughtering horses are fierce untamed colts br br br North America br br br Canada br A small horse meat business exists in Quebec Horse meat is also for sale in Granville Island Market in Vancouver where according to a Time reviewer who smuggled it into the United States it turned out to be a sweet rich superlean oddly soft meat closer to beef than venison Horse meat is also available in high end Toronto butchers and supermarkets CBC News reported on March that horse meat was also popular among some segments of Toronto s population br Despite this most of Canada shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the English speaking world br This mentality is especially evident in Alberta where strong horse racing and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province s founding although large numbers of horses are slaughtered for meat in Fort MacLeod and certain butchers in Calgary do sell it br In the consumer protection show Kassensturz of Swiss television SRF reported the poor animal conditions at Bouvry Exports a Canadian horse meat farm in Fort MacLeod Alberta Migros the primary importer of horse meat into Switzerland started working with Bouvry to improve their animal welfare but in Migros cut ties with Bouvry because though improvements had been made they

producer of horse meat in the world By it became the largest producer of horse meat in the world It is only exported as it is not used or consumed in Mexico br br br United States br br Horse meat is generally not eaten in the United States and is banned in many states in the country It holds a taboo in American culture very similar to the one found in the United Kingdom All horse meat produced in the United States since the s until the last quarter of was intended solely for export abroad primarily to the European Union However a thriving horse exportation business is going on in several states including Texas primarily exporting horses to slaughterhouses in either Canada or Mexico br Restriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U S has involved legislation at local state and federal levels Several states have enacted legislation either prohibiting the sale of horse meat or banning altogether the slaughter of horses br California outlawed in via ballot proposition the possession transfer reception or holding any horse pony burro or mule by a person who is aware that it will be used for human consumption and making the slaughter of horses or the sale of horse meat for human consumption a misdemeanor offense br In the Illinois General Assembly enacted Public Act amending Chapter Section of the state s compiled statutes to prohibit both the act of slaughtering equines for human consumption and the trade of any horse meat similarly to Texas Agriculture Code s Chapter br Other states banning horse slaughter or the sale of horse meat include New Jersey Oklahoma and Mississippi In addition several other states introduced legislation to outlaw the practice over the years such as Florida Massachusetts New Mexico and New York br At the federal level since several bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate to ban horse slaughter throughout the country without success However a budgetary provision banning the use of federal funds to carry out mandatory inspections at horse slaughter plants necessary to allow interstate sale and exports of horse meat has also been in place since This restriction was temporarily removed in as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year but was again included in the FY Agriculture Appropriations Act and subsequent federal budgets hence preventing the operation of any domestic horse slaughter operation br Until only three horse meat slaughterhouses still existed in the United States for export to foreign markets but they were closed by court orders resulting from the upholding of aforementioned Illinois and Texas statutes banning horse slaughter and the sale of horse meat br The taboo surrounding horse meat in the United States received national attention again in May when a restaurant in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh served a dish containing horse tartare as part of a special event the restaurant was hosting with French Canadian chefs as guests The restaurant which otherwise does not serve horse meat which is legal to serve and consume in Pennsylvania received an inspection and a warning from the USDA not to serve
