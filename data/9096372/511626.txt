title: Cultured meat
id: 511626
Cultured meat also known as cultivated meat among other names is a form of cellular agriculture where meat is produced by culturing animal cells in vitro Cultured meat is produced using tissue engineering techniques pioneered in regenerative medicine Jason Matheny popularized the concept in the early s after he co authored a paper on cultured meat production and created New Harvest the world s first non profit organization dedicated to in vitro meat research Cultured meat has the potential to address the environmental impact of meat production animal welfare food security and human health in addition to its potential mitigation of climate change br br In Mark Post created a hamburger patty made from tissue grown outside of an animal Since then other cultured meat prototypes have gained media attention SuperMeat opened a farm to fork restaurant in Tel Aviv called The Chicken to test consumer reaction to its cultured chicken burger while the world s first commercial sale of cell cultured meat occurred in December at Singapore restaurant where cultured meat manufactured by United States firm Eat Just was sold br While most efforts focus on common meats such as pork beef and chicken which constitute the bulk of consumption in developed countries companies such as Orbillion Bio focused on high end or unusual meats including elk lamb bison and Wagyu beef Avant Meats brought cultured grouper to market in while other companies have pursued different species of fish and other seafood br The production process is constantly evolving driven by companies and research institutions The applications for cultured meat led to ethical health environmental cultural and economic discussions Data published by the non governmental organization Good Food Institute found that in cultivated meat companies attracted million in Europe The first restaurant to serve cultured meat opened in Singapore in However cultured meat is not yet widely available br br br Nomenclature br Besides cultured meat the terms healthy meat slaughter free meat in vitro meat vat grown meat lab grown meat cell based meat clean meat cultivated meat and synthetic meat have been used to describe the product Although it has multiple meanings artificial meat is occasionally used br Between and clean meat gained traction The Good Food Institute GFI coined the term in and in late the institute published research claiming that use of clean better reflected the production process and benefits By it had surpassed cultured and in vitro in media mentions and Google searches Some industry stakeholders felt that the term unnecessarily tarnished conventional meat producers continuing to prefer cell based meat as a neutral alternative br In September GFI announced new research which found that the term cultivated meat is sufficiently descriptive and differentiating possesses a high degree of neutrality and ranks highly for consumer appeal A September poll indicated that the majority of industry CEOs have a preference for cultivated meat with percent of companies preferring it br br br History br br br Initial research br The theoretical possibility of growing meat in an industrial setting has long been of interest In a essay published by various periodicals and later included in his work Thoughts and Adventures British statesman Winston Churchill wrote We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken to eat the breast or wing by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium br In the s Dutch researcher Willem van Eelen independently came up with the idea for cultured meat As a prisoner of war during the Second World War Van Eelen suffered from starvation leaving him passionate about food production and food security He attended a university lecture discussing the prospects of preserved meat The earlier discovery of cell lines provided the basis for the idea In vitro cultivation of muscle fibers was first performed successfully in when pathologist Russel Ross cultured guinea pig aorta In Jon F Vein secured patent US for the production of tissue engineered meat for human consumption wherein muscle and fat would be grown in an integrated fashion to create food products br In dermatologist Wiete Westerhof along with van Eelen and businessperson Willem van Kooten announced that they had filed for a worldwide patent on a process to produce cultured meat The process employed a matrix of collagen seeded with muscle cells bathed in a nutritious solution and induced to divide That same year NASA began conducting cultured meat experiments with the intent of allowing astronauts to grow meat instead of transporting it In partnership with Morris Benjaminson they cultivated goldfish and turkey In Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr exhibited a few centimeters of steak grown from frog stem cells which they cooked and ate The goal was to start a conversation surrounding the ethics of cultured meat was it ever alive was it ever killed is it in any way disrespectful to an animal to throw it away br In the early s American public health student Jason Matheny traveled to India and visited a factory chicken farm He was appalled by the implications of this system Matheny later teamed up with three scientists involved in NASA s efforts In Matheny founded New Harvest to encourage development by funding research In the four published the first peer reviewed literature on the subject br In May PETA offered a million prize to the first company to bring cultured chicken meat to consumers by The contestant was required to complete two tasks to earn the prize namely to produce a cultured chicken meat product that was indistinguishable from real chicken and produce the product in large enough quantities to be competitively sold in at least states The contest was later extended until March The deadline eventually expired without a winner br The Dutch government has invested million into experiments regarding cultured meat The In Vitro Meat Consortium a group formed by international researchers held the first international conference hosted by the Norwegian Food Research Institute in April Time magazine declared cultured meat production to be one of the breakthrough ideas of In November scientists from the Netherlands announced they had managed to grow meat using cells from a live pig br br br First public trial br The first cultured beef burger patty was created by Mark Post at Maastricht University in It was made from over thin strands of muscle tissue cost over and needed years to produce The burger was tested on live television in London on August It was cooked by chef Richard McGeown of Couch s Great House Restaurant Polperro Cornwall and tasted by critics Hanni R tzler a food researcher from the Future Food Studio and Josh Schonwald R tzler stated There is really a bite to it there is quite some flavour with the browning I know there is no fat in it so I didn t really know how juicy it would be but there is quite some intense taste it s close to meat it s not that juicy but the consistency is perfect This is meat to me It s really something to bite on and I think the look is quite similar R tzler added that even in a blind trial she would have taken the product for meat rather than a soya copy br br br Industry development br br Between and many cultured meat startups were launched Memphis Meats now known as Upside Foods launched a video in February showcasing its cultured beef meatball In March it showcased chicken tenders and duck a l orange the first cultured poultry shown to the public An Israeli company SuperMeat ran a crowdfunding campaign in for its work on cultured chicken Finless Foods a San Francisco based company working on cultured fish was founded in June In March it commenced laboratory operations br In March Eat Just in founded as Hampton Creek in San Francisco later known as Just Inc claimed to be able to offer a consumer product from cultured meat by the end of According to CEO Josh Tetrick the technology was already there JUST had about employees and a research department of scientists where cultured meat from poultry pork and beef was researched JUST has received investments from Chinese billionaire Li Ka shing Yahoo co founder Jerry Yang and according to Tetrick also by Heineken International and others br Dutch startup Meatable consisting of Krijn de Nood Daan Luining Ruud Out Roger Pederson Mark Kotter and Gordana Apic among others reported in September that it had succeeded in growing meat using pluripotent stem cells from animal umbilical cords Although such cells are reportedly difficult to work with Meatable claimed to be able to direct them to behave to become muscle or fat cells as needed The major advantage is that this technique bypasses fetal bovine serum meaning that no animal has to be killed to produce meat That month an estimated cultured meat startups operated across the world Integriculture is a Japan based company working on their CulNet system Competitors included England based Multus Media and Canadian Future Fields br In August five American startups announced the formation of the Alliance for Meat Poultry Seafood Innovation AMPS Innovation a coalition seeking to work with regulators to create a pathway to market for cultured meat and seafood The founding members include Eat Just Memphis Meats Finless Foods BlueNalu and Fork Goode Similarly in December a group of European and Israeli companies Aleph Farms Bluu Biosciences Cubiq Foods Future Meat Gourmey Higher Steaks Ivy Farm Meatable Mirai Foods Mosa Meat Peace of Meat SuperMeat and Vital Meat established Cellular Agriculture Europe a Belgium based association that sought to find common ground and speak with a shared voice for the good of the industry consumers and regulators br In October Aleph Farms collaborated with D Bioprinting Solutions to culture meat on the International Space Station This was done by extruding meat cells onto a scaffold using a D printer In January Quartz found around cultured meat startups and that Memphis Meats Just Inc and Future Meat Technologies were the most advanced because they were building pilot plants According to New Scientist in May start ups were developing cultured meat Some of these were technology suppliers Growth media reportedly still cost hundreds of dollars per litre but for clean meat production to scale this needs to drop to around a litre In June Chinese government officials called for a national strategy to compete in cultured meat br In December the Foieture project was launched in Belgium with the goal of developing cultured foie gras the name is a portmanteau of foie and future by a consortium of companies cultured meat startup Peace of Meat small meat seasoning company Solina and small p t producing company Nauta and non profit institutes university KU Leuven food industry innovation centre Flanders Food and Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant Peace of Meat stated in December that it intended to complete its proof of concept in to produce its first prototype in and to go to market in That month the Foieture project received a research grant of almost million euros from the Innovation and Enterprise Agency of the Flemish Government In May Peace of Meat s Austrian born cofounder and scientific researcher Eva Sommer stated that the startup was then able to produce grams of cultured fat at a cost of about euros kg the goal was to reduce the price to euros per kilogram by Piece of Meat built two laboratories in the Port of Antwerp In late MeaTech acquired Peace of Meat for million euros and announced in May that it would build a new large scale pilot plant in Antwerp by br In November Indian start up Clear Meat claimed it had managed to cultivate chicken mince at the cost of only Indian rupees US while a slaughtered processed chicken cost about rupees On April the European Commission approved the request for the collection of signatures for the European Citizens Initiative End The Slaughter Age to shift subsidies from animal husbandry to cellular agriculture br According to a November report by Oghma Partners of all funds over billion British pounds raised for cultivated meat start ups between and went to a top five comprising Upside Foods formerly Memphis Meats Believer Meats formerly Future Meat Technologies Wildtype Aleph Farms and Mosa Meat br br br Market entry br br br European Union entry br In the European Union novel foods such as cultured meat products have to go through a testing period of about months during which a company must prove to the European Food Safety Authority EFSA that their product is safe In March cultured meat producers had reached the level of attempting to gain regulatory approval from European Union supranational institutions coming just before mass goods could be sold to consumers By February none had yet submitted a novel food dossier for approval by the EFSA Legal experts explained this as having to do with the fact that although the EFSA s novel food procedure has been well established since unlike in other jurisdictions that still have or had to develop certain regulatory standards it is a long and complicated process in which companies can have little input once they have submitted their request unlike cultured meat startups in the United States who could easily communicate back and forth with the FDA to clarify any issues and in the UK Singapore and Israel where governments have implemented a single point of contact responsible for the overall process br In April the Dutch start up Meatable was the first in the EU to receive regulatory approval from the EFSA for a public proof of concept tasting of cultured meat in this case sausage amid much international and national media attention Meatable CTO Daan Luining cautioned it would take several years to scale up production to serve all supermarkets that cultured meat was just an alternative that would gradually become more widely available giving consumers more choices and that the traditional meat industry would not be replaced any time soon br br br Israel entry br In November SuperMeat opened a test restaurant in Ness Ziona Israel right next to its pilot plant journalists experts and a small number of consumers could book an appointment to taste the novel food there while looking through a glass window into the production facility on the other side The restaurant was not yet fully open to the public because as of June SuperMeat still needed to wait for regulatory approval to start mass production for public consumption and because the COVID pandemic restricted restaurant operations By February Israeli authorities had established a regulatory structure similar to that of Singapore and shown a general willingness to work towards approval as well as financing research for cultivated food innovation but were still in the process of developing safety regulations in consultations with researchers and other experts For example the Israeli Health Ministry and UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO co organised a convention of cultivated food safety regulation experts in September br In January the Ministry of Health in Israel granted regulatory approval for cultured beef to Aleph Farms br br br Singapore entry br br On December the Singapore Food Agency approved the chicken bites produced by Eat Just for commercial sale It marked the first time that a cultured meat product passed the safety review which took years of a food regulator and was widely regarded as a milestone for the industry The chicken bits were scheduled for introduction in Singaporean restaurants Restaurant became the first to serve cultured meat to customers on Saturday December br In January the SFA also granted regulatory approval for the production of cultured meat with serum free media to Eat Just subsidiary GOOD Meat which had introduced its clean chicken product in several more Singaporese restaurants as well as hawker centres and food delivery services since and was constructing the bioreactors for its new facility in Singapore This world first approval was said to be a milestone in making cultivated meat production more scalable and efficient In April Australian start up Vow obtained Singaporean approval for its cultured quail while Dutch start up Meatable would be introducing its cultivated pork sausages in several restaurants in Singapore later in br br br United States entry br In November the Food and Drug Administration FDA completed the pre market consultation of Upside Foods formerly Memphis Meats concluding that its products were safe to eat a first for cultivated meat companies in the United States Approval from the final agency the United States Department of Agriculture USDA was received by Upside Foods and Good Meat both for cultivated chicken in June br br br Companies working on cultured meat br br Note dates in italics refer to projected dates of achievement in the future they may shift br br In addition to these companies non profit organizations such as New Harvest the Good Food Institute ProVeg International and the Cellular Agriculture Society advocate for fund and research cultured meat br br br Pilot plants br Note data in italics refer to unfinished projects or projected capacities in the future they may shift br br br Process br br br Cell lines br Cellular agriculture requires cell lines generally stem cells Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the potential to become many or all of the required kinds of specialized cell types Totipotent stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the different cell types found within the body Pluripotent stem cells can mature into all cell types save those in the placenta and multipotent stem cells can differentiate into several specialized cell types within one lineage Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into one specific cell fate br br While pluripotent stem cells would be an ideal source the most prominent example of this subcategory is embryonic stem cells which due to ethical issues are controversial for use in research As a result scientists have developed induced pluripotent stem cells iPSCs essentially multipotent blood and skin cells that have been regressed to a pluripotent state enabling them to differentiate into a greater range of cells The alternative is using multipotent adult stem cells that give rise to muscle cell lineages or unipotent progenitors which differentiate into muscle cells br Favourable characteristics of stem cells include immortality proliferative ability unreliance on adherence serum independence and easy differentiation into tissue The natural presence of such characteristics are likely to differ across cell species and origin As such in vitro cultivation must be adjusted to fill the exact needs of a specific cell line The immortality issue is that cells have a limit on the number of times they can divide that is dictated by their telomere cap supplementary nucleotide bases added to the end of their chromosomes With each division the telomere cap progressively shortens until nothing remains at which time the cells cease to divide Induced pluripotency can lengthen telomere cap such that the cells divide indefinitely br Cell lines can be collected from a primary source i e through a biopsy on an animal under local anesthesia They could also be established from secondary sources such as cryopreserved cultures cultures frozen after previous research br br br Growth medium br br Once cell lines are established they are immersed in a culture media to induce them to proliferate Culture media are typically formulated from basal media that provide cells with necessary carbohydrates fats proteins and salts Once a cell consumes a sufficient amount it divides and the population increases exponentially Culture media can be supplemented with additives for instance sera that supply additional growth factors Growth factors can be secreted proteins or steroids that are crucial in regulating cellular processes br Once differentiation begins muscle fibres begin to contract and generate lactic acid Cells ability to absorb nutrients and proliferate in part depends on the pH of their environment As lactic acid accumulates within the media the environment will become progressively more acidic and falls below the optimal pH As a result culture media must be frequently refreshed This helps refresh the concentration of nutrients from the basal media br br br Scaffold br br In the case of structured meat products products that are characterized by their overall configuration as well as cell type cells must be seeded to scaffolds Scaffolds are essentially molds meant to reflect and encourage the cells to organize into a larger structure When cells develop in vivo they are influenced by their interactions with the extracellular matrix ECM The ECM is the dimensional mesh of glycoproteins collagen and enzymes responsible for transmitting mechanical and biochemical cues to the cell Scaffolds need to simulate the characteristics of the ECM br br br Porosity br Pores are minute openings on the surface of the scaffold They can be created on the surface of the biomaterial in order to release cellular components that could interfere with tissue development They also help diffuse gas and nutrients to the innermost layers of adherent cells preventing a necrotic center from forming A necrotic center is a phenomenon in which cells that are not in direct contact with the culture medium die from a lack of nutrients br br br Vascularization br Vascular tissue found in plants contains the organs responsible for internally transporting fluids It forms natural topographies that provide a low cost way to promote cell alignment by replicating the natural physiological state of myoblasts It may also help with gas and nutrient exchange br br br Biochemical properties br A scaffold s biochemical properties should be similar to those of the ECM It must facilitate cell adhesion through textural qualities or chemical bonding Additionally it must produce the chemical cues that encourage cell differentiation Alternatively the material should be able to blend with other substances which have these functional qualities br br br Crystallinity br The degree of a material s crystallinity determines qualities such as rigidity High crystallinity can be attributed to hydrogen bonding which in turn increases thermal stability tensile strength important for maintaining the scaffold s shape water retention important for hydrating the cells and Young s modulus br br br Degradation br Certain materials degrade into compounds that are beneficial to cells although this degradation can also be irrelevant or detrimental Degradation allows easy removal of the scaffold from the finished product leaving only animal tissue thereby increasing its resemblance to in vivo meat This degradation can be induced by exposure to certain enzymes which do not impact the muscle tissue br br br Edibility br If scaffolds are unable to be removed from the animal tissue they must be edible to ensure consumer safety It would be beneficial if they were to be made out of nutritious ingredients Since academic research groups and companies have emerged in order to identify raw materials that have the characteristics of suitable scaffolds br br br Cellulose br Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature and provides the exoskeletons of plant leaves Due to its abundance it can be obtained at a relatively low cost It is also versatile and biocompatible Through a process called decellularization it is coated in a surfactant that creates pores These pores release the plant s cellular components and it becomes decellularized plant tissue This material has been extensively studied by the Pelling and Gaudette Groups at University of Ottawa and Worcester Polytechnic Institute respectively Through cross linking forming covalent bonds between individual polymer chains to hold them together the plant tissue s mechanical properties can be changed so that it more closely resembles muscle tissue This can also be done by blending plant tissue with other materials On the other hand decellularized plant tissue typically lacks mammalian biochemical cues so it needs to be coated with compensatory functional proteins C C growth was not shown to change significantly between the bare scaffold and the same scaffold with a coating of collagen or gelatin proteins however seeding efficiency rate at which cells attach to the scaffold improved br An advantage of decellularized plant tissue is the natural topography afforded by the leaf vasculature This helps replicate the natural physiological state of the myoblasts which promotes cell alignment The other ways of doing this are usually quite a bit more expensive including D printing soft lithography and photolithography Vascularization can also help overcome the nm diffusion limit of culture medium into cells that usually produce necrotic centres in muscle conglomerates Another way to do this is by having a porous scaffold which supports angiogenesis the development of new blood vessels While this has been shown to work for apple Hypanthium not all plants are nearly as porous The alternative to plant cellulose is bacterial cellulose which is typically more pure than plant cellulose as it is free from contaminants such as lignin and hemicellulose Bacterial cellulose has more hydrogen bonding between its polymer strands and so it has greater crystallinity It also has smaller microfibrils that allow it to retain more moisture and have smaller pores The substance can be produced using waste carbohydrates which may allow it to be produced less expensively and it adds juiciness and chewiness to emulsified meat which would mean that even if it can t be taken out of the final product it will contribute to the texture profile br br br Chitin br Chitin is nature s second most abundant polymer It is found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and fungi As cellular agriculture is attempting to end reliance on animals chitin derived from fungi is of greater interest It has mostly been studied by Pelling Group Chitosan is derived from chitin in a process known as alkaline deacetylation substituting out certain amino acid groups The degree of this process determines the physical and chemical properties of the chitosan Chitosan has antibacterial properties in particular it has bactericidal effects on planktonic bacteria and biofilms and a bacteria static effects on gram negative bacteria such as E coli This is important as it neutralizes potentially harmful compounds without using antibiotics which many consumers avoid Chitosan s resemblance to glycosaminoglycans and internal interactions between glycoproteins and proteoglycans make it highly biocompatible It can easily blend with other polymers in order to select for more bioactive factors One potential disadvantage of chitosan is that it degrades in the presence of lysozymes naturally occurring enzymes But this can be resisted using deacetylation This is not entirely negative as the byproducts produced through degradation have anti inflammatory and anti bacterial properties It is important to match the level that cells rely on the matrix for structure with degradation br br br Collagen br Collagen is a family of proteins that makes up the primary structure of human connective tissue It is typically derived from bovine porcine and murine sources Cellular agriculture overcomes this dependency through the use of transgenic organisms that are capable of producing the amino acid repeats that make up the collagen Collagen naturally exists as collagen type I It has been produced as porous hydrogels composites and substrates with topographical cues and biochemical properties Synthetic kinds of collagen have been produced through recombinant protein production collagen type II and III tropoelastin and fibronectin One challenge with these proteins is that they can not be modified post translation However an alternative fibrillar protein has been isolated in microbes that lack collagen s biochemical cues but has its kind of gene customizability One focus of recombinant collagen production is yield optimization how it can be produced most effectively Plants in particular tobacco look like the best option however bacteria and yeast are also viable alternatives br Textured soy protein is a soy flour product often used in plant based meat that supports the growth of bovine cells Its spongy texture enables efficient cell seeding and its porosity encourages oxygen transfer Additionally it degrades during cell differentiation into compounds that are beneficial to certain cells br br br Mycelium br Mycelium are the roots of mushrooms Altast Foods Co is using solid state fermentation to grow mushroom tissue on mycelium scaffolds They harvest this tissue and use it to create bacon analogs br br br Nanomaterials br Nanomaterials exhibit unique properties at the nanoscale London based Biomimetic Solutions is leveraging nanomaterials in order to create scaffolds Cass Materials in Perth Australia is using a dietary fibre called Nata de Coco derived from coconuts to create nanocellulose sponges for their BNC scaffold Nata de Coco is biocompatible has high porosity facilitates cell adhesion and is biodegradable br br br Spinning br Immersion Jet Spinning is a method of creating scaffolds by spinning polymers into fibres It was developed by the Parker Group at Harvard Their platform uses centrifugal force to extrude a polymer solution through an opening in a rotating reservoir During extrusion the solution forms a jet that elongates and aligns as it crosses the air gap The jet is directed into a vortex controlled precipitation bath that chemically cross links or precipitates polymer nanofibers Adjusting air gap rotation and the solution changes the diameter of the resulting fibres This method can spin scaffolds out of PPTA nylon DNA and nanofiber sheets A nanofibrous scaffold made from alginate and gelatin was able to support the growth of C C cells Rabbit and bovine aortic smooth muscle myoblasts were able to adhere to the gelatin fibres They formed aggregates on shorter fibres and aligned tissue on the longer ones Matrix Meats is using electrospinning a process that uses electric force to turn charged polymers into fibres for scaffolds Their scaffolds allowed meat marbling are compatible with multiple cell lines and are scalable br br br Additive manufacturing br br Another proposed way of structuring muscle tissue is additive manufacturing Such a technique was perfected for industrial applications in manufacturing objects made out of plastic metal glass and other synthetic materials The most common variation of the process involves incrementally depositing a filament in layers onto a bed until the object is completed This method will most likely lend itself best to the application of cultured meat as opposed to other types such as binder jetting material jetting or stereolithography that require a specific kind of resin or powder br A filament of muscle cells can be printed into a structure meant to resemble a finished meat product which can then be further processed for cell maturation This technique has been demonstrated in a collaboration between D bioprinting solutions and Aleph Farms that used additive manufacturing to structure turkey cells on the International Space Station D bioprinting has been used to produce steak like cultured meat composed of three types of bovine cell fibers and with a structure of assembled of cell fibers that is similar to original meat br br br Bioreactors br br Scaffolds are placed inside bioreactors so that cell growth and specialization can occur Bioreactors are large machines similar to brewery tanks which expose the cells to a large variety of environmental factors that are necessary to promote either proliferation or differentiation The temperature of the bioreactor must replicate in vivo conditions In the case of mammalian cells this requires heating to C F Alternatively insect cells can be grown at room temperature Most bioreactors are maintained at carbon dioxide Cells can be cultivated in either continuous or fed batch systems The former entails inoculating and harvesting cells in a constant process so that there are always cells in the bioreactor Fed batch systems mean inoculating the cells culturing them and harvesting them in a single period br Stirred tank bioreactors are the most widely used configuration An impeller increases the flow thereby homogenizing the culture media and a diffuser facilitates the exchange of oxygen into the media This system is generally used for suspended cultures but can be used for cells that require attachment to another surface if microcarriers are included Fixed bed bioreactors are commonly used for adherent cultures They feature strips of fibres that are packed together to form a bed to which cells can attach Aerated culture media is circulated through the bed In airlift bioreactors the culture media is aerated into a gaseous form using air bubbles which are then scattered and dispersed amongst the cells Perfusion bioreactors are common configurations for continuous cultivation They continuously drain media saturated with lactic acid that is void of nutrients and fill it with replenished media br br br Challenges br br br Growth factors br The culture media is an essential component of in vitro cultivation It is responsible for providing the macromolecules nutrients and growth factors necessary for cell proliferation Sourcing growth factors is one of the most challenging tasks of cellular agriculture Traditionally it involves the use of fetal bovine serum FBS which is a blood product extracted from fetal cows Besides the argument that its production is unethical it also violates the notion that the cultured meat is produced independent of the use of animals It is also the most costly constituent of cultured meat priced at around per litre Furthermore chemical composition varies greatly depending on the animal so it cannot be uniformly quantified chemically FBS is employed because it conveniently mimics the process of muscle development in vivo The growth factors needed for tissue development are predominantly provided through an animal s bloodstream and no other known fluid can single handedly deliver all these components br The current alternative is to generate each growth factor individually using recombinant protein production In this process the genes coding for the specific factor are integrated into bacteria which are then fermented Due to the added complexity of this process it is particularly expensive Future Fields a Canadian company focused on overcoming the economic and environmental costs of traditional growth media is developing serum free growth factors from fruit flies br The ideal medium would be chemically quantifiable and accessible to ensure simplicity in production cheap and not dependent on animals It will most likely be derived from plants and while this may reduce the possibility of transmitting infectious agents it may induce allergic reactions in some consumers Such culture sera may also require modifications specific to the cell line to which they are applied Companies currently invested in developing effective plant based culture include Multus Media and Biftek br The Good Food Institute GFI put out a report in in support of the concept that cell based meat could be produced at the same cost as ground beef and in they commissioned a report from CE Delft on the Techno Economic Analysis of cultivated meat Another proposed approach is to subject the cell lines to a magnetic field which can stimulate the release of molecules that have regenerative metabolic anti inflammatory and immunity boosting properties acting as an alternative to serum br br br Surface area br A common challenge to bioreactors and scaffolds is developing system configurations that enable all cells to gain exposure to culture media while simultaneously optimizing spatial requirements In the cell proliferation phase prior to the introduction of the scaffold many cell types need to be attached to a surface to support growth As such cells must be grown in confluent monolayers only one cell thick which necessitates a lot of surface area This poses practical challenges on large scales As such systems may incorporate microcarriers small spherical beads of glass or other compatible material that are suspended in the culture medium Cells adhere to these microcarriers as they would to the sides of the bioreactor which increases the amount of surface area br In the cell differentiation phase the cells may be seeded to a scaffold and so do not require the use of microcarriers However in these instances the density of the cells on the scaffold means that not all cells have an interface with culture media leading to cell death and necrotic centers within the meat When muscle is cultivated in vivo this issue is circumvented as the extracellular matrix delivers nutrients into the muscle through blood vessels As such many emerging scaffolds aim to replicate such networks br Similarly scaffolds must simulate many of the other characteristics of the extracellular matrix most notably porosity crystallinity degradation biocompatibility and functionality Few materials that emulate all these characteristics have been identified leading to the possibility of blending different materials with complementary properties br br br Research support br Cellular agriculture research does not have a significant basis of academic interest or funding streams Consequently the majority of research has been undertaken and funded by independent institutions This is incrementally changing as not for profits drive support and interest Notably New Harvest has a fellowship program to support graduate students and groups at various academic institutions Additionally a growing number of governments are funding research in cellular agriculture In August the Grant Management Services of the European Commission awarded a million grant to ORF Genetics That same month the Japanese Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry granted Integriculture million through their New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization br The European Union s Horizon R D funding framework awarded a million grant to a consortium led by BioTech Foods In the Spanish government granted million for Biotech Foods to investigate the potential health benefits of cellular agriculture The National Science Foundation awarded a million grant to a team of researchers at UC Davis for open access cultured meat research Non profits also drive support and interest in the field Notably New Harvest has a fellowship program to support the research of specific graduate students and groups at various academic institutions and the Good Food Institute funds open access research through its Research Grant Program br br br Consumer acceptance br Consumer acceptance of the product is critical A study looking at acceptance of cultured meat in China India and the US found high levels of acceptance of clean meat in the three most populous countries worldwide Several potential factors of consumer acceptance of cultured meat have been identified Healthiness safety nutritional characteristics sustainability taste and lower price are all contributing factors One study found that the use of highly technical language to explain cultured meat led to significantly more negative public attitude towards the concept One study suggested that describing cultured meat in a way that emphasizes the final product rather than the production method was an effective way to improve acceptance br The use of standardized descriptions would improve future research about consumer acceptance of cultured meat Current studies have often reported drastically different rates of acceptance despite similar survey populations Lou Cooperhouse CEO of BlueNalu shared on the Red to Green Podcast that cell based and cell cultured were suitable terms to differentiate it from conventional meat whilst being clear about the process by which it was made There also exists a challenge in how to use these descriptions in labelling For example in the United States there is no overarching federal legislation that regulates how cultured meat should be labeled for the consumer While traditional meat producers are attempting to prevent cultured meat companies from using the term meat cultured meat producers argue that the word is necessary for consumer acceptance br Global market acceptance has not been assessed Studies are attempting to determine the current levels of consumer acceptance and identify methods to improve this value Clear answers are not available although one recent study reported that consumers were willing to pay a premium for cultured meat Low percentages of older adult populations have been reported to show acceptance for cultured meat Green eating behavior educational status and food business were cited as most important factors for this population There is also a lack of studies relating the methods of producing cultured meat with its taste for the consuming public br br br Regulations br In Singapore became the first country in the world to approve cultured meat for sale The Singapore Food Agency has published guidance on its requirements for the safety assessment of novel foods including specific requirements on the information to be submitted for approval of cultivated meat products br In March Italy s Meloni government approved a draft bill banning the production and commercialization of cultivated meat for human and animal consumption this move which the government said was intended to protect food heritage was criticized including by scientists for being at odds with global trends of openness and legalization as misguided and for possibily worsening climate change in Italy By October it was reported the Italian government had retired the draft bill and withdrew the Technical Regulation Information System notification a procedure aimed at preventing the creation of barriers within the European Union s internal market for the bill Francesco Lollobrigida Italy s minister of agriculture said that the withdrawal of the proposed anti cultured meat bill Italy submitted to the European Union is not a step back which many speculated was because the government wanted to avoid a likely rejection by the European Commission He added that the bill was not going to be retired and would move forward Italy became the first country to ban cultured meat in November when the government approved the bill br Regulatory matters must also be sorted out Prior to being available for sale the European Union Australia New Zealand the United Kingdom and Canada require approved novel food applications Additionally the European Union requires that cultured animal products and production must prove safety by an approved company application as of January In September the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the United States Department of Agriculture USDA have agreed to jointly regulate cultured meat Under the agreement the FDA oversees cell collection cell banks and cell growth and differentiation while the USDA oversees the production and labeling of food products derived from the cells that are meant for human consumption Several U S states such as Missouri South Carolina Texas and Washington have passed legislation limiting the use of the term meat on cultured meat packaging Full bans on cultured meat have been enacted in Florida and Alabama in Florida the law makes it a criminal offense to manufacture and sell and in Alabama cultured meat will be illegal to manufacture sell or distribute starting in October The governments of Arizona Kentucky Tennessee and West Virginia are considering similar laws br br br Differences from conventional meat br br br Health br Large scale production of cultured meat may or may not require artificial growth hormones to be added to the culture for meat production As cultured meat is grown in a sterile environment there is no need for antibiotics Today the widespread use of antibiotics in conventional agriculture is the main driver of antibiotic resistance in humans According to the World Health Organization antimicrobial resistance represents an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society predicting up to million deaths annually by Cultured meat could provide an effective solution to help mitigate this major risk to human health br Researchers have suggested that omega fatty acids could be added to cultured meat as a health bonus In a similar way the omega fatty acid content of conventional meat can be increased by altering what the animals are fed Research is currently underway in Spain to develop cultivated meat with healthier fats which could reduce cholesterol and the risk of colon cancer typically associated with red meat consumption An issue of Time magazine suggested that the cell cultured process may also decrease exposure of the meat to bacteria and disease br Due to the strictly controlled and predictable environment cultured meat production has been compared to vertical farming Some of its proponents have predicted that it will have similar benefits in terms of reducing exposure to dangerous chemicals like pesticides and fungicides severe injuries and wildlife There is also a lack of research on the comparison on the health effects of production cultured meat with the industrial meat or the biologic organic meat ways of production br br br Artificiality br Although cultured meat consists of animal muscle cells fat and support cells as well as blood vessels that are the same as in traditional meat some consumers may find the high tech production process unacceptable Cultured meat has been described as fake or Frankenmeat On the other hand cultured meat can be produced without the artificial hormones antibiotics steroids medicine and GMOs commonly used in factory farmed meat and seafood though not used on organic biologic production If a cultured meat product is different in appearance taste smell texture or other factors it may not be commercially competitive with conventionally produced meat The lack of bone and cardiovascular system is a disadvantage for dishes where these parts make appreciable culinary contributions The lack of bones and or blood may make many traditional meat preparations such as buffalo wings more palatable to some people Furthermore blood and bones could potentially be cultured in the future br br br Environment br br Animal production for food is a major cause of air water pollution and carbon emissions Significant questions have been raised about whether the traditional industry can meet the rapidly increasing demands for meat Cultured meat may provide an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional meat production The environmental impacts of cultured meat are expected to be significantly lower than from animal husbandry For every hectare that is used for vertical farming and or cultured meat manufacturing anywhere between and hectares of land may be returned to its natural state Vertical farms in addition to cultured meat facilities could exploit methane digesters to generate a portion of its electrical needs Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the facility into biogas which is generally composed of methane This biogas could be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse or a series of bioreactors br One study reported that cultured meat was potentially much more efficient and environmentally friendly It generated only of greenhouse gas emissions reduced the energy needs of meat production by up to and required only of the land that the global meat livestock industry does In Tuomisto s life cycle analysis claimed that producing kg of meat conventionally requires GJ energy m water m land and emits kg CO eq GHG emissions On the other hand producing the same quantity of meat in vitro has lower energy use lower GHG emissions lower land use and lower water use br The latest study by independent research firm CE Delft shows that compared with conventional beef cultured meat may cause up to less greenhouse gas emissions if renewable energy is used in the production process less pollution up to less land use and less water There are many environmental concerns about intensive poultry farming that too can be reduced by cultivating their meat instead of farming animals These concerns include microorganism and pharmaceutical containing manure entering the water and soil emission of greenhouse gasses such as nitrous oxide and methane and the volatilization of manure particles br Skeptic Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists speculates that the energy and fossil fuel requirements of large scale cultured meat production may be more environmentally destructive than producing food off the land S L Davis speculated that both vertical farming in urban areas and the activity of cultured meat facilities may cause relatively little harm to the wildlife that live around the facilities Dickson Despommier speculated that natural resources may be spared from depletion due to vertical farming and cultured meat One study reported that conventional farming kills ten wild animals per hectare each year br br br Role of genetic modification br Techniques of genetic engineering such as insertion deletion silencing activation or mutation of a gene are not required to produce cultured meat Cultured meat production allows the biological processes that normally occur within an animal to occur without the animal Since cultured meat is grown in a controlled artificial environment some have commented that cultured meat more closely resembles hydroponic vegetables rather than genetically modified vegetables br More research is underway on cultured meat and although cultured meat does not require genetic engineering researchers may employ such techniques to improve quality and sustainability Fortifying cultured meat with nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids is one improvement that can be facilitated through genetic modification The same improvement can be made without genetic modification by manipulating the conditions of the culture medium Genetic modification may be able to enhance muscle cell proliferation The introduction of myogenic regulatory factors growth factors or other gene products into muscle cells may increase production over that of conventional meat br To avoid the use of any animal products the use of photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria has been proposed to produce the main ingredients for the culture media as opposed to fetal bovine or horse serum Some researchers propose that the ability of algae and cyanobacteria to produce ingredients for culture media can be improved with certain technologies most likely not excluding genetic engineering br br br Ethical br Australian bioethicist Julian Savulescu said Artificial meat stops cruelty to animals is better for the environment could be safer and more efficient and even healthier We have a moral obligation to support this kind of research It gets the ethical two thumbs up Animal welfare groups are generally in favor of cultured meat because the culture process does not include a nervous system and therefore does not involve pain or infringement of rights Reactions of vegetarians to cultured meat vary Some feel the cultured meat presented to the public in August was not vegetarian because fetal bovine serum was used in the growth medium However since then cultured meat has been grown with a medium that does not involve bovine serum Philosopher Carlo Alvaro argues that the question of the morality of eating in vitro meat has been discussed only in terms of convenience Alvaro proposes a virtue oriented approach suggesting that the determination to produce cultured meat stems from unvirtuous motives i e lack of temperance and misunderstanding of the role of food in human flourishing br Some have proposed independent inquiries into the standards laws and regulations for cultured meat Just as with many other foods cultured meat needs technically sophisticated production methods that may be difficult for some communities meaning they would lack self sufficiency and be dependent on global food corporations Some projects are focusing on making cellular agriculture accessible to all The open source cellular agriculture initiative Shojinmeat Project has for instance a bottom up approach teaching members of the project to cultivate DIY cultured meat at home br Establishing a similar parallel with cultured meat some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change Environmentalist Dave Riley states that being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us and writes that Mollison insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost br br br Religious considerations br Jewish rabbinical authorities disagree whether cultured meat is kosher meaning acceptable under Jewish law and practice One factor is the nature of the animal from which the cells are sourced whether it is a kosher or non kosher species and whether if the cells were taken from a dead animal slaughter in accordance with religious practice had taken place prior to the extraction of cells Most authorities agree that if the original cells were taken from a religiously slaughtered animal then the meat cultured from it will be kosher Depending on the nature of the cells it may be determined to be kosher even when taken from a live animal and some have argued that it would be kosher even if coming from non kosher animals such as pigs In the issue of lab meat being a non meat product or parve has come up for debate br Islamic dietary practices must also be considered The Islamic Institute of Orange County California said There does not appear to be any objection to eating this type of cultured meat In addition Abdul Qahir Qamar of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy said that cultured meat will not be considered meat from live animals but will be cultured meat As long as the cells are not from pigs dogs and other haram animals the meat would be considered vegetative and similar to yogurt and fermented pickles br Catholicism which excludes eating meat in certain days along the year Lent Holy Week has not pronounced on whether cultivated meat is banned as it happens with meat or not as with any other food as vegetables or fish Hinduism typically excludes the consumption of beef such as steak and burgers Chandra Kaushik president of the Hindu Mahasabha said about cultured beef that he would not accept it being traded in a marketplace in any form or being used for a commercial purpose br br br Economic br Cultured meat is significantly more costly than conventional meat In a March interview Post said that the marginal cost of his team s original burger was now He estimated that technological advancements would allow the product to be cost competitive to traditionally sourced beef in approximately ten years In Memphis Meats reduced the cost of production to per pound In Eat Just said it cost about US to produce one chicken nugget The company s cultured chicken nuggets now available at Singapore restaurant retail around US as part of a set meal however this retail price is below cost As of most companies report a production cost of or more per meal sized serving A study estimated that with current technology the actual production cost of cultured meat was over per kilogram A study estimated that if dramatic advances drove medium costs down to per liter large scale production costs might optimistically fall to per kilogram over the next few years The main drivers of cost would be growth medium accounting for kg labor kg and bioreactor repairs kg Competing with wholesale beef kg would require reducing all three of these costs br br br Farmers br A scientific paper published in Front Sustain Food Syst addresses the social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and plant based meat for rural producers According to this research cellular agriculture offers opportunities such as growing crops as ingredients for feedstock for cultured meat raising animals for genetic material for cultured meat producing cultured meat in bioreactors at the farm level transitioning into new sectors new market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal and alt meat products and new value around regenerative or high animal welfare farming Some challenges are also identified with possible loss of livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for farmers growing crops for animal feed barriers to transitioning into emerging alt meat sectors and the possibility of exclusion from those sectors br Some farmers already see the potential of cellular agriculture For instance Illtud Dunsford comes from a long line of farmers in Wales and established his cultured meat company Cellular Agriculture Ltd in br br br Continuing development br br br Education br In Maastricht University hosted the first International Conference on Cultured Meat New Harvest a c research institute as well as The Good Food Institute host annual conferences to convene industry leaders scientists investors and potential collaborators The two organizations also fund public research and produce educational content Organizations such as the Cellular Agriculture Society Cellular Agriculture Canada Cellular Agriculture France Cellular Agriculture Australia and Cellular Agriculture New Zealand were founded to advocate for cultured meat in their respective countries Publications such as Cell Agri and Protein Report have also provided

has often featured in science fiction The earliest mention may be in Two Planets by Kurd Lasswitz where synthetic meat is one of the varieties of synthetic food introduced on Earth by Martians Other notable books mentioning artificial meat include Ashes Ashes by Ren Barjavel The Space Merchants by Frederik Pohl and C M Kornbluth The Restaurant at the End of the Universe by Douglas Adams Le Transperceneige Snowpiercer by Jacques Lob and Jean Marc Rochette Neuromancer by William Gibson Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood Deadstock by Jeffrey Thomas Accelerando by Charles Stross Ware Tetralogy by Rudy Rucker Divergent by Veronica Roth and the Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold br In film artificial meat has featured prominently in Giulio Questi s drama La morte ha fatto l uovo Death Laid an Egg and Claude Zidi s comedy L aile ou la cuisse The Wing or the Thigh Man made chickens also appear in David Lynch s surrealist horror Eraserhead Most recently it was also featured prominently as the central theme of the movie Antiviral The Starship Enterprise from the TV and movie franchise Star Trek apparently provides a synthetic meat although crews from The Next Generation and later use replicators In the ABC sitcom Better Off Ted the episode Heroes features Phil Jonathan Slavin and Lem Malcolm Barrett trying to grow cowless beef br In the movie Galaxy Quest during the dinner scene Tim Allen s character refers to his steak tasting like real Iowa beef In the videogame Project Eden the player characters investigate a cultured meat company called Real Meat In The Expanse vat grown meat is produced to feed the people who live on spaceships space stations away from Earth due to the exorbitant cost of importing real meat Cultured meat was a subject on an episode of The Colbert Report on March br In February a biotech startup called BiteLabs ran a campaign to generate popular support for artisanal salami made with meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples The campaign became popular on Twitter where users tweeted at celebrities asking them to donate muscle cells to the project Media reactions to BiteLabs variously identified the startup as a satire on startup culture celebrity culture or as a discussion prompt on bioethical concerns While BiteLabs claimed to be inspired by the success of Sergey Brin s burger the company is seen as an example of critical design rather than an actual business venture br In late cultured meat was involved in a case in the episode How The Sausage Is Made of CBS show Elementary Cultured meat was profiled in the Canadian documentary film Meat the Future In the video game Cyberpunk multiple cultured meat products are for sale due to the high cost of natural meat This includes EEZYBEEF made from in vitro cultured muscle cells taken from cattle and the flatworm culture based Orgiatic which comes in several flavors br br br Related processes br br br Fermentation br Acellular agriculture is producing animal products synthesized from non living material Such products include milk honey eggs cheese and gelatin which are made of various proteins rather than cells These proteins must be fermented much like in recombinant protein production alcohol brewing and the generation of many plant based products like tofu tempeh and sauerkraut br br Proteins are coded for by specific genes the genes coding for the protein of interest are synthesized into a plasmid a closed loop of double helical genetic information This plasmid called recombinant DNA is then inserted into a bacterial specimen For this to happen the bacteria needs to be competent i e able to accept foreign extracellular DNA and able to horizontally transfer genes i e integrate the foreign genes into its own DNA Horizontal gene transfer is significantly more challenging in eukaryotic organisms than prokaryotic organisms because the former have both a cell membrane and a nuclear membrane which the plasmid needs to penetrate whereas prokaryotic organisms only have a cell membrane For this reason prokaryotic bacteria are often favoured In order to make such a bacteria temporarily competent it can be exposed to a salt such as calcium chloride which neutralizes the negative charges on the cell membrane s phosphate heads as well as the negative charges on the plasmid to prevent the two from repelling The bacteria can incubate in warm water opening large pores on the cell surface through which the plasmid can enter br Next the bacteria is fermented in sugar which encourages it to grow and duplicate In the process it expresses its DNA as well as the transferred plasmid resulting in protein Finally the solution is purified to separate out the residual protein This can be done by introducing an antibody raised against the protein of interest that will kill bacteria cells that do not contain the protein Through centrifugation the solution can be spun around an axis with sufficient force to separate solids from liquids Alternatively it could be soaked in a buffered ionic solution that employs osmosis to leach the water from bacteria and kill them br br br See also br Cellular agriculture society br List
