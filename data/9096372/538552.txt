The Great Ape Project GAP founded in is an international organization of primatologists anthropologists ethicists and others who advocate a United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Great Apes that would confer basic legal rights on non human great apes bonobos chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans br The rights suggested are the right to life the protection of individual liberty and the prohibition of torture The organization also monitors individual great ape activity in the United States through a census program Once rights are established GAP would demand the release of great apes from captivity currently are held in the U S including in biomedical research facilities br br br The Great Ape Project book br The book The Great Ape Project Equality Beyond Humanity edited by philosophers Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer features contributions from thirty four authors including Jane Goodall and Richard Dawkins who have submitted articles voicing their support for the project The authors write that human beings are intelligent animals with a varied social emotional and cognitive life If great apes also display such attributes the authors argue they deserve the same consideration humans extend to members of their own species br The book highlights findings that support the capacity of great apes to possess rationality and self consciousness and the ability to be aware of themselves as distinct entities with a past and future Documented conversations in sign languages with individual great apes are the basis for these findings Other subjects addressed within the book include the division placed between humans and great apes great apes as persons progress in gaining rights for the severely intellectually disabled once an overlooked minority and the situation of great apes in the world today br br br World Declaration on Great Apes br The Great Ape Project is campaigning to have the United Nations endorse a World Declaration on Great Apes This would extend what the project calls the community of equals to include chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans The declaration seeks to extend to non human great apes the protection of three basic interests the right to life the protection of individual liberty and the prohibition of torture br br br Right to life br The declaration states that members of the community of equals which includes humans have an essential right to life and may not be killed except in certain strictly defined circumstances such as self defense br br br Protection of individual liberty br The declaration states that members of the community of equals are not to be deprived of their liberty and are entitled to immediate release where there has been no form of due process Under the proposed declaration the detention of great apes who have not been convicted of any crime or who are not criminally liable should be permitted only where it can be shown that the detention is in their own interests or is necessary to protect the public The declaration says there must be a right of appeal either directly or through an advocate to a judicial tribunal br br br Prohibition of torture br The declaration prohibits the torture defined as the deliberate infliction of severe pain on any great ape whether wantonly or because of a perceived benefit to others br Under International Human Rights Law this is a jus cogens principle and under all major human rights documents it cannot at any time be derogated by any State br br br Opposition br Professor Colin Blakemore head of the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom from is opposed to granting rights to non human apes stating I can see no current necessity for the use of great apes and I m pleased that they re not being used and that every effort is being made to reduce the use of other primates But I worry about the principle of where the moral boundaries lie There is only one very secure definition that can be made and that is between our species and others Blakemore suggests that it would be necessary to perform research on great apes if humans were threatened by a pandemic virus that afflicted only humans and other great apes The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection described Blakemore s stance as backward looking br br br Recent developments br br br United States br A study commissioned by the National Institute of Health NIH and conducted by the Institute of Medicine IOM concluded in a report see report brief released on December that while the chimpanzee has been a valuable animal model in past research most current use of chimpanzees for biomedical research is unnecessary The primary recommendation is that the use of chimpanzees in research be guided by a set of principles and criteria in effect to greatly limit government funded research using chimpanzees Falling short of calling for the out right ban of using chimpanzees for research the report acknowledged that new emerging or re emerging diseases may require the use of chimpanzees echoing Professor Colin Blakemore s concern br Francis Collins Director of NIH announced on the same day the report was released that he accepted the recommendations and will develop the implementation plan which includes the forming of an expert committee to review all submitted grant applications and projects already underway involving the use of chimpanzees Furthermore no new grant applications using chimpanzees will be reviewed until further notice br On September NIH announced that chimpanzees owned by the government will be retired NIH owns about chimpanzees for research this move signifies the first step to wind down NIH s investment in chimpanzee research according to Francis Collins Currently housed at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana of the retired chimpanzees will go to the chimpanzee sanctuary Chimp Haven while the rest will go to Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio br However concerns over the chimpanzee s status in the Texas Biomedical Research Institute as research ineligible rather than retired prompted NIH to reconsider the plan and it announced on October that as many chimpanzees as possible will be relocated to Chimp Haven by August and eventually all will move there br On January a NIH task force released a report calling for the government to retire most of the chimpanzees the U S government support The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of primates for future research Other approaches such as genetically altered mice should be developed and refined br On November the U S House of Representatives and the U S Senate passed The Chimpanzee Health Improvement Maintenance and Protection Act approving the funding to expand the capacity of Chimp Haven and other chimpanzee sanctuaries thus allowing the transfer of almost all of the apes owned by the federal government to live in a more natural and group environment than in the laboratory The transfer is expected to take five years when all but chimpanzees which will remain with the NIH will be retired br br br Germany br The Great Ape Project achieved many of its goals in its early years New Zealand completely banned invasive experiments on great apes in as did the Balearic Islands an autonomous region of the monarchy of Spain in deciding to implement certain fundamental rights for great apes in their code of law However the project entered a long period of political stagnation in Europe All hopes that the achievements on the Balearic Islands would spark off further steps on the mainland of Spain and from there to other European countries proved to be futile Efforts in Spain were largely curtailed due to the influence of the Catholic Church obstructing the project s goals In however the project was given an official relaunch in Germany supported by the Germany based Giordano Bruno Stiftung br Great Ape Project Germany filed an official law initiative in spring of to have the aforesaid fundamental rights for great apes implemented into the constitutional law of the Federal Republic of Germany The goal was and still is to have the animal welfare law extended to specifically grant the great apes the rights needed to give them the chance to have legal guardians representing their interests In analogy to infants or of people suffering from dementia or Alzheimer disease who cannot speak for themselves legal guardians could file lawsuits against anyone violating the fundamental rights of the apes Right now there are only animal protection laws giving the animals no active legitimization br br br See also br br Great ape language br Great ape
