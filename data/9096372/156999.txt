A circus is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that may include clowns acrobats trained animals trapeze acts musicians dancers hoopers tightrope walkers jugglers magicians ventriloquists and unicyclists as well as other object manipulation and stunt oriented artists The term circus also describes the field of performance training and community which has followed various formats through its year modern history Although not the inventor of the medium Newcastle under Lyme born Philip Astley is credited as the father of the modern circus br In Astley a skilled equestrian began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha Penny Hatch on the south side of the Thames River England In he hired acrobats tightrope walkers jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a circus Performances developed significantly over the next fifty years with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature The format in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music often termed traditional or classical circus developed in the latter part of the th century and remained the dominant format until the s br As styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley so too have the types of venue where these circuses have performed The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited covered seating From the late th to late th century custom made circus buildings often wooden were built with various types of seating a centre ring and sometimes a stage The traditional large tents commonly known as big tops were introduced in the mid th century as touring circuses superseded static venues These tents eventually became the most common venue Contemporary circus is performed in a variety of venues including tents theatres casinos cruise ships and open air spaces Many circus performances are still held in a ring usually m ft in diameter This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks br A shift in form has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late s when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry Circus companies and artistes within this movement often termed new circus or cirque nouveau have tended to favour a theatrical approach combining character driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories Since the s a more avant garde approach to presenting traditional circus techniques or disciplines in ways that align more closely to performance art dance or visual arts has been given the name contemporary circus This labelling can cause confusion based upon the other use of the phrase contemporary circus to mean circus of today For this reason some commentators have begun using the term st Century Circus to encompass all the various styles available in the present day st Century Circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills techniques and stylistic influences from other art forms and technological developments For aesthetic or economic reasons st Century Circus productions may often be staged in theatres rather than in large outdoor tents br br br Etymology br First attested in English th century the word circus derives from Latin circus which is the romanisation of the Greek kirkos itself a metathesis of the Homeric Greek krikos meaning circle or ring In the book De Spectaculis early Christian writer Tertullian claimed that the first circus games were staged by the goddess Circe in honour of her father Helios the Sun God br br br History br br The modern and commonly held idea of a circus is of a Big Top with various acts providing entertainment therein however the history of circuses is more complex with historians disagreeing on its origin as well as revisions being done about the history due to the changing nature of historical research and the ongoing circus phenomenon For many circus history begins with Englishman Philip Astley while for others its origins go back much further to Roman Empire times br br br Origin br In Ancient Rome the circus was a roofless arena for the exhibition of horse and chariot races equestrian shows staged battles gladiatorial combat and displays of and fights with trained animals The circuses of Rome were similar to the ancient Greek hippodromes although circuses served varying purposes and differed in design and construction and for events that involved re enactments of naval battles the circus was flooded with water however the Roman circus buildings were not circular but rectangular with semi circular ends The lower seats were reserved for persons of rank there were also various state boxes for the giver of the games and his friends The circus was the only public spectacle at which men and women were not separated Some circus historians such as George Speaight have stated these performances may have taken place in the great arenas that were called circuses by the Romans but it is a mistake to equate these places or the entertainments presented there with the modern circus Others have argued that the lineage of the circus does go back to the Roman circuses and a chronology of circus related entertainment can be traced to Roman times continued by the Hippodrome of Constantinople that operated until the th century through medieval and renaissance jesters minstrels and troubadours to the late th century and the time of Astley br The first circus in the city of Rome was the Circus Maximus in the valley between the Palatine and Aventine hills It was constructed during the monarchy and at first built completely from wood After being rebuilt several times the final version of the Circus Maximus could seat people it was built of stone and measured m in length and m in width Next in importance were the Circus Flaminius and the Circus Neronis from the notoriety which it obtained through the Circensian pleasures of Nero A fourth circus was constructed by Maxentius its ruins have helped archaeologists reconstruct the Roman circus br For some time after the fall of Rome large circus buildings fell out of use as centres of mass entertainment Instead itinerant performers animal trainers and showmen travelled between towns throughout Europe performing at local fairs such as the Bartholomew Fair in London during the Middle Ages br br br Modern format br br br Astley and early British circus br br The origin of the modern circus has been attributed to Philip Astley who was born in Newcastle under Lyme England He became a cavalry officer who set up the first modern amphitheatre for the display of horse riding tricks in Lambeth London on April Astley did not originate trick horse riding nor was he first to introduce acts such as acrobats and clowns to the English public but he was the first to create a space where all these acts were brought together to perform a show Astley rode in a circle rather than a straight line as his rivals did and thus chanced on the format of performing in a circle Astley performed stunts in a ft diameter ring which is the standard size used by circuses ever since Astley referred to the performance arena as a circle and the building as an amphitheatre these would later be known as a circus In Astley hired acrobats tightrope walkers jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between acts br br Astley was followed by Andrew Ducrow whose feats of horsemanship had much to do with establishing the traditions of the circus which were perpetuated by Hengler s and Sanger s celebrated shows in a later generation In England circuses were often held in purpose built buildings in large cities such as the London Hippodrome which was built as a combination of the circus the menagerie and the variety theatre where wild animals such as lions and elephants from time to time appeared in the ring and where convulsions of nature such as floods earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were produced with an extraordinary wealth of realistic display Joseph Grimaldi the first mainstream clown had his first major role as Little Clown in the pantomime The Triumph of Mirth or Harlequin s Wedding in The Royal Circus was opened in London on November by Charles Dibdin who coined the term circus aided by his partner Charles Hughes an equestrian performer In Astley established the Amphith tre Anglais in Paris the first purpose built circus in France followed by other permanent circuses in cities throughout Europe Astley leased his Parisian circus to the Italian Antonio Franconi in In the first circus took place under a canvas big top br br br Ricketts and the first American circus br The Englishman John Bill Ricketts brought the first modern circus to the United States He began his theatrical career with Hughes Royal Circus in London in the s and travelled from England in to establish his first circus in Philadelphia The first circus building in the US opened on April in Philadelphia where Ricketts gave America s first complete circus performance George Washington attended a performance there later that season br br br Expansion of the American format br br In the Americas during the first two decades of the th century the Circus of Pepin and Breschard toured from Montreal to Havana building circus theatres in many of the cities it visited Victor P pin a native New Yorker was the first American to operate a major circus in the United States Later the establishments of Purdy Welch Co and of van Amburgh gave a wider popularity to the circus in the United States In Joshuah Purdy Brown was the first circus owner to use a large canvas tent for the circus performance Circus pioneer Dan Rice was the most famous pre Civil War circus clown popularising such expressions as The One Horse Show and Hey Rube The American circus was revolutionised by P T Barnum and William Cameron Coup who launched the travelling P T Barnum s Museum Menagerie Circus the first freak show in the s Coup also introduced the first multiple ring circuses and was also the first circus entrepreneur to use circus trains to transport the circus between towns By the s sideshows were also being established alongside travelling circuses br br br Touring br In the equestrian Thomas Taplin Cooke returned to England from the United States bringing with him a circus tent At this time itinerant circuses that could be fitted up quickly were becoming popular in Britain William Batty s circus for example between and travelled from Newcastle to Edinburgh and then to Portsmouth and Southampton Pablo Fanque who is noteworthy as Britain s only black circus proprietor and who operated one of the most celebrated travelling circuses in Victorian England erected temporary structures for his limited engagements or retrofitted existing structures One such structure in Leeds which Fanque assumed from a departing circus collapsed resulting in minor injuries to many but the death of Fanque s wife Traveling circus companies also rented the land they set up their structures on sometimes causing damage to the local ecosystems Three important circus innovators were the Italian Giuseppe Chiarini and Frenchmen Louis Soullier and Jacques Tourniaire whose early travelling circuses introduced the circus to Latin America Australia Southeast Asia China South Africa and Russia Soullier was the first circus owner to introduce Chinese acrobatics to the European circus when he returned from his travels in and Tourniaire was the first to introduce the performing art to Ranga where it became extremely popular br br After an merger with James Anthony Bailey and James L Hutchinson s circus and Barnum s death in his circus travelled to Europe as the Barnum Bailey Greatest Show On Earth where it toured from to impressing other circus owners with its large scale its touring techniques including the tent and circus train and its combination of circus acts a zoological exhibition and a freak show This format was adopted by European circuses at the turn of the th century br The influence of the American circus brought about a considerable change in the character of the modern circus In arenas too large for speech to be easily audible the traditional comic dialogue of the clown assumed a less prominent place than formerly while the vastly increased wealth of stage properties relegated to the background the old fashioned equestrian feats which were replaced by more ambitious acrobatic performances and by exhibitions of skill strength and daring requiring the employment of immense numbers of performers and often of complicated and expensive machinery br br From the late th century through the first half of the th century travelling circuses were a major form of spectator entertainment in the US and attracted huge attention whenever they arrived in a city After World War II the popularity of the circus declined as new forms of entertainment such as television arrived and the public s tastes changed From the s onward circuses attracted growing criticism from animal rights activists Many circuses went out of business or were forced to merge with other circus companies Nonetheless a good number of travelling circuses are still active in various parts of the world ranging from small family enterprises to three ring extravaganzas Other companies found new ways to draw in the public with innovative new approaches to the circus form itself br br br Russia br In Lenin head of Soviet Russia expressed a wish for the circus to become the people s art form with facilities and status on par with theatre opera and ballet The USSR nationalised Russian circuses In the State University of Circus and Variety Arts better known as the Moscow Circus School was established performers were trained using methods developed from the Soviet gymnastics programme When the Moscow State Circus company began international tours in the s its levels of originality and artistic skill were widely applauded br br br China br Circuses from China drawing on Chinese traditions of acrobatics like the Chinese State Circus are also popular touring acts br br br New Circus br br New Circus originally known as cirque nouveau is a performing arts movement that originated in the s in Australia Canada France the West Coast of the United States and the United Kingdom New Circus combines traditional circus skills and theatrical techniques to convey a story or theme Compared with the traditional circus this genre of circus tends to focus more attention on the overall aesthetic impact on character and story development and on the use of lighting design original music and costume design to convey thematic or narrative content Music used in the production is often composed exclusively for that production and aesthetic influences are drawn as much from contemporary culture as from circus history Animal acts rarely appear in new circus in contrast to traditional circus where animal acts have often been a significant part of the entertainment br Early pioneers of the new circus genre included Circus Oz forged in Australia in from SoapBox Circus and New Circus the Pickle Family Circus founded in San Francisco in Ra Ra Zoo in in London Nofit State Circus in from Wales Cirque du Soleil founded in Quebec in Cirque Plume and Archaos from France in and respectively More recent examples include Cirque loize founded in Quebec in Sweden s Cirkus Cirk r Teatro ZinZanni founded in Seattle in the West African Circus Baobab late s and Montreal s Les doigts de la main founded in The genre includes other circus troupes such as the Vermont based Circus Smirkus founded in by Rob Mermin and Le Cirque Imaginaire later renamed Le Cirque Invisible both founded and directed by Victoria Chaplin daughter of Charlie Chaplin br The most conspicuous success story in the new circus genre has been that of Cirque du Soleil the Canadian circus company whose estimated annual revenue exceeds US million in and whose cirque nouveau shows have been seen by nearly million spectators in over cities on five continents br br br Contemporary Circus br br The genre of contemporary circus is largely considered to have begun in with Le Cri du Cam l on an ensemble performance from the graduating class of the French circus school Le Centre National des Arts du Cirque CNAC directed by Joseph Nadj In contrast to New Circus Contemporary Circus as a genre tends to avoid linear narrative in favour of more suggestive interdisciplinary approaches to abstract concepts This includes a strong trend for developing new apparatus and movement languages based on the capacities experience and interests of individual performers rather than finding new ways to present traditional repertoire br br br Social Circus br br Beyond the performance aspect of circus is the Social Circus field catalysed by Reg Bolton Social Circus engages communities through circus practice and activity to provide health and well being benefits br br br Performance br br A traditional circus performance is often led by a ringmaster who has a role similar to a Master of Ceremonies The ringmaster presents performers speaks to the audience and generally keeps the show moving The activity of the circus traditionally takes place within a ring large circuses may have multiple rings like the six ringed Moscow State Circus A circus often travels with its own band whose instrumentation in the United States has traditionally included brass instruments drums glockenspiel and sometimes the distinctive sound of the calliope Performers have been traditionally referred to as artistes although in recent years the term artists has also come into regular use To some performers from multi generational circus families the term artiste is still preferred as it is considered to confer higher status than artist Conversely some performers from the circus school training route taken by many of the newer generations prefer the term artist as it is considered to be less pretentious than artiste The physical and creative skills that circus artist es perform are known as disciplines and are often grouped for training purposes into the broad categories of juggling equilibristics acrobatics aerial and clowning These disciplines can be honed into individual acts which can be performed independently and marketed to many different prospective circus employers and also used for devising solo or collaborative work created specifically for a single project br br br Acts br br Common acts include a variety of acrobatics gymnastics including tumbling and trampoline aerial acts such as trapeze aerial silk corde lisse contortion stilt walking and a variety of other routines Juggling is one of the most common acts in a circus the combination of juggling and gymnastics that includes acts like plate spinning and the rolling globe come under the category equilibristics along with more classical balance disciplines such as tightwire slackline and unicycle Acts like these are some of the most common and the most traditional Clowns are common to most circuses and are typically skilled in many circus acts clowns getting into the act is a very familiar theme in any circus Famous circus clowns have included Austin Miles the Fratellini Family Rusty Russell Emmett Kelly Grock and Bill Irwin The title clown refers to the role functions and performance skills not simply to the image of red nose and exaggerated facepaint that was popularised through th Century mass media While many clowns still perform in this styling there are also many clowns who adopt a more natural look br Daredevil stunt acts freak shows and sideshow acts are also parts of some circus acts these activities may include human cannonball chapeaugraphy fire eating breathing and dancing knife throwing magic shows sword swallowing or strongman Famous sideshow performers include Zip the Pinhead and The Doll Family A popular sideshow attraction from the early th century was the flea circus where fleas were attached to props and viewed through a Fresnel lens br br br Animal acts br br A variety of animals have historically been used in acts While the types of animals used vary from circus to circus big cats namely lions tigers and leopards foxes wolves polecats minks weasels camels llamas elephants zebras horses donkeys birds like parrots and doves sea lions bears monkeys and domestic animals such as cats and dogs are the most common br The earliest involvement of animals in circus was just the display of exotic creatures in a menagerie Going as far back as the early eighteenth century exotic animals were transported to North America for display and menageries were a popular form of entertainment The first true animals acts in the circus were equestrian acts Soon elephants and big cats were displayed as well Isaac A Van Amburgh entered a cage with several big cats in and is generally considered to be the first wild animal trainer in American circus history Mabel Stark was a famous female tiger tamer br br br Controversy and laws br br Animal rights groups have documented many cases of animal cruelty in the training of performing circus animals The animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals PETA contends that animals in circuses are frequently beaten into submission and that physical abuse has always been the method for training circus animals It is also alleged that the animals are kept in cages that are too small and are given very little opportunity to walk around outside of their enclosure thereby violating their right to freedom br br br United States br br According to PETA although the US Animal Welfare Act does not permit any sort of punishment that puts the animals in discomfort trainers will still go against this law and use such things as electric rods and bullhooks According to PETA during an undercover investigation of Carson Barnes Circus video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to beat the elephants with a bullhook as hard as they can and sink the sharp metal hook into the elephant s flesh and twist it until they scream in pain br On behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture Nature and Food Quality of the Netherlands Wageningen University conducted an investigation into the welfare of circus animals in The following issues among others were found br br of the observed animals had medical problems br of tigers and lions did not have access to an outdoor enclosure br Lions spend on average of their time indoors br An average enclosure for tigers is only m br Elephants are shackled in chains for hours a day on average br Elephants spend on average hours a day showing stereotypic behaviour br Tigers are terrified of fire but are still forced to jump through fire rings br Since there have been over cases of lion attacks at circuses br Animals are trained through discipline br Based on these findings the researchers called for more stringent regulation regarding the welfare of circus animals In the Dutch government announced a ban on the use of wild circus animals br In testimony in U S District Court in Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind the ears under the chin and on their legs with metal tipped prods called bullhooks Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers Feld also acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device known as a hot shot or electric prod on an elephant which Feld also stated was appropriate practice Feld denied that any of these practices harm elephants In its January verdict on the case brought against Feld Entertainment International by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals et al the Court ruled that evidence against the circus company was not credible with regard to the allegations In lieu of a USDA hearing Feld Entertainment Inc parent of Ringling Bros agreed to pay an unprecedented fine for violations of the Animal Welfare Act that allegedly occurred between June and August br A year litigation against the Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus came to an end in when The Humane Society of the United States and a number of other animal rights groups paid a million settlement to Feld Entertainment however the circus closed in May after a year run when it experienced a steep decline in ticket sales a year after it discontinued its elephant act and sent its pachyderms to a reserve br On February at the Great American Circus in Palm Bay Florida an elephant named Janet February went out of control while giving a ride to a mother her two children and three other children The elephant then stampeded through the circus grounds outside before being shot to death by police Also during a Circus International performance in Honolulu Hawaii on August an elephant called Tyke August killed her trainer Allen Campbell and severely mauled her groomer Dallas Beckwith in front of hundreds of spectators Tyke then bolted from the arena and ran through the streets of Kakaako for more than thirty minutes Police fired shots at Tyke who eventually collapsed from the wounds and died br In December New Jersey became the first state in the U S to ban circuses carnivals and fairs from featuring elephants tigers and other exotic animals br br br England br In in the United Kingdom a parliamentary working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions and treatment of animals in UK circuses All members of this group agreed that a change in the law was needed to protect circus animals Gale told the BBC It s undignified and the conditions under which they are kept are woefully inadequate the cages are too small the environments they live in are not suitable and many of us believe the time has come for that practice to end The group reported concerns about boredom and stress and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation however in a different working group under the UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare found an absence of scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom According to that group s report published in October there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments br A ban prohibiting the use of wild animals in circuses in England was due to be passed in but Conservative MP Christopher Chope repeatedly blocked the bill under the reasoning that The EU Membership Costs and Benefits bill should have been called by the clerk before the circuses bill so I raised a point of order He explained that the circus bill was at the bottom of the list for discussion The Animal Defenders International non profit group dubbed this a huge embarrassment for Britain that other nations have taken action before us on this simple and popular measure On May Environmental Secretary Michael Gove announced a new Bill to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses The Wild Animals in Circuses Act came into effect on January br br br Wales br br A bill to ban the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Wales was introduced in June and subsequently passed by the Welsh Parliament on July Over responses were made by the people of Wales to the public consultation on the draft Bill of which supported the ban br br br Scotland br The use of wild animals in travelling circuses has been banned in Scotland The Wild Animals in Travelling Circuses Scotland Act came into force on May br br br Worldwide br br There are nationwide bans on using some if not all animals in circuses in Austria Belgium Bolivia Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria Colombia Costa Rica Croatia Cyprus Czech Republic Denmark Ecuador El Salvador Estonia Finland Greece Hungary India Iran Ireland Israel Italy Malta Mexico Netherlands Norway Panama Paraguay Peru Poland Portugal Singapore Slovenia Sweden Switzerland and Turkey Germany Spain United Kingdom Australia Argentina Chile Brazil Canada and the United States have locally restricted or banned the use of animals in entertainment In response to a growing popular concern about the use of animals in entertainment animal free circuses are becoming more common around the world In Bolivia passed legislation banning the use of any animals wild or domestic in circuses The law states that circuses constitute an act of cruelty Circus operators had one year from the bill s passage on July to comply In in Germany an accident with an elephant during a circus performance prompted calls to ban animal performances in circuses PETA called the German politicians to outlaw the keeping of animals for circuses br A survey confirmed that on average wild animals spend around to percent of their time in cages wagons or enclosure due to transportation This causes a huge amount of distress to animals and leads to excessive amounts of drooling br City ordinances banning performances by wild animals have been enacted in San Francisco Los Angeles and New York City br Greece became the first European country to ban any animal from performing in any circus in its territory in February following a campaign by Animal Defenders International and the Greek Animal Welfare Fund GAWF br On June the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe adopted a position paper in which it recommends the prohibition of the use of wild animals in travelling circuses br Despite the contemporary circus shift toward more theatrical techniques and its emphasis on human rather than animal performance traditional circus companies still exist alongside the new movement Numerous circuses continue to maintain animal performers including UniverSoul Circus and the Big Apple Circus from the United States Circus Krone from Munich Circus Royale and Lennon Bros Circus from
