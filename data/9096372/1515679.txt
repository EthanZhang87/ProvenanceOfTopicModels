title: Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)
id: 1515679
According to the Deuteronomistic history in the Hebrew Bible a United Monarchy or United Kingdom of Israel existed under the reigns of Saul Eshbaal David and Solomon encompassing the territories of both the later kingdoms of Judah and Israel br br Whether the United Monarchy existed and if so to what extent is a matter of ongoing academic debate and scholars remain divided among those who support the historicity of the biblical narrative those who doubt or dismiss it and those who support the kingdom s theoretical existence while maintaining that the biblical narrative is exaggerated Proponents of the kingdom s existence traditionally date it to between c BCE and c BCE br In the s Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein contended that existing archaeological evidence for the United Monarchy in the th century BCE should be dated to the th century BCE This model placed the biblical kingdom in Iron Age I suggesting that it was not functioning as a country under centralized governance but rather as tribal chiefdom over a small polity in Judah disconnected from the north s Israelite tribes The rival chronology of Israeli archaeologist Amihai Mazar places the relevant period beginning in the early th century BCE and ending in the mid th century BCE addressing the problems of the traditional chronology while still aligning pertinent findings with the time of Saul David and Solomon Mazar s chronology and the traditional one have been fairly widely accepted though there is no current consensus on the topic Recent archaeological discoveries by Israeli archaeologists Eilat Mazar and Yosef Garfinkel in Jerusalem and Khirbet Qeiyafa respectively seem to support the existence of the United Monarchy but the dating and identifications are not universally accepted br According to the biblical account on the succession of Solomon s son Rehoboam the United Monarchy would have split into two separate kingdoms the Kingdom of Israel in the north containing the cities of Shechem and Samaria and the Kingdom of Judah in the south containing Jerusalem and the Jewish Temple br br br Archaeological record br br In and Israel Finkelstein published two papers where he proposed a Low Chronology for the stratigraphy of Iron Age Israel Finkelstein s model would push stratigraphic dates assigned by the conventional chronology by up to a century later so Finkelstein concluded that much of the monumental architecture characterizing Israel in the th century BCE that biblical United Monarchy has been traditionally associated with instead belongs to the th century Finkelstein wrote that Accepting the Low Chronology means stripping the United Monarchy of monumental buildings including ashlar masonry and proto Ionic capitals According to Finkelstein and Neil Silberman the authors of The Bible Unearthed ideas of a united monarchy is not accurate history but creative expressions of a powerful religious reform movement that are possibly based on certain historical kernels Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real kings of Judah around the th century BCE but they cite the fact that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel dates to about BCE and that to the Kingdom of Judah dates to about BCE Some see the united monarchy as fabricated during the Babylonian Exile transforming David and Solomon from local folk heroes into rulers of international status Finkelstein has posited a potential United Monarchy under Jeroboam II in the th century BCE whereas the former one was potentially invented during the reign of Josiah to justify his territorial expansion br Finkelstein s views have been strongly criticized by Amihai Mazar in response Mazar proposed the Modified Conventional Chronology which places the beginning of the Iron IIA period in the early th century and its end in the mid th century solving the problems of the High Chronology while still dating the archeological discoveries to the th century BCE Finkelstein s Low Chronology and views about the monarchy have received strong criticism from other scholars including Amnon Ben Tor William G Dever Kenneth Kitchen Doron Ben Ami Raz Kletter and Lawrence Stager br Though Am lie Kuhrt acknowledges that there are no royal inscriptions from the time of the united monarchy indeed very little written material altogether and not a single contemporary reference to either David or Solomon she concludes Against this must be set the evidence for substantial development and growth at several sites which is plausibly related to the tenth century Kenneth Kitchen University of Liverpool reaches a similar conclusion arguing that the physical archaeology of tenth century Canaan is consistent with the former existence of a unified state on its terrain br On August archaeologist Eilat Mazar announced that she had discovered in Jerusalem what may have been the palace of King David Now referred to as the Large Stone structure Mazar s discovery consists of a public building she dated from the th century BCE a copper scroll pottery from the same period and a clay bulla or inscribed seal of Jehucal son of Shelemiah son of Shevi an official mentioned at least twice in the Book of Jeremiah In July she also found a second bulla belonging to Gedaliah ben Pashhur who is mentioned together with Jehucal in Jeremiah Amihai Mazar called the find something of a miracle He has said that he believes the building may be the Fortress of Zion that David is said to have captured Other scholars are skeptical that the foundation walls are from David s palace Garfinkel also claimed to have discovered David s palace in kilometres away at Khirbet Qeiyafa br br Excavations at Khirbet Qeiyafa an Iron Age site in Judah found an urbanized settlement radiocarbon dated well before scholars such as Finkelstein suggest that urbanization had begun in Judah which supports the existence of an urbanized kingdom in the th century BCE The Israel Antiquities Authority stated The excavations at Khirbat Qeiyafa reveal an urban society that existed in Judah already in the late eleventh century BCE It can no longer be argued that the Kingdom of Judah developed only in the late eighth century BCE or at some other later date The techniques and interpretations to reach some conclusions related to Khirbet Qeiyafa have been criticized by some scholars such as Finkelstein and Alexander Fantalkin br In archaeologist Eilat Mazar announced the discovery of part of the ancient city walls around the City of David which she believes dates to the tenth century BCE According to Mazar It s the most significant construction we have from First Temple days in Israel and It means that at that time the th century in Jerusalem there was a regime capable of carrying out such construction The th century is the period the Bible describes as the reign of King Solomon Not all archaeologists agree with Mazar and archaeologist Aren Maeir is dubious about such claims and Mazar s dating br In the Jewish Study Bible Oded Lipschits states the concept of United Monarchy should be abandoned while Aren Maeir believes there is insufficient evidence in support of the United Monarchy In August Israeli archaeologists discovered massive fortifications in the ruins of the ancient city of Gath supposed birthplace of Goliath The size of the fortifications shows that Gath was a large city in the th century BCE perhaps the largest in Canaan at the time The professor leading the dig Aren Maeir estimated that Gath was as much as four times the size of contemporary Jerusalem which cast doubt that David s kingdom could have been as powerful as described in the Bible br In his book The Forgotten Kingdom Israel Finkelstein considered that Saul originally from the Benjamin territory had gained power in his natal Gibeon region around the th century BCE and that he conquered Jerusalem in the south and Shechem to the north creating a polity dangerous to Egypt s geopolitical intentions So Shoshenq I from Egypt invaded the territory and destroyed this new polity and installed David of Bethlehem in Jerusalem Judah and Jeroboam I in Shechem Israel as small local rulers who were vassals of Egypt Finkelstein concludes that the memory of a united monarchy was inspired by Saul s conquered territory serving first the ideal of a great united monarchy ruled by a northern king in the times of Jeroboam II and next to the idea of a united monarchy ruled from Jerusalem br In an article on the Biblical Archaeology Review William G Dever strongly criticized Finkelstein s theory calling it full of numerous errors misrepresentations over simplifications and contradictions Dever noted that Finkelstein proposes that Saul ruled a polity extending as far north as Jezreel and as far south as Hebron and reaching a border with Gath with a capital located in Gibeon rather than Jerusalem According to Dever such a polity is a united monarchy in its own right ironically confirming the biblical tradition In addition he rejected the notion that Gibeon was the capital of such polity since there is no clear archaeological evidence of occupation in the tenth century much less monumental architecture Dever went as far as to dismiss Finkelstein s theory as a product of his fantasy stemmed by his obsession to prove that Saul David and Solomon were not real kings and that the United Monarchy is an invention of a Judahite biased biblical writer Dever concluded by stating that Finkelstein has not discovered a forgotten kingdom He had invented it The careful reader will nevertheless gain some insights into Israel Israel Finkelstein that is br Another more moderate review was written in the same magazine by Aaron Burke Burke described Finkelstein s book as ambitious and praised its literary style but did not accept his conclusions according to Burke Finkelstein s thesis is mainly based on his proposed Low Chronology ignoring the criticism that it has received from scholars like Amihai Mazar Christopher Bronk Ramsey and others and engages in several speculations that archeology biblical and extrabiblical sources cannot prove He also criticized him for persistently trying to downgrade the role of David in the development of ancient Israel br In his books Beyond the Texts and Has Archeology Buried the Bible William G Dever has defended the historicity of the United Monarchy maintaining that the reigns of Saul David and Solomon are reasonably well attested Similar arguments were advanced by Amihai Mazar in two essays written in and which point toward archaeological evidence emerged from excavation sites in Jerusalem by Eilat Mazar and in Khirbet Qeiyafa by Yosef Garfinkel br In archaeologist Avraham Faust announced that his excavations at Tel Eton believed to be the biblical Eglon had uncovered an elite house which he referred to as the governor s residency whose foundations were dated by carbon analysis in the late th th century BCE the time usually ascribed to Saul David and Solomon Such dating would strengthen the thesis that a centralized state existed at the time of David br br br Historical sources br br According to mainstream source criticism several contrasting source texts were spliced together to produce the current Books of Samuel The most prominent sections in the early parts of the first book come from a pro monarchical source and from an anti monarchical source By identifying both sources two separate accounts can be reconstructed br The anti monarchical source describes Samuel having thoroughly routed the Philistines as begrudgingly accepting the people s demand for a ruler and appointing Saul by cleromancy br The pro monarchical source describes the divinely appointed birth of Saul a single word being changed by a later editor so that it referred to Samuel and his leading of an army to victory over the Ammonites which resulted in the people clamouring for him to lead them against the Philistines when he is appointed king br Many scholars believe that the Books of Samuel exhibit too many anachronisms to have been a contemporary account For example the text mentions later armour Samuel the use of camels Samuel cavalry as distinct from chariotry Samuel Samuel and iron picks and axes as if they were prevalent Samuel br Most scholars believe that the text of the Books of Samuel was compiled in the th century BCE rather than in the th century when most of the events described took place based on historical and legendary sources The narrative served primarily to fill the gap in Israelite history after the events described in Deuteronomy br br br Biblical narrative br br br Origin br br According to the biblical account the united monarchy was formed when the elders of Israel expressed the desire for a king God and Samuel seem to have a distaste for the monarchy with God telling Samuel that Israel has rejected me that I should not be king over them However Samuel still proceeds with the establishment of a monarchy by anointing Saul br In the Second Book of Samuel Saul s disobedience prompts Yahweh to curtail his reign and to hand his kingdom over to another dynasty leading to Saul s death in battle against the Philistines His heir Eshbaal rules for only two years before being assassinated Though David was only the King of Judah he ends the conspiracy and is appointed King of Israel in Eshbaal s place Some textual critics and biblical scholars suggest that David was responsible for the assassination and that his innocence was a later invention to legitimize his actions br Israel rebels against David and crowns David s son Absalom David is forced into exile east of the Jordan River but eventually launches a successful counterattack which results in the death of Absalom Having retaken Judah and asserted control over Israel David returns west of the Jordan br br br Golden age br Throughout the monarchy of Saul the capital is in Gibeah After Saul s death Eshbaal rules over the Kingdom of Israel from Mahanaim and David establishes the capital of the Kingdom of Judah in Hebron br After the civil war with Saul David forges a powerful and unified Israelite monarchy and rules from c to BCE Some modern archaeologists however believe that the two distinct cultures and geographic entities of Judah and Israel continued uninterrupted and if a political union between them existed it might have had no practical effect on their relationship br In the biblical account David embarks on successful military campaigns against the enemies of Judah and Israel and defeats such regional entities as the Philistines to secure his borders Israel grows from kingdom to empire its military and political sphere of influence expanding to control the weaker client states of Philistia Moab Edom and Ammon with Aramaean city states Aram Zobah and Aram Damascus becoming vassal states br David is succeeded by his son Solomon who obtains the throne in a somewhat disreputable manner from the rival claimant Adonijah his elder brother Like David s Palace Solomon s temple is designed and built with the assistance of Tyrian architects skilled labourers money jewels cedar and other goods obtained in exchange for land ceded to Tyre br Solomon goes on to rebuild numerous significant cities including Megiddo Hazor and Gezer Some scholars have attributed aspects of archaeological remains excavated from these sites including six chambered gates and ashlar palaces to the building programme However Israel Finkelstein s Low Chronology would propose to date them to the th century BCE Yigael Yadin later concluded that the stables that had been believed to have served Solomon s vast collection of horses were built by King Ahab in the th century BCE br br br Collapse and split br br Following Solomon s death in c BCE tensions between the northern part of Israel containing the ten northern tribes and the southern section dominated by Jerusalem and the southern tribes reach a boiling point When Solomon s son and successor Rehoboam deals tactlessly with economic complaints of the northern tribes in about BCE there are differences of opinion as to the actual year the Kingdom of Israel and Judah splits into two kingdoms the northern Kingdom of Israel which included the cities of Shechem and Samaria and the southern Kingdom of Judah which contained Jerusalem br The Kingdom of Israel or the Northern Kingdom or Samaria existed as an independent state until BCE when it was conquered by the Neo Assyrian Empire The Kingdom of Judah or the Southern Kingdom existed as an independent state until BCE when it was conquered by the Neo Babylonian Empire br br br Biblical chronology br br Many alternative chronologies have been suggested and there is no ultimate consensus between the different factions and scholarly disciplines concerned with the period as to when it is depicted as having begun or when it ended br Most biblical scholars follow either of the older chronologies established by American archaeologists William F Albright and Edwin R Thiele or the newer one by Israeli historian Gershon Galil Thiele s chronology generally corresponds with Galil s chronology below with a difference of one year at most br br br See also br Judaism br Greater Israel br History of ancient Israel and
