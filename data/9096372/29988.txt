Tenochtitlan also known as Mexico Tenochtitlan was a large Mexican altepetl in what is now the historic center of Mexico City The exact date of the founding of the city is unclear but the date March was chosen in to celebrate the th anniversary of the city The city was built on an island in what was then Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico The city was the capital of the expanding Aztec Empire in the th century until it was captured by the Tlaxcaltec and the Spanish in br At its peak it was the largest city in the pre Columbian Americas It subsequently became a cabecera of the Viceroyalty of New Spain Today the ruins of Tenochtitlan are in the historic center of the Mexican capital The World Heritage Site of Xochimilco contains what remains of the geography water boats floating gardens of the Mexica capital br Tenochtitlan was one of two Mexica ltep tl city states or polities on the island the other being Tlatelolco br br br Etymology br Traditionally the name Tenochtitlan was thought to come from Nahuatl tetl tet rock and n chtli no t t i prickly pear and is often thought to mean Among the prickly pears growing among rocks However one attestation in the late th century manuscript known as the Bancroft dialogues suggest the second vowel was short so that the true etymology remains uncertain Another view is that the city was named after Tenoch br br br Geography br br Tenochtitlan covered an estimated to km to sq mi situated on the western side of the shallow Lake Texcoco br At the time of Spanish conquests Mexico City comprised both Tenochtitlan and Tlatelolco The city extended from north to south from the north border of Tlatelolco to the swamps which by that time were gradually disappearing to the west the city ended more or less at the present location of Avenida Bucareli br The city was connected to the mainland by bridges and causeways leading to the north south and west The causeways were interrupted by bridges that allowed canoes and other water traffic to pass freely The bridges could be pulled away if necessary to protect the city The city was interlaced with a series of canals so that all sections of the city could be visited either on foot or via canoe br Lake Texcoco was the largest of five interconnected lakes Since it formed in an endorheic basin Lake Texcoco was brackish During the reign of Moctezuma I the levee of Nezahualcoyotl was constructed reputedly designed by Nezahualcoyotl Estimated to be to km to mi in length the levee was completed c The levee kept fresh spring fed water in the waters around Tenochtitlan and kept the brackish waters beyond the dike to the east br Two double aqueducts each more than km mi long and made of terracotta provided the city with fresh water from the springs at Chapultepec This was intended mainly for cleaning and washing For drinking water from mountain springs was preferred Most of the population liked to bathe twice a day Moctezuma was said to take four baths a day According to the context of Aztec culture in literature the soap that they most likely used was the root of a plant called copalxocotl Saponaria americana and to clean their clothes they used the root of metl Agave americana Also the upper classes and pregnant women washed themselves in a tem zcalli similar to a sauna bath which is still used in the south of Mexico This was also popular in other Mesoamerican cultures br br br City plans br When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water and all built of masonry And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream I do not know how to describe it seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before not even dreamed about br The city was divided into four zones or camps each camp was divided into districts calpullis Nahuatl languages calp lli pronounced ka po l i meaning large house and each calpulli or big house was crossed by streets or tlaxilcalli There were three main streets that crossed the city each leading to one of the three causeways to the mainland of Tepeyac Iztapalapa and Tlacopan Bernal D az del Castillo reported that they were wide enough for ten horses Surrounding the raised causeways were artificial floating gardens with canal waterways and gardens of plants shrubs and trees The calpullis were divided by channels used for transportation with wood bridges that were removed at night br The earliest European images of the city were woodcuts published in Augsburg around br br br Marketplaces br br Each calpulli had its own tiyanquiztli marketplace but there was also a main marketplace in Tlatelolco Tenochtitlan s sister city Cort s estimated it was twice the size of the city of Salamanca with about people trading daily Bernardino de Sahag n provides a more conservative population estimate of on ordinary days and on feast days There were also specialized markets in the other central Mexican cities br br br Public buildings br br In the center of the city were the public buildings temples and palaces Inside a walled square meters ft to a side was the ceremonial center There were about public buildings including the Templo Mayor which was dedicated to the Aztec patron deity Huitzilopochtli and the Rain God Tlaloc the temple of Quetzalcoatl the tlachtli ball game court with the tzompantli or rack of skulls the Sun Temple which was dedicated to Tonatiuh the Eagle s House which was associated with warriors and the ancient power of rulers the platforms for the gladiatorial sacrifice and some minor temples br Outside was the palace of Moctezuma with rooms each with its own bath for the lords and ambassadors of allies and conquered people Also located nearby was the cuicalli or house of the songs and the calmecac br The city had great symmetry All constructions had to be approved by the calmimilocatl a functionary in charge of the city planning br br br Palaces of Moctezuma II br The palace of Moctezuma II also had two houses or zoos one for birds of prey and another for other birds reptiles and mammals About people were dedicated to the care of the animals br There was also a botanical garden and an aquarium The aquarium had ten ponds of salt water and ten ponds of fresh water containing various fish and aquatic birds Places like this also existed in Texcoco Chapultepec Huaxtepec now called Oaxtepec and Texcotzingo br br br Social classes br br Tenochtitlan can be considered the most complex society in Mesoamerica in regard to social stratification The complex system involved many social classes The macehualtin were commoners who lived outside the island city of Tenochtitlan The pipiltin were noblemen who were relatives of leaders and former leaders and lived in the confines of the island Cuauhipiltin or eagle nobles were commoners who impressed the nobles with their martial prowess and were treated as nobles Teteuctin were the highest class rulers of various parts of the empire including the king Tlacohtin were slaves or indentured servants Finally the pochteca were merchants who traveled all of Mesoamerica trading The membership of this class was based on heredity Pochteca could become very rich because they did not pay taxes but they had to sponsor the ritual feast of Xocotl Huetzi from the wealth that they obtained from their trade expeditions br Status was displayed by the location and type of house where a person lived Ordinary people lived in houses made of reeds plastered with mud and roofed with thatch People who were better off had houses of adobe brick with flat roofs The wealthy had houses of stone masonry with flat roofs They most likely made up the house complexes that were arranged around the inner court The higher officials in Tenochtitlan lived in the great palace complexes that made up the city br Adding even more complexity to Aztec social stratification was the calp lli Calp lli is a group of families related by either kinship or proximity These groups consist of both elite members of Aztec society and commoners Elites provided commoners with arable land and nonagricultural occupations and commoners performed services for chiefs and gave tribute br br br History br br Tenochtitlan was the capital of the Mexican civilization of the Mexica people founded in The state religion of the Mexica civilization awaited the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy the wandering tribes would find the destined site for a great city whose location would be signaled by an eagle with a snake in its beak perched atop a cactus Opuntia which had grown from the heart of Copil br The Mexica saw this vision on what was then a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco a vision that is now immortalized in Mexico s coat of arms and on the Mexican flag Not deterred by the unfavourable terrain they set about building their city using the chinampa system misnamed as floating gardens for agriculture and to dry and expand the island br A thriving culture developed and the Mexica civilization came to dominate other tribes around Mexico The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire br After a flood of Lake Texcoco the city was rebuilt during the rule of Ahuitzotl which was between and in a style that made it one of the grandest ever in Mesoamerica br Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s arrived in Tenochtitlan on November Although there are not precise numbers the city s population has been estimated at between and inhabitants placing Tenochtitlan among the largest cities in the world at that time Compared to the cities of Europe only Paris Venice and Constantinople might have rivaled it It was five times the size of the London of Henry VIII In a letter to the Spanish king Cort s wrote that Tenochtitlan was as large as Seville or C rdoba Cortes men were in awe at the sight of the splendid city and many wondered if they were dreaming br Although some popular sources put the number as high as the most common estimates of the population are of over people One of the few comprehensive academic surveys of Mesoamerican city and town sizes arrived at a population of living on km sq mi It is also said that at one time Moctezuma had rule over an empire of almost five million people in central and southern Mexico because he had extended his rule to surrounding territories to gain tribute and prisoners to sacrifice to the gods br br br Conquest br br When Cort s and his men invaded Tenochtitlan Moctezuma II chose to welcome Cort s as an ambassador rather than risk a war which might quickly be joined by aggrieved indigenous people br As Cort s approached Tenochtitlan the Tenochcah celebrated Toxcatl At this event the most prominent warriors of altepetl would dance in front of a huge statue of Huitzilopochtli The Spanish leader Pedro de Alvarado who was left in charge worried that the natives planned a surprise attack He captured three natives and tortured them until they said that this was indeed true During the festival the Spaniards came heavily armed and closed off every exit from the courtyard so that no one would escape This happened during their last days in Tenochtitlan br Nobles lined each side of the city s main causeway which extended about a league Walking down the center came Moctezuma II with two lords at his side one his brother the ruler of Iztapalapa Cort s dismounted and was greeted by the ruler and his lords but forbidden to touch him Cort s gave him a necklace of crystals placing it over his neck br br They were then brought to a large house that would serve as their home for their stay in the city Once they were settled Moctezuma himself sat down and spoke with Cort s The great ruler declared that anything that they needed would be theirs to have He was thrilled to have visitors of such stature Although the Spaniards were seeking gold Moctezuma expressed that he had very little of the sort but all of it was to be given to Cort s if he desired it br Soon after arriving in Tenochtitlan Cort s came up against problems At Vera Cruz the officer left in charge received a letter from Qualpopoca the leader of Nueva Almer a asking to become a vassal of the Spaniards He requested that officials be sent to him so that he could confirm his submission To reach the province the officers would have to travel through hostile land The officer in charge of Vera Cruz decided to send four officers to meet with Qualpopoca br When they arrived they were captured and two were killed the other two escaping through the woods Upon their return to Vera Cruz the officer in charge was infuriated and led troops to storm Almer a Here they learned that Moctezuma was supposedly the one who ordered the officers executed Back in Tenochtitlan Cort s detained Moctezuma and questioned him Though no serious conclusions were reached this negatively affected the relationship between Moctezuma and the Spaniards br Cort s subsequently besieged Tenochtitlan for over days causing a famine Having gained control he then directed the systematic destruction and leveling of the city and began its rebuilding despite opposition The reconstruction involved the creation of a central area designated for Spanish use the traza The outer Indian section now dubbed San Juan Tenochtitlan continued to be governed by the previous indigenous elite and was divided into the same subdivisions as before br The people of Tenochtitlan were soon exposed to diseases to which they had no immunity Symptoms were often delayed for up to ten days when the infection would spread throughout the body causing sores pain and high fever People were weak to the point that they could not move nor obtain food and water Burial of the dead become difficult to impossible due to the pervasiveness of the people s illness The people of Tenochtitlan began to starve and weaken The death toll rose steadily over the course of the next days br br br Colonial era br br Cort s founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan Despite the extensive damage to the built environment the site retained symbolic power and legitimacy as the capital of the Aztec empire which Cort s sought to appropriate For a time this ciudad de espa oles the highest rank in the Spanish hierarchy of settlement designation was called Mexico Tenochtitlan Charles Gibson devotes the final chapter of his classic work The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule to what he called The City with later historians building on his work The Spaniards established a cabildo or town council which had jurisdiction over the Spanish residents The Spanish established a Europeans only zone in the center of the city an area of blocks in each direction of the central plaza which was the traza Although many native residents died during the siege of Tenochtitlan the indigenous still had a strong presence in the city and were settled in two main areas of the island designated San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco each with a municipal council that functioned the entire colonial period San Juan Tenochtitlan was a Spanish administrative creation which amalgamated four indigenous sections with each losing territory to the Spanish traza The Spanish laid out the streets of the traza in a checker board pattern with straight streets and plazas at intervals whereas the indigenous portions of the city were irregular in layout and built of modest materials In the colonial period both San Juan Tenochtitlan and Santiago Tlatelolco retained jurisdiction over settlements on the mainland that they could draw on for labor and tribute demanded by the Spanish but increasingly those subordinate settlements sujetos were able to gain their autonomy with their own rulers and separate relationship with the Spanish rulers Concern about the health of the indigenous population in early post conquest Mexico Tenochtitlan led to the founding of a royal hospital for indigenous residents br There are a number of colonial era pictorial manuscripts dealing with Tenochtitlan Tlatelolco which shed light on litigation between Spaniards and indigenous over property An account with information about the war of Tenochtitlan against its neighbor Tlatelolco in and the Spanish conquest in is the Anales de Mexico y Tlatelolco Anthropologist Susan Kellogg has studied colonial era inheritance patterns of Nahuas in Mexico City using Nahuatl and Spanish language testaments br On the th of August after over two months of fighting Spanish conquistador Hern n Cort s succeeded in bringing about the fall of Tenochtitlan the capital of the Aztec empire and consequently brought an end to the Aztec empire br br br Ruins br br Tenochtitlan s main temple complex the Templo Mayor was dismantled and the central district of the Spanish colonial city was constructed on top of it The great temple was destroyed by the Spanish during the construction of a cathedral The location of the Templo Mayor was rediscovered in the early th century but major excavations did not take place until after utility workers came across a massive stone disc depicting the nude dismembered body of the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui The disc is meters ft in in diameter and is held at the Templo Mayor Museum br The ruins constructed over seven periods were built on top of each other The resulting weight of the structures caused them to sink into the sediment of Lake Texcoco the ruins now rest at an angle instead of horizontally br Mexico City s Z calo the Plaza de la Constituci n is located at the site of Tenochtitlan s original central plaza and market and many of the original calzadas still correspond to modern city streets The Aztec calendar stone was located in the ruins This stone is meters ft in in diameter and weighs over metric tons short tons long tons It was once located half way up the great pyramid This sculpture was carved around under the rule of King Axayacatl the predecessor of Tizoc and is said to tell the history of the Mexicas and to prophesy the future br In August archaeologists discovered a mix of human bones five meters ft in below street level in Mexico City The burial dates back to the s and lies at the foot of the main temple in the sacred ceremonial precinct of the Aztec capital The bones are from children teenagers and adults A complete skeleton of a young woman was also found at the site br br br See also br List of megalithic sites br List of Mesoamerican pyramids br History of Mexico City br Portrait of Tenochtitlan br br br Notes br br br br
