The Tierpark Hagenbeck is a zoo in Stellingen Hamburg Germany The collection began in with animals that belonged to Carl Hagenbeck Sr a fishmonger who became an amateur animal collector The park itself was founded by Carl Hagenbeck Jr in It is known for being the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats rather than barred cages to better approximate animals natural environments br br br History br br br Animal and Human trading br In the elder Hagenbeck began collecting exotic animals that came through Hamburg s port By the s the trade had proved more lucrative than his fish shop and Hagenbeck had become one of the most prominent exotic animal traders in all of Europe In the younger Hagenbeck traveled around the world collecting animals Among his collections however were also human beings whom he exhibited in human zoos Hagenbeck decided to exhibit Samoan and S mi people as purely natural populations The S mi were presented with their tents weapons and sleds beside a group of reindeer br br In Hagenbeck opened a zoo facility in Hamburg called Carl Hagenbeck s Tierpark while he continued exhibiting humans In he began exhibiting Nubians all across Europe He also dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux Inuit from the settlement of Hebron these Inuit see Abraham Ulrikab were exhibited in the Hamburg Tierpark br Though initially popular Hagenbeck s shows gradually began to decline in popularity especially once the photograph became more and more common and Hagenbeck s exhibits began to look less and less real in comparison After one exhibit Hagenbeck was left with a large number of elephants and no one to purchase them Unable to sell he started a circus To counter the declining popularity of his human zoos Hagenbeck began working on making his displays more realistic techniques that would later influence the animal zoo br br br Panorama exhibits br br In the s Hagenbeck created his first panorama exhibit and patented the idea in The display was the Northern Panorama the foreground featured seals and walruses in a pool Hidden from the zoo s patrons was a moat behind the pool Beyond the moat were reindeer and beyond a second hidden moat were polar bears By hiding the moats the animals appeared to be together in one landscape br In Hagenbeck constructed a new facility outside of Hamburg which he called Tierpark Hagenbeck without the H that was in Thierpark which is still the location of the facility today Hagenbeck sought to design the entire zoo with his panorama system He also sought to demonstrate that animals from warmer climates did not need to live in expensive humid foreboding buildings Instead Hagenbeck again sought to make his displays realistic br Using data that he had compiled running his circus Hagenbeck had estimates of how high and far different animals could leap Using this data he built moats filled with water or an empty pit that he determined the animals could not cross Using moats to separate animals that did not swim one could look across an expanse of the zoo and see many animals at once as if in the wild Previously zoos had not grouped animals by species but Hagenbeck revolutionized the layout of zoos grouping his animals by species br Hagenbeck s design was a popular success In Hagenbeck designed the Rome Zoo in the same style In he designed the first monkey rock exhibit in this case an artificial crag with a foot m moat The rock was populated by around hamadryas baboons br Hagenbeck called his design an animal paradise where animals would live beside each other in harmony and where the fight for survival would be eliminated br br br World War I and II br Hagenbeck died in but his zoo remained popular until the political situation in Europe swept the zoo into hard times During World War I many of the keepers were drafted into the German army Because the military had taken horses from civilians for use at the front many of Hagenbeck s animals were rented out for use as draught animals for hauling coal and wood on home deliveries It was not unusual to see elephants and trained bears hitched up to heavy wagons After the war the zoo closed for two years as Germany entered into a deep depression Then during the Bombing of Hamburg in World War II the original zoo was destroyed After the war the zoo was rebuilt The private zoo is still run by the Hagenbeck family br br br Monkey escape br In July forty five rhesus monkeys escaped from the zoo and ran wild in Hamburg The incident resulted in calls for help from shocked housewives who met monkeys in their bedrooms and bathtubs Some of the monkeys sat in trees and chattered excitedly showing each other toothpaste soap bars and bathroom utensils which they had grabbed Managers of the zoo reported that more than two dozen of the long tailed Indian monkeys had been caught by policemen firemen zoo keepers and schoolchildren br br br Antje the walrus br In the zoo acquired a female Pacific talking walrus which Hagenbeck named Antje after his sister Antje became the logo of the north German television network NDR from to In Antje died and is now stuffed and on display at the zoological museum of Hamburg Soon after the children s cartoon Antje Tiger und B r aired on German television featuring a blue walrus protagonist based on Antje and designed by children s author Janosch In Tierpark Hagenbeck gained a male and three female walruses from Moscow br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website in German br Documents and clippings about
