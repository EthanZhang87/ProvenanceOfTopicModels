The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth Traditionally giraffes have been thought of as one species Giraffa camelopardalis with nine subspecies Most recently researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record br The giraffe s distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs horn like ossicones and spotted coat patterns It is classified under the family Giraffidae along with its closest extant relative the okapi Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands Their food source is leaves fruits and flowers of woody plants primarily acacia species which they browse at heights most other ground based herbivores cannot reach br Lions leopards spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations Males establish social hierarchies through necking combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon Dominant males gain mating access to females which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young br The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and has often been featured in paintings books and cartoons It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN as vulnerable to extinction It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range Giraffes are still found in many national parks and game reserves but estimates as of indicate there are approximately members of Giraffa in the wild More than were kept in zoos in br br br Etymology br The name giraffe has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zar fah ultimately from Persian zurn p a compound of zurn flute zurna and p leg In early Modern English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used probably directly from the Arabic and in Middle English jarraf and ziraph gerfauntz The Italian form giraffa arose in the s The modern English form developed around from the French girafe br Camelopard is an archaic English name for the giraffe it derives from the Ancient Greek kam lop rdalis from k m los camel and p rdalis leopard referring to its camel like shape and leopard like colouration br br br Taxonomy br br br Evolution br The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla the other being the okapi They are ruminants of the clade Pecora along with Antilocapridae pronghorns Cervidae deer Bovidae cattle antelope goats and sheep and Moschidae musk deer A genome study cladogram below finds that Giraffidae are a sister taxon to Antilocapridae with an estimated split of over million years ago br br The family Giraffidae was once much more extensive with over fossil genera described The elongation of the neck appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived to million years ago mya or mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya This animal resembled an antelope and had a medium sized lightly built body Giraffokeryx appeared mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an okapi or a small giraffe and had a longer neck and similar ossicones Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium br br Giraffids like Palaeotragus Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia These animals had broader skulls with reduced frontal cavities Paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have been its ancestor Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier before Giraffokeryx Samotherium was a particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage as the length and structure of its cervical vertebrae were between those of a modern giraffe and an okapi and its neck posture was likely similar to the former s Bohlinia which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived mya was likely a direct ancestor of the giraffe Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and dentition br Bohlinia colonised China and northern India and produced the Giraffa which around million years ago reached Africa Climate changes led to the extinction of the Asian giraffes while the African giraffes survived and radiated into new species Living giraffes appear to have arisen around million years ago in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene Some biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G jumae others find G gracilis a more likely candidate G jumae was larger and more robust while G gracilis was smaller and more slender br The changes from extensive forests to more open habitats which began mya are believed to be the main driver for the evolution of giraffes During this time tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C plants and a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India Some researchers have hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet including acacia species may have exposed giraffe ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution The coat patterns of modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more okapi like colourations br The giraffe genome is around billion base pairs in length compared to the billion base pairs of the okapi Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes are identical The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates to around mya A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appears responsible for the animal s height and associated circulatory adaptations br br br Species and subspecies br br The International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine subspecies br Carl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in He gave it the binomial name Cervus camelopardalis Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the generic name Giraffa in During the s various taxonomies with two or three species were proposed A study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species A study using detailed analyses of the morphology of giraffes and application of the phylogenetic species concept described eight species of living giraffes A study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species The researchers suggested the existence of four species which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for to million years br A study showed that depending on the method chosen different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six species can be considered for the genus Giraffa That study also found that multi species coalescent methods can lead to taxonomic over splitting as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species The three species hypothesis which recognises G camelopardalis G giraffa and G tippelskirchi is highly supported by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi species coalescent analyses A whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies A study found a higher amount of ancient gene flow than expected between populations br The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four proposed species and seven subspecies based on a genome analysis Note that the eight lineages correspond to eight traditional subspecies in the one species hypothesis The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into G camelopardalis camelopardalis br br The following table compares the different hypotheses for giraffe species The description column shows the traditional nine subspecies in the one species hypothesis br br The first extinct species to be described was Giraffa sivalensis Falconer and Cautley a reevaluation of a vertebra that was initially described as a fossil of the living giraffe While taxonomic opinion may be lacking on some names the extinct species that have been published include br br Giraffa gracilis br Giraffa jumae br Giraffa pomeli br Giraffa priscilla br Giraffa punjabiensis br Giraffa pygmaea br Giraffa sivalensis br Giraffa stillei br br br Anatomy br br Fully grown giraffes stand m ft tall with males taller than females The average weight is kg lb for an adult male and kg lb for an adult female Despite its long neck and legs its body is relatively short The skin is mostly gray or tan and can reach a thickness of mm in The cm in long tail ends in a long dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects br The coat has dark blotches or patches which can be orange chestnut brown or nearly black surrounded by light hair usually white or cream coloured Male giraffes become darker as they grow old The coat pattern has been claimed to serve as camouflage in the light and shade patterns of savannah woodlands When standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres distance However adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator relying on their size and ability to defend themselves rather than on camouflage which may be more important for calves Each giraffe has a unique coat pattern Calves inherit some coat pattern traits from their mothers and variation in some spot traits is correlated with calf survival The skin under the blotches may regulate the animal s body temperature being sites for complex blood vessel systems and large sweat glands Spotless or solid color giraffes are very rare but have been observed br The fur may give the animal chemical defense as its parasite repellents give it a characteristic scent At least main aromatic chemicals are in the fur although indole and methylindole are responsible for most of the smell Because males have a stronger odour than females it may also have a sexual function br br br Head br br Both sexes have prominent horn like structures called ossicones which can reach cm in They are formed from ossified cartilage covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones Being vascularised the ossicones may have a role in thermoregulation and are used in combat between males Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top whereas those of adult males tend to be bald and knobbed on top A lump which is more prominent in males emerges in the middle of the skull Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age Multiple sinuses lighten a giraffe s skull However as males age their skulls become heavier and more club like helping them become more dominant in combat The occipital condyles at the bottom of the skull allow the animal to tip its head over degrees and grab food on the branches directly above them with the tongue br With eyes located on the sides of the head the giraffe has a broad visual field from its great height Compared to other ungulates giraffe vision is more binocular and the eyes are larger with a greater retinal surface area Giraffes may see in colour and their senses of hearing and smell are sharp The ears are movable The nostrils are slit shaped possibly to withstand blowing sand The giraffe s tongue is about cm in long It is black perhaps to protect against sunburn and can grasp foliage and delicately pick off leaves The upper lip is flexible and hairy to protect against sharp prickles The upper jaw has a hard palate instead of front teeth The molars and premolars are wide with low crowns on the surface br br br Neck br The giraffe has an extremely elongated neck which can be up to m ft in in length Along the neck is a mane made of short erect hairs The neck typically rests at an angle of degrees though juveniles are closer to degrees The long neck results from a disproportionate lengthening of the cervical vertebrae not from the addition of more vertebrae Each cervical vertebra is over cm in long They comprise per cent of the length of the giraffe s vertebral column compared with the percent typical of similar large ungulates including the giraffe s closest living relative the okapi This elongation largely takes place after birth perhaps because giraffe mothers would have a difficult time giving birth to young with the same neck proportions as adults The giraffe s head and neck are held up by large muscles and a nuchal ligament which are anchored by long thoracic vertebrae spines giving them a hump br br The giraffe s neck vertebrae have ball and socket joints The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie between the first and second thoracic vertebrae T and T unlike in most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra C and T This allows C to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T is actually C and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra However this proposition is not generally accepted as T has other morphological features such as an articulating rib deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies br There are several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origin and maintenance of elongation in giraffe necks Charles Darwin originally suggested the competing browsers hypothesis which has been challenged only recently It suggests that competitive pressure from smaller browsers like kudu steenbok and impala encouraged the elongation of the neck as it enabled giraffes to reach food that competitors could not This advantage is real as giraffes can and do feed up to m ft high while even quite large competitors such as kudu can feed up to only about m ft in high There is also research suggesting that browsing competition is intense at lower levels and giraffes feed more efficiently gaining more leaf biomass with each mouthful high in the canopy However scientists disagree about just how much time giraffes spend feeding at levels beyond the reach of other browsers and a study found that adult giraffes with longer necks actually suffered higher mortality rates under drought conditions than their shorter necked counterparts This study suggests that maintaining a longer neck requires more nutrients which puts longer necked giraffes at risk during a food shortage br Another theory the sexual selection hypothesis proposes that long necks evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic giving males an advantage in necking contests see below to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females In support of this theory some studies have stated that necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age and that males do not employ other forms of combat However a study found that while males have thicker necks females actually have proportionally longer ones which is likely because of their greater need to find more food to sustain themselves and their dependent young It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance br br br Legs locomotion and posture br br The front legs tend to be longer than the hind legs and males have proportionally longer front legs than females which gives them better support when swinging their necks during fights The leg bones lack first second and fifth metapodials It appears that a suspensory ligament allows the lanky legs to support the animal s great weight The hooves of large male giraffes reach cm cm in in in diameter The fetlock of the leg is low to the ground allowing the hoof to better support the animal s weight Giraffes lack dewclaws and interdigital glands While the pelvis is relatively short the ilium has stretched out crests br A giraffe has only two gaits walking and galloping Walking is done by moving the legs on one side of the body then doing the same on the other side When galloping the hind legs move around the front legs before the latter move forward and the tail will curl up The movements of the head and neck provide balance and control momentum while galloping The giraffe can reach a sprint speed of up to km h mph and can sustain km h mph for several kilometres Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water although they might be able to float When swimming the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the water s surface br br A giraffe rests by lying with its body on top of its folded legs To lie down the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers the rest of its body To get back up it first gets on its front knees and positions its backside on top of its hindlegs It then pulls the backside upwards and the front legs stand straight up again At each stage the animal swings its head for balance If the giraffe wants to reach down to drink it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees Studies in captivity found the giraffe sleeps intermittently around hours per day mostly at night It usually sleeps lying down however standing sleeps have been recorded particularly in older individuals Intermittent short deep sleep phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep br br br Internal systems br br In mammals the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is longer than the right in the giraffe it is over cm in longer These nerves are longer in the giraffe than in any other living animal the left nerve is over m ft in long Each nerve cell in this path begins in the brainstem and passes down the neck along the vagus nerve then branches off into the recurrent laryngeal nerve which passes back up the neck to the larynx Thus these nerve cells have a length of nearly m ft in the largest giraffes Despite its long neck and large skull the brain of the giraffe is typical for an ungulate Evaporative heat loss in the nasal passages keep the giraffe s brain cool The shape of the skeleton gives the giraffe a small lung volume relative to its mass Its long neck gives it a large amount of dead space in spite of its narrow windpipe The giraffe also has a high tidal volume so the balance of dead space and tidal volume is much the same as other mammals The animal can still provide enough oxygen for its tissues and it can increase its respiratory rate and oxygen diffusion when running br br The giraffe s circulatory system has several adaptations to compensate for its great height Its kg lb and cm ft heart must generate approximately double the blood pressure required for a human to maintain blood flow to the brain As such the wall of the heart can be as thick as cm in Giraffes have relatively high heart rates for their size at beats per minute When the animal lowers its head the blood rushes down fairly unopposed and a rete mirabile in the upper neck with its large cross sectional area prevents excess blood flow to the brain When it raises again the blood vessels constrict and push blood into the brain so the animal does not faint The jugular veins contain several most commonly seven valves to prevent blood flowing back into the head from the inferior vena cava and right atrium while the head is lowered Conversely the blood vessels in the lower legs are under great pressure because of the weight of fluid pressing down on them To solve this problem the skin of the lower legs is thick and tight preventing too much blood from pouring into them br Giraffes have oesophageal muscles that are strong enough to allow regurgitation of food from the stomach up the neck and into the mouth for rumination They have four chambered stomachs which are adapted to their specialized diet The intestines of an adult giraffe measure more than m ft in length and have a relatively small ratio of small to large intestine The giraffe has a small compact liver In fetuses there may be a small gallbladder that vanishes before birth br br br Behaviour and ecology br br br Habitat and feeding br br Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands They prefer areas dominated by Acacieae Commiphora Combretum and Terminalia tree over Brachystegia which are more densely spaced The Angolan giraffe can be found in desert environments Giraffes browse on the twigs of trees preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and the genera Commiphora and Terminalia which are important sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe s growth rate They also feed on shrubs grass and fruit A giraffe eats around kg lb of plant matter daily When stressed giraffes may chew on large branches stripping them of bark Giraffes are also recorded to chew old bones br During the wet season food is abundant and giraffes are more spread out while during the dry season they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes Mothers tend to feed in open areas presumably to make it easier to detect predators although this may reduce their feeding efficiency As a ruminant the giraffe first chews its food then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system The animal s faeces come in the form of small pellets When it has access to water a giraffe will go no more than three days without drinking br Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving waistlines to too tall trees Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime Between these hours giraffes mostly stand and ruminate Rumination is the dominant activity during the night when it is mostly done lying down br br br Social life br br Giraffes usually form groups that vary in size and composition according to ecological anthropogenic temporal and social factors Traditionally the composition of these groups had been described as open and ever changing For research purposes a group has been defined as a collection of individuals that are less than a kilometre apart and moving in the same general direction More recent studies have found that giraffes have long lasting social groups or cliques based on kinship sex or other factors and these groups regularly associate with other groups in larger communities or sub communities within a fission fusion society Proximity to humans can disrupt social arrangements Masai giraffes in Tanzania sort themselves into different subpopulations of adult females with overlapping ranges each of which differ in reproductive rates and calf mortality Dispersal is male biased and can include spatial and or social dispersal Adult female subpopulations are connected by males into supercommunities of around animals br br The number of giraffes in a group can range from one up to individuals Giraffe groups tend to be sex segregated although mixed sex groups made of adult females and young males also occur Female groups may be matrilineally related Generally females are more selective than males when deciding which individuals of the same sex they associate with Particularly stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young which can last weeks or months Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights However as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups Giraffes are not territorial but they have home ranges that vary according to rainfall and proximity to human settlements Male giraffes occasionally roam far from areas that they normally frequent br Early biologists suggested giraffes were mute and unable to create enough air flow to vibrate their vocal folds This has been proved to the contrary they have been recorded to communicate using snorts sneezes coughs snores hisses bursts moans grunts growls and flute like sounds During courtship males emit loud coughs Females call their young by bellowing Calves will emit bleats mooing and mewing sounds Snorting and hissing is associated with vigilance During nighttime giraffes appear to hum to each other There is some evidence that giraffes use Helmholtz resonance to create infrasound They also communicate with body language Dominant males display to other males with an erect posture holding the chin and head up while walking stiffly and displaying their side The less dominant show submissiveness by dropping the head and ears lowering the chin and fleeing br br br Reproduction and parental care br br Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous a few older males mate with the fertile females Females can reproduce throughout the year and experience oestrus cycling approximately every days Female giraffes in oestrus are dispersed over space and time so reproductive adult males adopt a strategy of roaming among female groups to seek mating opportunities with periodic hormone induced rutting behaviour approximately every two weeks Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults br Male giraffes assess female fertility by tasting the female s urine to detect oestrus in a multi step process known as the flehmen response Once an oestrous female is detected the male will attempt to court her When courting dominant males will keep subordinate ones at bay A courting male may lick a female s tail lay his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his ossicones During copulation the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female s sides br Giraffe gestation lasts days after which a single calf is normally born although twins occur on rare occasions The mother gives birth standing up The calf emerges head and front legs first having broken through the fetal membranes and falls to the ground severing the umbilical cord A newborn giraffe is m ft in ft in tall Within a few hours of birth the calf can run around and is almost indistinguishable from a one week old However for the first one to three weeks it spends most of its time hiding its coat pattern providing camouflage The ossicones which have lain flat in the womb raise up in a few days br br Mothers with calves will gather in nursery herds moving or browsing together Mothers in such a group may sometimes leave their calves with one female while they forage and drink elsewhere This is known as a calving pool Calves are at risk of predation and a mother giraffe will stand over them and kick at an approaching predator Females watching calving pools will only alert their own young if they detect a disturbance although the others will take notice and follow Allo sucking where a calf will suckle a female other than its mother has been recorded in both wild and captive giraffes Calves first ruminate at four to six months and stop nursing at six to eight months Young may not reach independence until they are months old Females are able to reproduce at four years of age while spermatogenesis in males begins at three to four years of age Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate br br br Necking br br Male giraffes use their necks as weapons in combat a behaviour known as necking Necking is used to establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity In low intensity necking the combatants rub and lean on each other The male that can keep itself more upright wins the bout In high intensity necking the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other attempting to land blows with their ossicones The contestants will try to dodge each other s blows and then prepare to counter The power of a blow depends on the weight of the skull and the arc of the swing A necking duel can last more than half an hour depending on how well matched the combatants are Although most fights do not lead to serious injury there have been records of broken jaws broken necks and even deaths br After a duel it is common for two male giraffes to caress and court each other Such interactions between males have been found to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling In one study up to percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males The proportion of same sex activities varied from to percent Only one percent of same sex mounting incidents occurred between females br br br Mortality and health br br Giraffes have high adult survival probability and an unusually long lifespan compared to other ruminants up to years Adult female survival is significantly correlated with the number of social associations Because of their size eyesight and powerful kicks adult giraffes are mostly safe from predation with lions being their only major threats Calves are much more vulnerable than adults and are also preyed on by leopards spotted hyenas and wild dogs A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood Calf survival varies according to the season of birth with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates br The local seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability In turn it has been suggested that other ungulates may benefit from associating with giraffes as their height allows them to spot predators from further away Zebras were found to assess predation risk by watching giraffes and spend less time looking around when giraffes are present br br Some parasites feed on giraffes They are often hosts for ticks especially in the area around the genitals which have thinner skin than other areas Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus Giraffes may rely on red billed and yellow billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasites and are susceptible to various diseases They were victims of the now eradicated viral illness rinderpest Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder which comes in the form of wrinkles lesions or raw fissures As much as of giraffes have symptoms of the disease in Ruaha National Park but it did not cause mortality in Tarangire and is less prevalent in areas with fertile soils br br br Human relations br br br Cultural significance br With its lanky build and spotted coat the giraffe has been a source of fascination throughout human history and its image is widespread in culture It has represented flexibility far sightedness femininity fragility passivity grace beauty and the continent of Africa itself br br Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent including that of the Kiffians Egyptians and Kushites The Kiffians were responsible for a life size rock engraving of two giraffes dated years ago that has been called the world s largest rock art petroglyph How the giraffe got its height has been the subject of various African folktales The Tugen people of modern Kenya used the giraffe to depict their god Mda The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph sr in Old Egyptian and mmy in later periods br Giraffes have a presence in modern Western culture Salvador Dal depicted them with burning manes in some surrealist paintings Dali considered the giraffe to be a masculine symbol A flaming giraffe was meant to be a masculine cosmic apocalyptic monster Several children s books feature the giraffe including David A Ufer s The Giraffe Who Was Afraid of Heights Giles Andreae s Giraffes Can t Dance and Roald Dahl s The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me Giraffes have appeared in animated films as minor characters in Disney s Dumbo and The Lion King and in more prominent roles in The Wild and the Madagascar films Sophie the Giraffe has been a popular teether since Another famous fictional giraffe is the Toys R Us mascot Geoffrey the Giraffe br The giraffe has also been used for some scientific experiments and discoveries Scientists have used the properties of giraffe skin as a model for astronaut and fighter pilot suits because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction diffusion mechanisms The constellation of Camelopardalis introduced in the th century depicts a giraffe The Tswana people of Botswana traditionally see the constellation Crux as two giraffes Acrux and Mimosa forming a male and Gacrux and Delta Crucis forming the female br br br Captivity br The Egyptians were among the earliest people to keep giraffes in captivity and shipped them around the Mediterranean The giraffe was among the many animals collected and displayed by the Romans The first one in Rome was brought in by Julius Caesar in BC With the fall of the Western Roman Empire the housing of giraffes in Europe declined During the Middle Ages giraffes were known to Europeans through contact with the Arabs who revered the giraffe for its peculiar appearance br Individual captive giraffes were given celebrity status throughout history In a giraffe from Malindi was taken to China by explorer Zheng He and placed in a Ming dynasty zoo The animal was a source of fascination for the Chinese people who associated it with the mythical Qilin The Medici giraffe was a giraffe presented to Lorenzo de Medici in It caused a great stir on its arrival in Florence Zarafa another famous giraffe was brought from Egypt to Paris in the early th century as a gift for Charles X of France A sensation the giraffe was the subject of numerous memorabilia or giraffanalia br Giraffes have become popular attractions in modern zoos though keeping them healthy is difficult as they require vast areas and need to eat large amounts of browse Captive giraffes in North America and Europe appear to have a higher mortality rate than in the wild the most common causes being poor husbandry nutrition and management Giraffes in zoos display stereotypical behaviours particularly the licking of inanimate objects and pacing Zookeepers may offer various activities to stimulate giraffes including training them to take food from visitors Stables for giraffes are built particularly high to accommodate their height br br br Exploitation br Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes Their meat was used for food The tail hairs were flyswatters bracelets necklaces and threads Shields sandals and drums were made using the skin and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons In Buganda the smoke of burning giraffe skin was traditionally used to treat nosebleeds The Humr people of Kordofan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh which is prepared from the liver and bone marrow of giraffes Richard Rudgley hypothesised that Umm Nyolokh might contain DMT The drink is said to cause hallucinations of giraffes believed to be the giraffes ghosts by the Humr br br br Conservation status br In giraffes were assessed as Vulnerable from a conservation perspective by the IUCN In it was estimated there were giraffes in the wild This declined to over in Estimates as of indicate there are approximately members of Giraffa in the wild The Masai and reticulated subspecies are endangered and the Rothschild subspecies is near threatened The Nubian subspecies is critically endangered br br The primary causes for giraffe population declines are habitat loss and direct killing for bushmeat markets Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range including Eritrea Guinea Mauritania and Senegal They may also have disappeared from Angola Mali and Nigeria but have been introduced to Rwanda and Eswatini As of there were more than in captivity at Species registered zoos Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe In the Sahel the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation Normally giraffes can coexist with livestock since they avoid direct competition by feeding above them In severe droughts in northern Kenya led to increased tensions over land and the killing of wildlife by herders with giraffe populations being particularly hit br Protected areas like national parks provide important habitat and anti poaching protection to giraffe populations Community based conservation efforts outside national parks are also effective at protecting giraffes and their habitats Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in eastern and southern Africa The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range It is the national animal of Tanzania and is protected by law and unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in In giraffes were listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species CITES which means international trade including in parts derivatives is regulated br Translocations are sometimes used to augment or re establish diminished or extirpated populations but these activities are risky and difficult to undertake using the best practices of extensive pre and post translocation studies and ensuring a viable founding population Aerial survey is the most common method of monitoring giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes Ground based survey methods are more accurate and can be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends br br br See also br Fauna of Africa br Giraffe Centre br Giraffe Manor hotel in Nairobi with giraffes br br br br br br
