house the first public aquarium first insect house and the first children s zoo br ZSL receives no state funding and relies on Fellows and Friends memberships entrance fees venue hire and sponsorship to generate income br br br History br br br br br The Zoological Society of London ZSL was established by Sir Stamford Raffles and Sir Humphry Davy in who obtained the land for the zoo and saw the plans before Raffles died of apoplexy a stroke later that year on July his birthday After his death Henry Petty Fitzmaurice rd Marquess of Lansdowne took over the project and supervised the building of the first animal houses The zoo opened in April to fellows of the Society providing access to species such as Arabian oryx greater kudus orangutan and the now extinct quagga and thylacine The Society was granted a royal charter in by King George IV and in the zoo opened to the public to aid funding br It was believed that tropical animals could not survive outside in London s cold weather so they were all kept indoors until when Peter Chalmers Mitchell was appointed secretary of the Society He set about a major reorganisation of the buildings and enclosures of the zoo bringing many of the animals out into the open where many thrived This was an idea inspired by Hamburg Zoo and led to newer designs for many of the buildings Mitchell also envisaged a new acre ha park to the north of London and in Hall Farm near to Whipsnade village was bought In Whipsnade Wild Animal Park the world s first open zoological park opened The first woman to be a curator at London Zoo was Evelyn Cheesman in br br br Second World War br After the start of the Second World War the London Zoo was closed multiple times for over a week the first time being at am on September when all zoological places were closed by government order Valuable animals were transferred to Whipsnade Zoo during the war for safety On September high explosive bombs damaged the Rodent house the Civet house the gardener s office the propagating sheds the North Gate and the Zebra house In January the Camel House was also hit and the aquarium could not open until May due to extensive bombing No animals were harmed during the incidents although a zebra a female ass and her foal escaped from the zoo during the bombings For safety reasons all venomous animals were killed at London Zoo Throughout the war members of the armed forces paid half price for entry and the wounded entered free of charge br br br Since br In Caroline an Arabian oryx was lent to Phoenix Zoo Arizona US in the world s first international co operative breeding programme Today the zoo participates in breeding programmes for over species br In the s London Zoo housed animals of more than species and in the s the zoo possessed animals of species the next biggest collection in Britain was Chester Zoo with just under animals Many of the species in London Zoo could not be seen anywhere else in the country such as the wombat Tasmanian devil or long nosed potoroo Although this vast collection was part of the zoo s appeal it may also have been one of the main causes of its financial problems This contributed to the zoo being faced with closure in the s Due to the public change of attitude to animals kept in captivity and unsuitably cramped space the zoo also suffered dwindling visitor numbers However when it was announced that London Zoo would close in a swell of public support in visitors and donations allowed the zoo to continue its work attempt to balance its books and take on the huge task of restoring its buildings and creating environments more suitable for animal behaviour in the late th century The BAFTA winning documentary series The Ark by Molly Dineen chronicled this period of time br One benefit of the swell of public support was the development of volunteer staff Volunteers who give one day a week to assist the running of London Zoo wearing red pullovers are employed by both Education and Animal care br During the covid epidemic which started in the zoo was closed from March to June This closure resulted in a perilous financial position for the zoo due to the loss of revenue br The Snowdon Aviary was redeveloped as Monkey Valley opening in br br br Areas and attractions br br The Zoo has many named areas and attractions Several of them are available for hire

since the Roman Empire and the first in England since prehistoric times The hippo arrived at the London Zoo in May as a gift from the Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt in exchange for some greyhounds and deerhounds Obaysch led to a doubling of the zoo s visitors that year br In Jumbo the largest elephant known at the time was transferred to the zoo from Jardin des Plantes in Paris His name possibly from Jambo Swahili for hello became an epithet for anything of large size such as Boeing s Jumbo jet Jumbo became a crowd favourite due to his size and would give rides to children on his back

other elephants br On November Brumas became the first polar bear to be successfully bred at the zoo and immediately became a major attraction with the public This led to the zoo s annual attendance to rise to over million in a figure that has yet to be topped Despite being a female bear the press mistakenly reported her as a he and this error was not corrected leading the public to believe the bear was a male Eighteen years later on December the zoo welcomed its second polar bear cub a male He was named Pipaluk a Greenlandic Inuit feminine given name meaning little one or sweet little thing but in had to leave the zoo when the Mappin Terraces closed br One of the zoo s most famous giant pandas Chi Chi arrived in Although originally destined for an American zoo Washington D C had ceased

inspiration for Peter Scott s design for the World Wildlife Fund logo In July Chi Chi died and was publicly mourned br The zoo s last giant panda was Ming Ming She arrived in on a breeding loan from China After unsuccessful breeding attempts with Berlin s Zoo giant panda Bao Bao it was decided that Ming Ming should return to China As a result the London Zoo has been without a giant panda since

theirs br On January the last known Partula turgida land snail named Turgi died in his habitat For four days in late August the zoo ran an exhibit entitled the Human zoo which put eight humans on display in the Mappin Terraces The exhibit aimed to demonstrate the basic nature of man as an animal and examine our impact on the animal kingdom br br br Architecture br br Since its earliest days the zoo has prided itself on appointing leading architects to design its buildings Today it holds two Grade I and eight Grade II listed structures br The initial grounds were laid out in by Decimus Burton the zoo s first official architect from to made famous for his work on the London Colosseum and Marble Arch Burton s work began with the Clock Tower in above what was then the llama house which today is the first aid kiosk In the East Tunnel which linked the north and south parts of the zoo together for the first time was completed which also acted as a bomb shelter during the Second World War Burton concluded his work in with the Giraffe House which due to its functional design still remains in use as the zoo s giraffe enclosure in the Into Africa exhibit br The earliest surviving

designed by Berthold Lubetkin s Tecton Architectural Group to house gorillas was one of the first modernist style buildings to be built in Britain The following year the Penguin Pool also designed by Tecton was opened both now grade I listed The Modernist dual concrete spiral ramps of the Penguin Pool have made it famous as a piece of modern architecture but in the African penguins were moved out of the pool permanently following bumblefoot infections in the birds caused by micro abrasions from walking on the concrete br The Snowdon Aviary built in by Cedric Price Lord Snowdon and Frank Newby made pioneering use of aluminium and tension for support A year later the Casson Pavilion designed by Sir Hugh Casson and Neville Conder was opened as an elephant and rhinoceros house The Pavilion was commissioned to display these massive animals in the most dramatic way and designed to evoke a herd of elephants gathered around a watering hole br Many of these buildings are available on a private hire basis for events as well as a number of the animal houses The profits from the use of spaces at the zoo are re invested directly back into the society br br br In popular culture br br br In film
