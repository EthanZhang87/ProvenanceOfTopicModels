The Aztecs AZ teks were a Mesoamerican civilization that flourished in central Mexico in the post classic period from to The Aztec people included different ethnic groups of central Mexico particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who dominated large parts of Mesoamerica from the th to the th centuries Aztec culture was organized into city states altepetl some of which joined to form alliances political confederations or empires The Aztec Empire was a confederation of three city states established in Tenochtitlan the capital city of the Mexica or Tenochca Tetzcoco and Tlacopan previously part of the Tepanec empire whose dominant power was Azcapotzalco Although the term Aztecs is often narrowly restricted to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan it is also broadly used to refer to Nahua polities or peoples of central Mexico in the prehispanic era as well as the Spanish colonial era The definitions of Aztec and Aztecs have long been the topic of scholarly discussion ever since German scientist Alexander von Humboldt established its common usage in the early th century br Most ethnic groups of central Mexico in the post classic period shared essential cultural traits of Mesoamerica So many of the characteristics that characterize Aztec culture cannot be said to be exclusive to the Aztecs For the same reason the notion of Aztec civilization is best understood as a particular horizon of a general Mesoamerican civilization The culture of central Mexico includes maize cultivation the social division between nobility pipiltin and commoners macehualtin a pantheon featuring Tezcatlipoca Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl and the calendric system of a xiuhpohualli of days intercalated with a tonalpohualli of days Particular to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan was the patron God Huitzilopochtli twin pyramids and the ceramic styles known as Aztec I to IV br From the th century the Valley of Mexico was the heart of dense population and the rise of city states The Mexica were late comers to the Valley of Mexico and founded the city state of Tenochtitlan on unpromising islets in Lake Texcoco later becoming the dominant power of the Aztec Triple Alliance or Aztec Empire It was an empire that expanded its political hegemony far beyond the Valley of Mexico conquering other city states throughout Mesoamerica in the late post classic period It originated in as an alliance between the city states Tenochtitlan Texcoco and Tlacopan these allied to defeat the Tepanec state of Azcapotzalco which had previously dominated the Basin of Mexico Soon Texcoco and Tlacopan were relegated to junior partnership in the alliance with Tenochtitlan the dominant power The empire extended its reach by a combination of trade and military conquest It was never a true territorial empire controlling territory by large military garrisons in conquered provinces but rather dominated its client city states primarily by installing friendly rulers in conquered territories constructing marriage alliances between the ruling dynasties and extending an imperial ideology to its client city states Client city states paid taxes not tribute to the Aztec emperor the Huey Tlatoani in an economic strategy limiting communication and trade between outlying polities making them dependent on the imperial center for the acquisition of luxury goods The political clout of the empire reached far south into Mesoamerica conquering polities as far south as Chiapas and Guatemala and spanning Mesoamerica from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans br The empire reached its maximum extent in just before the arrival of a small group of Spanish conquistadors led by Hern n Cort s Cort s allied with city states opposed to the Mexica particularly the Nahuatl speaking Tlaxcalteca as well as other central Mexican polities including Texcoco its former ally in the Triple Alliance After the fall of Tenochtitlan on August and the capture of the emperor Cuauht moc the Spanish founded Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan From there they proceeded with the process of conquest and incorporation of Mesoamerican peoples into the Spanish Empire With the destruction of the superstructure of the Aztec Empire in the Spanish used the city states on which the Aztec Empire had been built to rule the indigenous populations via their local nobles Those nobles pledged loyalty to the Spanish crown and converted at least nominally to Christianity and in return were recognized as nobles by the Spanish crown Nobles acted as intermediaries to convey taxes and mobilize labor for their new overlords facilitating the establishment of Spanish colonial rule br Aztec culture and history are primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as that of the renowned Templo Mayor in Mexico City from Indigenous writings from eyewitness accounts by Spanish conquistadors such as Cort s and Bernal D az del Castillo and especially from th and th century descriptions of Aztec culture and history written by Spanish clergymen and literate Aztecs in the Spanish or Nahuatl language such as the famous illustrated bilingual Spanish and Nahuatl twelve volume Florentine Codex created by the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag n in collaboration with Indigenous Aztec informants Important for knowledge of post conquest Nahuas was the training of indigenous scribes to write alphabetic texts in Nahuatl mainly for local purposes under Spanish colonial rule At its height Aztec culture had rich and complex philosophical mythological and religious traditions as well as remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments br br br Definitions br br The Nahuatl words azt catl Nahuatl pronunciation as te kat singular and azt cah Nahuatl pronunciation as te ka plural mean people from Aztlan a mythical place of origin for several ethnic groups in central Mexico The term was not used as an endonym by the Aztecs themselves but it is found in the different migration accounts of the Mexica where it describes the different tribes who left Aztlan together In one account of the journey from Aztlan Huitzilopochtli the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe tells his followers on the journey that now no longer is your name Azteca you are now Mexitin Mexica br In today s usage the term Aztec often refers exclusively to the Mexica people of Tenochtitlan now the location of Mexico City situated on an island in Lake Texcoco who referred to themselves as M xihcah Nahuatl pronunciation me i ka a tribal designation that included the Tlatelolco Tenochcah Nahuatl pronunciation te not ka referring only to the Mexica of Tenochtitlan excluding Tlatelolco or C lhuah Nahuatl pronunciation ko lwa referring to their royal genealogy tying them to Culhuacan br Sometimes the term also includes the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan s two principal allied city states the Acolhuas of Texcoco and the Tepanecs of Tlacopan who together with the Mexica formed the Aztec Triple Alliance that controlled what is often known as the Aztec Empire The usage of the term Aztec in describing the empire centered in Tenochtitlan has been criticized by Robert H Barlow who preferred the term Culhua Mexica and by Pedro Carrasco who prefers the term Tenochca empire Carrasco writes about the term Aztec that it is of no use for understanding the ethnic complexity of ancient Mexico and for identifying the dominant element in the political entity we are studying br In other contexts Aztec may refer to all the various city states and their peoples who shared large parts of their ethnic history and cultural traits with the Mexica Acolhua and Tepanecs and who often also used the Nahuatl language as a lingua franca An example is Jerome A Offner s Law and Politics in Aztec Texcoco In this meaning it is possible to talk about an Aztec civilization including all the particular cultural patterns common for most of the peoples inhabiting central Mexico in the late postclassic period Such usage may also extend the term Aztec to all the groups in Central Mexico that were incorporated culturally or politically into the sphere of dominance of the Aztec empire br When used to describe ethnic groups the term Aztec refers to several Nahuatl speaking peoples of central Mexico in the postclassic period of Mesoamerican chronology especially the Mexica the ethnic group that had a leading role in establishing the hegemonic empire based at Tenochtitlan The term extends to further ethnic groups associated with the Aztec empire such as the Acolhua the Tepanec and others that were incorporated into the empire Charles Gibson enumerates many groups in central Mexico that he includes in his study The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule These include the Culhuaque Cuitlahuaque Mixquica Xochimilca Chalca Tepaneca Acolhuaque and Mexica br In older usage the term was commonly used about modern Nahuatl speaking ethnic groups as Nahuatl was previously referred to as the Aztec language In recent usage these ethnic groups are referred to as the Nahua peoples Linguistically the term Aztecan is still used about the branch of the Uto Aztecan languages also sometimes called the Uto Nahuan languages that includes the Nahuatl language and its closest relatives Pochutec and Pipil br To the Aztecs themselves the word Aztec was not an endonym for any particular ethnic group Rather it was an umbrella term used to refer to several ethnic groups not all of them Nahuatl speaking that claimed heritage from the mythic place of origin Aztlan Alexander von Humboldt originated the modern usage of Aztec in as a collective term applied to all the people linked by trade custom religion and language to the Mexica state and the Triple Alliance In with the publication of the work of William H Prescott on the history of the conquest of Mexico the term was adopted by most of the world including th century Mexican scholars who saw it as a way to distinguish present day Mexicans from pre conquest Mexicans This usage has been the subject of debate in more recent years but the term Aztec is still more common br br br History br br br Sources of knowledge br br Knowledge of Aztec society rests on several different sources The many archeological remains of everything from temple pyramids to thatched huts can be used to understand many of the aspects of what the Aztec world was like However archeologists often must rely on knowledge from other sources to interpret the historical context of artifacts There are many written texts by the indigenous people and Spaniards of the early colonial period that contain invaluable information about pre colonial Aztec history These texts provide insight into the political histories of various Aztec city states and their ruling lineages Such histories were produced as well in pictorial codices Some of these manuscripts were entirely pictorial often with glyphs In the postconquest era many other texts were written in Latin script by either literate Aztecs or by Spanish friars who interviewed the native people about their customs and stories An important pictorial and alphabetic text produced in the early sixteenth century was Codex Mendoza named after the first viceroy of Mexico and perhaps commissioned by him to inform the Spanish crown about the political and economic structure of the Aztec empire It has information naming the polities that the Triple Alliance conquered the types of taxes rendered to the Aztec Empire and the class gender structure of their society Many written annals exist written by local Nahua historians recording the histories of their polity These annals used pictorial histories and were subsequently transformed into alphabetic annals in Latin script Well known native chroniclers and annalists are Chimalpahin of Amecameca Chalco Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc of Tenochtitlan Alva Ixtlilxochitl of Texcoco Juan Bautista Pomar of Texcoco and Diego Mu oz Camargo of Tlaxcala There are also many accounts by Spanish conquerors who participated in the Spanish invasion such as Bernal D az del Castillo who wrote a full history of the conquest br Spanish friars also produced documentation in chronicles and other types of accounts Of key importance is Toribio de Benavente Motolinia one of the first twelve Franciscans arriving in Mexico in Another Franciscan of great importance was Fray Juan de Torquemada author of Monarquia Indiana Dominican Diego Dur n also wrote extensively about pre Hispanic religion as well as the history of the Mexica An invaluable source of information about many aspects of Aztec religious thought political and social structure as well as the history of the Spanish conquest from the Mexica viewpoint is the Florentine Codex Produced between and in the form of an ethnographic encyclopedia written bilingually in Spanish and Nahuatl by Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahag n and indigenous informants and scribes it contains knowledge about many aspects of precolonial society from religion calendrics botany zoology trades and crafts and history Another source of knowledge is the cultures and customs of the contemporary Nahuatl speakers who can often provide insights into what prehispanic ways of life may have been like Scholarly study of Aztec civilization is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies combining archeological knowledge with ethnohistorical and ethnographic information br br br Central Mexico in the classic and postclassic br br It is a matter of debate whether the enormous city of Teotihuacan was inhabited by speakers of Nahuatl or whether Nahuas had not yet arrived in central Mexico in the classic period It is generally agreed that the Nahua peoples were not indigenous to the highlands of central Mexico but that they gradually migrated into the region from somewhere in northwestern Mexico At the fall of Teotihuacan in the th century CE some city states rose to power in central Mexico some of them including Cholula and Xochicalco probably inhabited by Nahuatl speakers One study has suggested that Nahuas originally inhabited the Baj o area around Guanajuato which reached a population peak in the th century after which the population quickly diminished during a subsequent dry period This depopulation of the Baj o coincided with an incursion of new populations into the Valley of Mexico which suggests that this marks the influx of Nahuatl speakers into the region These people populated central Mexico dislocating speakers of Oto Manguean languages as they spread their political influence south As the former nomadic hunter gatherer peoples mixed with the complex civilizations of Mesoamerica adopting religious and cultural practices the foundation for later Aztec culture was laid After CE during the postclassic period many sites almost certainly inhabited by Nahuatl speakers became powerful Among them are the site of Tula Hidalgo and also city states such as Tenayuca and Colhuacan in the valley of Mexico and Cuauhnahuac in Morelos br br br Mexica migration and foundation of Tenochtitlan br In the ethnohistorical sources from the colonial period the Mexica themselves describe their arrival in the Valley of Mexico The ethnonym Aztec Nahuatl Aztecah means people from Aztlan Aztlan being a mythical place of origin toward the north Hence the term applied to all those peoples who claimed to carry the heritage from this mythical place The migration stories of the Mexica tribe tell how they traveled with other tribes including the Tlaxcalteca Tepaneca and Acolhua but that eventually their tribal deity Huitzilopochtli told them to split from the other Aztec tribes and take on the name Mexica At the time of their arrival there were many Aztec city states in the region The most powerful were Colhuacan to the south and Azcapotzalco to the west The Tepanecs of Azcapotzalco soon expelled the Mexica from Chapultepec and executed the first Aztec royal family except Queen Chimalxochitl II In Colhuacan ruler Cocoxtli permitted them to settle in the empty barrens of Tizapan where they were eventually assimilated into Culhuacan culture The noble lineage of Colhuacan traced its roots back to the legendary city state of Tula and by marrying into Colhua families the Mexica now appropriated this heritage After living in Colhuacan the Mexica were again expelled and were forced to move br According to Aztec legend in the Mexica were shown a vision of an eagle perched on a prickly pear cactus eating a snake The vision indicated the location where they were to build their settlement The Mexica founded Tenochtitlan on a small swampy island in Lake Texcoco the inland lake of the Basin of Mexico The year of foundation is usually given as In the Mexica royal dynasty was founded when Acamapichtli son of a Mexica father and a Colhua mother was elected as the first Huey Tlatoani of Tenochtitlan br br br Early Mexica rulers br br In the first years after the founding of the Mexica dynasty the Mexica were a tributary of Azcapotzalco which had become a major regional power under the ruler Tezozomoc The Mexica supplied the Tepaneca with warriors for their successful conquest campaigns in the region and received part of the tribute from the conquered city states In this way the political standing and economy of Tenochtitlan gradually grew br In at Acamapichtli s death his son Huitzilihhuitl lit Hummingbird feather became ruler married to Tezozomoc s daughter the relationship with Azcapotzalco remained close Chimalpopoca lit She smokes like a shield son of Huitzilihhuitl became ruler of Tenochtitlan in In Azcapotzalco initiated a war against the Acolhua of Texcoco and killed their ruler Ixtlilxochitl Even though Ixtlilxochitl was married to Chimalpopoca s daughter the Mexica ruler continued to support Tezozomoc Tezozomoc died in and his sons began a struggle for the rulership of Azcapotzalco During this power struggle Chimalpopoca died probably killed by Tezozomoc s son Maxtla who saw him as a competitor Itzcoatl brother of Huitzilihhuitl and uncle of Chimalpopoca was elected the next Mexica tlatoani The Mexica were now in open war with Azcapotzalco and Itzcoatl petitioned for an alliance with Nezahualcoyotl son of the slain Texcocan ruler Ixtlilxochitl against Maxtla Itzcoatl also allied with Maxtla s brother Totoquihuaztli ruler of the Tepanec city of Tlacopan The Triple Alliance of Tenochtitlan Texcoco and Tlacopan besieged Azcapotzalco and in they destroyed the city and sacrificed Maxtla Through this victory Tenochtitlan became the dominant city state in the Valley of Mexico and the alliance between the three city states provided the basis on which the Aztec Empire was built br Itzcoatl proceeded by securing a power basis for Tenochtitlan by conquering the city states on the southern lake including Culhuacan Xochimilco Cuitlahuac and Mizquic These states had an economy based on highly productive chinampa agriculture cultivating human made extensions of rich soil in the shallow lake Xochimilco Itzcoatl then undertook further conquests in the valley of Morelos subjecting the city state of Cuauhnahuac today Cuernavaca br br br Early rulers of the Aztec Empire br br br Motecuzoma I Ilhuicamina br br In Moteuczomatzin Ilhuicamina lit he frowns like a lord he shoots the sky was elected tlatoani he was the son of Huitzilihhuitl brother of Chimalpopoca and had served as the war leader of his uncle Itzcoatl in the war against the Tepanecs The accession of a new ruler in the dominant city state was often an occasion for subjected cities to rebel by refusing to pay taxes This meant that new rulers began their rule with a coronation campaign often against rebellious provinces but also sometimes demonstrating their military might by making new conquests Motecuzoma tested the attitudes of the cities around the valley by requesting laborers for the enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan Only the city of Chalco refused to provide laborers and hostilities between Chalco and Tenochtitlan would persist until the s Motecuzoma then reconquered the cities in the valley of Morelos and Guerrero and then later undertook new conquests in the Huaxtec region of northern Veracruz and the Mixtec region of Coixtlahuaca and large parts of Oaxaca and later again in central and southern Veracruz with conquests at Cosamalopan Ahuilizapan and Cuetlaxtlan During this period the city states of Tlaxcalan Cholula and Huexotzinco emerged as major competitors to the imperial expansion and they supplied warriors to several of the cities conquered Motecuzoma therefore initiated a state of low intensity warfare against these three cities staging minor skirmishes called Flower Wars Nahuatl xochiyaoyotl against them perhaps as a strategy of exhaustion br Motecuzoma I also consolidated the political structure of the Triple Alliance and the internal political organization of Tenochtitlan His brother Tlacaelel served as his main advisor Nahuatl languages Cihuacoatl and he is considered the architect of major political reforms in this period consolidating the power of the noble class Nahuatl languages pipiltin and instituting a set of legal codes and the practice of reinstating conquered rulers in their cities bound by fealty to the Mexica tlatoani br br br Axayacatl and Tizoc br In the next ruler was Axayacatl lit Water mask son of Itzcoatl s son Tezozomoc and Motecuzoma I s daughter Atotoztli II He undertook a successful coronation campaign far south of Tenochtitlan against the Zapotecs in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Axayacatl also conquered the independent Mexica city of Tlatelolco located on the northern part of the island where Tenochtitlan was also located The Tlatelolco ruler Moquihuix was married to Axayacatl s sister and his alleged mistreatment of her was used as an excuse to incorporate Tlatelolco and its important market directly under the control of the tlatoani of Tenochtitlan br Axayacatl then conquered areas in Central Guerrero the Puebla Valley on the gulf coast and against the Otomi and Matlatzinca in the Toluca Valley The Toluca Valley was a buffer zone against the powerful Tarascan state in Michoacan against which Axayacatl turned next In the major campaign against the Tarascans Nahuatl languages Michhuahqueh in the Aztec forces were repelled by a well organized defense Axayacatl was soundly defeated in a battle at Tlaximaloyan today Tajimaroa losing most of his men and only barely escaping back to Tenochtitlan with the remnants of his army br In at Axayacatls death his older brother Tizoc was elected ruler Tizoc s coronation campaign against the Otomi of Metztitlan failed as he lost the major battle and only managed to secure prisoners to be sacrificed for his coronation ceremony Having shown weakness many cities rebelled and consequently most of Tizoc s short reign was spent attempting to quell rebellions and maintain control of areas conquered by his predecessors Tizoc died suddenly in and it has been suggested that he was poisoned by his brother and war leader Ahuitzotl who became the next tlatoani Tizoc is mostly known as the namesake of the Stone of Tizoc a monumental sculpture Nahuatl temalacatl decorated with a representation of Tizoc s conquests br br br Ahuitzotl br br The next ruler was Ahuitzotl lit Water monster brother of Axayacatl and Tizoc and war leader under Tizoc His successful coronation campaign suppressed rebellions in the Toluca Valley and conquered Jilotepec and several communities in the northern Valley of Mexico A second campaign to the gulf coast was also highly successful He began an enlargement of the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan inaugurating the new temple in For the inauguration ceremony the Mexica invited the rulers of all their subject cities who participated as spectators in the ceremony in which an unprecedented number of war captives were sacrificed some sources giving a figure of prisoners sacrificed over four days Probably the actual figure of sacrifices was much smaller but still numbering several thousand There have never been found enough skulls in the capital to satisfy even the most conservative figures Ahuitzotl also constructed monumental architecture in sites such as Calixtlahuaca Malinalco and Tepoztlan After a rebellion in the towns of Alahuiztlan and Oztoticpac in Northern Guerrero he ordered the entire population executed and repopulated with people from the valley of Mexico He also constructed a fortified garrison at Oztuma defending the border against the Tarascan state br br br Final Aztec rulers and the Spanish conquest br br Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin is known to world history as the Aztec ruler when the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies began their conquest of the empire in a two year long campaign His early rule did not hint at his future fame He succeeded in the rulership after the death of Ahuitzotl Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin lit He frowns like a lord the youngest child who is dead as he had lived in life but not death was a son of Axayacatl and a war leader He began his rule in standard fashion conducting a coronation campaign to demonstrate his skills as a leader He attacked the fortified city of Nopallan in Oaxaca and subjected the adjacent region to the empire An effective warrior Moctezuma maintained the pace of conquest set by his predecessor and subjected large areas in Guerrero Oaxaca Puebla and even far south along the Pacific and Gulf coasts conquering the province of Xoconochco in Chiapas he also intensified the flower wars waged against Tlaxcala and Huexotzinco and secured an alliance with Cholula He also consolidated the class structure of Aztec society by making it harder for commoners Nahuatl languages macehualtin to accede to the privileged class of the pipiltin through merit in combat He also instituted a strict sumptuary code limiting the types of luxury goods that could be consumed by commoners br br In Moctezuma received the first news of ships with strange warriors having landed on the Gulf Coast near Cempoallan and he dispatched messengers to greet them and find out what was happening and he ordered his subjects in the area to keep him informed of any new arrivals In he was informed of the arrival of the Spanish fleet of Hern n Cort s who soon marched toward Tlaxcala where he allied with the traditional enemies of the Aztecs On November Moctezuma II received Cort s and his troops and Tlaxcalan allies on the causeway south of Tenochtitlan and he invited the Spaniards to stay as his guests in Tenochtitlan When Aztec troops destroyed a Spanish camp on the Gulf Coast Cort s ordered Moctezuma to execute the commanders responsible for the attack and Moctezuma complied At this point the power balance had shifted toward the Spaniards who now held Moctezuma as a prisoner in his palace As this shift in power became clear to Moctezuma s subjects the Spaniards became increasingly unwelcome in the capital city and in June hostilities broke out culminating in the massacre in the Great Temple and a major uprising of the Mexica against the Spanish During the fighting Moctezuma was killed either by the Spaniards who killed him as they fled the city or by the Mexica themselves who considered him a traitor br Cuitl huac a kinsman and adviser to Moctezuma succeeded him as tlatoani mounting the defense of Tenochtitlan against the Spanish invaders and their indigenous allies He ruled for only days perhaps dying in a smallpox epidemic although early sources do not give the cause He was succeeded by Cuauht moc the last independent Mexica tlatoani who continued the fierce defense of Tenochtitlan The Aztecs were weakened by disease and the Spanish enlisted tens of thousands of Indian allies especially Tlaxcalans for the assault on Tenochtitlan After the siege and destruction of the Aztec capital Cuauht moc was captured on August marking the beginning of Spanish hegemony in central Mexico Spaniards held Cuauht moc captive until he was tortured and executed on the orders of Cort s supposedly for treason during an ill fated expedition to Honduras in His death marked the end of a tumultuous era in Aztec political history br After the fall of the Aztec Empire entire Nahua communities were subject to forced labor under the encomienda system the Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education and Aztec religious practices were forcibly replaced with Catholicism br br br Political and social organization br br br Nobles and commoners br br The highest class was the p piltin or nobility The pilli status was hereditary and ascribed certain privileges to its holders such as the right to wear particularly fine garments and consume luxury goods as well as to own land and direct corvee labor by commoners The most powerful nobles were called lords Nahuatl languages teuctin and they owned and controlled noble estates or houses and could serve in the highest government positions or as military leaders Nobles made up about five percent of the population br The second class was the m cehualtin originally peasants but later extended to the lower working classes in general Eduardo Noguera estimates that in later stages only percent of the population was dedicated to agriculture and food production The other percent of society were warriors artisans and traders Eventually most of the m cehuallis were dedicated to arts and crafts Their works were an important source of income for the city Macehualtin could become enslaved Nahuatl languages tlacotin for example if they had to sell themselves into the service of a noble due to debt or poverty but enslavement was not an inherited status among the Aztecs Some macehualtin were landless and worked directly for a lord Nahuatl languages mayehqueh whereas the majority of commoners were organized into calpollis which gave them access to land and property br Commoners were able to obtain privileges similar to those of the nobles by demonstrating prowess in warfare When a warrior took a captive he accrued the right to use certain emblems weapons or garments and as he took more captives his rank and prestige increased br br br Family and gender br br The Aztec family pattern was bilateral counting relatives on the father s and mother s side of the family equally and inheritance was also passed both to sons and daughters This meant that women could own property just as men and that women therefore had a good deal of economic freedom from their spouses Nevertheless Aztec society was highly gendered with separate gender roles for men and women Men were expected to work outside of the house as farmers traders craftsmen and warriors whereas women were expected to take responsibility for the domestic sphere Women could however also work outside of the home as small scale merchants doctors priests and midwives Warfare was highly valued and a source of high prestige but women s work was metaphorically conceived of as equivalent to warfare and as equally important in maintaining the equilibrium of the world and pleasing the gods This situation has led some scholars to describe Aztec gender ideology as an ideology not of a gender hierarchy but of gender complementarity with gender roles being separate but equal br Among the nobles marriage alliances were often used as a political strategy with lesser nobles marrying daughters from more prestigious lineages whose status was then inherited by their children Nobles were also often polygamous with lords having many wives Polygamy was not very common among the commoners and some sources describe it as being prohibited br br br Altepetl and calpolli br br The main unit of Aztec political organization was the city state in Nahuatl called the altepetl meaning water mountain Each altepetl was led by a ruler a tlatoani with authority over a group of nobles and a population of commoners The altepetl included a capital that served as a religious center the hub of distribution and organization of a local population that often lived spread out in minor settlements surrounding the capital Altepetl was also the main source of ethnic identity for the inhabitants even though Altepetl was frequently composed of groups speaking different languages Each altepetl would see itself as standing in political contrast to other altepetl polities and war was waged between altepetl states In this way Nahuatl speaking Aztecs of one Altepetl would be solidary with speakers of other languages belonging to the same altepetl but enemies of Nahuatl speakers belonging to other competing altepetl states In the basin of Mexico altepetl was composed of subdivisions called calpolli which served as the main organizational unit for commoners In Tlaxcala and the Puebla valley the altepetl was organized into teccalli units headed by a lord Nahuatl languages tecutli who would hold sway over a territory and distribute rights to land among the commoners A calpolli was at once a territorial unit where commoners organized labor and land use since the land was not private property and also often a kinship unit as a network of families that were related through intermarriage Calpolli leaders might be or become members of the nobility in which case they could represent their Calpolli interests in the altepetl government br In the valley of Morelos archeologist Michael E Smith estimates that a typical altepetl had from to inhabitants and covered an area between and square kilometers and sq mi In the Morelos Valley altepetl sizes were somewhat smaller Smith argues that the altepetl was primarily a political unit made up of the population with allegiance to a lord rather than as a territorial unit He makes this distinction because in some areas minor settlements with different altepetl allegiances were interspersed br br br Triple Alliance and Aztec Empire br br The Aztec Empire was ruled by indirect means Like most European empires it was ethnically very diverse but unlike most European empires it was more of a hegemonic confederacy than a single system of government Ethnohistorian Ross Hassig has argued that the Aztec empire is best understood as an informal or hegemonic empire because it did not exert supreme authority over the conquered lands it merely expected taxes to be paid and exerted force only to the degree it was necessary to ensure the payment of taxes It was also a discontinuous empire because not all dominated territories were connected for example the southern peripheral zones of Xoconochco were not in direct contact with the center The hegemonic nature of the Aztec empire can be seen in the fact that generally local rulers were restored to their positions once their city state was conquered and the Aztecs did not generally interfere in local affairs as long as the tax payments were made and the local elites participated willingly Such compliance was secured by establishing and maintaining a network of elites related through intermarriage and different forms of exchange br Nevertheless the expansion of the empire was accomplished through military control of frontier zones in strategic provinces where a much more direct approach to conquest and control was taken Such strategic provinces were often exempt from taxation The Aztecs even invested in those areas by maintaining a permanent military presence installing puppet rulers or even moving entire populations from the center to maintain a loyal base of support In this way the Aztec system of government distinguished between different strategies of control in the outer regions of the empire far from the core in the Valley of Mexico Some provinces were treated as subject provinces which provided the basis for economic stability for the empire and strategic provinces which were the basis for further expansion br Although the form of government is often referred to as an empire most areas within the empire were organized as city states known as altepetl in Nahuatl These were small polities ruled by a hereditary leader tlatoani from a legitimate noble dynasty The Early Aztec period was a time of growth and competition among altepetl Even after the confederation of the Triple Alliance was formed in and began its expansion through conquest the altepetl remained the dominant form of organization at the local level The efficient role of the altepetl as a regional political unit was largely responsible for the success of the empire s hegemonic form of control br br br Economy br br br Agriculture and subsistence br br Like all Mesoamerican peoples Aztec society was organized around maize agriculture The humid environment in the Valley of Mexico with its many lakes and swamps permitted intensive agriculture The main crops in addition to maize were beans squashes chilies and amaranth Particularly important for agricultural production in the valley was the construction of chinampas on the lake artificial islands that allowed the conversion of the shallow waters into highly fertile gardens that could be cultivated year round Chinampas are human made extensions of agricultural land created from alternating layers of mud from the bottom of the lake and plant matter and other vegetation These raised beds were separated by narrow canals which allowed farmers to move between them by canoe Chinampas were extremely fertile pieces of land and yielded on average seven crops annually Based on current chinampa yields it has been estimated that one hectare acres of chinampa would feed individuals and hectares acres of chinampas could feed br The Aztecs further intensified agricultural production by constructing systems of artificial irrigation While most of the farming occurred outside the densely populated areas within the cities there was another method of small scale farming Each family had a garden plot where they grew maize fruits herbs medicines and other important plants When the city of Tenochtitlan became a major urban center water was supplied to the city through aqueducts from springs on the banks of the lake and they organized a system that collected human waste for use as fertilizer Through intensive agriculture the Aztecs were able to sustain a large urbanized population The lake was also a rich source of proteins in the form of aquatic animals such as fish amphibians shrimp insects and insect eggs and waterfowl The presence of such varied sources of protein meant that there was little use for domestic animals for meat only turkeys and dogs were kept and scholars have calculated that there was no shortage of protein among the inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico br br br Crafts and trades br br The excess supply of food products allowed a significant portion of the Aztec population to dedicate themselves to trades other than food production Apart from taking care of domestic food production women weaved textiles from agave fibers and cotton Men also engaged in craft specializations such as the production of ceramics and obsidian and flint tools and of luxury goods such as beadwork featherwork and the elaboration of tools and musical instruments Sometimes entire calpollis specialized in a single craft and in some archeological sites large neighborhoods have been found where only a single craft specialty was practiced br The Aztecs did not produce much metalwork but did have knowledge of basic smelting technology for gold and they combined gold with precious stones such as jade and turquoise Copper products were generally imported from the Tarascans of Michoacan br br br Trade and distribution br br Products were distributed through a network of markets some markets specialized in a single commodity e g the dog market of Acolman and other general markets with the presence of many different goods Markets were highly organized with a system of supervisors taking care that only authorized merchants were permitted to sell their goods and punishing those who cheated their customers or sold substandard or counterfeit goods A typical town would have a weekly market every five days while larger cities held markets every day Cort s reported that the central market of Tlatelolco Tenochtitlan s sister city was visited by people daily Some sellers in the markets were petty vendors farmers might sell some of their produce potters sold their vessels and so on Other vendors were professional merchants who traveled from market to market seeking profits br The pochteca were specialized long distance merchants organized into exclusive guilds They made long expeditions to all parts of Mesoamerica bringing back exotic luxury goods and they served as the judges and supervisors of the Tlatelolco market Although the economy of Aztec Mexico was commercialized in its use of money markets and merchants land and labor were not generally commodities for sale though some types of land could be sold between nobles In the commercial sector of the economy several types of money were in regular use Small purchases were made with cacao beans which had to be imported from lowland areas In Aztec marketplaces a small rabbit was worth beans a turkey egg cost three beans and a tamal cost a single bean For larger purchases standardized lengths of cotton cloth called quachtli were used There were different grades of quachtli ranging in value from to cacao beans About quachtli could support a commoner for one year in Tenochtitlan br br br Taxation br br Another form of distribution of goods was through the payment of taxes When an altepetl was conquered the victor imposed a yearly tax usually paid in the form of whichever local product was most valuable or treasured Several pages from the Codex Mendoza list subject towns along with the goods they supplied which included not only luxuries such as feathers adorned suits and greenstone beads but more practical goods such as cloth firewood and food Taxes were usually paid twice or four times a year at differing times br Archaeological excavations in the Aztec ruled provinces show that incorporation into the empire had both costs and benefits for provincial peoples On the positive side the empire promoted commerce and trade and exotic goods from obsidian to bronze managed to reach the houses of both commoners and nobles Trade partners also included the enemy Pur pecha also known as Tarascans a source of bronze tools and jewelry On the negative side imperial taxes imposed a burden on commoner households who had to increase their work to pay their share of taxes Nobles on the other hand often made out well under the imperial rule because of the indirect nature of imperial organization The empire had to rely on local kings and nobles and offered them privileges for their help in maintaining order and keeping the tax revenue flowing br br br Urbanism br Aztec society combined a relatively simple agrarian rural tradition with the development of a truly urbanized society with a complex system of institutions specializations and hierarchies The urban tradition in Mesoamerica was developed during the classic period with major urban centers such as Teotihuacan with a population well above and at the time of the rise of the Aztecs the urban tradition was ingrained in Mesoamerican society with urban centers serving major religious political and economic functions for the entire population br br br Mexico Tenochtitlan br br The capital city of the Aztec empire was Tenochtitlan now the site of modern day Mexico City Built on a series of islets in Lake Texcoco the city plan was based on a symmetrical layout that was divided into four city sections called campan directions Tenochtitlan was built according to a fixed plan and centered on the ritual precinct where the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan rose meters ft above the city Houses were made of wood and loam and roofs were made of reed although pyramids temples and palaces were generally made of stone The city was interlaced with canals which were useful for transportation Anthropologist Eduardo Noguera estimated the population at based on the house count and merging the population of Tlatelolco once an independent city but later became a suburb of Tenochtitlan If one includes the surrounding islets and shores surrounding Lake Texcoco estimates range from to inhabitants Michael E Smith gives a somewhat smaller figure of inhabitants of Tenochtitlan based on an area of hectares acres and a population density of inhabitants per hectare acre The second largest city in the valley of Mexico in the Aztec period was Texcoco with some inhabitants dispersed over hectares acres br The center of Tenochtitlan was the sacred precinct a walled off square area that housed the Great Temple temples for other deities the ballcourt the calmecac a school for nobles a skull rack tzompantli displaying the skulls of sacrificial victims houses of the warrior orders and a merchants palace Around the sacred precinct were the royal palaces built by the tlatoanis br br br The Great Temple br br The centerpiece of Tenochtitlan was the Templo Mayor the Great Temple a large stepped pyramid with a double staircase leading up to two twin shrines one dedicated to Tlaloc the other to Huitzilopochtli This was where most of the human sacrifices were carried out during the ritual festivals and the bodies of sacrificial victims were thrown down the stairs The temple was enlarged in several stages and most of the Aztec rulers made a point of adding a further stage each with a new dedication and inauguration The temple has been excavated in the center of Mexico City and the rich dedicatory offerings are displayed in the Museum of the Templo Mayor br Archeologist Eduardo Matos Moctezuma in his essay Symbolism of the Templo Mayor posits that the orientation of the temple is indicative of the totality of the vision the Mexica had of the universe cosmovision He states that the principal center or navel where the horizontal and vertical planes intersect that is the point from which the heavenly or upper plane and the plane of the Underworld begin and the four directions of the universe originate is the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan Matos Moctezuma supports his supposition by claiming that the temple acts as an embodiment of a living myth where all sacred power is concentrated and where all the levels intersect br br br Other major city states br Other major Aztec cities were some of the previous city state centers around the lake including Tenayuca Azcapotzalco Texcoco Colhuacan Tlacopan Chapultepec Coyoacan Xochimilco and Chalco In the Puebla Valley Cholula was the largest city with the largest pyramid temple in Mesoamerica while the confederacy of Tlaxcala consisted of four smaller cities In Morelos Cuahnahuac was a major city of the Nahuatl speaking Tlahuica tribe and Tollocan in the Toluca Valley was the capital of the Matlatzinca tribe which included Nahuatl speakers as well as speakers of Otomi and the language today called Matlatzinca Most Aztec cities had a similar layout with a central plaza with a major pyramid with two staircases and a double temple oriented toward the west br br br Religion br br Nahuas metaphysics centers around teotl a single dynamic vivifying eternally self generating and self regenerating sacred power energy or force This is conceptualized in a kind of monistic pantheism as manifest in the supreme god Ometeotl as well as a large pantheon of lesser gods and idealizations of natural phenomena such as stars and fire Priests and educated upper classes held more monistic views while the popular religion of the uneducated tended to embrace the polytheistic and mythological aspects br In common with many other indigenous Mesoamerican civilizations the Aztecs put great ritual emphasis on calendrics and scheduled festivals government ceremonies and even war around key transition dates in the Aztec calendar Public ritual practices could involve food storytelling and dance as well as ceremonial warfare the Mesoamerican ballgame and human sacrifice as a manner of payment for or even effecting the continuation of the days and the cycle of life br br br Deities br br The four main deities worshiped by the Aztecs were Tlaloc Huitzilopochtli Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca Tlaloc is a rain and storm deity Huitzilopochtli a solar and martial deity and the tutelary deity of the Mexica tribe Quetzalcoatl a wind sky and star deity and cultural hero and Tezcatlipoca a deity of the night magic prophecy and fate The Great Temple in Tenochtitlan had two shrines on its top one dedicated to Tlaloc the other to Huitzilopochtli The two shrines represented two sacred mountains the left one was Tonacatepetl the Hill of Sustenance whose patron god was Tlaloc and the right one was Coatepec whose patron god was Huitzilopochtli Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca each had separate temples within the religious precinct close to the Great Temple and the high priests of the Great Temple were named Quetzalcoatl Tlamacazqueh Other major deities were Tlaltecutli or Coatlicue a female earth deity the deity couple Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl associated with life and sustenance Mictlantecutli and Mictlancihuatl a male and female couple of deities that represented the underworld and death Chalchiutlicue a female deity of lakes and springs Xipe Totec a deity of fertility and the natural cycle Huehueteotl or Xiuhtecuhtli a fire god Tlazolteotl a female deity tied to childbirth and sexuality and Xochipilli and Xochiquetzal gods of song dance and games In some regions particularly Tlaxcala Mixcoatl or Camaxtli was the main tribal deity A few sources mention a binary deity Ometeotl who may have been a god of the duality between life and death male and female and who may have incorporated Tonacatecuhtli and Tonacacihuatl Some historians argue against the notion that Ometeotl was a dual god claiming that scholars are applying their preconceived ideas onto translated texts Apart from the major deities there were dozens of minor deities each associated with an element or concept and as the Aztec empire grew so did their pantheon because they adopted and incorporated the local deities of conquered people into their own Additionally the major gods had many alternative manifestations or aspects creating small families of gods with related aspects br br br Mythology and worldview br br Aztec mythology is known from many sources written down in the colonial period One set of myths called Legend of the Suns describes the creation of four successive suns or periods each ruled by a different deity and inhabited by a different group of beings Each period ends in a cataclysmic destruction that sets the stage for the next period to begin In this process the deities Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as adversaries each destroying the creations of the other The current Sun the fifth was created when a minor deity sacrificed himself on a bonfire and turned into the sun but the sun only begins to move once the other deities sacrifice themselves and offer it their life force br In another myth of how the earth was created Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl appear as allies defeating a giant crocodile Cipactli and requiring her to become the earth allowing humans to carve into her flesh and plant their seeds on the condition that in return they will offer blood to her In the story of the creation of humanity Quetzalcoatl travels with his twin Xolotl to the underworld and brings back bones which are then ground like corn on a metate by the goddess Cihuacoatl the resulting dough is given human form and comes to life when Quetzalcoatl imbues it with his blood br Huitzilopochtli is the deity tied to the Mexica tribe and he figures in the story of the origin and migrations of the tribe On their journey Huitzilopochtli in the form of a deity bundle carried by the Mexica priest continuously spurs the tribe by pushing them into conflict with their neighbors whenever they are settled in a place In another myth Huitzilopochtli defeats and dismembers his sister the lunar deity Coyolxauhqui and her four hundred brothers at the hill of Coatepetl The southern side of the Great Temple also called Coatepetl was a representation of this myth and at the foot of the stairs lay a large stone monolith carved with a representation of the dismembered goddess br br br Calendar br br Aztec religious life was organized around the calendars Like most Mesoamerican people the Aztecs used two calendars simultaneously a ritual calendar of days called the tonalpohualli and a solar calendar of days called the xiuhpohualli Each day had a name and number in both calendars and the combination of two dates was unique within years The tonalpohualli was mostly used for divinatory purposes and it consisted of day signs and number coefficients of that cycled in a fixed order The xiuhpohualli was made up of months of days and with a remainder of five void days at the end of a cycle before the new xiuhpohualli cycle began Each day month was named after the specific ritual festival that began the month many of which contained a relation to the agricultural cycle Whether and how the Aztec calendar was corrected for leap year is a matter of discussion among specialists The monthly rituals involved the entire population as rituals were performed in each household in the calpolli temples and the main sacred precinct Many festivals involved different forms of dancing as well as the reenactment of mythical narratives by deity impersonators and the offering of sacrifice in the form of food animals and human victims br Every years the two calendars reached their shared starting point and a new calendar cycle began This calendar event was celebrated with a ritual known as Xiuhmolpilli or the New Fire Ceremony In this ceremony old pottery was broken in all homes and all fires in the Aztec realm were put out Then a new fire was drilled over the breast of a sacrificial victim and runners brought the new fire to the different calpolli communities where fire was redistributed to each home The night without fire was associated with the fear that star demons tzitzimimeh might descend and devour the earth ending the fifth period of the sun br br br Human sacrifice and cannibalism br br To the Aztecs death was instrumental in the perpetuation of creation and gods and humans alike had the responsibility of sacrificing themselves to allow life to continue As described in the myth of creation above humans were understood to be responsible for the sun s continued revival as well as for paying the earth for its continued fertility Blood sacrifice in various forms was conducted Both humans and animals were sacrificed depending on the god to be placated and the ceremony being conducted and priests of some gods were sometimes required to provide their blood through self mutilation It is known that some rituals included acts of cannibalism with the captor and his family consuming part of the flesh of their sacrificed captives but it is not known how widespread this practice was br While human sacrifice was practiced throughout Mesoamerica the Aztecs according to their accounts brought this practice to an unprecedented level For example for the reconsecration of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in Aztec and Spanish sources later said that prisoners were sacrificed over four days reportedly by Ahuitzotl the Great Speaker himself This number however is considered by many scholars as wildly exaggerated Other estimates place the number of human sacrifices at between and annually br The scale of Aztec human sacrifice has provoked many scholars to consider what may have been the driving factor behind this aspect of Aztec religion In the s Michael Harner and Marvin Harris argued that the motivation behind human sacrifice among the Aztecs was the cannibalization of the sacrificial victims depicted for example in Codex Magliabechiano Harner claimed that very high population pressure and an emphasis on maize agriculture without domesticated herbivores led to a deficiency of essential amino acids among the Aztecs While there is universal agreement that the Aztecs practiced sacrifice there is a lack of scholarly consensus as to whether cannibalism was widespread Harris the author of Cannibals and Kings has propagated the claim originally proposed by Harner that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins These claims have been refuted by Bernard Ort z Montellano who in his studies of Aztec health diet and medicine demonstrates that while the Aztec diet was low in animal proteins it was rich in vegetable proteins Ortiz also points to the preponderance of human sacrifice during periods of food abundance following harvests compared to periods of food scarcity the insignificant quantity of human protein available from sacrifices and the fact that aristocrats already had easy access to animal protein Today many scholars point to ideological explanations of the practice noting how the public spectacle of sacrificing warriors from conquered states was a major display of political power supporting the claim of the ruling classes to divine authority It also served as an important deterrent against rebellion by subjugated polities against the Aztec state and such deterrents were crucial for the loosely organized empire to cohere br br br Art and cultural production br The Aztecs greatly appreciated the toltecayotl arts and fine craftsmanship of the Toltecs who predated the Aztecs in central Mexico The Aztecs considered Toltec productions to represent the finest state of culture The fine arts included writing and painting singing and composing poetry carving sculptures and producing mosaics making fine ceramics producing complex featherwork and working metals including copper and gold Artisans of the fine arts were referred to collectively as tolteca Toltec br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Writing and iconography br br The Aztecs did not have a fully developed writing system like the Maya however like the Maya and Zapotec they did use a writing system that combined logographic signs with phonetic syllable signs Logograms would for example be the use of an image of a mountain to signify the word tepetl mountain whereas a phonetic syllable sign would be the use of an image of a tooth tlantli to signify the syllable tla in words unrelated to teeth The combination of these principles allowed the Aztecs to represent the sounds of names of persons and places Narratives tended to be represented through sequences of images using various iconographic conventions such as footprints to show paths temples on fire to show conquest events etc br Epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has demonstrated that the different syllable signs used by the Aztecs almost enabled the representation of all the most frequent syllables of the Nahuatl language with some notable exceptions but some scholars have argued that such a high degree of phonetics was only achieved after the conquest when the Aztecs had been introduced to the principles of phonetic writing by the Spanish Other scholars notably Gordon Whittaker have argued that the syllabic and phonetic aspects of Aztec writing were considerably less systematic and more creative than Lacadena s proposal suggests arguing that Aztec writing never coalesced into a strictly syllabic system such as the Maya writing but rather used a wide range of different types of phonetic signs br The image to the right demonstrates the use of phonetic signs for writing place names in the colonial Aztec Codex Mendoza The uppermost place is Mapachtepec meaning literally Hill of the Raccoon but the glyph includes the phonetic prefixes ma hand and pach moss over a mountain tepetl spelling the word mapach raccoon phonetically instead of logographically The other two place names Mazatlan Place of Many Deer and Huitztlan Place of many thorns use the phonetic element tlan represented by a tooth tlantli combined with a deer head to spell maza mazatl deer and a thorn huitztli to spell huitz br br br Music song and poetry br br Song and poetry were highly regarded there were presentations and poetry contests at most of the Aztec festivals There were also dramatic presentations that included players musicians and acrobats There were several different genres of cuicatl song Yaocuicatl was devoted to war and the god s of war Teocuicatl to the gods and creation myths and adoration of said figures xochicuicatl to flowers a symbol of poetry itself and indicative of the highly metaphorical nature of poetry that often used duality to convey multiple layers of meaning Prose was tlahtolli also with its different categories and divisions br A key aspect of Aztec poetics was the use of parallelism using a structure of embedded couplets to express different perspectives on the same element Some such couplets were diphrasisms conventional metaphors whereby an abstract concept was expressed metaphorically by using two more concrete concepts For example the Nahuatl expression for poetry was in xochitl in cuicatl a dual term meaning the flower the song br A remarkable amount of this poetry survives having been collected during the era of the conquest In some cases poetry is attributed to individual authors such as Nezahualcoyotl tlatoani of Texcoco and Cuacuauhtzin Lord of Tepechpan but whether these attributions reflect actual authorship is a matter of opinion An important collection of such poems is Romances de los se ores de la Nueva Espa a collected Tezcoco probably by Juan Bautista de Pomar and the Cantares Mexicanos Both men and women were poets in Aztec society illustrating pre Hispanic Mexico s gender parallelism in upper class society One famous female poet is Macuilxochitzin whose work primarily focused on the Aztec conquest br br br Ceramics br br The Aztecs produced ceramics of different types Common are orange wares which are orange or buff burnished ceramics with no slip Red wares are ceramics with a reddish slip Polychrome ware is ceramics with a white or orange slip with painted designs in orange red brown and or black Very common is black on orange ware which is orange ware decorated with painted designs in black br Aztec black on orange ceramics are chronologically classified into four phases Aztec I and II corresponding to c early Aztec period Aztec III c and the last phase Aztec IV was the early colonial period Aztec I is characterized by floral designs and day name glyphs Aztec II is characterized by a stylized grass design above calligraphic designs such as S curves or loops Aztec III is characterized by very simple line designs Aztec IV continues some pre Columbian designs but adds European influenced floral designs There were local variations on each of these styles and archeologists continue to refine the ceramic sequence br Typical vessels for everyday use were clay griddles for cooking comalli bowls and plates for eating caxitl pots for cooking comitl molcajetes or mortar type vessels with slashed bases for grinding chilli molcaxitl and different kinds of braziers tripod dishes and biconical goblets Vessels were fired in simple updraft kilns or even in open firing in pit kilns at low temperatures Polychrome ceramics were imported from the Cholula region also known as Mixteca Puebla style and these wares were highly prized as a luxury ware whereas the local black on orange styles were also for everyday use br br br Painted art br br Aztec painted art was produced on animal skin mostly deer on cotton lienzos and amate paper made from bark e g from Trema micrantha or Ficus aurea it was also produced on ceramics and carved in wood and stone The surface of the material was often first treated with gesso to make the images stand out more clearly The art of painting and writing was known in Nahuatl by the metaphor in tlilli in tlapalli meaning the black ink the red pigment br There are few extant Aztec painted books Of these none are conclusively confirmed to have been created before the conquest but several codices must have been painted either right before the conquest or very soon after before traditions for producing them were much disturbed Even if some codices may have been produced after the conquest there is good reason to think that they may have been copied from pre Columbian originals by scribes The Codex Borbonicus is considered by some to be the only extant Aztec codex produced before the conquest it is a calendric codex describing the day and month counts indicating the patron deities of the different periods Others consider it to have stylistic traits suggesting a post conquest production br Some codices were produced post conquest sometimes commissioned by the colonial government for example Codex Mendoza were painted by Aztec tlacuilos codex creators but under the control of Spanish authorities who also sometimes commissioned codices describing pre colonial religious practices for example Codex R os After the conquest codices with calendric or religious information were sought out and systematically destroyed by the church whereas other types of painted books particularly historical narratives and tax lists continued to be produced Although depicting Aztec deities and describing religious practices also shared by the Aztecs of the Valley of Mexico the codices produced in Southern Puebla near Cholula are sometimes not considered to be Aztec codices because they were produced outside of the Aztec heartland Karl Anton Nowotny nevertheless considered that the Codex Borgia painted in the area around Cholula and using a Mixtec style was the most significant work of art among the extant manuscripts br The first Aztec murals were from Teotihuacan Most of our current Aztec murals were found in Templo Mayor The Aztec capital was decorated with elaborate murals In Aztec murals humans are represented like they are represented in the codices One mural discovered in Tlateloco depicts an old man and an old woman This may represent the gods Cipactonal and Oxomico br br br Sculpture br br Sculptures were carved in stone and wood but few wood carvings have survived Aztec stone sculptures exist in many sizes from small figurines and masks to large monuments and are characterized by a high quality of craftsmanship Many sculptures were carved in highly realistic styles for example realistic sculpture of animals such as rattlesnakes dogs jaguars frogs turtles and monkeys br In Aztec artwork some monumental stone sculptures have been preserved such sculptures usually functioned as adornments for religious architecture Particularly famous monumental rock sculpture includes the so called Aztec Sunstone or Calendarstone discovered in also discovered in excavations of the Z calo was the meter tall ft Coatlicue statue made of andesite representing a serpentine chthonic goddess with a skirt made of rattlesnakes The Coyolxauhqui Stone representing the dismembered goddess Coyolxauhqui found in was at the foot of the staircase leading up to the Great Temple in Tenochtitlan Two important types of sculpture are unique to the Aztecs and related to the context of ritual sacrifice the cuauhxicalli or eagle vessel large stone bowls often shaped like eagles or jaguars used as a receptacle for extracted human hearts the temalacatl a monumental carved stone disk to which war captives were tied and sacrificed in a form of gladiatorial combat The most well known examples of this type of sculpture are the Stone of Tizoc and the Stone of Motecuzoma I both carved with images of warfare and conquest by specific Aztec rulers Many smaller stone sculptures depicting deities also exist The style used in religious sculpture was rigid stances likely meant to create a powerful experience for the onlooker Although Aztec stone sculptures are now displayed in museums as unadorned rock they were originally painted in vivid polychrome color sometimes covered first with a base coat of plaster Early Spanish conquistador accounts also describe stone sculptures as having been decorated with precious stones and metal inserted into the plaster br br br Featherwork br br An especially prized art form among the Aztecs was featherwork the creation of intricate and colorful mosaics of feathers and their use in garments as well as decoration on weaponry war banners and warrior suits The class of highly skilled and honored craftsmen who created feather objects was called the amanteca named after the Amantla neighborhood in Tenochtitlan where they lived and worked They did not pay taxes nor were required to perform public service The Florentine Codex gives information about how feather works were created The amanteca had two ways of creating their works One was to secure the feathers in place using agave cords for three dimensional objects such as fly whisks fans bracelets headgear and other objects The second and more difficult was a mosaic type technique which the Spanish also called feather painting These were done principally on feather shields and cloaks for idols Feather mosaics were arrangements of minute fragments of feathers from a wide variety of birds generally worked on a paper base made from cotton and paste then itself backed with amate paper but bases of other types of paper and directly on amate were done as well These works were done in layers with common feathers dyed feathers and precious feathers First a model was made with lower quality feathers and the precious feathers were found only on the top layer The adhesive for the feathers in the Mesoamerican period was made from orchid bulbs Feathers from local and faraway sources were used especially in the Aztec Empire The feathers were obtained from wild birds as well as from domesticated turkeys and ducks with the finest quetzal feathers coming from Chiapas Guatemala and Honduras These feathers were obtained through trade and taxes Due to the difficulty of conserving feathers fewer than ten pieces of original Aztec featherwork exist today br br br Colonial period br br Mexico City was built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan gradually replacing and covering the lake the island and the architecture of Aztec Tenochtitlan After the fall of Tenochtitlan Aztec warriors were enlisted as auxiliary troops alongside the Spanish Tlaxcalteca allies and Aztec forces participated in all of the subsequent campaigns of conquest in northern and southern Mesoamerica This meant that aspects of Aztec culture and the Nahuatl language continued to expand during the early colonial period as Aztec auxiliary forces made permanent settlements in many of the areas that were put under the Spanish crown br The Aztec ruling dynasty continued to govern the indigenous polity of San Juan Tenochtitlan a division of the Spanish capital of Mexico City but the subsequent indigenous rulers were mostly puppets installed by the Spanish One was Andr s de Tapia Motelchiuh who was appointed by the Spanish Other former Aztec city states likewise were established as colonial indigenous towns governed by a local indigenous gobernador This office was often initially held by the hereditary indigenous ruling line with the gobernador being the tlatoani but the two positions in many Nahua towns became separated over time Indigenous governors were in charge of the colonial political organization of the Indians In particular they enabled the continued functioning of the tax and enslavement of indigenous commoners to benefit the Spanish encomenderos Encomenderos owned encomiendas large tracts of agricultural land on which the encomenderos and their slaves lived The Spanish coerced the tribes into granting them private ownership of indigenous people and land for enslavement and encomiendas Occasionally an Indigenous individual benefited from this system and grew into substantial wealth and power come the colonial period br br br Population decline br br After the arrival of the Europeans in Mexico and the conquest indigenous populations declined significantly This was largely the result of the epidemics of viruses brought to the continent against which the natives had no immunity In an outbreak of smallpox swept through the population of Tenochtitlan and was decisive in the fall of the city further significant epidemics struck in and br There has been no consensus about the population size of Mexico at the time of European arrival Early estimates gave very small population figures for the Valley of Mexico in Kubler estimated a figure of In Borah and Cook used preconquest tax lists to calculate the number of residents in central Mexico estimating over million Their very high figure has been highly criticized for relying on unwarranted assumptions Archeologist William Sanders based an estimate on archeological evidence of dwellings arriving at an estimate of million inhabitants in the Valley of Mexico Whitmore used a computer simulation model based on colonial censuses to arrive at an estimate of million for the Basin in and an estimate of million for all of Mexico Depending on the estimations of the population in the scale of the decline in the th century range from around percent to around percent with Sanders s and Whitmore s estimates being around percent br br br Social and political continuity and change br br Although the Aztec empire fell some of its highest elites continued to hold elite status in the colonial era The principal heirs of Moctezuma II and their descendants retained high status His son Pedro Moctezuma produced a son who married into the Spanish aristocracy and a further generation saw the creation of the title Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo From to the Viceroy of Mexico held the title of Count of Moctezuma In the holder of the title became a Grandee of Spain In during the Second Mexican Empire the title which was held by Antonio Mar a Moctezuma Marcilla de Teruel y Navarro th Count of Moctezuma de Tultengo was elevated to that of a Duke thus becoming Duke of Moctezuma with de Tultengo again added in by Juan Carlos I Two of Moctezuma s daughters Do a Isabel Moctezuma and her younger sister Do a Leonor Moctezuma were granted extensive encomiendas in perpetuity by Hern n Cortes Do a Leonor Moctezuma married in succession two Spaniards and left her encomiendas to her daughter by her second husband br The different Nahua peoples just like other Mesoamerican indigenous peoples in colonial New Spain were able to maintain many aspects of their social and political structure under colonial rule The basic division the Spanish made was between the Indigenous populations organized under the Rep blica de indios which was separate from the Hispanic sphere the Rep blica de espa oles The Rep blica de espa oles included not just Europeans but also Africans and mixed race castas The Spanish recognized the indigenous elites as nobles in the Spanish colonial system maintaining the status distinction of the preconquest era and used these noblemen as intermediaries between the Spanish colonial government and their communities This was contingent on their conversion to Christianity and continuing loyalty to the Spanish crown Colonial Nahua polities had considerable autonomy to regulate their local affairs The Spanish rulers did not entirely understand the indigenous political organization but they recognized the importance of the existing system and their elite rulers They reshaped the political system utilizing altepetl or city states as the basic unit of governance In the colonial era altepetl was renamed cabeceras or head towns although they often retained the term altepetl in local level Nahuatl language documentation with outlying settlements governed by the cabeceras named sujetos subject communities In cabeceras the Spanish created Iberian style town councils or cabildos which usually continued to function as the elite ruling group had in the Preconquest era Population decline due to epidemic disease resulted in many population shifts in settlement patterns and the formation of new population centers These were often forced resettlements under the Spanish policy of congregaci n Indigenous populations living in sparsely populated areas were resettled to form new communities making it easier for them to be brought within range of evangelization efforts and easier for the colonial state to exploit their labor br br br Legacy br Today the legacy of the Aztecs lives on in Mexico in many forms Archeological sites are excavated and opened to the public and their artifacts are prominently displayed in museums Place names and loanwords from the Aztec language Nahuatl permeate the Mexican landscape and vocabulary and Aztec symbols and mythology have been promoted by the Mexican government and integrated into contemporary Mexican nationalism as emblems of the country br During the th century the image of the Aztecs as uncivilized barbarians was replaced with romanticized visions of the Aztecs as original sons of the soil with a highly developed culture rivaling the ancient European civilizations When Mexico became independent from Spain a romanticized version of the Aztecs became a source of images that could be used to ground the new nation as a unique blend of European and American br br br The Aztecs and Mexico s national identity br br Aztec culture and history have been central to the formation of a Mexican national identity after Mexican independence in In th and th century Europe the Aztecs were generally described as barbaric gruesome and culturally inferior Even before Mexico achieved its independence American born Spaniards criollos drew on Aztec history to ground their search for symbols of local pride separate from that of Spain Intellectuals used Aztec writings such as those collected by Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl and writings of Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc and Chimalpahin to understand Mexico s indigenous past in texts by indigenous writers This search became the basis for what historian D A Brading calls creole patriotism Seventeenth century cleric and scientist Carlos de Sig enza y G ngora acquired the manuscript collection of Texcocan nobleman Alva Ixtlilxochitl Creole Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero published La Historia Antigua de M xico in his Italian exile following the expulsion of the Jesuits in in which he traces the history of the Aztecs from their migration to the last Aztec ruler Cuauhtemoc He wrote it expressly to defend Mexico s indigenous past against the slanders of contemporary writers such as Pauw Buffon Raynal and William Robertson Archeological excavations in in the capital s main square uncovered two massive stone sculptures buried immediately after the fall of Tenochtitlan in the conquest Unearthed were the famous calendar stone as well as a statue of Coatlicue Antonio de Le n y Gama s Descripci n hist rico y

his early publications from that period was Views of the Cordilleras and Monuments of the Indigenous Peoples of the Americas Humboldt was important in disseminating images of the Aztecs to scientists and general readers in the Western world br br In the realm of religion late colonial paintings of the Virgin of Guadalupe have examples of her depicted floating above the iconic nopal cactus of the Aztecs Juan Diego the Nahua to whom the apparition was said to appear links the dark Virgin to Mexico s Aztec past br When New Spain achieved independence in and became a monarchy the First Mexican Empire its flag had the traditional Aztec eagle on a nopal cactus The eagle had a crown symbolizing the new Mexican monarchy When Mexico became a republic after the overthrow of the first monarch Agust n de Iturbide in the flag was revised to show the eagle with no crown In the s when the French established the Second Mexican Empire under Maximilian of Habsburg the Mexican flag retained the emblematic eagle and cactus with elaborate symbols of monarchy After the defeat of the French and their Mexican collaborators the Mexican Republic was re established and the flag returned to its republican simplicity This emblem has also been adopted as Mexico s national coat of arms and is emblazoned on official buildings seals and signs br Tensions within post independence Mexico pitted those rejecting the ancient civilizations of Mexico as a source of national pride the Hispanistas mostly politically conservative Mexican elites and those who saw them as a source of pride the Indigenistas who were mostly liberal Mexican elites Although the flag of the Mexican Republic had the symbol of the Aztecs as its central element conservative elites were generally hostile to the current indigenous populations of Mexico or crediting them with a glorious pre Hispanic history Under Mexican President Antonio L pez de Santa Anna pro indigenist Mexican intellectuals did not find a wide audience With Santa Anna s overthrow in Mexican liberals and scholars interested in the indigenous past became more active Liberals were more favorably inclined toward the Indigenous populations and their history but considered a pressing matter being the Indian Problem Liberals commitment to equality before the law meant that for upwardly mobile Indigenous such as Zapotec Benito Ju rez who rose in the ranks of the liberals to become Mexico s first president of Indigenous origins and Nahua intellectual and politician Ignacio Altamirano a disciple of Ignacio Ram rez a defender of the rights of the indigenous liberalism presented a way forward in that era For investigations of Mexico s indigenous past however the role of moderate liberal Jos Fernando Ram rez is important serving as director of the National Museum and doing research utilizing codices while staying out of the fierce conflicts between liberals and conservatives that led to a decade of civil war Mexican scholars who pursued research on the Aztecs in the late th century were Francisco Pimentel Antonio Garc a Cubas Manuel Orozco y Berra Joaqu n Garc a Icazbalceta and Francisco del Paso y Troncoso contributing significantly to the th century development of Mexican scholarship on the Aztecs br br The late th century in Mexico was a period in which Aztec civilization became a point of national pride The era was dominated by liberal military hero Porfirio D az a mestizo from Oaxaca who was president of Mexico from to His policies opening Mexico to foreign investors and modernizing the country under a firm hand controlling unrest Order and Progress undermined Mexico s indigenous populations and their communities However for investigations of Mexico s ancient civilizations his was a benevolent regime with funds supporting archeological research and for protecting monuments Scholars found it more profitable to confine their attention to Indians who had been dead for a number of centuries His benevolence saw the placement of a monument to Cuauhtemoc in a major traffic roundabout glorieta of the wide Paseo de la Reforma which he inaugurated in In world fairs of the late th century Mexico s pavilions included a major focus on its indigenous past especially the Aztecs Mexican scholars such as Alfredo Chavero helped shape the cultural image of Mexico at these exhibitions br br The Mexican Revolution and the significant participation of Indigenous people in the struggle in many regions ignited a broad government sponsored political and cultural movement of indigenismo with symbols of Mexico s Aztec past becoming ubiquitous most especially in Mexican muralism of Diego Rivera br In their works Mexican authors such as Octavio Paz and Agustin Fuentes have analyzed the use of Aztec symbols by the modern Mexican state critiquing the way it adopts and adapts indigenous culture to political ends yet they have also in their works made use of the symbolic idiom themselves Paz for example critiqued the architectural layout of the National Museum of Anthropology which constructs a view of Mexican history as culminating with the Aztecs as an expression of a nationalist appropriation of Aztec culture br br br Aztec history and international scholarship br br Scholars in Europe and the United States increasingly wanted investigations into Mexico s ancient civilizations starting in the nineteenth century Humboldt had been extremely important in bringing ancient Mexico into broader scholarly discussions of ancient civilizations French Americanist Charles tienne Brasseur de Bourbourg asserted that science in our own time has at last effectively studied and rehabilitated America and the Americans from the previous viewpoint of history and archeology It was Humboldt who woke us from our sleep Frenchman Jean Fr d ric Waldeck published Voyage pittoresque et arch ologique dans la province d Yucatan pendant les ann es et in Although not directly connected with the Aztecs it contributed to the increased interest in ancient Mexican studies in Europe English aristocrat Lord Kingsborough spent considerable energy in their pursuit of understanding ancient Mexico Kingsborough answered Humboldt s call for the publication of all known Mexican codices publishing nine volumes of Antiquities of Mexico that were richly illustrated bankrupting him He was not directly interested in the Aztecs but rather in proving that Mexico had been colonized by Jews However his publication of these valuable primary sources gave others access to them br In the United States in the early th century interest in ancient Mexico propelled John Lloyd Stephens to travel to Mexico and then publish well illustrated accounts in the early s The research of a half blind Bostonian William Hickling Prescott into the Spanish conquest of Mexico resulted in his highly popular and deeply researched The Conquest of Mexico Although not formally trained as a historian Prescott drew on the obvious Spanish sources but also Ixtlilxochitl and Sahag n s history of the conquest His resulting work was a mixture of pro and anti Aztec attitudes It was not only a bestseller in English but it also influenced Mexican intellectuals including the leading conservative politician Lucas Alam n Alam n pushed back against his characterization of the Aztecs In the assessment of Benjamin Keen Prescott s history has survived attacks from every quarter and still dominates the conceptions of the laymen if not the specialist concerning Aztec civilization In the later th century businessman and historian Hubert Howe Bancroft oversaw a huge project employing writers and researchers to write the history the Native Races of North America including Mexico California and Central America One entire work was devoted to ancient Mexico half of which concerned the Aztecs It was a work of synthesis drawing on Ixtlilxochitl and Brasseur de Bourbourg among others br When the International Congress of Americanists was formed in Nancy France in Mexican scholars became active participants and Mexico City hosted the biennial multidisciplinary meeting six times starting in Mexico s ancient civilizations have continued to be the focus of major scholarly investigations by Mexican and international scholars br br br Language and placenames br br The Nahuatl language is today spoken by million people mostly in mountainous areas in the states of central Mexico Mexican Spanish today incorporates hundreds of loans from Nahuatl and many of these words have passed into general Spanish use and further into other world languages br In Mexico Aztec place names are ubiquitous particularly in central Mexico where the Aztec empire was centered but also in other regions where many towns cities and regions were established under their Nahuatl names as Aztec auxiliary troops accompanied the Spanish colonizers on the early expeditions that mapped New Spain In this way even towns that were not originally Nahuatl speaking came to be known by their Nahuatl names In Mexico City there are commemorations of Aztec rulers including on the Mexico City Metro line with stations named for Moctezuma II and Cuauhtemoc br br br Cuisine br br Mexican cuisine continues to be based on staple elements of Mesoamerican cooking and particularly of Aztec cuisine corn chili beans squash tomato and avocado Many of these staple products continue to be known by their Nahuatl names carrying in this way ties to the Aztec people who introduced these foods to the Spaniards and the world Through the spread of ancient Mesoamerican food elements particularly plants Nahuatl loan words chocolate tomato chili avocado tamale taco pupusa chipotle pozole atole have been borrowed through Spanish into other languages around the world Through the spread and popularity of Mexican cuisine the culinary legacy of the Aztecs can be said to have a global reach Today Aztec images and Nahuatl words are often used to lend an air of authenticity or exoticism in the marketing of Mexican cuisine br br br br br br br br br br br br Ethnic identity br Aztec and Maya were newly listed examples given for American Indian groups in the United States census and Aztec became the largest American Indian group that respondents identified as having a full background br br br In popular culture br The idea of the Aztecs has captivated the imaginations of Europeans since the first encounters and has provided many iconic symbols to Western popular culture In his book The Aztec Image in Western Thought Benjamin Keen argued that Western thinkers have usually viewed Aztec culture through a filter of their cultural interests br The Aztecs and figures from Aztec mythology feature in Western culture The name of Quetzalcoatl a feathered serpent god has been used for a genus of pterosaurs Quetzalcoatlus a large flying reptile with a wingspan of as much as meters ft Quetzalcoatl has appeared as a character in many books films and video games D H Lawrence gave the name Quetzalcoatl to an early draft of his novel The Plumed Serpent but his publisher Alfred A Knopf insisted on a
