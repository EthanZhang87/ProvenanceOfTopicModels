insufficiently Congolese Instead nearly all of the art on display was created by Europeans in a purposefully primitive and imitative style and the entrance of the exhibit featured a bust of King Leopold II under whose colonial rule millions of Congolese died The Congolese chosen to be exhibited by the Ministry were educated urbanites referred to by Belgians as volu s meaning literally evolved but were made to dress in primitive clothing and an armed guard blocked them from communicating with white Belgians who came to observe them The exotic nature of the exhibit was lauded by visitors and
