Finland officially the Republic of Finland is a Nordic country in Northern Europe It borders Sweden to the northwest Norway to the north and Russia to the east with the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to the south opposite Estonia Finland covers an area of square kilometres sq mi and has a population of million Helsinki is the capital and largest city The vast majority of the population are ethnic Finns The official languages are Finnish and Swedish of which percent of the population speak the first as their mother tongue and percent the latter Finland s climate varies from humid continental in the south to boreal in the north The land cover is predominantly boreal forest biome with more than recorded lakes br Finland was first settled around BC after the last Ice Age During the Stone Age various cultures emerged distinguished by different styles of ceramics The Bronze Age and Iron Ages were marked by contacts with other cultures in Fennoscandia and the Baltic region From the late th century Finland became part of the Swedish Empire as a result of the Northern Crusades In as a result of the Finnish War Finland was captured from Sweden and became a Grand Duchy of Finland an autonomous state ruled by the Russian Empire During this period Finnish art flourished and the idea of full independence began to take hold In Finland became the first European state to grant universal suffrage and the first in the world to give all adult citizens the right to run for public office Following the Russian Revolution of Finland declared its full independence In the young nation was divided by the Finnish Civil War During World War II Finland fought against the Soviet Union in the Winter War and the Continuation War and later against Nazi Germany in the Lapland War As a result it lost parts of its territory but retained its independence br Finland remained a largely agricultural country until the s After World War II it industrialised quickly and established an advanced economy with a welfare state built on the Nordic model This allowed the country to experience overall prosperity and high per capita income During the Cold War Finland officially embraced a policy of neutrality Since then it has become a member of the European Union in the Eurozone in and NATO in Finland is a member of various international organisations such as the United Nations the Nordic Council the Schengen Area the Council of Europe the World Trade Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD The nation performs exceedingly well in national performance metrics including education economic competitiveness civil liberties quality of life and human development br br br History br br br Prehistory br br The area that is now Finland was settled in at the latest around BC during the Stone Age towards the end of the last glacial period The artefacts the first settlers left behind present characteristics that are shared with those found in Estonia Russia and Norway The earliest people were hunter gatherers using stone tools br The first pottery appeared in BC when the Comb Ceramic culture was introduced The arrival of the Corded Ware culture in Southern coastal Finland between and BC may have coincided with the start of agriculture Even with the introduction of agriculture hunting and fishing continued to be important parts of the subsistence economy br br In the Bronze Age permanent all year round cultivation and animal husbandry spread but the cold climate slowed the change The Seima Turbino phenomenon brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and possibly also the Finno Ugric languages Commercial contacts that had so far mostly been to Estonia started to extend to Scandinavia Domestic manufacture of bronze artefacts started BC br In the Iron Age population grew Finland Proper was the most densely populated area Commercial contacts in the Baltic Sea region grew and extended during the eighth and ninth centuries Main exports from Finland were furs slaves castoreum and falcons to European courts Imports included silk and other fabrics jewelry Ulfberht swords and in lesser extent glass Production of iron started approximately in BC At the end of the ninth century indigenous artefact culture especially weapons and women s jewelry had more common local features than ever before This has been interpreted to be expressing common Finnish identity br An early form of Finnic languages spread to the Baltic Sea region approximately BC Common Finnic language was spoken around Gulf of Finland years ago The dialects from which the modern day Finnish language was developed came into existence during the Iron Age Although distantly related the Sami people retained the hunter gatherer lifestyle longer than the Finns The Sami cultural identity and the Sami language have survived in Lapland the northernmost province br The name Suomi Finnish for Finland has uncertain origins but a common etymology with saame the Sami has been suggested In the earliest historical sources from the th and th centuries the term Finland refers to the coastal region around Turku This region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland See also Etymology of Finns br br br Swedish era br br The th and th centuries were a violent time in the northern Baltic Sea The Livonian Crusade was ongoing and the Finnish tribes such as the Tavastians and Karelians were in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other Also during the th and th centuries several crusades from the Catholic realms of the Baltic Sea area were made against the Finnish tribes Danes waged at least three crusades to Finland in or slightly earlier in and in and Swedes possibly the so called second crusade to Finland in against Tavastians and the third crusade to Finland in against the Karelians The so called first crusade to Finland possibly in most likely never occurred br As a result of the crusades mostly with the second crusade led by Birger Jarl and the colonization of some Finnish coastal areas with Christian Swedish population during the Middle Ages Finland gradually became part of the kingdom of Sweden and the sphere of influence of the Catholic Church Under Sweden Finland was annexed as part of the cultural order of Western Europe br br Swedish was the dominant language of the nobility administration and education Finnish was chiefly a language for the peasantry clergy and local courts in predominantly Finnish speaking areas During the Protestant Reformation the Finns gradually converted to Lutheranism br In the th century a bishop and Lutheran Reformer Mikael Agricola published the first written works in Finnish and Finland s current capital city Helsinki was founded by King Gustav Vasa in The first university in Finland the Royal Academy of Turku was established by Queen Christina of Sweden at the proposal of Count Per Brahe in br The Finns reaped a reputation in the Thirty Years War as a well trained cavalrymen called Hakkapeliitta Finland suffered a severe famine in during which about one third of the Finnish population died and a devastating plague a few years later br In the th century wars between Sweden and Russia twice led to the occupation of Finland by Russian forces times known to the Finns as the Greater Wrath and the Lesser Wrath It is estimated that almost an entire generation of young men was lost during the Great Wrath due mainly to the destruction of homes and farms and the burning of Helsinki br br br Grand Duchy of Finland br br The Swedish era ended with the Finnish War of On March after being conquered by the armies of Alexander I of Russia Finland became an autonomous Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire as recognised by the Diet of Porvoo This situation continued until the end of In Alexander I incorporated the Russian province of Vyborg into the Grand Duchy of Finland In Finland became involved in Russia s involvement in the Crimean War when the British and French navies bombed the Finnish coast and land during the so called land War br br Although Swedish was still widely spoken the Finnish language began to gain recognition during this period From the s a strong Finnish nationalist movement known as the Fennoman movement grew One of the movement s most prominent leaders was the philosopher and politician J V Snellman who worked to stabilise the status of the Finnish language and its own currency the Finnish markka in the Grand Duchy of Finland Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland s national epic the Kalevala in and the legal equality of the Finnish language with Swedish in In the spirit of Adolf Ivar Arwidsson we are not Swedes we do not want to become Russians so let us be Finns a Finnish national identity was established Nevertheless there was no real independence movement in Finland until the early th century br The Finnish famine of occurred after freezing temperatures in early September devastated crops and killed around of the population making it one of the worst famines in European history The famine led the Russian Empire to relax financial regulations and investment increased in the following decades Economic development was rapid The gross domestic product GDP per capita was still half of that of the United States and a third of that of Britain br From to the Russian Empire pursued a policy known as the Russification of Finland This policy was suspended between and In universal suffrage was introduced in the Grand Duchy of Finland However relations between the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire soured when the Russian government began to take steps to restrict Finland s special status and autonomy For example universal suffrage was virtually meaningless in practice as the Tsar did not have to approve any of the laws passed by the Finnish parliament The desire for independence gained ground first among radical liberals and socialists partly driven by a declaration called the February Manifesto by the last Tsar of the Russian Empire Nicholas II on February br br br Civil war and early independence br br After the February Revolution of Finland s position as a Grand Duchy under the rule of the Russian Empire was questioned The Finnish parliament controlled by the Social Democrats passed the so called Power Act to give the parliament supreme authority This was rejected by the Russian Provisional Government which decided to dissolve the parliament New elections were held in which the right wing parties won by a small majority Some social democrats refused to accept the result claiming that the dissolution of parliament and the subsequent elections were extra legal The two almost equally powerful political blocs the right wing parties and the Social Democratic Party were deeply divided br br The October Revolution in Russia changed the geopolitical situation once again Suddenly the right wing parties in Finland began to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of supreme executive power from the Russian government to Finland when the Bolsheviks came to power in Russia The right wing government led by Prime Minister P E Svinhufvud presented the Declaration of Independence on December which was officially approved by the Finnish Parliament on December The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic RSFSR led by Vladimir Lenin was the first country to recognise Finland s full independence on January br On January the government began to disarm the Russian forces in Ostrobothnia The socialists took control of southern Finland and Helsinki but the white government continued in exile in Vaasa This led to a short but bitter civil war The Whites backed by Imperial Germany prevailed over the Reds and their self proclaimed Finnish Socialist Workers Republic After the war tens of thousands of Reds were interned in camps where thousands were executed or died of malnutrition and disease A deep social and political enmity was sown between the Reds and the Whites that would last until the Winter War and beyond The civil war and the activist expeditions to Soviet Russia in known as the Kinship Wars strained relations with the East br br After a brief experiment with monarchy when an attempt to make Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse King of Finland failed Finland became a presidential republic with K J St hlberg elected as its first president in A liberal nationalist with a legal background St hlberg anchored the state in liberal democracy promoted the rule of law and initiated internal reforms Finland was also one of the first European countries to strongly promote women s equality with Miina Sillanp becoming the first female minister in Finnish history in V in Tanner s cabinet in The Finnish Russian border was established in by the Treaty of Tartu which largely followed the historical border but gave Finland Pechenga Finnish Petsamo and its Barents Sea port Finnish democracy survived Soviet coup attempts and the anti communist Lapua movement br In there were three million people in the country After the civil war a credit based land reform was introduced increasing the proportion of the population with capital About of the workforce was employed in agriculture and in industry br br br World War II br br The Soviet Union launched the Winter War on November to annex Finland in accordance with the Molotov Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany to divide Europe into spheres of influence between the two dictatorships The Finnish Democratic Republic was set up by Joseph Stalin at the beginning of the war to govern Finland after Soviet conquest There was widespread international condemnation of the unprovoked attack and it led to the Soviet Union being expelled from the League of Nations The Red Army was defeated in numerous battles most notably the Battle of Suomussalmi After two months of negligible progress on the battlefield as well as heavy losses in men and material Soviet forces began to advance in February and reached Vyborg Finnish Viipuri in March The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on March and the war ended the following day Finland had defended its independence but ceded of its territory to the Soviet Union br br Hostilities resumed in June with the Continuation War when Finland allied itself with Germany following the latter s invasion of the Soviet Union the main aim was to regain the territory lost to the Soviets barely a year earlier Finnish troops occupied Eastern Karelia from to The massive Soviet Vyborg Petrozavodsk offensive in the summer of led to a breakthrough until the Finns finally repulsed it at Tali Ihantala This partial Soviet success led to a stalemate and later an armistice This was followed by the Lapland War of when Finland fought retreating German forces in northern Finland br The Armistice and treaty signed with the Soviet Union in and included Finnish obligations restraints and reparations as well as further territorial concessions As a result of the two wars Finland lost of its land area of its industrial capacity its second largest city Vyborg Finnish Viipuri and the ice free port of Liinakhamari Finnish Liinahamari The Finns lost soldiers and were forced to pay war reparations of million billion in However the country avoided occupation by Soviet forces and managed to retain its independence Along with Great Britain Finland emerged from the war as the only European country to have taken part in hostilities that was never occupied and managed to preserve its democracy throughout br For a few decades after the Communists were a strong political party Furthermore the Soviet Union persuaded Finland to refuse Marshall Plan aid However in the hope of preserving Finland s independence the United States provided secret development aid and supported the Social Democratic Party br br br After the war br br The development of trade with the Western powers such as the United Kingdom and the payment of reparations to the Soviet Union led to Finland s transformation from a primarily agrarian society to an industrialised one Valmet originally a shipyard and then several metal workshops was established to produce materials for war reparations After the reparations were paid Finland continued to trade with the Soviet Union as part of bilateral trade br In of Finnish workers were employed in agriculture and a third lived in urban areas but new jobs in manufacturing services and trade quickly attracted people to the cities The average number of births per woman fell from a baby boom peak of in to in As the baby boomers entered the workforce the economy failed to create jobs fast enough and hundreds of thousands emigrated to more industrialised Sweden with emigration peaking in and Finland participated in trade liberalisation in the World Bank the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade br br Officially neutral Finland was in the grey zone between the Western countries and the Soviet bloc during the Cold War The YYA treaty Finno Soviet Pact of Friendship Cooperation and Mutual Assistance gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics President Urho Kekkonen used it extensively against his opponents From he had a virtual monopoly on relations with the Soviet Union which was crucial to his continued popularity In politics there was a tendency to avoid any policy or statement that could be interpreted as anti Soviet This phenomenon was dubbed Finlandisation by the West German press br A market economy was maintained in Finland Various industries benefited from trade privileges with the Soviets Economic growth was rapid in the post war period and by Finland s GDP per capita was the th highest in the world During the s and s Finland built one of the most extensive welfare states in the world Finland negotiated a treaty with the European Economic Community EEC a forerunner of the European Union that largely eliminated tariffs with the EEC from In President Urho Kekkonen s failing health forced him to retire after years in office br Miscalculated macroeconomic decisions a banking crisis the collapse of its largest trading partner the Soviet Union and a global economic downturn caused a deep recession in Finland in the early s The recession bottomed out in and Finland enjoyed more than a decade of steady economic growth After the collapse of the Soviet Union Finland began to integrate more closely with the West Finland joined the European Union in and the euro zone in Much of the economic growth of the late s was fuelled by the success of mobile phone manufacturer Nokia br br br st century br br The Finnish people elected Tarja Halonen in the Presidential election making her the first female President of Finland Her predecessor President Martti Ahtisaari later won the Nobel Peace Prize in Financial crises paralysed Finland s exports in leading to weaker economic growth throughout the decade Sauli Niinist was elected President of Finland from until when Alexander Stubb took over br Finnish support for NATO rose sharply after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Before February opinion polls showed a narrow but decisive majority against NATO membership by April a supermajority was in favour of membership On May Finland signed a mutual security pact with the United Kingdom On May Finland s President and Prime Minister called for NATO membership without delay Subsequently on May the Finnish Parliament voted in favour of Finland s accession to NATO Finland became a member of NATO on April br br br Geography br br Lying approximately between latitudes and N and longitudes and E Finland is one of the world s northernmost countries Of world capitals only Reykjav k lies more to the north than Helsinki The distance from the southernmost point Hanko in Uusimaa to the northernmost Nuorgam in Lapland is kilometres mi br br Finland has about lakes of area larger than m or acres and islands Its largest lake Saimaa is the fourth largest in Europe The Finnish Lakeland is the area with the most lakes in the country many of the major cities in the area most notably Tampere Jyv skyl and Kuopio are located near the large lakes The Finnish coastline is speckled with the world s largest archipelago encompassing more than islands greatest concentration of which is found in the southwest in the Archipelago Sea between continental Finland and the main island of land br Much of the geography of Finland is a result of the Ice Age The glaciers were thicker and lasted longer in Fennoscandia compared with the rest of Europe The eroding effects have contributed to a mostly flat landscape in Finland characterized by hills However in the northern regions including areas bordering the Scandinavian Mountains the terrain features mountainous elevations At metres ft Halti is the highest point in Finland It is found in the north of Lapland at the border between Finland and Norway The highest mountain whose peak is entirely in Finland is Ridnit ohkka at m ft directly adjacent to Halti br br The retreating glaciers have left the land with morainic deposits in formations of eskers These are ridges of stratified gravel and sand running northwest to southeast where the ancient edge of the glacier once lay Among the biggest of these are the three Salpausselk ridges that run across southern Finland br Having been compressed under the enormous weight of the glaciers terrain in Finland is rising due to the post glacial rebound The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia where land steadily rises about cm in a year As a result the old sea bottom turns little by little into dry land the surface area of the country is expanding by about square kilometres sq mi annually Relatively speaking Finland is rising from the sea br The landscape is covered mostly by coniferous taiga forests and fens with little cultivated land Of the total area is lakes rivers and ponds and is forest The forest consists of pine spruce birch and other species Finland is the largest producer of wood in Europe and among the largest in the world The most common type of rock is granite It is a ubiquitous part of the scenery visible wherever there is no soil cover Moraine or till is the most common type of soil covered by a thin layer of humus of biological origin Podzol profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor Gleysols and peat bogs occupy poorly drained areas br br br Biodiversity br br Phytogeographically Finland is shared between the Arctic central European and northern European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom According to the WWF the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three ecoregions the Scandinavian and Russian taiga Sarmatic mixed forests and Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland On the southwestern coast south of the Helsinki Rauma line forests are characterized by mixed forests that are more typical in the Baltic region In the extreme north of Finland near the tree line and Arctic Ocean Montane Birch forests are common Finland had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it th globally out of countries br Similarly Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna There are at least sixty native mammalian species breeding bird species over fish species and reptile and frog species present today many migrating from neighbouring countries thousands of years ago br Large and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the brown bear grey wolf wolverine and elk Three of the more striking birds are the whooper swan a large European swan and the national bird of Finland the Western capercaillie a large black plumaged member of the grouse family and the Eurasian eagle owl The latter is considered an indicator of old growth forest connectivity and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation Around species of insects are prevalent in Finland some of the most common being hornets with tribes of beetles such as the Onciderini also being common The most common breeding birds are the willow warbler common chaffinch and redwing Of some seventy species of freshwater fish the northern pike perch and others are plentiful Atlantic salmon remains the favourite of fly rod enthusiasts br The endangered Saimaa ringed seal one of only three lake seal species in the world exists only in the Saimaa lake system of southeastern Finland down to only seals today The species has become the emblem of the Finnish Association for Nature Conservation br A third of Finland s land area originally consisted of moorland about half of this area has been drained for cultivation over the past centuries br br br Climate br br The main factor influencing Finland s climate is the country s geographical position between the th and th northern parallels in the Eurasian continent s coastal zone In the K ppen climate classification the whole of Finland lies in the boreal zone characterized by warm summers and freezing winters Within the country the temperateness varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north showing characteristics of both a maritime and a continental climate Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the Gulf Stream The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the Baltic Sea and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same latitude such as Alaska Siberia and southern Greenland br br Winters in southern Finland when mean daily temperature remains below C or F are usually about days long and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April and on the coastal areas such as Helsinki snow often covers the land from late December to late March Even in the south the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to C F although on coastal areas like Helsinki temperatures below C F are rare Climatic summers when mean daily temperature remains above C or F in southern Finland last from about late May to mid September and in the inland the warmest days of July can reach over C F Although most of Finland lies on the taiga belt the southernmost coastal regions are sometimes classified as hemiboreal br In northern Finland particularly in Lapland the winters are long and cold while the summers are relatively warm but short On the most severe winter days in Lapland can see the temperature fall to C F The winter of the north lasts for about days with permanent snow cover from about mid October to early May Summers in the north are quite short only two to three months but can still see maximum daily temperatures above C F during heat waves No part of Finland has Arctic tundra but Alpine tundra can be found at the fells Lapland br The Finnish climate is suitable for cereal farming only in the southernmost regions while the northern regions are suitable for animal husbandry br A quarter of Finland s territory lies within the Arctic Circle and the midnight sun can be experienced for more days the farther north one travels At Finland s northernmost point the sun does not set for consecutive days during summer and does not rise at all for days during winter br br br Regions br br Finland consists of regions maakunta The counties are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the municipalities of a county The main tasks of the counties are regional planning and development of enterprise and education In addition the public health services are usually organized based on counties Regional councils

financed by municipal income tax state subsidies and other revenue As of there are municipalities and most have fewer than residents br In addition to municipalities two intermediate levels are defined Municipalities co operate in seventy sub regions and nineteen counties These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers The autonomous province of land has a permanent democratically elected regional council Sami people have a semi autonomous Sami native region in Lapland for issues on language and culture br Health social and emergency services are organised by the Wellbeing services counties Finland has Wellbeing services counties and the county structure is mainly based on the region structure The County council which is responsible for the operation administration and finances of the area is the highest decision making body in the Wellbeing services county The delegates and deputy commissioners of the county council are elected in the county elections for a term of office of four years Wellbeing services counties are self governing However they do not have the right to levy taxes and their funding is based on central government

most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on It is headed by the Prime Minister of Finland and consists of him or her other ministers and the Chancellor of Justice Each minister heads his or her ministry or in some cases has responsibility for a subset of a ministry s policy After the prime minister the most powerful minister is often the minister of finance br As no one

are important The Helsinki metropolitan area area accounts for roughly one third of Finland s GDP Private services represent the largest employer in Finland br Finland s soil and climate pose particular challenges for crop production with harsh winters and relatively short growing seasons often interrupted by frost However the prevalence of the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current in Finland s temperate climate allows for half of the world s arable land north of the north latitude Although annual precipitation is generally adequate it mostly transpires during winter which poses a continuous risk of summer droughts Farmers have adapted to the climate by relying on quick ripening and frost resistant crop varieties They cultivate south facing slopes and rich bottomlands to ensure year round production even during summer frosts Drainage systems are often utilized to remove excess water Finland s agricultural sector has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and productivity particularly in comparison to its European counterparts br Forests are crucial to the nation s economy making it one of the world s foremost wood producers and offering raw materials
