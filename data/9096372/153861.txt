title: Moat
id: 153861
A moat is a deep broad ditch dug around a castle fortification building or town historically to provide it with a preliminary line of defence Moats can be dry or filled with water In some places moats evolved into more extensive water defences including natural or artificial lakes dams and sluices In older fortifications such as hillforts they are usually referred to simply as ditches although the function is similar In later periods moats or water defences may be largely ornamental They could also act as a sewer br br br Historical use br br br Ancient br br Some of the earliest evidence of moats has been uncovered around ancient Egyptian castles One example is at Buhen a castle excavated in Nubia Other evidence of ancient moats is found in the ruins of Babylon and in reliefs from ancient Egypt Assyria and other cultures in the region br Evidence of early moats around settlements has been discovered in many archaeological sites throughout Southeast Asia including Noen U Loke Ban Non Khrua Chut Ban Makham Thae and Ban Non Wat The use of the moats could have been either for defensive or agriculture purposes br br br Medieval br br Moats were excavated around castles and other fortifications as part of the defensive system as an obstacle immediately outside the walls In suitable locations they might be filled with water A moat made access to the walls difficult for siege weapons such as siege towers and battering rams which needed to be brought up against a wall to be effective A water filled moat made the practice of mining digging tunnels under the castles in order to effect a collapse of the defences very difficult as well Segmented moats have one dry section and one section filled with water Dry moats that cut across the narrow part of a spur or peninsula are called neck ditches Moats separating different elements of a castle such as the inner and outer wards are cross ditches br The word was adapted in Middle English from the Old French motte lit mound hillock and was first applied to the central mound on which a castle was erected see Motte and bailey and then came to be applied to the excavated ring a dry moat The shared derivation implies that the two features were closely related and possibly constructed at the same time The term moat is also applied to natural formations reminiscent of the artificial structure and to similar modern architectural features br br br Later western fortification br br With the introduction of siege artillery a new style of fortification emerged in the th century using low walls and projecting strong points called bastions which was known as the trace italienne The walls were further protected from infantry attack by wet or dry moats sometimes in elaborate systems When this style of fortification was superseded by lines of polygonal forts in the mid th century moats continued to be used for close protection br br br Africa br The Walls of Benin were a combination of ramparts and moats called Iya used as a defence of the capital Benin City in present day Edo State of Nigeria It was considered the largest man made structure lengthwise second only to the Great Wall of China and the largest earthwork in the world Recent work by Patrick Darling has established it as the largest man made structure in the world larger than Sungbo s Eredo also in Nigeria It enclosed km of community lands Its length was over km of earth boundaries It was estimated that earliest construction began in and continued into the mid th century br The walls are built of a ditch and dike structure the ditch dug to form an inner moat with the excavated earth used to form the exterior rampart br The Benin Walls were ravaged by the British in Scattered pieces of the walls remain in Edo with material being used by the locals for building purposes The walls continue to be torn down for real estate developments br The Walls of Benin City were the world s largest man made structure Fred Pearce wrote in New Scientist br They extend for some kilometres in all in a mosaic of more than interconnected settlement boundaries They cover square kilometres and were all dug by the Edo people In all they are four times longer than the Great Wall of China and consumed a hundred times more material than the Great Pyramid of Cheops They took an estimated million hours of digging to construct and are perhaps the largest single archaeological phenomenon on the planet br br br Asia br Japanese castles often have very elaborate moats with up to three moats laid out in concentric circles around the castle and a host of different patterns engineered around the landscape The outer moat of a Japanese castle typically protects other support buildings in addition to the castle br As many Japanese castles have historically been a very central part of their cities the moats have provided a vital waterway to the city Even in modern times the moat system of the Tokyo Imperial Palace consists of a very active body of water hosting everything from rental boats and fishing ponds to restaurants br Most modern Japanese castles have moats filled with water but castles in the feudal period more commonly had dry moats karabori lit empty moat a trench A tatebori lit vertical moat is a dry moat dug into a slope A unejo tatebori lit furrowed shape empty moat is a series of parallel trenches running up the sides of the excavated mountain and the earthen wall which was also called doi lit earth mount was an outer wall made of earth dug out from a moat Even today it is common for mountain Japanese castles to have dry moats A mizubori lit water moat is a moat filled with water br Moats were also used in the Forbidden City and Xi an in China in Vellore Fort in India Hsinchu in Taiwan and in Southeast Asia such as at Angkor Wat in Cambodia Mandalay in Myanmar and Chiang Mai in Thailand br br br Australia br The only moated fort ever built in Australia was Fort Lytton in Brisbane As Brisbane was much more vulnerable to attack than either Sydney or Melbourne a series of coastal defences was built throughout Moreton Bay Fort Lytton being the largest br Built between and in response to fear of a Russian invasion it is a pentagonal fortress concealed behind grassy embankments and surrounded by a water filled moat br br br North America br Moats were developed independently by North American indigenous people of the Mississippian culture as the outer defence of some fortified villages The remains of a th century moat are still visible at the Parkin Archeological State Park in eastern Arkansas br The Maya people also used moats for example in the city of Becan br European colonists in the Americas often built dry ditches surrounding forts built to protect important landmarks harbours or cities e g Fort Jay on Governors Island in New York Harbor br br br Photo gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

br Architectural usage br br Dry moats were a key element used in French Classicism and Beaux Arts architecture dwellings both as decorative designs and to provide discreet access for service Excellent examples of these can be found in Newport Rhode Island at Miramar mansion and The Elms as well as at Carolands outside of San Francisco California and at Union Station in Toronto Ontario Canada Additionally a dry moat can allow light and fresh air to reach basement workspaces as for example at the James Farley Post Office in New York City br br br Anti terrorist moats br Whilst moats are no longer a significant tool of warfare modern architectural building design continues to use them as a defence against certain modern threats such as terrorist attacks from car bombs and improvised fighting vehicles For example the new location of the Embassy of the United States in London opened in includes a moat among its security features the first moat built in England for more than a century Modern moats may also be used for aesthetic or ergonomic purposes br The Catawba Nuclear Station has a concrete moat around some of the plant Other sides of the plant are bordering a lake The moat is a part of precautions added to such sites after the September attacks br br br Safety moats br Moats rather than fences separate animals from spectators in many modern zoo installations Moats were first used in this way by Carl Hagenbeck at his Tierpark in Hamburg Germany The structure with a vertical outer retaining wall rising direct from the moat is an extended usage of the ha ha of English landscape gardening br br br Border defence moats br In plans were suggested for a two mile moat across the southern border of the Gaza Strip to prevent tunnelling from Egyptian territory to the border town of Rafah br In city officials in Yuma Arizona planned to dig out a two mile stretch of a hectare acre wetland known as Hunters Hole to control immigrants coming from Mexico br br br Pest control moats br Researchers of jumping spiders which have excellent vision and adaptable tactics built water filled miniature moats too wide for the spiders to jump across Some specimens were rewarded for jumping then swimming and others for swimming only Portia fimbriata from Queensland generally succeeded for whichever method they were rewarded When specimens from two different populations of Portia labiata were set the same task members of one population determined which method earned them a reward whilst members of the other continued to use whichever method they tried first and did not try to adapt br As a basic method of pest control in bonsai a moat may be used to restrict access of crawling insects to the bonsai br br br See also br Drawbridge br Gracht br
