Polish endonym j zyk polski j z k p lsk i polszczyzna p l t zna or simply polski p lsk i is a West Slavic language of the Lechitic group within the Indo European language family written in the Latin script It is primarily spoken in Poland and serves as the official language of the country as well as the language of the Polish diaspora around the world In there were over million Polish native speakers It ranks as the sixth most spoken among languages of the European Union Polish is subdivided into regional dialects and maintains strict T V distinction pronouns honorifics and various forms of formalities when addressing individuals br The traditional letter Polish alphabet has nine additions to the letters of the basic letter Latin alphabet while removing three x q v Those three letters are at times included in an extended letter alphabet The traditional set comprises consonants and written vowels including two nasal vowels defined by a reversed diacritic hook called an ogonek Polish is a synthetic and fusional language which has seven grammatical cases It is one of very few languages in the world possessing continuous penultimate stress with only a few exceptions and the only in its group having an abundance of palatal consonants Contemporary Polish developed in the s as the successor to the medieval Old Polish th th centuries and Middle Polish th th centuries br Among the major languages it is most closely related to Slovak and Czech but differs in terms of pronunciation and general grammar In addition Polish was profoundly influenced by Latin and other Romance languages like Italian and French as well as Germanic languages most notably German which contributed to a large number of loanwords and similar grammatical structures Extensive usage of nonstandard dialects has also shaped the standard language considerable colloquialisms and expressions were directly borrowed from German or Yiddish and subsequently adopted into the vernacular of Polish which is in everyday use br Historically Polish was a lingua franca important both diplomatically and academically in Central and part of Eastern Europe In addition to being the official language of Poland Polish is also spoken as a second language in eastern Germany northern Czech Republic and Slovakia western parts of Belarus and Ukraine as well as in southeast Lithuania and Latvia Because of the emigration from Poland during different time periods most notably after World War II millions of Polish speakers can also be found in countries such as Canada Argentina Brazil Israel Australia the United Kingdom and the United States br br br History br br Polish began to emerge as a distinct language around the th century the process largely triggered by the establishment and development of the Polish state Mieszko I ruler of the Polans tribe from the Greater Poland region united a few culturally and linguistically related tribes from the basins of the Vistula and Oder before eventually accepting baptism in With Christianity Poland also adopted the Latin alphabet which made it possible to write down Polish which until then had existed only as a spoken language The closest relatives of Polish are the Elbe and Baltic Sea Lechitic dialects Polabian and Pomeranian varieties All of them except Kashubian are extinct The precursor to modern Polish is the Old Polish language Ultimately Polish descends from the unattested Proto Slavic language br br The Book of Henryk w Polish Ksi ga henrykowska Latin Liber fundationis claustri Sanctae Mariae Virginis in Heinrichau contains the earliest known sentence written in the Polish language Day ut ia pobrusa a ti poziwai in modern orthography Daj u ja pobrusza a ti pocziwaj the corresponding sentence in modern Polish Daj niech ja pomiel a ty odpoczywaj or Pozw l e ja b d me a ty odpocznij and in English Come let me grind and you take a rest written around The book is exhibited in the Archdiocesal Museum in Wroc aw and as of has been added to UNESCO s Memory of the World list br The medieval recorder of this phrase the Cistercian monk Peter of the Henryk w monastery noted that Hoc est in polonico This is in Polish br The earliest treatise on Polish orthography was written by Jakub Parkosz around The first printed book in Polish appeared in either or while the oldest Polish newspaper was established in Starting in the s large numbers of books in the Polish language were published contributing to increased homogeneity of grammar and orthography The writing system achieved its overall form in the th century which is also regarded as the Golden Age of Polish literature The orthography was modified in the th century and in br Tomasz Kamusella notes that Polish is the oldest non ecclesiastical written Slavic language with a continuous tradition of literacy and official use which has lasted unbroken from the th century to this day Polish evolved into the main sociolect of the nobles in Poland Lithuania in the th century The history of Polish as a language of state governance begins in the th century in the Kingdom of Poland Over the later centuries Polish served as the official language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Congress Poland the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and as the administrative language in the Russian Empire s Western Krai The growth of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth s influence gave Polish the status of lingua franca in Central and Eastern Europe br br br Geographic distribution br br Poland is one of the most linguistically homogeneous European countries nearly of Poland s citizens declare Polish as their first language Elsewhere Poles constitute large minorities in areas which were once administered or occupied by Poland notably in neighboring Lithuania Belarus and Ukraine Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania s Vilnius County by of the population according to the census results as Vilnius was part of Poland from until Polish is found elsewhere in southeastern Lithuania In Ukraine it is most common in the western parts of Lviv and Volyn Oblasts while in West Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority especially in the Brest and Grodno regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border There are significant numbers of Polish speakers among Polish emigrants and their descendants in many other countries br In the United States Polish Americans number more than million but most of them cannot speak Polish fluently According to the United States Census Americans of age five years and over reported Polish as the language spoken at home which is about of people who speak languages other than English of the US population and of the Polish American population The largest concentrations of Polish speakers reported in the census over were found in three states Illinois New York and New Jersey Enough people in these areas speak Polish that PNC Financial Services which has a large number of branches in all of these areas offers services available in Polish at all of their cash machines in addition to English and Spanish br According to the census there are now over people in England and Wales who consider Polish to be their main language In Canada there is a significant Polish Canadian population There are speakers of Polish according to the census with a particular concentration in Toronto speakers and Montreal br The geographical distribution of the Polish language was greatly affected by the territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II and Polish population transfers Poles settled in the Recovered Territories in the west and north which had previously been mostly German speaking Some Poles remained in the previously Polish ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the USSR resulting in the present day Polish speaking communities in Lithuania Belarus and Ukraine although many Poles were expelled from those areas to areas within Poland s new borders To the east of Poland the most significant Polish minority lives in a long strip along either side of the Lithuania Belarus border Meanwhile the flight and expulsion of Germans as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and Operation Vistula the migration of Ukrainian minorities in the Recovered Territories in the west of the country contributed to the country s linguistic homogeneity br br br Dialects br br The inhabitants of different regions of Poland still speak Polish somewhat differently although the differences between modern day vernacular varieties and standard Polish j zyk og lnopolski appear relatively slight Most of the middle aged and young speak vernaculars close to standard Polish while the traditional dialects are preserved among older people in rural areas First language speakers of Polish have no trouble understanding each other and non native speakers may have difficulty recognizing the regional and social differences The modern standard dialect often termed as correct Polish is spoken or at least understood throughout the entire country br Polish has traditionally been described as consisting of three to five main regional dialects br br Greater Polish spoken in the west br Lesser Polish spoken in the south and southeast br Masovian spoken throughout the central and eastern parts of the country br Silesian and Kashubian spoken in Upper Silesia and Pomerania respectively are thought of as either Polish dialects or distinct languages depending on the criteria used br Kashubian contains a number of features not found elsewhere in Poland e g nine distinct oral vowels vs the six of standard Polish and in the northern dialects phonemic word stress an archaic feature preserved from Common Slavic times and not found anywhere else among the West Slavic languages However it was described by some linguists as lacking most of the linguistic and social determinants of language hood br Many linguistic sources categorize Silesian as a regional language separate from Polish while some consider Silesian to be a dialect of Polish Many Silesians consider themselves a separate ethnicity and have been advocating for the recognition of Silesian as a regional language in Poland The law recognizing it as such was passed by the Sejm and Senate in April but has been vetoed by the president in late May of br According to the last official census in Poland in over half a million people declared Silesian as their native language Many sociolinguists e g Tomasz Kamusella Agnieszka Pianka Alfred F Majewicz Tomasz Wicherkiewicz assume that extralinguistic criteria decide whether a lect is an independent language or a dialect speakers of the speech variety or and political decisions and this is dynamic i e it changes over time Also research organizations such as SIL International and resources for the academic field of linguistics such as Ethnologue Linguist List and others for example the Ministry of Administration and Digitization recognized the Silesian language In July the Silesian language was recognized by ISO and was attributed an ISO code of szl br Some additional characteristic but less widespread regional dialects include br br The distinctive dialect of the Gorals G ralski occurs in the mountainous area bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia The Gorals Highlanders take great pride in their culture and the dialect It exhibits some cultural influences from the Vlach shepherds in the th th centuries br The Pozna ski dialect spoken in Pozna and to some extent in the whole region of the former Prussian Partition excluding Upper Silesia with noticeable German influences br In the northern and western formerly German regions where Poles from the territories annexed by the Soviet Union resettled after World War II the older generation speaks a dialect of Polish characteristic of the Kresy that includes a longer pronunciation of vowels br Poles living in Lithuania particularly in the Vilnius region in Belarus particularly the northwest and in the northeast of Poland continue to speak the Eastern Borderlands dialect which sounds slushed in Polish described as zaci ganie z ruska speaking with a Ruthenian drawl and is easily distinguishable br Some city dwellers especially the less affluent population had their own distinctive dialects for example the Warsaw dialect still spoken by some of the population of Praga on the eastern bank of the Vistula However these city dialects are now mostly extinct due to assimilation with standard Polish br Many Poles living in emigrant communities for example in the United States whose families left Poland just after World War II retain a number of minor features of Polish vocabulary as spoken in the first half of the th century that now sound archaic to contemporary visitors from Poland br Polish linguistics has been characterized by a strong strive towards promoting prescriptive ideas of language intervention and usage uniformity along with normatively oriented notions of language correctness unusual by Western standards br br br Phonology br br br Vowels br Polish has six oral vowels seven oral vowels in written form which are all monophthongs and two nasal vowels The oral vowels are i spelled i spelled y and also transcribed as or spelled e a spelled a spelled o and u spelled u and as separate letters The nasal vowels are w spelled and w spelled Unlike Czech or Slovak Polish does not retain phonemic vowel length the letter which formerly represented lengthened in older forms of the language is now vestigial and instead corresponds to u br br br Consonants br The Polish consonant system shows more complexity its characteristic features include the series of affricate and palatal consonants that resulted from four Proto Slavic palatalizations and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish The full set of consonants together with their most common spellings can be presented as follows although other phonological analyses exist br br Neutralization occurs between voiced voiceless consonant pairs in certain environments at the end of words where devoicing occurs and in certain consonant clusters where assimilation occurs For details see Voicing and devoicing in the article on Polish phonology br Most Polish words are paroxytones that is the stress falls on the second to last syllable of a polysyllabic word although there are exceptions br br br Consonant distribution br Polish permits complex consonant clusters which historically often arose from the disappearance of yers Polish can have word initial and word medial clusters of up to four consonants whereas word final clusters can have up to five consonants Examples of such clusters can be found in words such as bezwzgl dny b z vz l ndn absolute or heartless ruthless d b o d bw blade of grass fst w s shock and krn brno krn mbrn t disobedience A popular Polish tongue twister from a verse by Jan Brzechwa is f t b x w t b mi f t t i In Szczebrzeszyn a beetle buzzes in the reed br Unlike languages such as Czech Polish does not have syllabic consonants the nucleus of a syllable is always a vowel br The consonant j is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel It also cannot precede the letter y br br br Prosody br The predominant stress pattern in Polish is penultimate stress in a word of more than one syllable the next to last syllable is stressed Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress e g in a four syllable word where the primary stress is on the third syllable there will be secondary stress on the first br Each vowel represents one syllable although the letter i normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel it represents j palatalization of the preceding consonant or both depending on analysis Also the letters u and i sometimes represent only semivowels when they follow another vowel as in autor awt r author mostly in loanwords so not in native nauka na u ka science the act of learning for example nor in nativized Mateusz ma te u Matthew br br Some loanwords particularly from the classical languages have the stress on the antepenultimate third from last syllable For example fizyka fiz ka physics is stressed on the first syllable This may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement for example muzyka muz ka music vs muzyka mu z ka genitive singular of muzyk musician When additional syllables are added to such words through inflection or suffixation the stress normally becomes regular For example uniwersytet u i v rs t t university has irregular stress on the third or antepenultimate syllable but the genitive uniwersytetu u iv rs t tu and derived adjective uniwersytecki u iv rs t t sk i have regular stress on the penultimate syllables Loanwords generally become nativized to have penultimate stress In psycholinguistic experiments speakers of Polish have been demonstrated to be sensitive to the distinction between regular penultimate and exceptional antepenultimate stress br Another class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings by bym by my etc These endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress for example zrobi bym I would do is stressed on the first syllable and zrobiliby my we would do on the second According to prescriptive authorities the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings my cie although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech so zrobili my we did should be prescriptively stressed on the second syllable although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as zrobili my These irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable clitics rather than true verbal inflections for example instead of kogo zobaczyli cie whom did you see it is possible to say kogo cie zobaczyli here kogo retains its usual stress first syllable in spite of the attachment of the clitic Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns These stress patterns are considered part of a usable norm of standard Polish in contrast to the model high norm br Some common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word This applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun such as do niej to her na nas on us przeze mnie because of me all stressed on the bolded syllable br br br Orthography br br The Polish alphabet derives from the Latin script but includes certain additional letters formed using diacritics The Polish alphabet was one of three major forms of Latin based orthography developed for Western and some South Slavic languages the others being Czech orthography and Croatian orthography the last of these being a th century invention trying to make a compromise between the first two Kashubian uses a Polish based system Slovak uses a Czech based system and Slovene follows the Croatian one the Sorbian languages blend the Polish and the Czech ones br Historically Poland s once diverse and multi ethnic population utilized many forms of scripture to write Polish For instance Lipka Tatars and Muslims inhabiting the eastern parts of the former Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth wrote Polish in the Arabic alphabet The Cyrillic script is used to a certain extent today by Polish speakers in Western Belarus especially for religious texts br The diacritics used in the Polish alphabet are the kreska graphically similar to the acute accent over the letters and through the letter in the kropka superior dot over the letter and the ogonek little tail under the letters The letters q v x are used only in foreign words and names br Polish orthography is largely phonemic there is a consistent correspondence between letters or digraphs and trigraphs and phonemes for exceptions see below The letters of the alphabet and their normal phonemic values are listed in the following table br br The following digraphs and trigraphs are used br br Voiced consonant letters frequently come to represent voiceless sounds as shown in the tables this occurs at the end of words and in certain clusters due to the neutralization mentioned in the Phonology section above Occasionally also voiceless consonant letters can represent voiced sounds in clusters br The spelling rule for the palatal sounds t d and is as follows before the vowel i the plain letters s z c dz n are used before other vowels the combinations si zi ci dzi ni are used when not followed by a vowel the diacritic forms d are used For example the s in siwy grey haired the si in siarka sulfur and the in wi ty holy all represent the sound The exceptions to the above rule are certain loanwords from Latin Italian French Russian or English where s before i is pronounced as s e g sinus sinologia do re mi fa sol la si do Saint Simon i saint simoni ci Sierio a Siergiej Singapur singiel In other loanwords the vowel i is changed to y e g Syria Sybir synchronizacja Syrakuzy br The following table shows the correspondence between the sounds and spelling br Digraphs and trigraphs are used br br Similar principles apply to k x and l except that these can only occur before vowels so the spellings are k g c h l before i and ki gi c hi li otherwise Most Polish speakers however do not consider palatalization of k g c h or l as creating new sounds br Except in the cases mentioned above the letter i if followed by another vowel in the same word usually represents j yet a palatalization of the previous consonant is always assumed br The reverse case where the consonant remains unpalatalized but is followed by a palatalized consonant is written by using j instead of i for example zje to eat up br The letters and when followed by plosives and affricates represent an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant rather than a nasal vowel For example in d b oak is pronounced m and in t cza rainbow is pronounced n the nasal assimilates to the following consonant When followed by l or for example przyj li przyj y is pronounced as just e When is at the end of the word it is often pronounced as just br Depending on the word the phoneme x can be spelt h or ch the phoneme can be spelt or rz and u can be spelt u or In several cases it determines the meaning for example mo e maybe and morze sea br In occasional words letters that normally form a digraph are pronounced separately For example rz represents rz not in words like zamarza freeze and in the name Tarzan br Doubled letters are usually pronounced as a single lengthened consonant however some speakers might pronounce the combination as two separate sounds br There are certain clusters where a written consonant would not be pronounced For example the in the word jab ko apple might be omitted in ordinary speech leading to the pronunciation japko br br br Grammar br br Polish is a highly fusional language with relatively free word order although the dominant arrangement is subject verb object SVO There are no articles and subject pronouns are often dropped br Nouns belong to one of three genders masculine feminine and neuter The masculine gender is also divided into subgenders animate vs inanimate in the singular human vs nonhuman in the plural There are seven cases nominative genitive dative accusative instrumental locative and vocative br Adjectives agree with nouns in terms of gender case and number Attributive adjectives most commonly precede the noun although in certain cases especially in fixed phrases like j zyk polski Polish language the noun may come first the rule of thumb is that generic descriptive adjectives normally precede e g pi kny kwiat beautiful flower while categorizing adjectives often follow the noun e g w giel kamienny black coal Most short adjectives and their derived adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by inflection the superlative is formed by prefixing naj to the comparative br Verbs are of imperfective or perfective aspect often occurring in pairs Imperfective verbs have a present tense past tense compound future tense except for by to be which has a simple future b d etc this in turn being used to form the compound future of other verbs subjunctive conditional formed with the detachable particle by imperatives an infinitive present participle present gerund and past participle Perfective verbs have a simple future tense formed like the present tense of imperfective verbs past tense subjunctive conditional imperatives infinitive present gerund and past participle Conjugated verb forms agree with their subject in terms of person number and in the case of past tense and subjunctive conditional forms gender br Passive type constructions can be made using the auxiliary by or zosta become with the passive participle There is also an impersonal construction where the active verb is used in third person singular with no subject but with the reflexive pronoun si present to indicate a general unspecified subject as in pije si w dk vodka is being drunk note that w dka appears in the accusative A similar sentence type in the past tense uses the passive participle with the ending o as in widziano ludzi people were seen As in other Slavic languages there are also subjectless sentences formed using such words as mo na it is possible together with an infinitive br Yes no questions both direct and indirect are formed by placing the word czy whether at the start although it s often omitted in casual speech Negation uses the word nie before the verb or other item being negated nie is still added before the verb even if the sentence also contains other negatives such as nigdy never or nic nothing effectively creating a double negative br Cardinal numbers have a complex system of inflection and agreement Zero and cardinal numbers higher than five except for those ending with the digit or but not ending with or govern the genitive case rather than the nominative or accusative Special forms of numbers collective numerals are used with certain classes of noun which include dziecko child and exclusively plural nouns such as drzwi door br br br Borrowed words br br Polish has over the centuries borrowed a number of words from other languages When borrowing pronunciation was adapted to Polish phonemes and spelling was altered to match Polish orthography In addition word endings are liberally applied to almost any word to produce verbs nouns adjectives as well as adding the appropriate endings for cases of nouns adjectives diminutives double diminutives augmentatives etc br Depending on the historical period borrowing has proceeded from various languages Notable influences have been Latin th th centuries Czech th and th th centuries Italian th th centuries French th th centuries German th and th th centuries Hungarian th th centuries and Turkish th century Currently English words are the most common imports to Polish br The Latin language for a very long time the only official language of the Polish state has had a great influence on Polish Many Polish words were direct borrowings or calques e g rzeczpospolita from res publica from Latin Latin was known to a larger or smaller degree by most of the numerous szlachta in the th to th centuries and it continued to be extensively taught at secondary schools until World War II Apart from dozens of loanwords its influence can also be seen in a number of verbatim Latin phrases in Polish literature especially from the th century and earlier br During the th and th centuries Mongolian words were brought to the Polish language during wars with the armies of Genghis Khan and his descendants e g dzida spear and szereg a line or row br Words from Czech an important influence during the th and th th centuries include sejm ha ba and brama br In the Polish king Sigismund I the Old married Bona Sforza the niece of the Holy Roman emperor Maximilian who introduced Italian cuisine to Poland especially vegetables Hence words from Italian include pomidor from pomodoro tomato kalafior from cavolfiore cauliflower and pomara cza a portmanteau from Italian pomo pome plus arancio orange A later word of Italian origin is autostrada from Italian autostrada highway br In the th century with the rising prominence of France in Europe French supplanted Latin as an important source of words Some French borrowings also date from the Napoleonic era when the Poles were enthusiastic supporters of Napoleon Examples include ekran from French cran screen aba ur abat jour lamp shade rekin requin shark meble meuble furniture baga bagage luggage walizka valise suitcase fotel fauteuil armchair pla a plage beach and koszmar cauchemar nightmare Some place names have also been adapted from French such as the Warsaw borough of oliborz joli bord beautiful riverside as well as the town of yrard w from the name Girard with the Polish suffix w attached to refer to the founder of the town br br Many words were borrowed from the German language from the sizable German population in Polish cities during medieval times German words found in the Polish language are often connected with trade the building industry civic rights and city life Some words were assimilated verbatim for example handel trade and dach roof others are pronounced similarly but differ in writing Schnur sznur cord As a result of being neighbors with Germany Polish has many German expressions which have become literally translated calques The regional dialects of Upper Silesia and Masuria Modern Polish East Prussia have noticeably more German loanwords than other varieties br The contacts with Ottoman Turkey in the th century brought many new words some of them still in use such as jar yar deep valley szasz yk i lik shish kebab fili anka fincan cup arbuz karpuz watermelon dywan divan carpet etc br From the founding of the Kingdom of Poland in through the early years of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth created in Poland was the most tolerant country of Jews in Europe Known as the paradise for the Jews it became a shelter for persecuted and expelled European Jewish communities and the home to the world s largest Jewish community of the time As a result many Polish words come from Yiddish spoken by the large Polish Jewish population that existed until the Holocaust Borrowed Yiddish words include bachor an unruly boy or child bajzel slang for mess belfer slang for teacher ciuchy slang for clothing cymes slang for very tasty food geszeft slang for business kitel slang for apron machlojka slang for scam mamona money manele slang for oddments myszygene slang for lunatic pinda slang for girl pejoratively plajta slang for bankruptcy rejwach noise szmal slang for money and trefny dodgy br The mountain dialects of the G rale in southern Poland have quite a number of words borrowed from Hungarian e g baca gazda juhas hejna and Romanian as a result of historical contacts with Hungarian dominated Slovakia and Wallachian herders who travelled north along the Carpathians br Thieves slang includes such words as kima to sleep or majcher knife of Greek origin considered then unknown to the outside world br In addition Turkish and Tatar have exerted influence upon the vocabulary of war names of oriental costumes etc Russian borrowings began to make their way into Polish from the second half of the th century on br Polish has also received an intensive number of English loanwords particularly after World War II Recent loanwords come primarily from the English language mainly those that have Latin or Greek roots for example komputer computer korupcja from corruption but sense restricted to bribery etc Concatenation of parts of words e g auto moto which is not native to Polish but common in English for example is also sometimes used When borrowing English words Polish often changes their spelling For example Latin suffix tio corresponds to cja To make the word plural cja becomes cje Examples of this include inauguracja inauguration dewastacja devastation recepcja reception konurbacja conurbation and konotacje connotations Also the digraph qu becomes kw kwadrant quadrant kworum quorum br br br Loanwords from Polish in other languages br br The Polish language has influenced others Particular influences appear in other Slavic languages and in German due to their proximity and shared borders Examples of loanwords include German Grenze border Dutch and Afrikaans grens from Polish granica German Peitzker from Polish piskorz weatherfish German Zobel French zibeline Swedish sobel and English sable from Polish sob l and ogonek little tail the word describing a diacritic hook sign added below some letters in various alphabets The common Germanic word quartz comes from the dialectical Old Polish kwardy Szmata a Polish Slovak and Ruthenian word for mop or rag became part of Yiddish The Polish language exerted significant lexical influence upon Ukrainian particularly in the fields of abstract and technical terminology for example the Ukrainian word panstvo country is derived from Polish pa stwo The Polish influence on Ukrainian is particularly marked on western Ukrainian dialects in western Ukraine which for centuries was under Polish cultural domination br There are a substantial number of Polish words which officially became part of Yiddish once the main language of European Jews These include basic items objects or terms such as a bread bun Polish bu ka Yiddish bulke a fishing rod w dka ventke an oak d b demb a meadow ka lonke a moustache w sy vontses and a bladder p cherz penkher br Quite a few culinary loanwords exist in German and in other languages some of which describe distinctive features of Polish cuisine These include German and English Quark from twar g a kind of fresh cheese and German Gurke English gherkin from og rek cucumber The word pierogi Polish dumplings has spread internationally as well as p czki Polish donuts and kie basa sausage e g kolbaso in Esperanto As far as pierogi concerned the original Polish word is already in plural sing pier g plural pierogi stem pierog plural ending i NB o becomes in a closed syllable like here in singular yet it is commonly used with the English plural ending s in Canada and United States of America pierogis thus making it a double plural A similar situation happened with the Polish loanword from English czipsy potato chips from English chips being already plural in the original chip s yet it has obtained the Polish plural ending y br It is believed that the English word spruce was derived from Prusy the Polish name for the region of Prussia It became spruce because in Polish z Prus sounded like spruce in English transl from Prussia and was a generic term for commodities brought to England by Hanseatic merchants and because the tree was believed to have come from Polish Ducal Prussia However it can be argued that the word is actually derived from the Old French term Pruce meaning literally Prussia br br br Literature br br The Polish language started to be used in literature in the Late Middle Ages Notable works include the Holy Cross Sermons th th century Bogurodzica th century and Master Polikarp s Dialog with Death th century The most influential Renaissance era literary figures in Poland were poet Jan Kochanowski Laments Miko aj Rej and Piotr Skarga The Lives of the Saints who established poetic patterns that would become integral to the Polish literary language and laid foundations for the modern Polish grammar During the Age of Enlightenment in Poland Ignacy Krasicki known as the Prince of Poets wrote the first Polish novel called The Adventures of Mr Nicholas Wisdom as well as Fables and Parables Another significant work form this period is The Manuscript Found in Saragossa written by Jan Potocki a Polish nobleman Egyptologist linguist and adventurer br In the Romantic Era the most celebrated national poets referred to as the Three Bards were Adam Mickiewicz Pan Tadeusz
