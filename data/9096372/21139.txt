North America is a continent in the Northern and Western Hemispheres North America is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean to the east by the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea and to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean The region includes the Bahamas Bermuda Canada the Caribbean Central America Clipperton Island Greenland Mexico Saint Pierre and Miquelon Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States br North America covers an area of about square kilometers square miles representing approximately of the Earth s land area and of its total surface area It is the third largest continent by size after Asia and Africa and the fourth largest continent by population after Asia Africa and Europe As of North America s population was estimated as over million people in independent states or about of the world s population In human geography the terms North America and North American sometimes refer to just Canada the United States Mexico and Greenland br It is unknown with certainty how and when first human populations first reached North America People were known to live in the Americas at least years ago but various evidence points to possibly earlier dates The Paleo Indian period in North America followed the Last Glacial Period and lasted until about years ago when the Archaic period began The classic stage followed the Archaic period and lasted from approximately the th to th centuries Beginning in AD the Norse were the first Europeans to begin exploring and ultimately colonizing areas of North America br In the exploratory voyages of Christopher Columbus led to a transatlantic exchange including migrations of European settlers during the Age of Discovery and the early modern period Present day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect interactions between European colonists indigenous peoples enslaved Africans immigrants from Europe Asia and descendants of these respective groups br Europe s colonization in North America led to most North Americans speaking European languages such as English Spanish and French and the cultures of the region commonly reflect Western traditions However relatively small parts of North America in Canada the United States Mexico and Central America have indigenous populations that continue adhering to their respective pre European colonial cultural and linguistic traditions br br br Name br br The Americas were named after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci by German cartographers Martin Waldseem ller and Matthias Ringmann Vespucci explored South America between and and was the first European to suggest that the Americas represented a landmass not then known to the Europeans In Waldseem ller published a world map and placed the word America on the continent of present day South America The continent north of present day Mexico was then referred to as Parias On a world map published by Petrus Apianus North America was called Baccalearum meaning realm of the Cod fish in reference to the abundance of cod fish on the East Coast br Waldseem ller used the Latin version of Vespucci s name Americus Vespucius in its feminine form of America following the examples of Europa Asia and Africa Map makers later extended the name America to North America br In Gerardus Mercator used the term America on his world map of the entire Western Hemisphere On his subsequent map Mercator called North America America or New India America sive India Nova br The Spanish Empire called its territories in North and South America Las Indias and the name given to the state body that oversaw the region was called the Council of the Indies br br br Definitions br br The United Nations and its statistics division recognize North America as including three regions Northern America Central America and the Caribbean Northern America is a distinct term from North America excluding Central America which itself may or may not include Mexico In the limited context of regional trade agreements the term is used to reference three nations Canada the United States and Mexico br France Italy Portugal Spain Romania Greece and the countries of Latin America use a six continent model with the Americas viewed as a single continent and North America designating a subcontinent comprising Canada the United States Mexico and Saint Pierre and Miquelon politically part of France and often including Greenland and Bermuda br North America has historically been known by other names including Spanish North America New Spain and Am rica Septentrional the first official name given to Mexico br br br Regions br br North America includes several regions and subregions each of which have their own respective cultural economic and geographic regions Economic regions include several regions formalized in th and st century trade agreements including NAFTA between Canada Mexico and the United States and CAFTA between Central America the Dominican Republic and the United States br North America is divided linguistically and culturally into two primary regions Anglo America and Latin America Anglo America includes most of North America Belize and Caribbean islands with English speaking populations There are also regions including Louisiana and Quebec with large Francophone populations in Quebec French is the official language br The southern portion of North America includes Central America and non English speaking Caribbean nations The north of the continent maintains recognized regions as well In contrast to the common definition of North America which encompasses the whole North American continent the term North America is sometimes used more narrowly to refer only to four nations Canada Greenland Mexico and the U S The U S Census Bureau includes Saint Pierre and Miquelon but excludes Mexico from its definition br The term Northern America refers to the northernmost countries and territories of North America the U S Bermuda Canada Greenland and St Pierre and Miquelon Although the term does not refer to a unified region Middle America includes Mexico Central America and the Caribbean br North America s largest countries by land area are Canada and the U S both of which have well defined and recognized subregions In Canada these include from east to west Atlantic Canada Central Canada Canadian Prairies the British Columbia Coast and Northern Canada In the U S they include New England the Mid Atlantic South Atlantic states East North Central states West North Central states East South Central states West South Central states Mountain states and Pacific states The Great Lakes region and the Pacific Northwest include areas in both Canada and the U S br br br Countries dependencies and other territories br br br Natural characteristics br br br Geography br br North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World the Western Hemisphere the Americas or simply America which in many countries is considered a single continent with North America a subcontinent North America is the third largest continent by area after Asia and Africa br North America s only land connection to South America is in present day Panama at the Darien Gap on the Colombia Panama border placing almost all of Panama within North America Alternatively some geologists physiographically locate its southern limit at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec Mexico with Central America extending southeastward to South America from this point The Caribbean islands or West Indies are considered part of North America The continental coastline is long and irregular The Gulf of Mexico is the largest body of water indenting the continent followed by Hudson Bay Others include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Gulf of California br Before the Central American isthmus formed the region had been underwater The islands of the West Indies delineate a submerged former land bridge which had connected North and South America via what are now Florida and Venezuela br There are several islands off the continent s coasts principally the Arctic Archipelago the Bahamas Turks and Caicos the Greater and Lesser Antilles the Aleutian Islands some of which are in the Eastern Hemisphere proper the Alexander Archipelago the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast and Newfoundland Greenland a self governing Danish island and the world s largest is on the same tectonic plate the North American Plate and is part of North America geographically In a geologic sense Bermuda is not part of the Americas but an oceanic island that was formed on the fissure of the Mid Atlantic Ridge over million years ago mya The nearest landmass to it is Cape Hatteras North Carolina However Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America especially given its historical political and cultural ties to Virginia and other parts of the continent br The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate Parts of western Mexico including Baja California and of California including the cities of San Diego Los Angeles and Santa Cruz lie on the eastern edge of the Pacific Plate with the two plates meeting along the San Andreas fault The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the Caribbean Plate whereas the Juan de Fuca and Cocos plates border the North American Plate on its western frontier br The continent can be divided into four great regions each of which contains many subregions the Great Plains stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian Arctic the geologically young mountainous west including the Rocky Mountains the Great Basin California and Alaska the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast and the varied eastern region which includes the Appalachian Mountains the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard and the Florida peninsula Mexico with its long plateaus and cordilleras falls largely in the western region although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf br The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the coast ranges in California Oregon Washington and British Columbia with the Great Basin a lower area containing smaller ranges and low lying deserts in between The highest peak is Denali in Alaska br The U S Geographical Survey USGS states that the geographic center of North America is miles km west of Balta Pierce County North Dakota at about N W about kilometers mi from Rugby North Dakota The USGS further states that No marked or monumented point has been established by any government agency as the geographic center of either the states the conterminous United States or the North American continent Nonetheless there is a meter ft field stone obelisk in Rugby claiming to mark the center The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is located km mi from the nearest coastline between Allen and Kyle South Dakota at N W Pole of Inaccessibility North America br br br Geology br br br Geologic history br br Laurentia is an ancient craton which forms the geologic core of North America it formed between and billion years ago during the Proterozoic eon The Canadian Shield is the largest exposure of this craton From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras North America was joined with the other modern day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea with Eurasia to its east One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains which formed some mya making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world When Pangaea began to rift around mya North America became part of Laurasia before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid Cretaceous period The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny between and mya The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately to mya and the Great Lakes as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers were carved by receding glaciers about years ago br North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about geologic time periods The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of dinosaurs than any other modern country According to paleontologist Peter Dodson this is primarily due to stratigraphy climate and geography human resources and history Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent The most significant Late Jurassic dinosaur bearing fossil deposit in North America is the Morrison Formation of the western U S br br br Canada br br Canada is geographically one of the oldest regions in the world with more than half of the region consisting of Precambrian rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era Canada s mineral resources are diverse and extensive Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron nickel zinc copper gold lead molybdenum and uranium reserves Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic making Canada one of the world s largest producers Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals The largest and best known is Sudbury Ontario Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater The nearby but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin and so it could be a second metal rich impact crater The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry br br br United States br br The lower U S states can be divided into roughly five physiographic provinces br br The American cordillera br The Canadian Shield Northern portion of the upper midwestern U S br The stable platform br The coastal plain br The Appalachian orogenic belt br The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera while the major islands of Hawaii consist of Neogene volcanics erupted over a hot spot br br br Central America br br Central America is geologically active with volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occurring from time to time In Guatemala was hit by a major earthquake killing people Managua the capital of Nicaragua was devastated by earthquakes in and the last one killing about people three earthquakes devastated El Salvador one in and two in one earthquake devastated northern and central Costa Rica in killing at least people in Honduras a powerful earthquake killed seven people in br Volcanic eruptions are common in the region In the Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica erupted and killed people Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in agriculturally productive highland areas br Central America has many mountain ranges the longest are the Sierra Madre de Chiapas the Cordillera Isabelia and the Cordillera de Talamanca Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people in fact most of the population of Honduras Costa Rica and Guatemala live in valleys Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee beans and other crops br br br Climate br br North America is a very large continent that extends from north of the Arctic Circle to south of the Tropic of Cancer Greenland along with the Canadian Shield is tundra with average temperatures ranging from to C to F but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet This tundra radiates throughout Canada but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains but still contains Alaska and at the end of the Canadian Shield near the Great Lakes br Climate west of the Cascade Range is described as being temperate weather with average precipitation inches millimeters br Climate in coastal California is described to be Mediterranean with average temperatures in cities like San Francisco ranging from to F to C over the course of the year br Stretching from the East Coast to eastern North Dakota and stretching down to Kansas is the humid continental climate featuring intense seasons with a large amount of annual precipitation with places like New York City averaging in mm br Starting at the southern border of the humid continental climate and stretching to the Gulf of Mexico whilst encompassing the eastern half of Texas is the humid subtropical climate This area has the wettest cities in the contiguous U S with annual precipitation reaching in mm in Mobile Alabama br Stretching from the borders of the humid continental and subtropical climates and going west to the Sierra Nevada south to the southern tip of Durango north to the border with tundra climate the steppe desert climates are the driest in the United States Highland climates cut from north to south of the continent where subtropical or temperate climates occur just below the tropics as in central Mexico and Guatemala Tropical climates appear in the island regions and in the subcontinent s bottleneck found in countries and states bathed by the Caribbean Sea or to the south of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean Precipitation patterns vary across the region and as such rainforest monsoon and savanna types can be found with rains and high temperatures throughout the year br br br Ecology br br Notable North American fauna include the bison black bear jaguar cougar prairie dog turkey pronghorn raccoon coyote and monarch butterfly Notable plants that were domesticated in North America include tobacco maize squash tomato sunflower blueberry avocado cotton chile pepper and vanilla br br br History br br br Pre Columbian era br br The indigenous peoples of the Americas have many creation myths by which they assert that they have been present on the land since its creation but there is no evidence that humans evolved there The specifics of the initial settlement of the Americas by ancient Asians are subject to ongoing research and discussion The traditional theory has been that hunters entered the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Siberia and present day Alaska from to years ago A growing viewpoint is that the first American inhabitants sailed from Beringia some years ago with widespread habitation of the Americas during the end of the Last Glacial Period in what is known as the Late Glacial Maximum around years ago The oldest petroglyphs in North America date from to years before present Genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from Asia via the Bering Strait during the Early Middle Holocene br Prior to the arrival of European explorers and colonists in North America the natives of North America were divided into many different polities ranging from small bands of a few families to large empires They lived in several culture areas which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones that defined the representative cultures and lifestyles of the indigenous people who lived there including the bison hunters of the Great Plains and the farmers of Mesoamerica Native groups also are classified by their language families which included Athapascan and Uto Aztecan languages Indigenous peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture however and were not necessarily always allies Anthropologists speculate that the Inuit of the high Arctic arrived in North America much later than other native groups evidenced by the disappearance of Dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the Thule people br During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent cultures changed and shifted One of the oldest yet discovered is the Clovis culture c BCE in modern New Mexico Later groups include the Mississippian culture and related Mound building cultures found in the Mississippi River valley and the Pueblo culture of what is now the Four Corners The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the domestication of many common crops now used around the world such as tomatoes squash and maize As a result of the development of agriculture in the south many other cultural advances were made there The Mayans developed a writing system built huge pyramids and temples had a complex calendar and developed the concept of zero around CE br The first recorded European references to North America are in Norse sagas where it is referred to as Vinland The earliest verifiable instance of pre Columbian trans oceanic contact by any European culture with the North America mainland has been dated to around CE The site situated at the northernmost extent of the island named Newfoundland has provided unmistakable evidence of Norse settlement Norse explorer Leif Erikson c CE is thought to have visited the area Erikson was the first European to make landfall on the continent excluding Greenland br The Mayan culture was still present in southern Mexico and Guatemala when the Spanish conquistadors arrived but political dominance in the area had shifted to the Aztec Empire whose capital city Tenochtitlan was located further north in the Valley of Mexico The Aztecs were conquered in by Hern n Cort s br br br Post contact br br During the so called Age of Discovery Europeans explored overseas and staked claims to various parts of North America much of which was already settled by indigenous peoples Upon Europeans arrival in the New World indigenous peoples had a variety of reactions including curiosity trading cooperation resignation and resistance The indigenous population declined substantially following European arrival primarily due to the introduction of Eurasian diseases such as smallpox to which the indigenous peoples lacked immunity and because of violent conflicts with Europeans Indigenous culture changed significantly and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed Several linguistic groups died out and others changed quite quickly br On the North America s southeastern coast Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le n who had accompanied Columbus s second voyage visited and named in La Florida As the colonial period unfolded Spain England and France appropriated and claimed extensive territories in North America eastern and southern coastlines Spain established permanent settlements on the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba in the s building cities putting the resident indigenous populations to work raising crops for Spanish settlers and panning gold to enrich the Spaniards Much of the indigenous population died due to disease and overwork spurring the Spaniards on to claim new lands and peoples An expedition under the command of Spanish settler Hern n Cort s sailed westward in to what turned out to be the mainland in Mexico With local indigenous allies the Spanish conquered the Aztec empire in central Mexico in Spain then established permanent cities in Mexico Central America and Spanish South America in the sixteenth century Once Spaniards conquered the high civilization of the Aztecs and Incas the Caribbean was a backwater of the Spanish empire br Other European powers began to intrude on areas claimed by Spain including the Caribbean islands France took the western half of Hispaniola and developed Saint Domingue as a cane sugar producing colony worked by black slave labor Britain took Barbados and Jamaica and the Dutch and Danes took islands previously claimed by Spain Britain did not begin settling on the North American mainland until a hundred years after the first Spanish settlements since it sought first to control nearby Ireland br br br English settlements br br The first permanent English settlement was in Jamestown Virginia in followed by additional colonial establishments on the east coast from present day Georgia in the south to Massachusetts in the north forming the Thirteen Colonies of British America The English did not establish settlements north or east of the St Lawrence Valley in present day Canada until after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War Britain s early settlements in present day Canada included St John s Newfoundland in and Halifax Nova Scotia in The first permanent French settlement was in Quebec City Quebec in br br br Seven Years War br br With the British victory in the Seven Years War France in ceded to Britain its claims of North American territories east of the Mississippi River Spain in turn gained rights to the territories west of Mississippi which then served as a border between Spain and Britain s territorial claims French colonists settled Illinois Country after several generations of experience on North America migrating over the Mississippi River to regions where Spain was not present and where they were able to leverage their earlier Louisiana French settlements around the Gulf of Mexico These early French settlers partnered with midwest indigenous tribes and their mixed ancestry descendants later followed a westward expansion all the way to the Pacific Ocean on the present day U S West Coast br br br American Revolution br br In after various attempts to reconcile differences with the British the Thirteen Colonies in British America sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia who unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July written primarily by Thomas Jefferson a member of the Committee of Five charged by the Second Continental Congress with authoring it In the Declaration the thirteen colonies declared their independence from the British monarchy then governed by King George III and detailed the factors that contributed to their decision With the signing and issuance of the Declaration of Independence the thirteen colonies formalized and escalated the American Revolutionary War which had begun the year before at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April Gathered in Philadelphia following the war s outbreak delegates from the thirteen colonies established the Continental Army from various patriot militias then engaged in resisting the British and appointed George Washington as the Continental Army s military commander br As the American Revolutionary War progressed France and Spain both then enemies of Britain began to ultimately see the promise of a potential American victory in the war and began supporting Washington and the American Revolutionary cause The British Army in turn was supported by Hessian military units from present day Germany br In after an eight year attempt to defeat the American rebellion King George III acknowledged Britain s defeat in the war leading to the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September which solidified the sovereign establishment of the United States br br br Westward expansion br br By the late th century Russia was established on the Pacific Northwest northern coastline where it was engaged in maritime fur trade and was supported by various indigenous settlements in the region As a result the Spanish were showing more interest in controlling the trade on the Pacific coast and mapped most of its coastline The first Spanish settlements were attempted in Alta California during that period Numerous overland explorations associated with voyageurs fur trade and U S led expeditions including the Lewis and Clark Fr mont and Wilkes expeditions reached the Pacific br In during the presidency of Thomas Jefferson the third U S president Napoleon Bonaparte sold France s remaining North American territorial claims which included regions west of the Mississippi River to the U S in the Louisiana Purchase Spain and the U S settled their western boundary dispute in in the Adams On s Treaty Mexico fought a lengthy war for independence from Spain winning it for Mexico which included Central America at the time in The U S sought further westward expansion and fought the Mexican American War gaining a vast territory that first Spain and then Mexico claimed but which they did not effectively control Much of the area was in fact dominated by indigenous peoples which did not recognize the claims of Spain France or the U S Russia sold its North American claims which included the present day U S state of Alaska to the U S in br br br Canada and Panama Canal br br In colonial settlers north of the United States unified as the dominion of Canada The U S sought to dig a canal across the Isthmus of Panama in present day Panama in Central America then a part of present day Colombia The U S aided Panamanians in a war that resulted in its separation from Colombia The U S subsequently carved out the Panama Canal Zone and claimed sovereignty over it After decades of work the Panama Canal was completed which connected the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in and greatly facilitated global shipping navigation br br br Demographics br br Canada and the United States are the wealthiest and most developed nations on the continent followed by Mexico a newly industrialized country The countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at various levels of economic and human development For example small Caribbean island nations such as Barbados Trinidad and Tobago and Antigua and Barbuda have a higher GDP PPP per capita than Mexico due to their smaller populations Panama and Costa Rica have a significantly higher Human Development Index and GDP than the rest of the Central American nations Additionally despite Greenland s vast resources in oil and minerals much of them remain untapped and the island is economically dependent on fishing tourism and subsidies from Denmark Nevertheless the island is highly developed br Demographically North America is ethnically diverse Its three main groups are Whites Mestizos and Blacks There is a significant minority of Indigenous Americans and Asians among other less numerous groups br br br Languages br br The dominant languages in North America are English Spanish and French Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside Greenlandic and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the Dutch Caribbean The term Anglo America is used to refer to the anglophone countries of the Americas namely Canada where English and French are co official and the U S but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics especially the Commonwealth Caribbean Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas generally south of the U S where the Romance languages derived from Latin of Spanish and Portuguese but French speaking countries are not usually included predominate the other republics of Central America but not always Belize part of the Caribbean not the Dutch English or French speaking areas Mexico and most of South America except Guyana Suriname French Guiana France and the Falkland Islands UK br The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions Canada is officially bilingual French is the official language of the province of Quebec where of the people speak it as either their first or second language and it is co official with English in the province of New Brunswick Other French speaking locales include the province of Ontario the official language is English but there are an estimated Franco Ontarians the province of Manitoba co official as de jure with English the French West Indies and Saint Pierre et Miquelon as well as the U S state of Louisiana where French is also an official language Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both Creole and French Similarly French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the Commonwealth of Dominica alongside English br A significant number of Indigenous languages are spoken in North America with people in the U S speaking an indigenous language at home about in Canada and roughly million in Mexico In the U S and Canada there are approximately surviving indigenous languages of the spoken prior to European contact br br br Religions br br Christianity is the largest religion in the United States Canada and Mexico According to a Pew Research Center survey of the population considered themselves Christians Christianity also is the predominant religion in the dependent territories in North America The U S has the largest Christian population in the world with nearly million Christians although other countries have higher percentages of Christians among their populations Mexico has the world s second largest number of Catholics surpassed only by Brazil br According to the same study the religiously unaffiliated including agnostics and atheists make up about of the population of Canada and the U S Those with no religious affiliation make up about of Canada s total population br Canada the U S and Mexico host communities of Jews million or about Buddhists million or and Muslims million or The largest number of Jews can be found in the U S million Canada and Mexico The U S hosts the largest Muslim population in North America with million or while Canada hosts about one million Muslims or of the population In Mexico there were Muslims in In U T San Diego estimated U S practitioners of Buddhism at million people of whom are living in Southern California br The predominant religion in Mexico and Central America is Christianity Beginning with the Spanish colonization of Mexico in the th century Roman Catholicism was the only religion permitted by Spanish crown and Catholic church A vast campaign of religious conversion the so called spiritual conquest was launched to bring the indigenous peoples into the Christian fold The Inquisition was established to assure orthodox belief and practice The Catholic Church remained an important institution so that even after political independence Roman Catholicism remained the dominant religion Since the s there has been an increase in other Christian groups particularly Protestantism as well as other religious organizations and individuals identifying themselves as having no religion Christianity is also the predominant religion in the Caribbean Other religious groups in the region are Hinduism Islam Rastafari in Jamaica and Afro American religions such as Santer a and Vodou br br br Populace br br North America is the fourth most populous continent after Asia Africa and Europe Its most populous country is the U S with million persons The second largest country is Mexico with a population of million Canada is the third most populous country with million The majority of Caribbean island nations have national populations under a million though Cuba Dominican Republic Haiti Puerto Rico a territory of the U S Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago each have populations higher than a million Greenland has a small population of for its massive size million km or mi and therefore it has the world s lowest population density at pop km pop mi br While the U S Canada and Mexico maintain the largest populations large city populations are not restricted to those nations There are also large cities in the Caribbean The largest cities in North America by far are Mexico City and New York City These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million and two of three in the Americas Next in size are Los Angeles Toronto Chicago Havana Santo Domingo and Montreal Cities in the Sun Belt regions of the U S such as those in Southern California and Houston Phoenix Miami Atlanta and Las Vegas are experiencing rapid growth These causes included warm temperatures retirement of Baby Boomers large industry and the influx of immigrants Cities near the U S border particularly in Mexico are also experiencing large amounts of growth Most notable is Tijuana a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of water shortages br Eight of the top ten metropolitan areas are located in the U S These metropolitan areas all have a population of above million and include the New York City metropolitan area Los Angeles metropolitan area Chicago metropolitan area and the Dallas Fort Worth metroplex Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within the U S Mexico is host to the largest metropolitan area by population in North America Greater Mexico City Canada also breaks into the top ten largest metropolitan areas with the Toronto metropolitan area having six million people The proximity of cities to each other on the Canada United States border and the Mexico U S border has led to the rise of international metropolitan areas These urban agglomerations are observed at their largest and most productive in Detroit Windsor and San Diego Tijuana and experience large commercial economic and cultural activity The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight In Detroit Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in concluded US billion was dependent on the Detroit Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US billion br br North America has also been witness to the growth of megapolitan areas The United States includes eleven megaregions br br Census figures br br br Economy br br North America s GDP per capita was evaluated in October by the International Monetary Fund IMF to be making it the richest continent in the world followed by Oceania br Canada Mexico and the U S have significant and multifaceted economic systems The U S has the largest economy in the world In the U S had an estimated per capita gross domestic product PPP of according to the World Bank and is the most technologically developed economy of the three The U S s services sector comprises of the country s GDP estimated in industry comprises and agriculture comprises The U S economy is also the fastest growing economy in North America and the Americas as a whole with the highest GDP per capita in the Americas as well br Canada shows significant growth in the sectors of services mining and manufacturing Canada s per capita GDP PPP was estimated at and it had the th largest GDP nominal in Canada s services sector comprises of the country s GDP estimated in industry comprises and agriculture comprises Mexico has a per capita GDP PPP of and as of is the th largest GDP nominal in the world Being a newly industrialized country Mexico maintains both modern and outdated industrial and agricultural facilities and operations Its main sources of income are oil industrial exports manufactured goods electronics heavy industry automobiles construction food banking and financial services br The North American economy is well defined and structured in three main economic areas These areas are those under the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA the Caribbean Community and Common Market CARICOM and the Central American Common Market CACM Of these trade blocs the U S takes part in two In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the Canada Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement among numerous other free trade relations often between the larger more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries br NAFTA formed one of the four largest trade blocs in the world Its implementation in was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada the U S and Mexico While Canada and the U S already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship and to present day still do in the world and Canada U S trade relations already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar duty free trade The free trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on U S Mexico trade Trade volume has steadily increased annually and in surface trade between the three NAFTA nations reached an all time historical increase of or US billion The NAFTA trade bloc GDP PPP is the world s largest with US trillion This is in part attributed to the fact that the economy of the U S is the world s largest national economy the country had a nominal GDP of approximately trillion in The countries of NAFTA are also some of each other s largest trade partners The U S is the largest trade partner of Canada and Mexico while Canada and Mexico are each other s third largest trade partners In the NAFTA was replaced by the U S Mexico Canada Agreement br The Caribbean trade bloc CARICOM came into agreement in when it was signed by Caribbean nations As of CARICOM trade volume was US billion CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a common passport for associated nations In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on free trade agreements and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations free trade agreements have been signed into effect br Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation The implementation of the Central American Free Trade Agreement CAFTA left the future of the CACM unclear The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries the Dominican Republic and the U S The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA In addition to the U S Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs br These nations also take part in inter continental trade blocs Mexico takes a part in the G Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU The U S has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the Transatlantic Free Trade Area between itself and the European Union the U S Middle East Free Trade Area between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself and the Trans Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership between Southeast Asian nations Australia and New Zealand br br br Transport br br The Pan American Highway route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly km mi in length which travels through the mainland nations No definitive length of the Pan American Highway exists because the U S and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan American Highway and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the U S border However the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly km mi br The first transcontinental railroad in the U S was built in the s linking the railroad network of the eastern U S with California on the Pacific coast Finished on May at the famous golden spike event at Promontory Summit Utah it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the American West catalyzing the transition from the wagon trains of previous decades to a modern transportation system Although an accomplishment it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern U S railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world The Canadian Grand Trunk Railway had by already accumulated more than km mi of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as Port Huron Michigan through Sarnia Ontario br br br Communications br A shared telephone system known as the North American Numbering Plan NANP is an integrated telephone numbering plan of countries and territories the U S and its territories Canada Bermuda and Caribbean nations In recent months the internet service by Starlink has expanded to cover a number of North American markets br br br Culture br br The cultures of North America are diverse The U S and English Canada have many cultural similarities while French Canada has a distinct culture from Anglophone Canada which is protected by law Since the U S was formed from portions previously part of the Spanish Empire and then independent Mexico and there has been considerable and continuing immigration of Spanish speakers from south of the U S Mexico border In the southwest of the U S there are many Hispanic cultural traditions and considerable bilingualism Mexico and Central America are part of Latin America and are culturally distinct from anglophone and francophone North America However they share with the United States the establishment of post independence governments that are federated representative republics with written constitutions dating from their founding as nations Canada is a federated parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy br Canada s constitution dates to with confederation in the British North America Act but not until did Canada
