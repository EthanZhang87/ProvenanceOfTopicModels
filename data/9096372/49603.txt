The Colosseum KOL SEE m Italian Colosseo kolos s o is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome Italy just east of the Roman Forum It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world despite its age Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian r AD in and was completed in AD under his successor and heir Titus r Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian r The three emperors who were patrons of the work are known as the Flavian dynasty and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre Latin Amphitheatrum Flavium Italian Anfiteatro Flavio a fite a tro fla vjo by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with their family name Flavius br The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone tuff volcanic rock and brick faced concrete It could hold an estimated to spectators at various points in its history having an average audience of some it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts executions re enactments of famous battles dramas based on Roman mythology and briefly mock sea battles The building ceased to be used for entertainment in the early medieval era It was later reused for such purposes as housing workshops quarters for a religious order a fortress a quarry and a Christian shrine br Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New Wonders of the World It is one of Rome s most popular tourist attractions and has links to the Catholic Church as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit Way of the Cross procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the euro cent coin br br br Name br Originally the building s Latin name was simply amphitheatrum amphitheatre Though the modern name Flavian Amphitheatre Latin Amphitheatrum Flavium is often used there is no evidence it was used in classical antiquity This name refers to the patronage of the Flavian dynasty during whose reigns the building was constructed but the structure is better known as the Colosseum In antiquity Romans may have referred to the Colosseum by the unofficial name Amphitheatrum Caesareum with Caesareum an adjective pertaining to the title Caesar but this name may have been strictly poetic as it was not exclusive to the Colosseum Vespasian and Titus builders of the Colosseum also constructed a Flavian Amphitheatre in Puteoli modern Pozzuoli br br The name Colosseum is believed to be derived from a colossal statue of Nero on the model of the Colossus of Rhodes The giant bronze sculpture of Nero as a solar deity was moved to its position beside the amphitheatre by the emperor Hadrian r The word colosseum is a neuter Latin noun formed from the adjective colosseus meaning gigantic or colossean By the year the Latin name Colosseum had been coined to refer to the amphitheatre from the nearby Colossus Solis br The spelling was sometimes altered in Medieval Latin coloseum and coliseum are attested from the th and th centuries respectively In the th century the structure was recorded as the amphitheatrum colisei Amphitheatre of the Colossus In the High Middle Ages the Flavian amphitheatre is attested as the late th century Old French colos and in Middle French as colis e by the early th century by which time the word could be applied to any amphitheatre From Middle French colis e derived the Middle English colisee in use by the middle of the th century and employed by John Capgrave in his Solace of Pilgrims in which he remarked Middle English collise eke is a meruelous place e moost part of it stant at is day An English translation by John Bourchier nd Baron Berners of Antonio de Guevara s biography of Marcus Aurelius r in about referred to Middle English this Emperour beynge with the Senate at Collisee Similarly the Italian colosseo or coliseo are attested as referring first to the amphitheatre in Rome and then to any amphitheatre as Italian culiseo in By an equivalent existed in Catalan coliseu by had appeared the Spanish coliseo and by the Portuguese coliseu br br The earliest citation for the name Colosseum in Early Modern English is the translation by Philemon Holland of the Urbis Romae topographia of Bartolomeo Marliani which he used in the preparation of his translation of Livy s Augustan era Ab Urbe Condita Libri The text states This Amphitheatre was commonly called Colosseum of Neroes Colossus which was set up in the porch of Neroes house Similarly John Evelyn translating the Middle French name le Colis e used by the architectural theorist Roland Fr art de Chambray wrote And tis indeed a kind of miracle to see that the Colosseum and innumerable other Structures which seemed to have been built for Eternity should be at present so ruinous and dilapidated br br br Related to the Colossus of Nero statue br After Nero s suicide and the civil wars of the Year of the Four Emperors the Colossus of Nero statue was remodeled by the condemned emperor s successors into the likeness of Helios Sol or Apollo the sun god by adding the appropriate solar crown It was then commonly referred to as the Colossus solis Nero s head was also replaced several times with the heads of succeeding emperors Despite its pagan links the statue remained standing well into the Middle Ages and was credited with magical powers The emperor Constantine the Great remodeled the statue s face as his own br In the th century an epigram attributed to the Venerable Bede celebrated the symbolic significance of the statue in a prophecy that is variously quoted Quamdiu stat Colis us stat et Roma quando cadet colis us cadet et Roma quando cadet Roma cadet et mundus as long as the Colossus stands so shall Rome when the Colossus falls Rome shall fall when Rome falls so falls the world This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus as in for instance Byron s poem Childe Harold s Pilgrimage However at the time that the Pseudo Bede wrote the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to the amphitheatre br The Colossus did eventually fall possibly being pulled down to reuse its bronze The statue itself was largely forgotten and only its base survives between the Colosseum and the nearby Temple of Venus and Roma br br br History br br br Construction inauguration and Roman renovations br br The site chosen was a flat area on the floor of a low valley between the Caelian Esquiline and Palatine Hills through which a canalised stream ran as well as an artificial lake marsh By the nd century BC the area was densely inhabited It was devastated by the Great Fire of Rome in AD following which Nero seized much of the area to add to his personal domain He built the grandiose Domus Aurea on the site in front of which he created an artificial lake surrounded by pavilions gardens and porticoes The existing Aqua Claudia aqueduct was extended to supply water to the area and the gigantic bronze Colossus of Nero was set up nearby at the entrance to the Domus Aurea Although the Colossus was preserved much of the Domus Aurea was torn down The lake was filled in and the land reused as the location for the new Flavian Amphitheatre Gladiatorial schools and other support buildings were constructed nearby within the former grounds of the Domus Aurea Vespasian s decision to build the Colosseum on the site of Nero s lake can be seen as a populist gesture of returning to the people an area of the city which Nero had appropriated for his own use In contrast to many other amphitheatres which were on the outskirts of a city the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre in effect placing it both symbolically and geographically at the heart of Rome br Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the First Jewish Roman War in AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general s share of the booty It is often assumed that Jewish prisoners of war were brought back to Rome and contributed to the massive workforce needed for the construction of the amphitheatre but there is no ancient evidence for that it would nonetheless be commensurate with Roman practice to add humiliation to the defeated population Along with this free source of unskilled labor teams of professional Roman builders engineers artists painters and decorators undertook the more specialized tasks necessary for building the Colosseum The Colosseum was constructed with several different materials wood limestone tuff tiles cement and mortar br Construction of the Colosseum began under the rule of Vespasian in around AD AD according to some sources The Colosseum had been completed up to the third story by the time of Vespasian s death in The top level was finished by his son Titus in and the inaugural games were held in or AD Dio Cassius recounts that over wild animals were killed during the inaugural games of the amphitheatre Commemorative coinage was issued celebrating the inauguration The building was remodelled further under Vespasian s younger son the newly designated Emperor Domitian who constructed the hypogeum a series of tunnels used to house animals and slaves He also added a gallery to the top of the Colosseum to increase its seating capacity br In the Colosseum was badly damaged by a major fire caused by lightning according to Dio Cassius which destroyed the wooden upper levels of the amphitheatre s interior It was not fully repaired until about and underwent further repairs in or and again in Honorius banned the practice of gladiator fights in and again in Gladiatorial fights are last mentioned around An inscription records the restoration of various parts of the Colosseum under Theodosius II and Valentinian III reigned possibly to repair damage caused by a major earthquake in more work followed in and The arena continued to be used for contests well into the th century Animal hunts continued until at least when Anicius Maximus celebrated his consulship with some venationes criticised by King Theodoric the Great for their high cost br br br Medieval br br The Colosseum underwent several radical changes of use By the late th century a small chapel had been built into the structure of the amphitheater though this apparently did not confer any particular religious significance on the building as a whole The arena was converted into a cemetery The numerous vaulted spaces in the arcades under the seating were converted into housing and workshops and are recorded as still being rented out as late as the th century Around the Frangipani family took over the Colosseum and fortified it apparently using it as a castle In the early to mid th century the Pope s relocation to Avignon caused a population decline in Rome that left the region insecure The colosseum was largely abandoned by the public and became a popular den for bandits br Severe damage was inflicted on the Colosseum by the great earthquake in causing the outer south side lying on a less stable alluvial terrain to collapse Much of the tumbled stone was reused to build palaces churches hospitals and other buildings elsewhere in Rome In after the Pope s return to Rome the Colosseum was restored by a religious order called Arciconfraternita del SS Salvatore ad Sancta Sanctorum who then inhabited a northern portion of it until as late as the early th century The interior of the amphitheater was extensively stripped of stone which was reused elsewhere or in the case of the marble fa ade was burned to make quicklime The iron clamps which held the stonework together were pried or hacked out of the walls leaving numerous pockmarks which still scar the building today br br br Modern br br br br During the th and th century Church officials sought a productive role for the Colosseum Pope Sixtus V planned to turn the building into a wool factory to provide employment for Rome s prostitutes though this proposal fell through with his premature death In Cardinal Altieri authorized its use for bullfights a public outcry caused the idea to be hastily abandoned br br In Pope Benedict XIV endorsed the view that the Colosseum was a sacred site where early Christians had been martyred He forbade the use of the Colosseum as a quarry and consecrated the building to the Passion of Christ and installed Stations of the Cross declaring it sanctified by the blood of the Christian martyrs who perished there see Significance in Christianity However there is no historical evidence to support Benedict s claim nor is there even any evidence that anyone before the th century suggested this might be the case the Catholic Encyclopedia concludes that there are no historical grounds for the supposition other than the reasonably plausible conjecture that some of the many martyrs may well have been br br Later popes initiated various stabilization and restoration projects removing the extensive vegetation which had overgrown the structure and threatened to damage it further The fa ade was reinforced with triangular brick wedges in and and the interior was repaired in and in the s The arena substructure was partly excavated in and and was fully exposed under Benito Mussolini in the s br The Colosseum is today one of Rome s most popular tourist attractions receiving millions of visitors annually The effects of pollution and general deterioration over time prompted a major restoration programme carried out between and at a cost of Lire billion m m at prices br In recent years the Colosseum has become a symbol of the international campaign against capital punishment which was abolished in Italy in Several anti death penalty demonstrations took place in front of the Colosseum in Since that time as a gesture against the death penalty the local authorities of Rome change the color of the Colosseum s night time illumination from white to gold whenever a person condemned to the death penalty anywhere in the world gets their sentence commuted or is released or if a jurisdiction abolishes the death penalty Most recently the Colosseum was illuminated in gold in November following the abolishment of capital punishment in the American state of Connecticut in April br Because of the ruined state of the interior it is impractical to use the Colosseum to host large events only a few hundred spectators can be accommodated in temporary seating However much larger concerts have been held just outside using the Colosseum as a backdrop Performers who have played at the Colosseum in recent years have included Ray Charles May Paul McCartney May Elton John September and Billy Joel July br br br Physical description br br br Exterior br br Unlike Roman theatres that were built into hillsides the Colosseum is an entirely free standing structure It derives its basic exterior and interior architecture from that of two theatres back to back It is elliptical in plan and is meters ft Roman feet long and meters ft Roman feet wide with a base area of square metres acres The height of the outer wall is meters ft Roman feet The perimeter originally measured meters ft Roman feet The central arena is an ellipse m ft long and m ft wide surrounded by a wall m ft high above which rose tiers of seating br The outer wall is estimated to have required over cubic metres million cubic feet of travertine stone which were set without mortar they were held together by tons of iron clamps However it has suffered extensive damage over the centuries with large segments having collapsed following earthquakes The north side of the perimeter wall is still standing the distinctive triangular brick wedges at each end are modern additions having been constructed in the early th century to shore up the wall The remainder of the present day exterior of the Colosseum is in fact the original interior wall br br The surviving part of the outer wall s monumental fa ade comprises three superposed storeys surmounted by a podium on which stands a tall attic both of which are pierced by windows interspersed at regular intervals The arcades are framed by half columns of the Doric Ionic and Corinthian orders while the attic is decorated with Corinthian pilasters Each of the arches in the second and third floor arcades framed statues probably honoring divinities and other figures from Classical mythology br Two hundred and forty mast corbels were positioned around the top of the attic They originally supported a retractable awning known as the velarium that kept the sun and rain off spectators This consisted of a canvas covered net like structure made of ropes with a hole in the center It covered two thirds of the arena and sloped down towards the center to catch the wind and provide a breeze for the audience Sailors specially enlisted from the Roman naval headquarters at Misenum and housed in the nearby Castra Misenatium were used to work the velarium br br The Colosseum s huge crowd capacity made it essential that the venue could be filled or evacuated quickly Its architects adopted solutions very similar to those used in modern stadia to deal with the same problem The amphitheatre was ringed by eighty entrances at ground level of which were used by ordinary spectators Each entrance and exit was numbered as was each staircase The northern main entrance was reserved for the Roman Emperor and his aides whilst the other three axial entrances were most likely used by the elite All four axial entrances were richly decorated with painted stucco reliefs of which fragments survive Many of the original outer entrances have disappeared with the collapse of the perimeter wall but entrances XXIII to LIIII survive br Spectators were given tickets in the form of numbered pottery shards which directed them to the appropriate section and row They accessed their seats via vomitoria singular vomitorium passageways that opened into a tier of seats from below or behind These quickly dispersed people into their seats and upon conclusion of the event or in an emergency evacuation could permit their exit within only a few minutes The name vomitoria derived from the Latin word for a rapid discharge from which English derives the word vomit br br br Interior seating br br According to the Codex Calendar of the Colosseum could accommodate people although modern estimates put the figure at around They were seated in a tiered arrangement that reflected the rigidly stratified nature of Roman society Special boxes were provided at the north and south ends respectively for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins providing the best views of the arena Flanking them at the same level was a broad platform or podium for the senatorial class who were allowed to bring their own chairs The names of some th century senators can still be seen carved into the stonework presumably reserving areas for their use br br The tier above the senators known as the maenianum primum was occupied by the non senatorial noble class or knights equites The next level up the maenianum secundum was originally reserved for ordinary Roman citizens plebeians and was divided into two sections The lower part the immum was for wealthy citizens while the upper part the summum was for poor citizens Specific sectors were provided for other social groups for instance boys with their tutors soldiers on leave foreign dignitaries scribes heralds priests and so on Stone and later marble seating was provided for the citizens and nobles who presumably would have brought their own cushions with them Inscriptions identified the areas reserved for specific groups br Another level the maenianum secundum in legneis was added at the very top of the building during the reign of Domitian This comprised a gallery for the common poor slaves and women It would have been either standing room only or would have had very steep wooden benches Some groups were banned altogether from the Colosseum notably gravediggers actors and former gladiators br Each tier was divided into sections maeniana by curved passages and low walls praecinctiones or baltei and were subdivided into cunei or wedges by the steps and aisles from the vomitoria Each row gradus of seats was numbered permitting each individual seat to be exactly designated by its gradus cuneus and number br br br Arena and hypogeum br br The arena itself was meters by meters ft by ft by Roman feet It comprised a wooden floor covered by sand the Latin word for sand is harena or arena covering an elaborate underground structure called the hypogeum literally meaning underground The hypogeum was not part of the original construction but was ordered to be built by Emperor Domitian Little now remains of the original arena floor but the hypogeum is still clearly visible It consisted of a two level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath larger hinged platforms called hegmata provided access for elephants and the like It was restructured on numerous occasions at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen br br The hypogeum was connected by tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables with the gladiators barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds br Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts it was possible to flood the arena rapidly presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct However the construction of the hypogeum at Domitian s behest put an end to the practise of flooding and thus also to naval battles early in the Colosseum s existence There is however wide debate over the practicality and logistics of this phenomenon which leads to speculation over its actuality This is mostly because there is no physical evidence of naumachiae at the Colosseum remains br br br Supporting buildings br The Colosseum and its activities supported a substantial industry in the area In addition to the amphitheatre itself many other buildings nearby were linked to the games Immediately to the east is the remains of the Ludus Magnus a training school for gladiators This was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passage to allow easy access for the gladiators The Ludus Magnus had its own miniature training arena which was itself a popular attraction for Roman spectators Other training schools were in the same area including the Ludus Matutinus Morning School where fighters of animals were trained plus the Dacian and Gallic Schools br Also nearby were the Armamentarium comprising an armory to store weapons the Summum Choragium where machinery was stored the Sanitarium which had facilities to treat wounded gladiators and the Spoliarium where bodies of dead gladiators were stripped of their armor and disposed of br Around the perimeter of the Colosseum at a distance of m ft from the perimeter was a series of tall stone posts with five remaining on the eastern side Various explanations have been advanced for their presence they may have been a religious boundary or an outer boundary for ticket checks or an anchor for the velarium or awning br br br Use br br The Colosseum was used to host gladiatorial shows as well as a variety of other events The shows called munera were always given by private individuals rather than the state They had a strong religious element but were also demonstrations of power and family prestige and were immensely popular Another major attraction was the animal hunt or venatio This utilized a great variety of wild beasts mainly imported from Africa and the Middle East and included creatures such as rhinoceros hippopotamuses elephants giraffes aurochs wisents Barbary lions panthers leopards bears Caspian tigers crocodiles and ostriches Battles and hunts were often staged amid elaborate sets with movable trees and buildings These events could be huge in scale Trajan is said to have celebrated his victories in Dacia in with contests involving animals and gladiators over the course of days During lunch intervals executions ad bestias would be staged Those condemned to death would be sent into the arena naked and unarmed to face the beasts of death which would literally tear them to pieces Acrobats and magicians would also perform usually during the intervals br During the early days of the Colosseum ancient writers recorded that the building was used for naumachiae more properly known as navalia proelia or simulated sea battles Accounts of the inaugural games held by Titus in AD describe it being filled with water for a display of specially trained swimming horses and bulls There is also an account of a re enactment of a famous sea battle between the Corcyrean Corfiot Greeks and the Corinthians This has been the subject of some debate among historians although providing the water would not have been a problem it is unclear how the arena could have been waterproofed nor would there have been enough space in the arena for the warships to move around It has been suggested that the reports either have the location wrong or that the Colosseum originally featured a wide floodable channel down its central axis which would later have been replaced by the hypogeum br Sylvae or recreations of natural scenes were also held in the arena Painters technicians and architects would construct a simulation of a forest with real trees and bushes planted in the arena s floor and animals would then be introduced Such scenes might be used simply to display a natural environment for the urban population or could otherwise be used as the backdrop for hunts or dramas depicting episodes from mythology They were also occasionally used for executions in which the hero of the story played by a condemned person was killed in one of various gruesome but mythologically authentic ways such as being mauled by beasts or burned to death br br br Modern use br br Beneath the Colosseum a network of subterranean passageways that were once used for transporting wild animals and gladiators to the arena opened to the public in summer br The Colosseum is also the site of Roman Catholic ceremonies in the th and st centuries For instance Pope Benedict XVI led the Stations of the Cross called the Scriptural Way of the Cross which calls for more meditation at the Colosseum on Good Fridays br br br Restoration br br In Diego Della Valle head of the shoe firm Tod s entered into an agreement with local officials to sponsor a million restoration of the Colosseum Work was planned to begin at the end of taking up to two and a half years Due to the controversial nature of using a public private partnership to fund the restoration work was delayed and began in The restoration is the first full cleaning and repair in the Colosseum s history The first stage is to clean and restore the Colosseum s arcaded fa ade and replace the metal enclosures that block the ground level arches After three years the work was completed on July when the Italian minister of culture Dario Franceschini also announced that the funds have been committed to replace the floors by the end of These will provide a stage that Franceschini says will be used for cultural events of the highest level The project also includes creating a services center and restoring the galleries and underground spaces inside the Colosseum Since November the top two levels have been opened for guided visits The fourth level held the marketplace and the top fifth tier is where the poorest citizens the plebeians gathered and watched the show bringing picnics for the day long event br br br Significance in Christianity br br The Colosseum is generally regarded by Christians as a site of the martyrdom of large numbers of believers during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire as evidenced by Church history and tradition On the other hand other scholars believe that the majority of martyrdoms may have occurred at other venues within the city of Rome rather than at the Colosseum citing a lack of still intact physical evidence or historical records These scholars assert that some Christians were executed as common criminals in the Colosseum their crime being refusal to reverence the Roman gods but most Christian martyrs of the early Church were executed for their faith at the Circus Maximus According to Irenaeus died about Ignatius of Antioch was fed to the lions in Rome around A D and although Irenaeus says nothing about this happening at the Colosseum tradition ascribes it to that place br In the Middle Ages the Colosseum was not regarded as a monument and was used as what some modern sources label a quarry which is to say that stones from the Colosseum were taken for the building of other sacred sites This fact is used to support the idea that at a time when sites associated with martyrs were highly venerated the Colosseum was not being treated as a sacred site It was not included in the itineraries compiled for the use of pilgrims nor in works such as the th century Mirabilia Urbis Romae Marvels of the City of Rome which claims the Circus Flaminius but not the Colosseum as the site of martyrdoms Part of the structure was inhabited by a Christian religious order but it is not known whether this was for any particular religious reason br Pope Pius V is said to have recommended that pilgrims gather sand from the arena of the Colosseum to serve as a relic on the grounds that it was impregnated with the blood of martyrs although some of his contemporaries did not share his conviction A century later Fioravante Martinelli listed the Colosseum at the head of a list of places sacred to the martyrs in his book Roma ex ethnica sacra Martinelli s book evidently had an effect on public opinion in response to Cardinal Altieri s proposal some years later to turn the Colosseum into a bullring Carlo Tomassi published a pamphlet in protest against what he regarded as an act of desecration The ensuing controversy persuaded Pope Clement X to close the Colosseum s external arcades and declare it a sanctuary br br At the insistence of St Leonard of Port Maurice Pope Benedict XIV forbade the quarrying of the Colosseum and erected Stations of the Cross around the arena which remained until February Benedict Joseph Labre spent the later years of his life within the walls of the Colosseum living on alms before he died in Several th century popes funded repair and restoration work on the Colosseum and it still retains its Christian connection today A Christian cross stands in the Colosseum with a plaque stating br br The amphitheater one consecrated to triumphs entertainments and the impious worship of pagan gods is now dedicated to the sufferings of the martyrs purified from impious superstitions br Other Christian crosses stand in several points around the arena and every Good Friday the Pope leads a Via Crucis procession to the amphitheater br br br Flora br br The Colosseum has a wide and well documented history of flora ever since Domenico Panaroli made the first catalogue of its plants in Since then species have been identified there The peak was in species Attempts were made in to eradicate the vegetation because of concerns over the damage that was being caused to the masonry but much of it has returned Two hundred forty two species have been counted today and of the species first identified by Panaroli remain br The variation of plants can be explained by the change of climate in Rome through the centuries Additionally bird migration flower blooming and the growth of Rome that caused the Colosseum to become embedded within the modern city centre rather than on the outskirts of the ancient city as well as deliberate transport of species are also contributing causes Another reason often given is their seeds being unwittingly transported either on the fur or in the feces of animals brought there from all corners of the empire br br br In popular culture br The Colosseum has appeared in numerous films artworks and games It is featured in films such as Roman Holiday Gladiator The Way of the Dragon Jumper and Godzilla x Kong The New Empire br Several architectural works have also been modelled on or inspired by the Colosseum These include br br The Kongresshalle or Congress Hall unfinished at the Nazi Party Rally grounds Nuremberg Germany br The Summer Olympic Games medal from to designed by Giuseppe Cassioli features a depiction of the Colosseum At the Summer Olympics in Athens the Colosseum was replaced by a depiction of the Panathinaiko
