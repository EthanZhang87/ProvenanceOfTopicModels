The wildcat is a species complex comprising two small wild cat species the European wildcat Felis silvestris and the African wildcat F lybica The European wildcat inhabits forests in Europe Anatolia and the Caucasus while the African wildcat inhabits semi arid landscapes and steppes in Africa the Arabian Peninsula Central Asia into western India and western China br The wildcat species differ in fur pattern tail and size the European wildcat has long fur and a bushy tail with a rounded tip the smaller African wildcat is more faintly striped has short sandy gray fur and a tapering tail the Asiatic wildcat F lybica ornata is spotted br The wildcat and the other members of the cat family had a common ancestor about million years ago The European wildcat evolved during the Cromerian Stage about to years ago its direct ancestor was Felis lunensis The silvestris and lybica lineages probably diverged about years ago br The wildcat is categorized as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since since it is widely distributed in a stable global population exceeding mature individuals Some local populations are threatened by introgressive hybridisation with the domestic cat F catus contagious disease vehicle collisions and persecution br The association of African wildcats and humans appears to have developed along with the establishment of settlements during the Neolithic Revolution when rodents in grain stores of early farmers attracted wildcats This association ultimately led to it being tamed and domesticated the domestic cat is the direct descendant of the African wildcat It was one of the revered cats in ancient Egypt The European wildcat has been the subject of mythology and literature br br br Taxonomy br Felis catus silvestris was the scientific name used in by Johann von Schreber when he described the European wildcat based on descriptions and names proposed by earlier naturalists such as Mathurin Jacques Brisson Ulisse Aldrovandi and Conrad Gessner br Felis lybica was the name proposed in by Georg Forster who described an African wildcat from Gafsa on the Barbary Coast br In subsequent decades several naturalists and explorers described wildcat specimens collected in European African and Asian range countries In the s the taxonomist Reginald Innes Pocock reviewed the collection of wildcat skins and skulls in the Natural History Museum London and designated seven F silvestris subspecies from Europe to Asia Minor and F lybica subspecies from Africa and West to Central Asia Pocock differentiated the br br Forest wildcat subspecies silvestris group br Steppe wildcat subspecies ornata caudata group is distinguished from the forest wildcat by being smaller with comparatively lighter fur colour and longer and more sharply pointed tails The domestic cat is thought to have derived from this group br Bush wildcat subspecies ornata lybica group is distinguished from the steppe wildcat by paler fur well developed spot patterns and bands br In subspecies were recognized by the authors of Mammal Species of the World who allocated subspecies largely in line with Pocock s assessment br In the Cat Classification Task Force revised the taxonomy of the Felidae and recognized the following as valid taxa br br br Evolution br The wildcat is a member of the Felidae a family that had a common ancestor about million years ago Felis species diverged from the Felidae around million years ago The European wildcat diverged from Felis about to million years ago br The European wildcat s direct ancestor was Felis lunensis which lived in Europe in the late Pliocene and Villafranchian periods Fossil remains indicate that the transition from lunensis to silvestris was completed by the Holstein interglacial about to years ago br Craniological differences between the European and African wildcats indicate that the wildcat probably migrated during the Late Pleistocene from Europe into the Middle East giving rise to the steppe wildcat phenotype br Phylogenetic research revealed that the lybica lineage probably diverged from the silvestris lineage about years ago br br br Characteristics br br The wildcat has pointed ears which are moderate in length and broad at the base br Its whiskers are white number to on each side and reach cm in in length on the muzzle Whiskers are also present on the inner surface of the paw and measure cm in br Its eyes are large with vertical pupils and yellowish green irises The eyelashes range from cm in in length and can number six to eight per side br The European wildcat has a greater skull volume than the domestic cat a ratio known as Schauenberg s index Further its skull is more spherical in shape than that of the jungle cat F chaus and leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis Its dentition is relatively smaller and weaker than the jungle cat s br Both wildcat species are larger than the domestic cat The European wildcat has relatively longer legs and a more robust build compared to the domestic cat The tail is long and usually slightly exceeds one half of the animal s body length The species size varies according to Bergmann s rule with the largest specimens occurring in cool northern areas of Europe and Asia such as Mongolia Manchuria and Siberia Males measure cm in in head to body length cm in in tail length and normally weigh kg lb Females are slightly smaller measuring cm in in body length and cm in in tail length and weighing kg lb br Both sexes have two thoracic and two abdominal teats Both sexes have pre anal glands consisting of moderately sized sweat and sebaceous glands around the anal opening Large sized sebaceous and scent glands extend along the full length of the tail on the dorsal side Male wildcats have pre anal pockets on the tail activated upon reaching sexual maturity play a significant role in reproduction and territorial marking br br br Distribution and habitat br br The European wildcat inhabits temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in Europe Turkey and the Caucasus In the Iberian peninsula it occurs from sea level to m ft in the Pyrenees Between the late th and mid th centuries its European range became fragmented due to large scale hunting and regional extirpation It is possibly extinct in the Czech Republic and considered regionally extinct in Austria though vagrants from Italy are spreading into Austria It has never inhabited Fennoscandia or Estonia Sicily is the only island in the Mediterranean Sea with a native wildcat population br br The African wildcat lives in a wide range of habitats except rainforest but throughout the savannahs of Africa from Mauritania on the Atlantic coast eastward to the Horn of Africa up to altitudes of m ft Small populations live in the Sahara and Nubian Deserts Karoo region Kalahari and Namib Deserts It occurs around the Arabian Peninsula s periphery to the Caspian Sea encompassing Mesopotamia Israel and Palestine region In Central Asia it ranges into Xinjiang and southern Mongolia and in South Asia into the Thar Desert and arid regions in India br br br Behaviour and ecology br Both wildcat species are largely nocturnal and solitary except during the breeding period and when females have young The size of home ranges of females and males varies according to terrain the availability of food habitat quality and the age structure of the population Male and female home ranges overlap though core areas within territories are avoided by other cats Females tend to be more sedentary than males as they require an exclusive hunting area when raising kittens Wildcats usually spend the day in a hollow tree a rock crevice or in dense thickets br It is also reported to shelter in abandoned burrows of other species such as of red fox Vulpes vulpes and in European badger Meles meles setts in Europe and of fennec Vulpes zerda in Africa br When threatened it retreats into a burrow rather than climb trees When taking residence in a tree hollow it selects one low to the ground Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird feathers Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough sawdust to make lining unnecessary If the den becomes infested with fleas the wildcat shifts to another den During winter when snowfall prevents the European wildcat from travelling long distances it remains within its den until travel conditions improve br Territorial marking consists of spraying urine on trees vegetation and rocks depositing faeces in conspicuous places and leaving scent marks through glands in its paws It also leaves visual marks by scratching trees br br br Hunting and prey br br Sight and hearing are the wildcat s primary senses when hunting br It lies in wait for prey then catches it by executing a few leaps which can span three metres When hunting near water courses it waits on trees overhanging the water It kills small prey by grabbing it in its claws and piercing the neck or occiput with its fangs When attacking large prey it leaps upon the animal s back and attempts to bite the neck or carotid It does not persist in attacking if prey manages to escape br The European wildcat primarily preys on small mammals such as European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and rodents br It also preys on dormice hares nutria Myocastor coypus and birds especially ducks and other waterfowl galliformes pigeons and passerines It can consume large bone fragments Although it kills insectivores such as moles and shrews it rarely eats them When living close to human settlements it preys on poultry In the wild it consumes up to g oz of food daily br The African wildcat preys foremost on murids to a lesser extent also on birds small reptiles and invertebrates br br br Reproduction and development br br The wildcat has two estrus periods one in December February and another in May July Estrus lasts days with a gestation period lasting days Ovulation is induced through copulation Spermatogenesis occurs throughout the year During the mating season males fight viciously and may congregate around a single female There are records of male and female wildcats becoming temporarily monogamous Kittens are usually born between April and May and up to August Litter size ranges from kittens br Kittens are born with closed eyes and are covered in a fuzzy coat They weigh g oz at birth and kittens under g oz usually do not survive They are born with pink paw pads which blacken at the age of three months and blue eyes which turn amber after five months Their eyes open after days and their incisors erupt after days The kittens milk teeth are replaced by their permanent dentition at the age of days The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of days and start moving independently after days Lactation lasts months though the kittens eat meat as early as months of age Sexual maturity is attained at the age of days Similarly to the domestic cat the physical development of African wildcat kittens over the first two weeks of their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats The kittens are largely fully grown by months though skeletal growth continues for over months The family dissolves after roughly five months and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories Their maximum life span is years though they usually live up to years br Generation length of the wildcat is about eight years br br br Predators and competitors br Because of its habit of living in areas with rocks and tall trees for refuge dense thickets and abandoned burrows wildcats have few natural predators In Central Europe many kittens are killed by European pine marten Martes martes and there is at least one account of an adult wildcat being killed and eaten Competitors include the golden jackal Canis aureus red fox marten and other predators In the steppe regions of Europe and Asia village dogs constitute serious enemies of wildcats along with the much larger Eurasian lynx one of the rare habitual predators of healthy adult wildcats In Tajikistan the grey wolf Canis lupus is the most serious competitor having been observed to destroy cat burrows Birds of prey including Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo and saker falcon Falco cherrug have been recorded to kill wildcat kittens Golden eagle Aquila chrysaetos are known to hunt both adults and kittens Seton Gordon recorded an instance where a wildcat fought a golden eagle resulting in the deaths of both combatants br In Africa wildcats are occasionally killed and eaten by Central African rock python Python sebae and martial eagle Polemaetus bellicosus br br br Threats br br Wildcat populations are foremost threatened by hybridization with the domestic cat Mortality due to traffic accidents is a threat especially in Europe The wildcat population in Scotland has declined since the turn of the th century due to habitat loss and persecution by landowners br In the former Soviet Union wildcats were caught accidentally in traps set for European pine marten In modern times they are caught in unbaited traps on pathways or at abandoned trails of red fox European badger European hare or pheasant One method of catching wildcats consists of using a modified muskrat trap with a spring placed in a concealed pit A scent trail of pheasant viscera leads the cat to the pit Wildcat skins were of little commercial value and sometimes converted into imitation sealskin the fur usually fetched between and kopecks br Wildcat skins were almost solely used for making cheap scarfs muffs and coats for ladies br br br Conservation br Wildcat species are protected in most range countries and listed in CITES Appendix II The European wildcat is also listed in Appendix II of the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and in the European Union s Habitats and Species Directive br Conservation Action Plans have been developed in Germany and Scotland br br br In culture br br br Domestication br br An African wildcat skeleton excavated in a year old Neolithic grave in Cyprus is the earliest known indication for a close relationship between a human and a possibly tamed cat As no cat species is native to Cyprus this discovery indicates that Neolithic farmers may have brought cats to Cyprus from the Near East Results of genetics and morphological research corroborated that the African wildcat is the ancestor of the domestic cat The first individuals were probably domesticated in the Fertile Crescent around the time of the introduction of agriculture Murals and statuettes depicting cats as well mummified cats indicate that it was commonly kept by ancient Egyptians since at least the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt br br br In mythology br Celtic fables of the Cat S th a fairy creature described as resembling a large white chested black cat are thought to have been inspired by the Kellas cat itself thought to be a free ranging crossbreed between a European wildcat and a domestic cat In William Salmon mentioned how body parts of the wildcat were used for medicinal purposes its flesh for treating gout its fat for dissolving tumours and easing pain its blood for curing falling sickness and its excrement for treating baldness br br br In heraldry br br The Picts venerated wildcats having probably named Caithness Land of the Cats after them According to the foundation myth of the Catti tribe their ancestors were attacked by wildcats upon landing in Scotland Their ferocity impressed the Catti so much that the wildcat became their symbol The progenitors of Clan Sutherland use the wildcat as symbol on their family crest The clan s chief bears the title Morair Chat Great Man of the Cats br The wildcat is considered an icon of Scottish wilderness and has been used in clan heraldry since the th century The Clan Chattan Association also known as the Clan of Cats comprises clans the majority of which display the wildcat on their badges br br br In literature br Shakespeare referenced the wildcat three times br br The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder br Snail slow in profit and he sleeps by day br More than the wild cat br br Thou must be married to no man but me br For I am he am born to tame you Kate br And bring you from a wild cat to a Kate br Comfortable as other household Kates br
