Babylonia Akkadian m t Akkad was an ancient Akkadian speaking state and cultural area based in the city of Babylon in central southern Mesopotamia present day Iraq and parts of Syria and Iran It emerged as an Akkadian populated but Amorite ruled state c BC During the reign of Hammurabi and afterwards Babylonia was retrospectively called the country of Akkad m t Akkad in Akkadian a deliberate archaism in reference to the previous glory of the Akkadian Empire It was often involved in rivalry with the older ethno linguistically related state of Assyria in the north of Mesopotamia and Elam to the east in Ancient Iran Babylonia briefly became the major power in the region after Hammurabi fl c BC middle chronology or c BC short chronology created a short lived empire succeeding the earlier Akkadian Empire Third Dynasty of Ur and Old Assyrian Empire The Babylonian Empire rapidly fell apart after the death of Hammurabi and reverted to a small kingdom centered around the city of Babylon br Like Assyria the Babylonian state retained the written Akkadian language the language of its native populace for official use despite its Northwest Semitic speaking Amorite founders and Kassite successors who spoke a language isolate not being native Mesopotamians It retained the Sumerian language for religious use as did Assyria which also shared the same Mesopotamian religion as Babylonia but already by the time Babylon was founded this was no longer a spoken language having been wholly subsumed by Akkadian The earlier Akkadian and Sumerian traditions played a major role in the descendant Babylonian and Assyrian culture and the region would remain an important cultural center even under its protracted periods of outside rule br br br History br br br Pre Babylonian Sumero Akkadian period br Mesopotamia had already enjoyed a long history before the emergence of Babylon with Sumerian civilization emerging in the region c BC and the Akkadian speakers who would go on to form Akkad Assyria and Babylonia appearing somewhere between the th and th century BC br During the rd millennium BC an intimate cultural symbiosis occurred between Sumerian and Akkadian speakers which included widespread bilingualism The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian and vice versa is evident in all areas from lexical borrowing on a massive scale to syntactic morphological and phonological convergence This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund br Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the third and the second millennium BC the precise timeframe being a matter of debate From c BC until the rise of the Akkadian Empire in the th century BC Mesopotamia had been dominated by largely Sumerian cities and city states such as Ur Lagash Uruk Kish Isin Larsa Adab Eridu Gasur Assur Hamazi Akshak Arbela and Umma although Semitic Akkadian names began to appear on the king lists of some of these states such as Eshnunna and Assyria between the th and th centuries BC Traditionally the major religious center of all Mesopotamia was the city of Nippur where the god Enlil was supreme and it would remain so until replaced by Babylon during the reign of Hammurabi in the mid th century BC The Akkadian Empire BC saw the Akkadian Semites and Sumerians of Mesopotamia unite under one rule and the Akkadians fully attain ascendancy over the Sumerians and indeed come to dominate much of the ancient Near East The empire eventually disintegrated due to economic decline climate change and civil war followed by attacks by the language isolate speaking Gutians from the Zagros Mountains to the northeast Sumer rose up again with the Third Dynasty of Ur Neo Sumerian Empire in the late nd century BC and ejected the Gutians from southern Mesopotamia in BC as suggested by surviving tablets and astronomy simulations They also seem to have gained ascendancy over much of the territory of the Akkadian speaking kings of Assyria in northern Mesopotamia for a time br Followed by the collapse of the Sumerian Ur III dynasty at the hands of the Elamites in BC the Amorites Westerners a foreign Northwest Semitic speaking people began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia from the northern Levant gradually gaining control over most of southern Mesopotamia where they formed a series of small kingdoms while the Assyrians reasserted their independence in the north The states of the south were unable to stem the Amorite advance and for a time may have relied on their fellow Akkadians in Assyria for protection br King Ilu shuma c BC of the Old Assyrian period BC in a known inscription describes his exploits to the south as follows br br The freedom of the Akkadians and their children I established I purified their copper I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur Awal and Kish Der of the goddess Ishtar as far as the City of Ashur Past scholars originally extrapolated from this text that it means he defeated the invading Amorites to the south and Elamites to the east but there is no explicit record of that and some scholars believe the Assyrian kings were merely giving preferential trade agreements to the south br These policies whether military economic or both were continued by his successors Erishum I and Ikunum br However when Sargon I BC succeeded as king in Assyria in BC he eventually withdrew Assyria from the region preferring to concentrate on continuing the vigorous expansion of Assyrian colonies in Anatolia at the expense of the Hurrians and Hattians and the Amorite inhabited Levant and eventually southern Mesopotamia fell to the Amorites During the first centuries of what is called the Amorite period the most powerful city states in the south were Isin Eshnunna and Larsa together with Assyria in the north br br br First Babylonian dynasty Amorite dynasty BC br br Around BC an Amorite chieftain named Sumu abum appropriated a tract of land which included the then relatively small city of Babylon from the neighbouring minor city state of Kazallu of which it had initially been a territory turning his newly acquired lands into a state in its own right His reign was concerned with establishing statehood amongst a sea of other minor city states and kingdoms in the region However Sumu abum appears never to have bothered to give himself the title of King of Babylon suggesting that Babylon itself was still only a minor town or city and not worthy of kingship br He was followed by Sumu la El Sabium and Apil Sin each of whom ruled in the same vague manner as Sumu abum with no reference to kingship of Babylon itself being made in any written records of the time Sin Muballit was the first of these Amorite rulers to be regarded officially as a king of Babylon and then on only one single clay tablet Under these kings Babylonia remained a small nation which controlled very little territory and was overshadowed by neighbouring kingdoms that were both older larger and more powerful such as Isin Larsa Assyria to the north and Elam to the east in ancient Iran The Elamites occupied huge swathes of southern Mesopotamia and the early Amorite rulers were largely held in vassalage to Elam br br br Empire of Hammurabi br Babylon remained a minor town in a small state until the reign of its sixth Amorite ruler Hammurabi during BC or c BC in the short chronology He conducted major building work in Babylon expanding it from a small town into a great city worthy of kingship A very efficient ruler he established a bureaucracy with taxation and centralized government Hammurabi freed Babylon from Elamite dominance and indeed drove the Elamites from southern Mesopotamia entirely invading Elam itself He then systematically conquered southern Mesopotamia including the cities of Isin Larsa Eshnunna Kish Lagash Nippur Borsippa Ur Uruk Umma Adab Sippar Rapiqum and Eridu His conquests gave the region stability after turbulent times and coalesced the patchwork of small states into a single nation it is only from the time of Hammurabi that southern Mesopotamia acquired the name Babylonia br Hammurabi turned his disciplined armies eastwards and invaded the region which a thousand years later became Iran conquering Elam Gutium Lullubi Turukku and Kassites To the west he conquered the Amorite states of the Levant modern Syria and Jordan including the powerful kingdoms of Mari and Yamhad br Hammurabi then entered into a protracted war with the Old Assyrian Empire for control of Mesopotamia and dominance of the Near East Assyria had extended control over much of the Hurrian and Hattian parts of southeast Anatolia from the st century BC and from the latter part of the th century BC had asserted itself over the northeast Levant and central Mesopotamia After a protracted struggle over decades with the powerful Assyrian kings Shamshi Adad I and Ishme Dagan I Hammurabi forced their successor Mut Ashkur to pay tribute to Babylon c BC giving Babylonia control over Assyria s centuries old Hattian and Hurrian colonies in Anatolia br One of Hammurabi s most important and lasting works was the compilation of the Babylonian law code which improved the much earlier codes of Sumer Akkad and Assyria This was made by order of Hammurabi after the expulsion of the Elamites and the settlement of his kingdom In a copy of the Code of Hammurabi was discovered on a stele by Jacques de Morgan and Jean Vincent Scheil at Susa in Elam where it had later been taken as plunder That copy is now in the Louvre br From before BC until the reign of Hammurabi the major cultural and religious center of southern Mesopotamia had been the ancient city of Nippur where the god Enlil was supreme Hammurabi transferred this dominance to Babylon making Marduk supreme in the pantheon of southern Mesopotamia with the god Ashur and to some degree Ishtar remaining the long dominant deity in northern Mesopotamian Assyria The city of Babylon became known as a holy city where any legitimate ruler of southern Mesopotamia had to be crowned and the city was also revered by Assyria for these religious reasons Hammurabi turned what had previously been a minor administrative town into a large powerful and influential city extended its rule over the entirety of southern Mesopotamia and erected a number of buildings br The Amorite ruled Babylonians like their predecessor states engaged in regular trade with the Amorite and Canaanite city states to the west with Babylonian officials or troops sometimes passing to the Levant and Canaan and Amorite merchants operating freely throughout Mesopotamia The Babylonian monarchy s western connections remained strong for quite some time Ammi Ditana great grandson of Hammurabi still titled himself king of the land of the Amorites Ammi Ditana s father and son also bore Amorite names Abi Eshuh and Ammi Saduqa br br br Decline br br Southern Mesopotamia had no natural defensible boundaries making it vulnerable to attack After the death of Hammurabi his empire began to disintegrate rapidly Under his successor Samsu iluna BC the far south of Mesopotamia was lost to a native Akkadian speaking king Ilum ma ili who ejected the Amorite ruled Babylonians The south became the native Sealand Dynasty remaining free of Babylon for the next years br Both the Babylonians and their Amorite rulers were driven from Assyria to the north by an Assyrian Akkadian governor named Puzur Sin c BC who regarded king Mut Ashkur as both a foreign Amorite and a former lackey of Babylon After six years of civil war in Assyria a native king named Adasi seized power c BC and went on to appropriate former Babylonian and Amorite territory in central Mesopotamia as did his successor Bel bani br Amorite rule survived in a much reduced Babylon Samshu iluna s successor Abi Eshuh made a vain attempt to recapture the Sealand Dynasty for Babylon but met defeat at the hands of king Damqi ilishu II By the end of his reign Babylonia had shrunk to the small and relatively weak nation it had been upon its foundation although the city itself was far larger and opulent than the small town it had been prior to the rise of Hammurabi br He was followed by Ammi Ditana and then Ammi Saduqa both of whom were in too weak a position to make any attempt to regain the many territories lost after the death of Hammurabi contenting themselves with peaceful building projects in Babylon itself br Samsu Ditana was to be the last Amorite ruler of Babylon Early in his reign he came under pressure from the Kassites a people speaking an apparent language isolate originating in the mountains of what is today northwest Iran Babylon was then attacked by the Indo European speaking Anatolia based Hittites in BC Shamshu Ditana was overthrown following the sack of Babylon by the Hittite king Mursili I The Hittites did not remain for long but the destruction wrought by them finally enabled their Kassite allies to gain control br br br The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology br The date of the sack of Babylon by the Hittites under king Mursili I is considered crucial to the various calculations of the early chronology of the ancient Near East as it is taken as a fixed point in the discussion Suggestions for its precise date vary by as much as years corresponding to the uncertainty regarding the length of the Dark Age of the much later Late Bronze Age collapse resulting in the shift of the entire Bronze Age chronology of Mesopotamia with regard to the Egyptian chronology Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are br br ultra short chronology BC br short chronology BC br middle chronology BC probably the most commonly used and often seen as having the most support br long chronology BC favored by some astronomical events reconstruction br ultra long chronology BC br Mursili I the Hittite king first conquered Aleppo capital of Yamhad kingdom to avenge the death of his father but his main geopolitical target was Babylon The Mesopotamian Chronicle written after BC mentions briefly the sack of Babylon as During the time of Samsu ditana the Hittites marched on Akkad More details can be found in another source the Telepinu Proclamation a Hittite text from around BC which states br br And then he Mursili I marched to Aleppo and he destroyed Aleppo and brought captives and possessions of Aleppo to attu a Then however he marched to Babylon and he destroyed Babylon and he defeated the Hurrian troops and he brought captives and possessions of Babylon to attu a br The movement of Mursili s troops was around km from the conquered Aleppo to reach the Euphrates located to the east skirting around Assyria and then to the south along the course of the river to reach finally Babylon His conquest of Babylon brought to an end the dynasty of Hammurabi and although the Hittite text Telipinu Proclamation does not mention Samsu ditana and the Babylonian Chronicle does not mention a specific Hittite king either Trevor Bryce concludes that there is no doubt that both sources refer to Mursili I and Samsu ditana br The Hittites when sacking Babylon removed the images of the gods Marduk and his consort Zarpanitu from the Esagil temple and they took them to their kingdom The later inscription of Agum kakrime the Kassite king claims he returned the images and another later text the Marduk Prophesy written long after the events mentions that the image of Marduk was in exile around twenty four years br After the conquest Mursili I did not attempt to convert the whole region he had occupied from Aleppo to Babylon as a part of his kingdom he instead made an alliance with the Kassites and then a Kassite dynasty was established in Babylonia br br br Kassite dynasty BC br br The Kassite dynasty was founded by Gandash of Mari The Kassites like the Amorite rulers who had preceded them were not originally native to Mesopotamia Rather they had first appeared in the Zagros Mountains of what is today northwestern Iran br The ethnic affiliation of the Kassites is unclear Still their language was not Semitic or Indo European and is thought to have been either a language isolate or possibly related to the Hurro Urartian language family of Anatolia although the evidence for its genetic affiliation is meager due to the scarcity of extant texts That said several Kassite leaders may have borne Indo European names and they may have had an Indo European elite similar to the Mitanni elite that later ruled over the Hurrians of central and eastern Anatolia while others had Semitic names br The Kassites renamed Babylon Kardunia and their rule lasted for years the longest dynasty in Babylonian history br This new foreign dominion offers a striking analogy to the roughly contemporary rule of the Semitic Hyksos in ancient Egypt Most divine attributes ascribed to the Amorite kings of Babylonia disappeared at this time the title god was never given to a Kassite sovereign Babylon continued to be the capital of the kingdom and one of the holy cities of western Asia where the priests of the ancient Mesopotamian religion were all powerful and the only place where the right to inheritance of the short lived old Babylonian empire could be conferred br Babylonia experienced short periods of relative power but in general proved to be relatively weak under the long rule of the Kassites and spent long periods under Assyrian and Elamite domination and interference br It is not clear precisely when Kassite rule of Babylon began but the Indo European Hittites from Anatolia did not remain in Babylonia for long after the sacking of the city and it is likely the Kassites moved in soon afterwards Agum II took the throne for the Kassites in BC and ruled a state that extended from Iran to the middle Euphrates The new king retained peaceful relations with Erishum III the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria but successfully went to war with the Hittite Empire and twenty four years after the Hittites took the sacred statue of Marduk he recovered it and declared the god equal to the Kassite deity Shuqamuna br br Burnaburiash I succeeded him and drew up a peace treaty with the Assyrian king Puzur Ashur III and had a largely uneventful reign as did his successor Kashtiliash III br The Sealand Dynasty of southern Mesopotamia remained independent of Babylonia and like Assyria was in native Akkadian speaking hands Ulamburiash managed to attack it and conquered parts of the land from Ea gamil a king with a distinctly Sumerian name around BC whereupon Ea Gamil fled to his allies in Elam The Sealand Dynasty region still remained independent and the Kassite king seems to have been unable to finally conquer it Ulamburiash began making treaties with ancient Egypt which then was ruling southern Canaan and Assyria to the north Agum III also campaigned against the Sealand Dynasty finally wholly conquering the far south of Mesopotamia for Babylon destroying its capital Dur Enlil in the process From there Agum III extended farther south still invading what was many centuries later to be called the Arabian Peninsula or Arabia and conquering the pre Arab state of Dilmun in modern Bahrain br Karaindash built a bas relief temple in Uruk and Kurigalzu I BC built a new capital Dur Kurigalzu named after himself transferring administrative rule from Babylon Both of these kings continued to struggle unsuccessfully against the Sealand Dynasty Karaindash also strengthened diplomatic ties with the Assyrian king Ashur bel nisheshu and the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and protected Babylonian borders with Elam br Kada man arbe I succeeded Karaindash and briefly invaded Elam before being eventually defeated and ejected by its king Tepti Ahar He then had to contend with the Suteans ancient Semitic speaking peoples from the southeastern Levant who invaded Babylonia and sacked Uruk He describes having annihilated their extensive forces then constructed fortresses in a mountain region called i i in the desert to the west modern Syria as security outposts and he dug wells and settled people on fertile lands to strengthen the guard br Kurigalzu I succeeded the throne and soon came into conflict with Elam to the east When ur batila the successor of Tepti Ahar took the throne of Elam he began raiding the Babylonia taunting Kurigalzu to do battle with him at D r ulgi Kurigalzu launched a campaign which resulted in the abject defeat and capture of ur batila who appears in no other inscriptions He went on to conquer the eastern lands of Elam This took his army to the Elamite capital the city of Susa which was sacked After this a puppet ruler was placed on the Elamite throne subject to Babylonia Kurigalzu I maintained friendly relations with Assyria Egypt and the Hittites throughout his reign Kadashman Enlil I BC succeeded him and continued his diplomatic policies br Burna Buriash II ascended to the throne in BC he retained friendly relations with Egypt but the resurgent Middle Assyrian Empire BC to the north was now encroaching into northern Babylonia and as a symbol of peace the Babylonian king took the daughter of the powerful Assyrian king Ashur uballit I in marriage He also maintained friendly relations with Suppiluliuma I ruler of the Hittite Empire br He was succeeded by Kara arda who was half Assyrian and the grandson of the Assyrian king in BC a usurper named Nazi Buga deposed him enraging Ashur uballit I who invaded and sacked Babylon slew Nazi Buga annexed Babylonian territory for the Middle Assyrian Empire and installed Kurigalzu II BC as his vassal ruler of Babylonia br br Soon after Arik den ili succeeded the throne of Assyria in BC Kurigalzu II attacked Assyria in an attempt to reassert Babylonian power After some impressive initial successes he was ultimately defeated and lost yet more territory to Assyria Between BC and BC his successors such as Nazi Maruttash Kadashman Turgu Kadashman Enlil II Kudur Enlil and Shagarakti Shuriash allied with the empires of the Hittites and the Mitanni who were both also losing swathes of territory to the resurgent Assyrians in a failed attempt to stop Assyrian expansion This expansion nevertheless continued unchecked br Kashtiliash IV s BC reign ended catastrophically as the Assyrian king Tukulti Ninurta I BC routed his armies sacked and burned Babylon and set himself up as king ironically becoming the first native Mesopotamian to rule the Mesopotamian populated state its previous rulers having all been non Mesopotamian Amorites and Kassites Kashtiliash himself was taken to Ashur as a prisoner of war br An Assyrian governor king named Enlil nadin shumi was placed on the throne to rule as viceroy to Tukulti Ninurta I and Kadashman Harbe II and Adad shuma iddina succeeded as Assyrian governor kings also subject to Tukulti Ninurta I until BC br Babylon did not begin to recover until late in the reign of Adad shuma usur BC as he too remained a vassal of Assyria until BC However he was able to prevent the Assyrian king Enlil kudurri usur from retaking Babylonia which apart from its northern reaches had mostly shrugged off Assyrian domination during a short period of civil war in the Assyrian empire in the years after the death of Tukulti Ninurta br Meli Shipak II BC seems to have had a peaceful reign Despite not being able to regain northern Babylonia from Assyria no further territory was lost Elam did not threaten and the Late Bronze Age collapse now affecting the Levant Canaan Egypt the Caucasus Anatolia Mediterranean North Africa northern Iran and Balkans seemed initially to have little impact on Babylonia or indeed Assyria and Elam br War resumed under subsequent kings such as Marduk apla iddina I BC and Zababa shuma iddin BC The long reigning Assyrian king Ashur dan I BC resumed expansionist policies and conquered further parts of northern Babylonia from both kings and the Elamite ruler Shutruk Nakhunte eventually conquered most of eastern Babylonia Enlil nadin ahhe BC was finally overthrown and the Kassite dynasty ended after Ashur dan I conquered yet more of northern and central Babylonia and the equally powerful Shutruk Nahhunte pushed deep into the heart of Babylonia itself sacking the city and slaying the king Poetical works have been found lamenting this disaster br Despite the loss of territory general military weakness and evident reduction in literacy and culture the Kassite dynasty was the longest lived dynasty of Babylon lasting until BC when Babylon was conquered by Shutruk Nakhunte of Elam and reconquered a few years later by the Nebuchadnezzar I part of the larger Late Bronze Age collapse br br br Early Iron Age Native rule second dynasty of Isin BC br The Elamites did not remain in control of Babylonia long instead entering into an ultimately unsuccessful war with Assyria allowing Marduk kabit ahheshu BC to establish the Dynasty IV of Babylon from Isin with the first native Akkadian speaking south Mesopotamian dynasty to rule Babylonia with Marduk kabit ahheshu becoming only the second native Mesopotamian to sit on the throne of Babylon after the Assyrian king Tukulti Ninurta I His dynasty was to remain in power for some years The new king successfully drove out the Elamites and prevented any possible Kassite revival Later in his reign he went to war with Assyria and had some initial success briefly capturing the south Assyrian city of Ekallatum before ultimately suffering defeat at the hands of Ashur Dan I br Itti Marduk balatu succeeded his father in BC and successfully repelled Elamite attacks on Babylonia during his year reign He too made attempts to attack Assyria but also met with failure at the hands of the still reigning Ashur Dan I br Ninurta nadin shumi took the throne in BC and also attempted an invasion of Assyria his armies seem to have skirted through eastern Aramea modern Syria and then made an attempt to attack the Assyrian city of Arbela modern Erbil from the west However this bold move met with defeat at the hands of Ashur resh ishi I who then forced a treaty in his favour upon the Babylonian king br Nebuchadnezzar I BC was the most famous ruler of this dynasty He fought and defeated the Elamites and drove them from Babylonian territory invading Elam itself sacking the Elamite capital Susa and recovering the sacred statue of Marduk that had been carried off from Babylon during the fall of the Kassites Shortly afterwards the king of Elam was assassinated and his kingdom disintegrated into civil war However Nebuchadnezzar failed to extend Babylonian territory further being defeated a number of times by Ashur resh ishi I BC king of the Middle Assyrian Empire for control of formerly Hittite controlled territories in Aram and Anatolia The Hittite Empire of the northern and western Levant and eastern Anatolia had been largely annexed by the Middle Assyrian Empire and its heartland finally overrun by invading Phrygians from the Balkans In the later years of his reign Nebuchadnezzar I devoted himself to peaceful building projects and securing Babylonia s borders against the Assyrians Elamites and Arameans br Nebuchadnezzar was succeeded by his two sons firstly Enlil nadin apli BC who lost territory to Assyria The second of them Marduk nadin ahhe BC also went to war with Assyria Some initial success in these conflicts gave way to a catastrophic defeat at the hands of the powerful Assyrian king Tiglath Pileser I BC who annexed huge swathes of Babylonian territory thus further expanding the Assyrian Empire Following this a terrible famine gripped Babylon inviting attacks and migrations from the northwest Semitic tribes of Aramaeans and Suteans from the Levant br In BC Marduk shapik zeri signed a peace treaty with Ashur bel kala BC of Assyria however his successor Kada man Buria was not so friendly to Assyria prompting the Assyrian king to invade Babylonia and depose him placing Adad apla iddina on the throne as his vassal Assyrian domination continued until c BC with Marduk ahhe eriba and Marduk zer X regarded as vassals of Assyria After BC the Middle Assyrian Empire descended into a period of civil war followed by constant warfare with the Arameans Phrygians Neo Hittite states and Hurrians allowing Babylonia to once more largely free itself from the Assyrian yoke for a few decades br However East Semitic speaking Babylonia soon began to suffer further repeated incursions from West Semitic nomadic peoples migrating from the Levant during the Bronze Age collapse and during the th century BC large swathes of the Babylonian countryside was appropriated and occupied by these newly arrived Arameans and Suteans Arameans settled much of the countryside in eastern and central Babylonia and the Suteans in the western deserts with the weak Babylonian kings being unable to stem these migrations br br br Period of chaos BC br The ruling Babylonian dynasty of Nabu shum libur was deposed by marauding Arameans in BC and the heart of Babylonia including the capital city itself descended into anarchic state and no king was to rule Babylon for over years br However in southern Mesopotamia a region corresponding with the old Dynasty of the Sealand Dynasty V BC arose this was ruled by Simbar shipak leader of a Kassite clan and was in effect a separate state from Babylon The state of anarchy allowed the Assyrian ruler Ashur nirari IV BC the opportunity to attack Babylonia in BC and he invaded and captured the Babylonian city of Atlila and some south central regions of Mesopotamia for Assyria br The south Mesopotamian dynasty was replaced by another Kassite Dynasty Dynasty VI BC which also seems to have regained control over Babylon itself The Elamites deposed this brief Kassite revival with king Mar biti apla usur founding Dynasty VII BC However this dynasty too fell when the Arameans once more ravaged Babylon br Babylonian rule was restored by Nab mukin apli in BC ushering in Dynasty VIII Dynasty IX begins with Ninurta kudurri usur II who ruled from BC Babylonia remained weak during this period with whole areas of Babylonia now under firm Aramean and Sutean control Babylonian rulers were often forced to bow to pressure from Assyria and Elam both of which had appropriated Babylonian territory br br br Assyrian rule BC br Babylonia remained in a state of chaos as the th century BC drew to a close A further migration of nomads from the Levant occurred in the early th century BC with the arrival of the Chaldeans another nomadic Northwest Semitic speaking people described in Assyrian annals as the Kaldu The Chaldeans settled in the far southeast of Babylonia joining the already long extant Arameans and Suteans By BC the migrant Chaldeans had established a small territory in the extreme southeast of Mesopotamia br From BC with the founding of the Neo Assyrian Empire BC by Adad nirari II Babylon found itself once again under the domination and rule of its fellow Mesopotamian state for the next three centuries Adad nirari II twice attacked and defeated Shamash mudammiq of Babylonia annexing a large area of land north of the Diyala River and the towns of H t and Zanqu in mid Mesopotamia He made further gains over Babylonia under Nabu shuma ukin I later in his reign Tukulti Ninurta II and Ashurnasirpal II also forced Babylonia into vassalage and Shalmaneser III BC sacked Babylon itself slew king Nabu apla iddina subjugated the Aramean Sutean and Chaldean tribes settled within Babylonia and installed Marduk zakir shumi I BC followed by Marduk balassu iqbi BC as his vassals It was during the late s BC in the annals of Shalmaneser III that the Chaldeans and Arabs dwelling in some northern regions of the Arabian Peninsula are first mentioned in the pages of written recorded history br Upon the death of Shalmaneser II Baba aha iddina was reduced to vassalage by the Assyrian queen Shammuramat known as Semiramis to the Persians Armenians and Greeks acting as regent to his successor Adad nirari III who was merely a boy Adad nirari III eventually killed Baba aha iddina and ruled there directly until BC until Ninurta apla X was crowned However he too was subjugated by Adad Nirari III The next Assyrian king Shamshi Adad V then made a vassal of Marduk bel zeri br br Babylonia briefly fell to another foreign ruler when Marduk apla usur ascended the throne in BC taking advantage of a period of civil war in Assyria He was a member of the Chaldean tribe who had a century or so earlier settled in a small region in the far southeastern corner of Mesopotamia bordering the Persian Gulf and southwestern Elam Shalmaneser IV attacked him and retook northern Babylonia forcing a border treaty in Assyria s favour upon him However he was allowed to remain on the throne and successfully stabilised the part of Babylonia he controlled Eriba Marduk another Chaldean succeeded him in BC and his son Nabu shuma ishkun in BC Babylonia appears to have been in a state of chaos during this time with the north occupied by Assyria its throne occupied by foreign Chaldeans and civil unrest prominent throughout the land br The Babylonian king Nabonassar overthrew the Chaldean usurpers in BC and successfully stabilised Babylonia remaining untroubled by Ashur nirari V of Assyria However with the accession of Tiglath Pileser III BC Babylonia came under renewed attack Babylon was invaded and sacked and Nabonassar reduced to vassalage His successors Nabu nadin zeri Nabu suma ukin II and Nabu mukin zeri were also in servitude to Tiglath Pileser III until in BC the Assyrian king decided to rule Babylon directly as its king instead of allowing Babylonian kings to remain as vassals of Assyria as his predecessors had done for two hundred years br It was during this period that Eastern Aramaic was introduced by the Assyrians as the lingua franca of the Neo Assyrian Empire and the still spoken by Assyrians and Mandeans Mesopotamian Aramaic began to slowly overlay and supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia br The Assyrian king Shalmaneser V was declared king of Babylon in BC but died whilst besieging Samaria in BC br Marduk apla iddina II a Chaldean malka chieftain of the far southeast of Mesopotamia then fomented revolt against Assyrian domination assisted by strong Elamite support Marduk apla iddina managed to take the throne of Babylon itself between and BC whilst the Assyrian king Sargon II BC were otherwise occupied in defeating the Scythians and Cimmerians who had attacked Assyria s Persian and Median vassal colonies in ancient Iran Marduk apla iddina II was eventually defeated and ejected by Sargon II of Assyria and fled to his protectors in Elam Sargon II was then declared king in Babylon br br br Destruction of Babylon br Sennacherib BC succeeded Sargon II and after ruling directly for a while he placed his son Ashur nadin shumi on the throne However Merodach Baladan and his Elamite protectors continued to unsuccessfully agitate against Assyrian rule Nergal ushezib an Elamite murdered the Assyrian prince and briefly took the throne This led the infuriated Assyrian king Sennacherib to invade and subjugate Elam and to sack Babylon laying waste to the region and largely destroying the city While praying to the god Nisroch in Nineveh in BC Sennacherib was soon murdered by his own sons The new Assyrian king Esarhaddon placed a puppet king Marduk zakir shumi II on the throne in Babylon However Marduk apla iddina returned from exile in Elam and briefly deposed Marduk zakir shumi whereupon Esarhaddon was forced to attack and defeat him Marduk apla iddina once more fled to his masters in Elam where he died in exile br br br Restoration and rebuilding br Esarhaddon BC ruled Babylon personally he completely rebuilt the city bringing rejuvenation and peace to the region Upon his death and in an effort to maintain harmony within his vast empire which stretched from the Caucasus to Egypt and Nubia and from Cyprus to Persia and the Caspian Sea he installed his eldest son Shamash shum ukin as a subject king in Babylon and his youngest the highly educated Ashurbanipal BC in the more senior position as king of Assyria and overlord of Shamash shum ukin br br br Babylonian revolt br br Despite being an Assyrian himself Shamash shum ukin after decades subject to his brother Ashurbanipal declared that the city of Babylon and not the Assyrian city of Nineveh should be the seat of the immense empire He raised a major revolt against his brother Ashurbanipal He led a powerful coalition of peoples also resentful of Assyrian subjugation and rule including Elam the Persians Medes the Babylonians Chaldeans and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia the Arameans of the Levant and southwest Mesopotamia the Arabs and Dilmunites of the Arabian Peninsula and the Canaanites Phoenicians After a bitter struggle Babylon was sacked and its allies vanquished Shamash shum ukim being killed in the process Elam was destroyed once and for all and the Babylonians Persians Chaldeans Arabs Medes Elamites Arameans Suteans and Canaanites were violently subjugated with Assyrian troops exacting savage revenge on the rebelling peoples An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was placed on the throne to rule on behalf of the Assyrian king Upon Ashurbanipal s death in BC his son Ashur etil ilani BC became ruler of Babylon and Assyria br However Assyria soon descended into a series of brutal internal civil wars which were to cause its downfall Ashur etil ilani was deposed by one of his own generals named Sin shumu lishir in BC who also set himself up as king in Babylon After only one year on the throne amidst continual civil war Sinsharishkun BC ousted him as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia in BC However he too was beset by constant unremitting civil war in the Assyrian heartland Babylonia took advantage of this and rebelled under Nabopolassar a previously unknown malka chieftain of the Chaldeans who had settled in southeastern Mesopotamia by c BC br It was during the reign of Sin shar ishkun that Assyria s vast empire began to unravel and many of its former subject peoples ceased to pay tribute most significantly for the Assyrians the Babylonians Chaldeans Medes Persians Scythians Arameans and Cimmerians br br br Neo Babylonian Empire Chaldean Empire br br In BC Nabopolassar seized control over much of Babylonia with the support of most of the inhabitants with only the city of Nippur and some northern regions showing any loyalty to the beleaguered Assyrian king Nabopolassar was unable to utterly secure Babylonia and for the next four years he was forced to contend with an occupying Assyrian army encamped in Babylonia trying to unseat him However the Assyrian king Sin shar ishkun was plagued by constant revolts among his people in Nineveh and was thus prevented from ejecting Nabopolassar br The stalemate ended in BC when Nabopolassar entered the Babylonians and Chaldeans into alliance with Cyaxares an erstwhile vassal of Assyria and king of the Iranian peoples the Medes Persians Sagartians and Parthians Cyaxares had also taken advantage of the Assyrian destruction of the formerly regionally dominant pre Iranian Elamite and Mannean nations and the subsequent anarchy in Assyria to free the Iranic peoples from three centuries of the Assyrian yoke and regional Elamite domination The Scythians from north of the Caucasus and the Cimmerians from the Black Sea who had both also been subjugated by Assyria joined the alliance as did regional Aramean tribes br In BC while the Assyrian king was fully occupied fighting rebels in both Babylonia and Assyria itself Cyaxares launched a surprise attack on the Assyrian heartlands sacking the cities of Kalhu the Biblical Calah Nimrud and Arrapkha modern Kirkuk Nabopolassar was still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia and thus not involved in this breakthrough br From this point on the coalition of Babylonians Chaldeans Medes Persians Scythians Cimmerians and Sagartians fought in unison against a civil war ravaged Assyria Major Assyrian cities such as Ashur Arbela modern Irbil Guzana Dur Sharrukin modern Khorsabad Imgur Enlil Nibarti Ashur Gasur Kanesh Kar Ashurnasipal and Tushhan fell to the alliance during BC Sin shar ishkun somehow managed to rally against the odds during BC and drove back the combined forces ranged against him br However the alliance launched a renewed combined attack the following year and after five years of fierce fighting Nineveh was sacked in late BC after a prolonged siege in which Sin shar ishkun was killed defending his capital br House to house fighting continued in Nineveh and an Assyrian general and member of the royal household took the throne as Ashur uballit II BC He was offered the chance of accepting a position of vassalage by the leaders of the alliance according to the Babylonian Chronicle However he refused and managed to successfully fight his way out of Nineveh and to the northern Assyrian city of Harran in Upper Mesopotamia where he founded a new capital The fighting continued as the Assyrian king held out against the alliance until BC when he was eventually ejected by the Medes Babylonians Scythians and their allies and prevented in an attempt to regain the city the same year br br The Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II whose dynasty had been installed as vassals of Assyria in BC belatedly tried to aid Egypt s former Assyrian masters possibly out of fear that Egypt would be next to succumb to the new powers without Assyria to protect them having already been ravaged by the Scythians The Assyrians fought on with Egyptian aid until what was probably a final decisive victory was achieved against them at Carchemish in northwestern Assyria in BC The seat of empire was thus transferred to Babylonia for the first time since Hammurabi over a thousand years before br Nabopolassar was followed by his son Nebuchadnezzar II BC whose reign of years made Babylon once more the ruler of much of the civilized world taking over portions of the former Assyrian Empire with the eastern and northeastern portion being taken by the Medes and the far north by the Scythians br Nebuchadnezzar II may have also had to contend with remnants of the Assyrian resistance Some sections of the Assyrian army and administration may have still continued in and around Dur Katlimmu in northwest Assyria for a time however by BC Assyrian imperial records from this region also fell silent The fate of Ashur uballit II remains unknown and he may have been killed attempting to regain Harran at Carchemish or continued to fight on eventually disappearing into obscurity br The Scythians and Cimmerians erstwhile allies of Babylonia under Nabopolassar now became a threat and Nebuchadnezzar II was forced to march into Anatolia and rout their forces ending the northern threat to his Empire br The Egyptians attempted to remain in the Near East possibly in an effort to aid in restoring Assyria as a secure buffer against Babylonia and the Medes and Persians or to carve out an empire of their own Nebuchadnezzar II campaigned against the Egyptians and drove them back over the Sinai However an attempt to take Egypt itself as his Assyrian predecessors had succeeded in doing failed mainly due to a series of rebellions from the Israelites of Judah and the former kingdom of Ephraim the Phoenicians of Caanan and the Arameans of the Levant The Babylonian king crushed these rebellions deposed Jehoiakim the king of Judah and deported a sizeable part of the population to Babylonia Cities like Tyre Sidon and Damascus were also subjugated The Arabs and other South Arabian peoples who dwelt in the deserts to the south of the borders of Mesopotamia were then also subjugated br In BC he went to war with Pharaoh Amasis and briefly invaded Egypt itself After securing his empire which included marrying a Median princess he devoted himself to maintaining the empire and conducting numerous impressive building projects in Babylon He is credited with building the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon br br Amel Marduk succeeded to the throne and reigned for only two years Little contemporary record of his rule survives though Berosus later stated that he was deposed and murdered in BC by his successor Neriglissar for conducting himself in an improper manner br Neriglissar BC also had a short reign He was the son in law of Nebuchadnezzar II and it is unclear if he was a Chaldean or native Babylonian who married into the dynasty He campaigned in Aram and Phoenicia successfully maintaining Babylonian rule in these regions Neriglissar died young however and was succeeded by his son Labashi Marduk BC who was still a boy He was deposed and killed during the same year in a palace conspiracy br Of the reign of the last Babylonian king Nabonidus Nabu na id BC who is the son of the Assyrian priestess Adda Guppi and who managed to kill the last Chaldean king Labashi Marduk and took the reign there is a fair amount of information available Nabonidus hence his son the regent Belshazzar was at least from the mother s side neither Chaldean nor Babylonian but ironically Assyrian hailing from its final capital of Harran Kharranu His father s origins remain unknown Information regarding Nabonidus is chiefly derived from a chronological tablet containing the annals of Nabonidus supplemented by another inscription of Nabonidus where he recounts his restoration of the temple of the Moon god Sin at Harran as well as by a proclamation of Cyrus issued shortly after his formal recognition as king of Babylonia br A number of factors arose which would ultimately lead to the fall of Babylon The population of Babylonia became restive and increasingly disaffected under Nabonidus He excited a strong feeling against himself by attempting to centralize the polytheistic religion of Babylonia in the temple of Marduk at Babylon and while he had thus alienated the local priesthoods the military party also despised him on account of his antiquarian tastes He seemed to have left the defense of his kingdom to his son Belshazzar a capable soldier but poor diplomat who alienated the political elite occupying himself with the more congenial work of excavating the foundation records of the temples and determining the dates of their builders He also spent time outside Babylonia rebuilding temples in the Assyrian city of Harran and also among his Arab subjects in the deserts to the south of Mesopotamia Nabonidus and Belshazzar s Assyrian heritage is also likely to have added to this resentment In addition Mesopotamian military might had usually been concentrated in the martial state of Assyria Babylonia had always been more vulnerable to conquest and invasion than its northern neighbour and without the might of Assyria to keep foreign powers in check and Mesopotamia dominant Babylonia was ultimately exposed br It was in the sixth year of Nabonidus BC that Cyrus the Great the Achaemenid Persian king of Anshan in Elam revolted against his suzerain Astyages king of the Manda or Medes at Ecbatana Astyages army betrayed him to his enemy and Cyrus established himself at Ecbatana thus putting an end to the empire of the Medes and making the Persian faction dominant among the Iranic peoples Three years later Cyrus had become king of all Persia and was engaged in a campaign to put down a revolt among the Assyrians Meanwhile Nabonidus had established a camp in the desert of his colony of Arabia near the southern frontier of his kingdom leaving his son Belshazzar Belsharutsur in command of the army br In BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia A battle was fought at Opis in the month of June where the Babylonians were defeated and immediately afterwards Sippar surrendered to the invader Nabonidus fled to Babylon where he was pursued by Gobryas and on the th day of Tammuz two days after the capture of Sippar the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting Nabonidus was dragged from his hiding place where the services continued without interruption Cyrus did not arrive until the rd of Marchesvan October Gobryas having acted for him in his absence Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon and a few days afterwards Belshazzar the son of Nabonidus died in battle A public mourning followed lasting six days and Cyrus son Cambyses accompanied the corpse to the tomb br One of the first acts of Cyrus accordingly was to allow the Jewish exiles to return to their own homes carrying with them their sacred temple vessels The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne br Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of Bel Marduk who was assumed to be wrathful at the impiety of Nabonidus in removing the images of the local gods from their ancestral shrines to his capital Babylon br The Chaldean tribe had lost control of Babylonia decades before the end of the era that sometimes bears their name and they appear to have blended into the general populace of Babylonia even before this for example Nabopolassar Nebuchadnezzar II and their successors always referred to themselves as Shar Akkad and never as Shar Kaldu on inscriptions and during the Persian Achaemenid Empire the term Chaldean ceased to refer to a race of people and instead specifically to a social class of priests educated in classical Babylonian literature particularly Astronomy and Astrology By the mid Seleucid Empire BC period this term too had fallen from use br br br Fall of Babylon br br Babylonia was absorbed into the Achaemenid Empire in BC becoming the satrapy of Babirush Old Persian B biru br A year before Cyrus death in BC he elevated his son Cambyses II in the government making him king of Babylon while he reserved for himself the fuller title of king of the other provinces of the empire It was only when Darius I acquired the Persian throne and ruled it as a representative of the Zoroastrian religion that the old tradition was broken and the claim of Babylon to confer legitimacy on the rulers of western Asia ceased to be acknowledged br Immediately after Darius seized Persia Babylonia briefly recovered its independence under a native ruler Nidinta Bel who took the name of Nebuchadnezzar III and reigned from October BC to August BC when Darius took the city by storm during this period Assyria to the north also rebelled A few years later probably BC Babylon again revolted under the Urartian king Nebuchadnezzar IV on this occasion after its capture by the Persians the walls were partly destroyed The Esagila the great temple of Bel however still continued to be kept in repair and to be a center of Babylonian religious feelings br Alexander the Great conquered Babylon in BC for the Greeks and died there in BC Babylonia and Assyria then became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire It has long been maintained that the foundation of Seleucia diverted the population to the new capital of southern Mesopotamia and that the ruins of the old city became a quarry for the builders of the new seat of government but the recent publication of the Babylonian Chronicles has shown that urban life was still very much the same well into the Parthian Empire BC to AD The Parthian king Mithridates conquered the region into the Parthian Empire in BC and the region became something of a battleground between Greeks and Parthians br There was a brief interlude of Roman conquest the provinces of Assyria and Mesopotamia AD under Trajan after which the Parthians reasserted control br The satrapy of Babylonia was absorbed into As rist n meaning The land of the Assyrians in Middle Persian in the Sasanian Empire which began in AD and by this time East Syriac Rite Syriac Christianity which emerged in Assyria and Upper Mesopotamia the first century AD had become the dominant religion among the native Assyrian Babylonian populace who had never adopted the Zoroastrianism or Hellenic religions and languages of their rulers br Apart from the small nd century BC to rd century AD independent Neo Assyrian states of Adiabene Osroene Assur Beth Garmai Beth Nuhadra and Hatra in the north Mesopotamia remained under largely Persian control until the Arab Muslim conquest of Persia in the seventh century AD As rist n was dissolved as a geopolitical entity in AD and the native Eastern Aramaic speaking and largely Christian populace of southern and central Mesopotamia with the exception of the Mandeans gradually underwent Arabization and Islamization in contrast to northern Mesopotamia where an Assyrian continuity endures to the present day br br br Culture br Bronze Age to Early Iron Age Mesopotamian culture is sometimes summarized as Assyro Babylonian because of the close ethnic linguistic and cultural interdependence of the two political centers The term Babylonia especially in writings from around the early th century was formerly used to also include Southern Mesopotamia s earliest pre Babylonian history and not only in reference to the later city state of Babylon proper This geographic usage of the name Babylonia has generally been replaced by the more accurate term Sumer or Sumero Akkadian in more recent writing referring to the pre Assyro Babylonian Mesopotamian civilization br br br Babylonian culture br br br Art and architecture br br In Babylonia an abundance of clay and lack of stone led to greater use of mudbrick Babylonian Sumerian and Assyrian temples were massive structures of crude brick which were supported by buttresses the rain being carried off by drains One such drain at Ur was made of lead The use of brick led to the early development of the pilaster and column and of frescoes and enameled tiles The walls were brilliantly coloured and sometimes plated with zinc or gold as well as with tiles Painted terracotta cones for torches were also embedded in the plaster In Babylonia in place of the relief there was greater use of three dimensional figures the earliest examples being the Statues of Gudea that are realistic if somewhat clumsy The paucity of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of gem cutting br br br Astronomy br br Tablets dating back to the Old Babylonian period document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of cuneiform script tablets known as the En ma Anu Enlil The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet of En ma Anu Enlil the Venus tablet of Ammi Saduqa which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic The oldest rectangular astrolabe dates back to Babylonia c BC The MUL APIN contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting heliacal risings and the settings of the planets lengths of daylight measured by a water clock gnomon shadows and intercalations The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in strings that lie along declination circles and thus measure right ascensions or time intervals and also employs the stars of the zenith which are also separated by given right ascensional differences br br br Medicine br Medical diagnosis and prognosis br br We find medical semiotics in a whole constellation of disciplines There was a real common ground among these Babylonian forms of knowledge an approach involving analysis of particular cases constructed only through traces symptoms hints In short we can speak about a symptomatic or divinatory or conjectural paradigm which could be oriented toward past present or future depending on the form of knowledge called upon Toward future that was the medical science of symptoms with its double character diagnostic explaining past and present and prognostic suggesting likely future br The oldest Babylonian i e Akkadian texts on medicine date back to the First Babylonian dynasty in the first half of the nd millennium BC although the earliest medical prescriptions appear in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur period The most extensive Babylonian medical text however is the Diagnostic Handbook written by the umm n or chief scholar Esagil kin apli of Borsippa during the reign of the Babylonian king Adad apla iddina BC br Along with contemporary ancient Egyptian medicine the Babylonians introduced the concepts of diagnosis prognosis physical examination and prescriptions In addition the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of therapy and aetiology and the use of empiricism logic and rationality in diagnosis prognosis and therapy The text contains a list of medical symptoms and often detailed empirical observations along with logical rules used in combining observed symptoms on the body of a patient with its diagnosis and prognosis br The symptoms and diseases of a patient were treated through therapeutic means such as bandages creams and pills If a patient could not be cured physically the Babylonian physicians often relied on exorcism to cleanse the patient from any curses Esagil kin apli s Diagnostic Handbook was based on a logical set of axioms and assumptions including the modern view that through the examination and inspection of the symptoms of a patient it is possible to determine the patient s disease its aetiology and future development and the chances of the patient s recovery br Esagil kin apli discovered a variety of illnesses and diseases and described their symptoms in his Diagnostic Handbook These include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis Later Babylonian medicine resembles early Greek medicine in many ways In particular the early treatises of the Hippocratic Corpus show the influence of late Babylonian medicine in terms of both content and form br br br Literature br br There were libraries in most towns and temples an old Sumerian proverb averred that he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn Women as well as men learned to read and write and in Semitic times this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language and a complicated and extensive syllabary br A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals and the language of religion and law long continued to be written in the old agglutinative language of Sumer Vocabularies grammars and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named and elaborate lists of them were drawn up br There are many Babylonian literary works whose titles have come down to us One of the most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh in twelve books translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sin liqi unninni and arranged upon an astronomical principle Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh The whole story is a composite product and it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure br br br Neo Babylonian culture br The brief resurgence of Babylonian culture in the th to th centuries BC was accompanied by a number of important cultural developments br br br Astronomy br br Among the sciences astronomy and astrology still occupied a conspicuous place in Babylonian society Astronomy was of old standing in Babylonia The zodiac was a Babylonian invention of great antiquity and eclipses of the sun and moon could be foretold There are dozens of cuneiform records of original Mesopotamian eclipse observations br Babylonian astronomy was the basis for much of what was done in ancient Greek astronomy in classical in Sasanian Byzantine and Syrian astronomy astronomy in the medieval Islamic world and in Central Asian and Western European astronomy Neo Babylonian astronomy can thus be considered the direct predecessor of much of ancient Greek mathematics and astronomy which in turn is the historical predecessor of the European Western scientific revolution br During the th and th centuries BC Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy br In Seleucid and Parthian times the astronomical reports were of a thoroughly scientific character how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the history of astronomy br The only Babylonian astronomer known to have supported a heliocentric model of planetary motion was Seleucus of Seleucia b BC Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch He supported the heliocentric theory where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun According to Plutarch Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system but it is not known what arguments he used br br br Mathematics br br Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited In respect of time they fall in two distinct groups one from the First Babylonian dynasty period BC the other mainly Seleucid from the last three or four centuries BC In respect of content there is scarcely any difference between the two groups of texts Thus Babylonian mathematics remained stale in character and content with very little progress or innovation for nearly two millennia br The Babylonian system of mathematics was sexagesimal or a base numeral system From this we derive the modern day usage of seconds in a minute minutes in an hour and degrees in a circle The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons First the number has many divisors and making calculations easier Additionally unlike the Egyptians and Romans the Babylonians had a true place value system where digits written in the left column represented larger values much as in our base ten system Among the Babylonians mathematical accomplishments were the determination of the square root of two correctly to seven places YBC They also demonstrated knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem well before Pythagoras as evidenced by this tablet translated by Dennis Ramsey and dating to c BC br br is the length and is the diagonal br What is the breadth br Its size is not known br times is And times is br You take from and there remains br What times

lathe was discovered by Austen Henry Layard at Nimrud along with glass vases bearing the name of Sargon this could explain the excessive minuteness of some of the writing on the Assyrian tablets and a lens may also have been used in the observation of the heavens br The Babylonians might have been familiar with the general rules for measuring the areas They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one twelfth the square of the circumference which would be correct if were estimated as The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the base and the height however the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases Also there was a recent discovery in which a tablet used as and The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile which was a measure of distance equal to about kilometres mi today This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun therefore representing time Eves Chapter The Babylonians used also space time graphs to calculate the velocity of Jupiter This is an idea that is considered highly modern traced to the th century England and France and anticipating integral calculus br br br Philosophy br br The origins of Babylonian philosophy can be traced back to early Mesopotamian wisdom literature which embodied certain philosophies of life particularly ethics in the forms of dialectic dialogs epic poetry folklore hymns lyrics prose and proverbs Babylonian reasoning and rationality developed beyond empirical observation br It is possible that Babylonian philosophy had an influence on Greek philosophy particularly Hellenistic philosophy The Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the sophists the Heraclitean doctrine of contrasts and the dialogs of Plato as well as a precursor to the maieutic Socratic method of Socrates The Milesian philosopher Thales is also known to have studied philosophy in Mesopotamia br According to the assyriologist Marc Van de Mieroop Babylonian philosophy was a highly developed system of thought with a unique approach to knowledge and a focus on writing lexicography divination and law It was also a bilingual intellectual culture based on Sumerian and Akkadian br br br Legacy br Babylonia and particularly its capital city Babylon has long held a place in the Abrahamic religions as a symbol of excess and dissolute power Many references are made to Babylon in the Bible both literally historical and allegorically The mentions in the Tanakh tend to be historical or prophetic while New Testament apocalyptic references to the Whore of Babylon are more likely figurative or cryptic references possibly to pagan Rome or some other archetype The legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the Tower of Babel are seen as symbols of luxurious and arrogant power respectively br Early Christians sometimes referred to Rome as Babylon For instance the writer of the First Epistle of Peter concludes his letter with this advice She who is in Babylon Rome chosen together with you sends you her greetings and so does my son Mark Peter br Revelation says A second angel followed and said Fallen Fallen is Babylon the Great which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries Other examples can be found in Revelation and Revelation br Babylon is mentioned in the Quran in verse of chapter of Surah Baqarah The Cow br br They instead followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon Never did Solomon disbelieve rather the devils disbelieved They taught magic to the people along with what had been revealed to the two angels H r t and M r t in Babylon The two angels never taught anyone without saying We are only a test for you so do not abandon your faith Yet people learned magic that caused a rift even between husband and wife although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah s Will They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would
