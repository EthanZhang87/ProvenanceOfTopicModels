Ota Benga c March was a Mbuti Congo pygmy man known for being featured in an exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis Missouri and as a human zoo exhibit in at the Bronx Zoo Benga had been purchased from native African slave traders by the explorer Samuel Phillips Verner a businessman searching for African people for the exhibition who took him to the United States While at the Bronx Zoo Benga was allowed to walk the grounds before and after he was exhibited in the zoo s Monkey House Benga was placed in a cage with an orangutan regarded as both an offense to his humanity and a promotion of Darwinism br To enhance the primitive image and presumably protect himself if need be from the ape he was given a functional bow and arrow He used this instead to shoot at visitors who mocked him and partially as a result of this the exhibition was ended Except for a brief visit to Africa with Verner after the close of the St Louis fair Benga lived in the United States mostly in Virginia for the rest of his life br African American newspapers around the nation published editorials strongly opposing Benga s treatment Robert Stuart MacArthur spokesman for a delegation of black churches petitioned New York City Mayor George B McClellan Jr for his release from the Bronx Zoo In late the mayor released Benga to the custody of James H Gordon who supervised the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn br In Gordon arranged for Benga to be cared for in Lynchburg Virginia where he paid for his clothes and to have his sharpened teeth capped This would enable Benga to be more readily accepted in local society Benga was tutored in English and began to work at a Lynchburg tobacco factory br He tried to return to Africa but the outbreak of World War I in stopped all passenger ship travel Benga developed depression and died by suicide in br br br Early life br As a member of the Mbuti people Ota Benga lived in equatorial forests near the Kasai River in what was then the Congo Free State His people were attacked by the Force Publique established by King Leopold II of Belgium as a militia to oppress the local people and communities most of whom were used as forced laborers in the extraction and exploitation of Congo s massive supply of rubber Benga s wife and two children were slaughtered he survived because he was on a hunting expedition when the Force Publique attacked his village He was later captured by slave traders from the enemy Baschelel Bashilele tribe br In American businessman and explorer Samuel Phillips Verner traveled to Africa under contract from the Louisiana Purchase Exposition to bring back an assortment of pygmies to be part of an exhibition Verner came across Benga while en route to a Batwa pygmy village visited previously He purchased Benga from the Bashilele slave traders giving them a pound of salt and a bolt of cloth in exchange Verner later claimed he had rescued Benga from cannibals br The two spent several weeks together before reaching the Batwa village The villagers did not trust the muzungu white man Verner was unable to recruit any villagers to join him for travel to the United States until Benga said that the muzungu had saved his life and spoke of the bond that had grown between them and his own curiosity about the world Verner came from Four Batwa all male ultimately decided to accompany them Verner also recruited other Africans who were not pygmies five men from the Bakuba including the son of King Ndombe ruler of the Bakuba and other related peoples br br br Exhibitions br br br St Louis World Fair br br The group was taken to St Louis Missouri in late June without Verner as he had been taken ill with malaria The Louisiana Purchase Exposition had already begun and the Africans immediately became the center of attention Benga was particularly popular and his name was reported variously by the press as Artiba Autobank Ota Bang and Otabenga He had an amiable personality and visitors were eager to see his teeth that had been filed to sharp points in his early youth as ritual decoration The Africans learned to charge for photographs and performances One newspaper account promoted Benga as the only genuine African cannibal in America and claimed that his teeth were worth the five cents he charges for showing them to visitors br br When Verner arrived a month later he realized the pygmies were more prisoners than performers Their attempts to congregate peacefully in the forest on Sundays were thwarted by the crowds fascination with them McGee s attempts to present a serious scientific exhibit were also overturned On July the Africans performed to the crowd s preconceived notion that they were savages resulting in the First Illinois Regiment being called in to control the mob Benga and the other Africans eventually performed in a warlike fashion imitating Native Americans they saw at the Exhibition The Apache leader Geronimo featured as The Human Tyger with special dispensation from the Department of War grew to admire Benga and gave him one of his arrowheads br br br American Museum of Natural History br Benga accompanied Verner when he returned the other Africans to the Congo He briefly lived amongst the Batwa while continuing to accompany Verner on his African adventures He married a Batwa woman who later died of snakebite but little is known of this second marriage Not feeling that he belonged with the Batwa Benga chose to return with Verner to the United States br Verner eventually arranged for Benga to stay in a spare room at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City while he was tending to other business Verner negotiated with the curator Henry Bumpus over the presentation of his acquisitions from Africa and potential employment While Bumpus was put off by Verner s request of what he thought was the prohibitively high salary of a month and was not impressed by the man s credentials he was interested in Benga Benga initially enjoyed his time at the museum where he was given a Southern style linen suit to wear when he entertained He became homesick for his own culture br In the writers Bradford and Blume imagined his feelings br br What at first held his attention now made him want to flee It was maddening to be inside to be swallowed whole so long He had an image of himself stuffed behind glass but somehow still alive crouching over a fake campfire feeding meat to a lifeless child Museum silence became a source of torment a kind of noise he needed birdsong breezes trees br The disaffected Benga attempted to find relief by exploiting his employers presentation of him as a savage He tried to slip past the guards as a large crowd was leaving the premises when asked on one occasion to seat a wealthy donor s wife he pretended to misunderstand instead hurling the chair across the room just missing the woman s head Meanwhile Verner was struggling financially and had made little progress in his negotiations with the museum He soon found another home for Benga br br br Bronx Zoo br At the suggestion of Bumpus Verner took Benga to the Bronx Zoo in William Hornaday director of the zoo initially enlisted Benga to help maintain the animal habitats However Hornaday saw that people took more notice of Benga than the animals at the zoo and he eventually created an exhibition to feature Benga At the zoo Benga was allowed to roam the grounds but there is no record that he was ever paid for his work He became fond of an orangutan named Dohong the presiding genius of the Monkey House who had been taught to perform tricks and imitate human behavior br The events leading to his exhibition alongside Dohong were gradual Benga spent some of his time in the Monkey House exhibit and the zoo encouraged him to hang his hammock there and to shoot his bow and arrow at a target On the first day of the exhibit September visitors found Benga in the Monkey House br br Soon a sign on the exhibit read br br The African Pygmy Ota Benga br Age years Height feet inches br Weight pounds Brought from the br Kasai River Congo Free State South Cen br tral Africa by Dr Samuel P Verner Ex br hibited each afternoon during September br br Hornaday considered the exhibit a valuable spectacle for visitors he was supported by Madison Grant Secretary of the New York Zoological Society who lobbied to put Ota Benga on display alongside apes at the Bronx Zoo A decade later Grant became prominent nationally as a racial anthropologist and eugenicist br African American clergymen immediately protested to zoo officials about the exhibit Said James H Gordon br br Our race we think is depressed enough without exhibiting one of us with the apes We think we are worthy of being considered human beings with souls br Gordon thought the exhibit was hostile to Christianity and was effectively a promotion of Darwinism br br The Darwinian theory is absolutely opposed to Christianity and a public demonstration in its favor should not be permitted br A number of clergymen backed Gordon In defense of the depiction of Benga as a lesser human an editorial in The New York Times suggested br br We do not quite understand all the emotion which others are expressing in the matter It is absurd to make moan over the imagined humiliation and degradation Benga is suffering The pygmies are very low in the human scale and the suggestion that Benga should be in a school instead of a cage ignores the high probability that school would be a place from which he could draw no advantage whatever The idea that men are all much alike except as they have had or lacked opportunities for getting an education out of books is now far out of date br After the controversy Benga was allowed to roam the grounds of the zoo In response to the situation as well as verbal and physical prods from the crowds he became more mischievous and somewhat violent Around this time an article in The New York Times quoted Robert Stuart MacArthur as saying It is too bad that there is not some society like the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children We send our missionaries to Africa to Christianize the people and then we bring one here to brutalize him br The zoo finally removed Benga from the grounds Verner was unsuccessful in his continued search for employment but he occasionally spoke to Benga The two had agreed that it was in Benga s best interests to remain in the United States despite the unwelcome spotlight at the zoo br Toward the end of Benga was released into Reverend Gordon s custody br br br Later life br Gordon placed Benga in the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum a church sponsored orphanage in Brooklyn that Gordon supervised As the unwelcome press attention continued in January Gordon arranged for Benga s relocation to Lynchburg Virginia where he lived with the family of Gregory W Hayes br So that he could more easily be part of local society Gordon arranged for Benga s teeth to be capped and bought him American style clothes He received tutoring from Lynchburg poet Anne Spencer in order to improve his English and began to attend elementary school at the Baptist Seminary in Lynchburg br Once he felt his English had improved sufficiently Benga discontinued his formal education He began working at a Lynchburg tobacco factory and began to plan a return to Africa br br br Death br In when World War I broke out a return to the Congo became impossible as passenger ship traffic ended Benga became depressed as his hopes for a return to his homeland faded On March at the age of or he built a ceremonial fire chipped off the caps on his teeth and shot himself in the heart with a borrowed pistol br Benga was buried in an unmarked grave in the black section of the Old City Cemetery near his benefactor Gregory Hayes At some point the remains of both men went missing Local oral history indicates that Hayes and Benga were eventually moved from the Old Cemetery to White Rock Hill Cemetery a burial ground that later fell into disrepair Benga received a historic marker in Lynchburg in br br br Legacy br Phillips Verner Bradford the grandson of Samuel Phillips Verner together with Author Harvey Blume wrote a book on Benga entitled Ota Benga The Pygmy in the Zoo During his research for the book Bradford visited the American Museum of Natural History which holds a life mask and body cast of Ota Benga The display is still labeled Pygmy rather than indicating Benga s name despite objections beginning a century ago from Verner and repeated by others Publication of Bradford s book in inspired widespread interest in Ota Benga s story and stimulated creation of many other works both fictional and non fiction such as br br John Strand s play Ota
