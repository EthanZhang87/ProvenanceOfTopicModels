id: 32587
Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products particularly in diet and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals A person who practices veganism is known as a vegan br The foundations of veganism include ethical moral environmental health and humanitarian arguments Veganism excludes all animal use for example in food meat fish eggs milk and dairy products honey in clothing and industry leather wool fur and some cosmetics entertainment zoos exotic pets circuses or services guide dogs police dogs hunting dogs working animals or animal testing including medical experimentation br A person who practices veganism may do so to reduce animal deaths minimize animal suffering minimize their ecological footprint or for health benefits br Fruits vegetables legumes nuts grains and mushrooms are the basic elements of vegan food Since ancient times individuals have been renouncing the consumption of products of animal origin but the term veganism is modern it was coined in by Donald Watson with the aim of differentiating it from vegetarianism which rejects the consumption of meat but accepts the consumption of other products of animal origin such as milk dairy products and eggs Interest in veganism increased significantly in the s br br br Origins br br br Vegetarian etymology br The term vegetarian has been in use since around to refer to what was previously called a vegetable regimen or diet Its origin is an irregular compound of vegetable and the suffix arian in the sense of supporter believer as in humanitarian The earliest known written use is attributed to actress writer and abolitionist Fanny Kemble in her Journal of a Residence on a Georgian plantation in br br br History br Vegetarianism can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilization in BCE in the Indian subcontinent particularly in northern and western ancient India Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Parshavnatha Mahavira Acharya Kundakunda Umaswati Samantabhadra and Valluvar the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka Greek philosophers such as Empedocles Theophrastus Plutarch Plotinus and Porphyry and the Roman poet Ovid and the playwright Seneca the Younger The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans and wearing woolen garments Eudoxus of Cnidus a student of Archytas and Plato writes Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters One of the earliest known vegans was the Arab poet al Ma arri famous for his poem I No Longer Steal From Nature c c Their arguments were based on health the transmigration of souls animal welfare and the view espoused by Porphyry in De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium On Abstinence from Animal Food c c that if humans deserve justice then so do animals br Vegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in th century Britain and the United States A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely In the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published A Vindication of Natural Diet advocating abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors and in William Lambe a London physician said that his water and vegetable diet could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne Lambe called animal food a habitual irritation and argued that milk eating and flesh eating are but branches of a common system and they must stand or fall together Sylvester Graham s meatless Graham diet mostly fruit vegetables water and bread made at home with stoneground flour became popular as a health remedy in the s in the United States Several vegan communities were established around this time In Massachusetts Amos Bronson Alcott father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott opened the Temple School in and Fruitlands in and in England James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common in br br br Vegetarian Society br br In members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food led by Sophia Chichester a wealthy benefactor of Alcott House Alcott House also helped to establish the UK Vegetarian Society which held its first meeting in in Ramsgate Kent The Medical Times and Gazette in London reported in br br There are two kinds of Vegetarians one an extreme form the members of which eat no animal food products what so ever and a less extreme sect who do not object to eggs milk or fish The Vegetarian Society belongs to the latter more moderate division br An article in the Society s magazine the Vegetarian Messenger in discussed alternatives to shoe leather which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely not only in diet Henry S Salt s A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays asserts It is quite true that most not all Food Reformers admit into their diet such animal food as milk butter cheese and eggs The first known vegan cookbook was Asenath Nicholson s Kitchen Philosophy for Vegetarians published in C W Daniel published an early vegan cookbook Rupert H Wheldon s No Animal Food Two Essays and Recipes in The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades There were regular discussions about it in the Vegetarian Messenger it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism were vegetarians br During a visit to London in Mahatma Gandhi who had joined the Vegetarian Society s executive committee when he lived in London from to gave a speech to the Society arguing that it ought to promote a meat free diet as a matter of morality not health Lacto vegetarians acknowledged the ethical consistency of the vegan position but regarded a vegan diet as impracticable and were concerned that it might be an impediment to spreading vegetarianism if vegans found themselves unable to participate in social circles where no non animal food was available This became the predominant view of the Vegetarian Society which in stated The lacto vegetarians on the whole do not defend the practice of consuming the dairy products except on the ground of expediency br br br Vegan etymology br br In August several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non dairy vegetarianism When the request was denied Donald Watson secretary of the Leicester branch set up a new quarterly newsletter The Vegan News in November priced tuppence The word vegan was invented by Watson and Dorothy Morgan a schoolteacher he later married The word is based on the first three and last two letters of vegetarian because it marked in Watson s words the beginning and end of vegetarian The Vegan News asked its readers if they could think of anything better than vegan to stand for non dairy vegetarian They suggested allvega neo vegetarian dairyban vitan benevore sanivores and beaumangeur br The first edition attracted more than letters including from George Bernard Shaw who resolved to give up eggs and dairy The new Vegan Society held its first meeting in early November at the Attic Club High Holborn London In attendance were Donald Watson Elsie B Shrigley Fay K Henderson Alfred Hy Haffenden Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake with Mme Pataleewa Barbara Moore a Russian British engineer observing World Vegan Day is held every November to mark the founding of the Society and the Society considers November World Vegan Month br br The Vegan News changed its name to The Vegan in November by which time it had subscribers It published recipes and a vegan trade list of animal free products such as toothpastes shoe polishes stationery and glue Vegan books appeared including Vegan Recipes by Fay K Henderson and Aids to a Vegan Diet for Children by Kathleen V Mayo br The Vegan Society soon made clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose not only in diet In Watson wrote The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own From The Vegan s front page read Advocating living without exploitation and in the Society published its definition of veganism as the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals In its vice president Leslie Cross founded the Plantmilk Society and in as Plantmilk Ltd and later Plamil Foods it began production of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the Western world br The first vegan society in the U S was founded in by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California who distributed Watson s newsletter In H Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society AVS linking veganism to the concept of ahimsa non harming in Sanskrit According to Joanne Stepaniak the word vegan was first published independently in by the Oxford Illustrated Dictionary defined as a vegetarian who eats no butter eggs cheese or milk br br br Definition br Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism Dietary vegans also known as strict vegetarians refrain from consuming meat eggs dairy products and any other animal derived substances An ethical vegan is someone who not only excludes animal products from their diet but also tries to avoid using animals animal products and animal tested products when practical Another term is environmental veganism which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the grounds that the industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable Another motivation for veganism is concern about animal welfare br Since The Vegan Society gives two definitions of veganism br br Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude as far as is possible and practicable all forms of exploitation of and cruelty to animals for food clothing or any other purpose and by extension promotes the development and use of animal free alternatives for the benefit of animals humans and the environment In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals br The first definition by The Vegan Society is accepted among ethical and environmental vegans and the second definition by The Vegan Society is accepted among dietary vegans br The European Commission was granted the power to adopt an implementing act on food information related to suitability of a food for vegans by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in article of Regulation EU No The German consumer protection minister conference approved a definition for food suitable for vegans on April The European Vegetarian Union adopted this text for a proposal for a legally binding definition based on Regulation EU No in July br In the International Organization for Standardization published standard ISO on definitions and technical criteria for foods and food ingredients suitable for vegetarians or vegans and for labelling and claims ISO was rejected by Nederlandse Vereniging voor Veganisme who found the standard inconsistent with their vision br br br Increasing interest br br br Alternative food movements br In the s and s a vegetarian food movement emerged as part of the counterculture in the United States that focused on concerns about diet the environment and a distrust of food producers leading to increasing interest in organic gardening One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lapp s Diet for a Small Planet It sold more than three million copies and suggested getting off the top of the food chain br The following decades saw research by a group of scientists and doctors in the U S including Dean Ornish Caldwell Esselstyn Neal D Barnard John A McDougall Michael Greger and biochemist T Colin Campbell who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein such as the Western pattern diet were unhealthy They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets including McDougall s The McDougall Plan John Robbins s Diet for a New America which associated meat eating with environmental damage and Dr Dean Ornish s Program for Reversing Heart Disease In two major North American dietitians associations indicated that well planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages This was followed by the film Earthlings Campbell s The China Study Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin s Skinny Bitch Jonathan Safran Foer s Eating Animals and the film Forks over Knives br In the s veganism became associated with punk subculture and ideologies particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the U S and anarcho punk in the United Kingdom This association continues into the st century as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe br br br Into the mainstream br br The vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the s especially in the latter half The Economist declared the year of the vegan Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan processed food br The global mock meat market increased by percent between and and in the U S by eight percent between and to million a year The Vegetarian Butcher De Vegetarische Slager the first known vegetarian butcher shop selling mock meats opened in the Netherlands in while America s first vegan butcher the Herbivorous Butcher opened in Minneapolis in Since more than chain restaurant locations have begun offering Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods products including Carl s Jr outlets offering Beyond Burgers and Burger King outlets serving Impossible Whoppers Plant based meat sales in the U S grew between and br br In Europe s first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany Veganz in Berlin and Vegilicious in Dortmund In the Oktoberfest in Munich traditionally a meat heavy event offered vegan dishes for the first time in its year history br By of Americans were drinking plant milk and still drank dairy milk In the U K the plant milk market increased by percent in two years from million litres million imperial pints in to million million imperial pints in There was a increase in new vegan products between and in the U K In the United States School Nutrition Association found of school districts across the country were serving vegan school meals compared to of schools offering vegan lunch in br In total as of the largest share of vegan consumers globally currently reside in Asia Pacific with nine percent of people following a vegan diet In veganism rose in popularity in Hong Kong and China particularly among millennials China s vegan market was estimated to rise by more than between and which is expected to be the fastest growth rate internationally in that period This exceeds the projected growth in the second and third fastest growing vegan markets internationally in the same period the United Arab Emirates and Australia respectively br In Jacy Reese Anthis s book The End of Animal Farming argued that veganism will completely replace animal based food by The book was featured in The Guardian The New Republic and Forbes among other newspapers and magazines br The growth of schools serving vegan school meals has increased in recent years with the lunches added by Los Angeles California in Portland Maine in and New York City in br In January people from countries and territories signed up for Veganuary breaking the previous year s record of That month ONA in France became the first vegan restaurant in the country to receive a Michelin star That year more plant based restaurants around the world received Michelin stars At the end of the year a poll conducted by The Guardian showed that a new high of of the British public were interested in veganism br br br Prevalence by country br br Australia Australians topped Google s worldwide searches for the word vegan between mid and mid A Euromonitor International study concluded the market for packaged vegan food in Australia would rise per year between and making Australia the third fastest growing vegan market behind China and the United Arab Emirates br Austria In Kurier estimated that percent of Austrians practised veganism and in the capital Vienna percent br Belgium A iVOX online study found that out of Dutch speaking residents of Flanders and Brussels of years and over percent were vegan br Brazil According to research by IBOPE Intelig ncia published in April of Brazilians or about million people considered themselves vegetarians million of them vegans br Canada In one survey estimated that percent of adult Canadians considered themselves as vegans br Germany A government commissioned survey indicates that as of of German residents follow a vegan diet br India In the National Health Survey of the surveyed population reported never consuming animal products Veganism was most common in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra br Israel Five percent approx in Israel said they were vegan in making it the highest per capita vegan population in the world A survey by Globes and Israel s Channel News similarly found of Israelis were vegan Veganism increased among Israeli Arabs The Israeli army made special provision for vegan soldiers in which included providing non leather boots and wool free berets Veganism also simplifies adherence to the Judaic prohibition on combining meat and milk in meals br Italy Between and percent of Italians were reported to be vegan as of br Netherlands In the Dutch Society for Veganism Nederlandse Vereniging voor Veganisme NVV estimated there were more than Dutch vegans percent based on their membership growth In July the NVV estimated the number of vegans in the Netherlands at That is approximately of the Dutch population br Romania Followers of the Romanian Orthodox Church keep fast during several periods throughout the ecclesiastical calendar amounting to a majority of the year In the Romanian Orthodox tradition devotees abstain from eating any animal products during these times As a result vegan foods are abundant in stores and restaurants however Romanians may not be familiar with a vegan diet as a full time lifestyle choice br Sweden Four percent said they were vegan in a Demoskop poll br Switzerland Market research company DemoSCOPE estimated in that three percent of the population was vegan br United Kingdom A Ipsos MORI study commissioned by the Vegan Society surveying almost people aged or over across England Scotland and Wales found that percent were vegan the Vegan Society estimates that in the UK follow a vegan diet According to a survey by Comparethemarket com the number of people who identify as vegans in the United Kingdom has risen to over million which is approximately seven percent of the population and environmental concerns were a major factor in this development However doubt was cast on this inflated figure by the UK based Vegan Society who perform their own regular survey the Vegan Society themselves found in that there were vegans in Great Britain which was seen as a dramatic increase on previous figures YouGov reported vegans in br United States Past estimates of vegans in the U S varied from Gallup to Faunalytics According to the latter of those who adopted a vegan diet abandoned it But Top Trends in Prepared Foods a report by GlobalData estimated that of US consumers now claim to be vegan up from just in In YouGov published results of research that showed only reported being vegan Nearly of the vegan respondents were female According to Gallup black Americans are three times as likely to be vegan and vegetarian as whites as of July compared to br The city with the most vegan restaurants per resident in according to data collected from HappyCow was Chiang Mai Thailand followed by Ubud Bali Indonesia Phuket Thailand Tel Aviv Israel and Lisbon Portugal br br br Vegan diets substitutions and meat analogues br Vegan diets are based on grains and other seeds legumes particularly beans fruits vegetables edible mushrooms and nuts The main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products eggs and honey br br br Meat substitutes br Vegan meat alternatives are commonly sold in forms like vegetarian sausage mince or veggie burgers They are often made from soybeans seitan wheat gluten beans lentils rice mushrooms or vegetables Meat substitutes have been made in China since at least the Tang dynasty to common era including mock duck made from seitan They are much newer to Western countries Some famous Western producers of vegan meat alternatives include Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat But in the late s many meat producers and supermarkets also started making their own brands of vegan meat substitutes br br br Plant milk and dairy product alternatives br Plant milks such as soy milk almond milk cashew milk grain milks oat milk flax milk and rice milk hemp milk and coconut milk are used in place of cow or goat milk Soy milk provides around g oz of protein per cup mL or fl oz compared with g oz of protein per cup of cow s milk Almond milk is lower in dietary energy carbohydrates and protein Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula normally based on cow milk or soy The latter is known as soy based infant formula or SBIF br Butter and margarine can be replaced with alternate vegan products Vegan cheeses are made from seeds such as sesame and sunflower nuts such as cashew pine nut and almond and soybeans coconut oil nutritional yeast tapioca and rice among other ingredients and can replicate the meltability of dairy cheese Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes Cheese substitutes can be made at home including from nuts such as cashews Yoghurt and cream products can be replaced with plant based products such as soy yoghurt br Various types of plant cream have been created to replace dairy cream and some types of imitation whipped cream are non dairy br In the s and s a number of companies have genetically engineered yeast to produce cow milk proteins whey or fat without the use of cows These include Perfect Day Novacca Motif FoodWorks Remilk Final Foods Imagindairy Nourish Ingredients and Circe br br br Egg replacements br br As of in the U S many vegan egg substitutes were available including products used for scrambled eggs cakes cookies and doughnuts Baking powder silken soft tofu mashed potato bananas flaxseeds and aquafaba from chickpeas can also be used as egg substitutes Which one of these works depends on the egg property the replacement is meant to emulate Scrambled tofu for instance replaces scrambled eggs but tofu does not act as a binding agent for cakes like raw eggs flaxseeds or bananas do br br br Raw veganism br br Raw veganism combining veganism and raw foodism excludes all animal products and food cooked above C F A raw vegan diet includes vegetables fruits nuts grain and legume sprouts seeds and sea vegetables There are many variations of the diet including fruitarianism br br br Animal products br br br General br br While vegans broadly abstain from animal products there are many ways in which animal products are used and different individuals and organizations that identify with the practice of veganism may use some limited animal products based on philosophy means or other concerns Philosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan because animal use and products are deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society br Animal Ingredients A to Z and Veganissimo A to Z list which ingredients might be animal derived The British Vegan Society s sunflower logo and PETA s bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan which includes no animal testing The Leaping Bunny logo signals no animal testing but it might not be vegan The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by or on behalf of the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control Its website contains a list of certified products as does Australia s Choose Cruelty Free CCF The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical including animal testing but recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals an issue that was highlighted in when it became known that the UK s newly introduced note contained tallow br br br Meat eggs and dairy br br Like vegetarians vegans do not eat meat including beef pork poultry fowl and game Vegan groups disagree over whether vegans can eat oysters br br br Clothing br Many clothing products may be made of animal products such as silk wool including lambswool shearling cashmere angora mohair and a number of other fine wools fur feathers pearls animal derived dyes leather snakeskin or other kinds of skin or animal product Most leather clothing is made from cow skins Vegans discourage the use of leather but may continue to wear leather they bought before adopting the diet on the grounds that they are not financially supporting the meat industry However vegans try to work towards a point where they no longer own animal products The word was coined in Britain by Dorothy Morgan and Donald Watson Ethical vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non animal derived materials such as hemp linen cotton canvas polyester artificial leather pleather rubber and vinyl Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork pi a from pineapples cactus and mushroom leather Some vegan clothes in particular leather alternatives are made of petroleum based products which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production br br br Toiletries br br While dietary vegans might use animal products in toiletries ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the use of animal products and rejects the commodification of animals altogether Ethical vegans replace personal care products and household cleaners containing animal products with vegan products Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are relatively inexpensive After animals are slaughtered for meat the leftovers are put through a rendering process and some of that material particularly the fat is used in toiletries Vegans also avoid using sea sponges br Common animal derived ingredients include tallow in soap collagen derived glycerine which used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products moisturizers shaving foams soaps and toothpastes lanolin from sheep s wool often found in lip balm and moisturizers stearic acid a common ingredient in face creams shaving foam and shampoos like glycerine it can be plant based but is usually animal derived lactic acid an alpha hydroxy acid derived from animal milk used in moisturizers allantoin from the comfrey plant or cow urine found in shampoos moisturizers and toothpaste and carmine from scale insects such as the female cochineal used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades br Beauty Without Cruelty founded as a charity in was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of animal free personal care products br br br Hair extensions br Hair extensions are generally avoided by ethical vegans since they are made from human hair but ethical vegans may use synthetic alternatives Environmental vegans avoid synthetic hair extensions due to their biodegradability br br br Insect products br Vegan groups disagree about insect products Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey silk and other insect products suitable for vegans Some vegans believe that exploiting the labor of bees and harvesting their energy source is immoral and that commercial beekeeping operations can harm and even kill bees Insect products can be defined much more widely as commercial bees are used to pollinate about different food crops br br br Pet food br br Some environmental vegans do not use meat based pet food to feed their pets due to its environmental impact and ethical vegans do not use meat based pet food This is particularly true for domesticated cats and dogs for which vegan pet food is available br This practice has been met with caution and criticism especially regarding vegan cat diets because unlike omnivorous dogs felids are obligate carnivores A study found that out of commercial vegan pet food brands do not meet the Association of American Feed Control Officials AAFCO labeling regulations for amino acid adequacy A systematic review found no evidence of considerable effects on health however it was pointed out that there were issues with selection bias studies not being long term and low sample sizes and recommended larger scale studies br br br Other products and farming practices br br A concern is the case of medications which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe and may also contain animal ingredients such as lactose gelatine or stearates There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable less effective or have more adverse side effects Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines food additives cosmetics household products workplace chemicals and many other substances Vegans may avoid certain vaccines such as the flu vaccine which is commonly produced in chicken eggs An effective alternative Flublok is widely available in the United States br Farming of fruits and vegetables may include fertilizing the soil with animal manure even on organic farms possibly causing a concern to vegans for ethical or environmental reasons Vegan or animal free farming uses plant compost only br br br Animal use br br br General br Vegans oppose the use of animals for any purpose including food clothing toiletries testing and places that use animals for entertainment br br br Horseback riding br Vegans oppose horseback riding on the basis that it is unnecessary and exploitative While The Vegan Society acknowledges that there are ways to minimize cruelty in breaking a horse they believe that the fact that horses need to be broken at all shows that horses do not naturally expect to be ridden The Vegan Society also points out that in the modern age horseback riding is a hobby rather than a legitimate means of transportation br br br Zoos and aquariums br Vegans avoid visiting zoos and aquariums on the belief that they exploit animals for entertainment Some vegans may visit animal sanctuaries as an alternative br br br Pets br Vegans do not purchase pets but may adopt or rescue a domestic animal that cannot live independently Vegans do not keep exotic pets such as birds tortoises and fish believing that because they have not been domesticated they do not belong in captivity br br br Research and guidance br br Conclusions in scientific review articles range from stating benefits to concluding that evidence is not yet sufficient to identifying possible health problems One review reported moderate evidence that adhering to a vegan diet for at least weeks may be effective in individuals with overweight or type diabetes to induce a meaningful decrease in body weight and improve glycemia A second reported that vegetarian diets including vegan diets are associated with lower risk for vascular disease obesity dyslipidemia hypertension and type diabetes A third indicated that a vegan diet may be effective for reducing body weight lowering the risk of cancer and providing a lower risk of all cause mortality People on a vegan diet with diabetes or cardiovascular diseases may have lower levels of disease biomarkers A fifth concluded that In most countries a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet A sixth reported modestly reduced blood pressure br Less conclusively a Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials found that there is currently insufficient information to draw conclusions about the effects of vegan dietary interventions on cardiovascular disease risk factors There is inconsistent evidence for vegan diets providing an effect on metabolic syndrome A meta analysis of prospective cohort studies concluded that vegan diets are associated with reduced risk of ischemic heart disease but no clear association was found for cardiovascular disease and stroke There is tentative evidence of an association between vegan diets and reduced risk of cancer Vegans may be at risk of low bone mineral density br br br Positions of dietetic and government associations br br The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada say that properly planned vegetarian or vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages including pregnancy and lactation The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well planned vegan diet as viable for any age as does the British Dietetic Association British National Health Service and the Canadian Pediatric Society br As of the German Society for Nutrition DGE holds that for healthy adults a vegan diet can be healthful when B is supplemented and the diet is well planned so that critical nutrients are provided Because data is lacking the DGE does not recommend for or against vegan diets for vulnerable groups like children young people elderly and pregnant or breastfeeding women If individuals in these groups decide for a vegan diet they are suggested to seek professional advice as planning the diet in these cases is complex and irreversible consequences cannot be ruled out when the diet is not well planned The DGE highlights that a vegan diet is exceptionally environmental friendly and can reduce greenhouse cases by about while having other environmental benefits too As of of government nutritional guidelines discuss vegan meat or milk alternatives or both br br br Pregnancy infants and children br br The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics consider well planned vegetarian and vegan diets appropriate for all stages of the life cycle including pregnancy lactation infancy childhood adolescence older adulthood and for athletes The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women breastfeeding women babies children and adolescents The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that well planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal infant child and adolescent growth It is recommended that attention should be given to nutrient intake particularly protein vitamins B and D essential fatty acids iron zinc and calcium br br br Nutrients and potential deficiencies br br Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber magnesium folic acid vitamin C vitamin E iron and phytochemicals and lower in dietary energy saturated fat cholesterol omega fatty acid vitamin D calcium zinc and vitamin B As a result of the elimination of all animal products a poorly planned vegan diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies that counteract its beneficial effects and cause serious health issues some of which can only be prevented with fortified foods or dietary supplements Vitamin B supplementation is important because its deficiency can cause blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage this danger is also one of the most common in poorly planned non vegan diets br The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics states that special attention may be necessary to ensure that a vegan diet provides adequate amounts of vitamin B omega fatty acids vitamin D calcium iodine iron and zinc It also states that concern that vegans and vegan athletes may not consume an adequate amount and quality of protein is unsubstantiated br These nutrients are available in plant foods with the exception of vitamin B which can be obtained only from B fortified vegan foods or supplements Vitamin B deficiency occurs in up to of all vegans in some Asian countries Iodine may also require supplementation such as using iodized salt br br br Philosophy br br br Ethical veganism br br Ethical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism the assignment of value to individuals based on animal species membership alone Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian protectionist approach which pursues improved conditions for animals It also pertains to the rights based abolitionism which seeks to end human ownership of non humans Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic the happy meat position br Donald Watson co founder of The Vegan Society asked why he was an ethical vegan replied If an open minded honest person pursues a course long enough and listens to all the criticisms and in one s own mind can satisfactorily meet all the criticisms against that idea sooner or later one s resistance against what one sees as evil tradition has to be discarded Of bloodsports he has said that to kill creatures for fun must be the very dregs and that vivisection and animal experimentation is probably the cruelest of all Man s attack on the rest of Creation He has also said vegetarianism whilst being a necessary stepping stone between meat eating and veganism is only a stepping stone br Alex Hershaft co founder of the Farm Animal Rights Movement and Holocaust survivor says he was always bothered by the idea of hitting a beautiful living innocent animal over the head cutting him up into pieces then shoving the pieces into his mouth and that his experiences in the Nazi Holocaust allowed him to empathize with the conditions of animals in factory farms auction yards and slaughterhouses because he knows firsthand what it s like to be treated like a worthless object Several animal rights activists including Isaac Bashevis Singer Gary Yourofsky and Karen Davis have compared the cruel treatment of animals in CAFOs and slaughterhouses to the Holocaust br Law professor Gary Francione an abolitionist argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property and that veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non humans have intrinsic moral value Philosopher Tom Regan also a rights theorist argues that animals possess value as subjects of a life because they have beliefs desires memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals The right of subjects of a life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles but Regan argues that pleasure convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough Philosopher Peter Singer a protectionist and utilitarian argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival Despite this he writes that ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances and that he is not too concerned about trivial infractions br An argument by Bruce Friedrich also a protectionist holds that strict veganism harms animals because it focuses on personal purity rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can For Francione this is similar to arguing that because human rights abuses can never be eliminated we should not defend human rights in situations we control By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience he argues He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms br Philosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is subtly human centred an example of what she called human nature dualism because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature Ethical vegans want to admit non humans into the category that deserves special protection rather than recognize the ecological embeddedness of all Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an unnecessary evil from the perspective of the consumer who draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs and she strongly opposed factory farming but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan br Bioethicist Ben Mepham in his review of Francione and Garner s book The Animal Rights Debate Abolition or Regulation concludes if the aim of ethics is to choose the right or best course of action in specific circumstances all things considered it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self contradictions Or as Farlie puts it with characteristic panache to conclude that veganism is the only ethical response is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition abuse and exploitation the focus on attitudes and conditions in Western developed countries leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy culture and in some cases survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals br David Pearce a transhumanist philosopher has argued that humanity has a hedonistic imperative not merely to avoid cruelty to animals caused by humans but also to redesign the global ecosystem such that wild animal suffering in nature ceases to exist In pursuit of abolishing suffering Pearce promotes predation elimination among animals and the cross species global analogue of the welfare state Fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine predation and disease The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce s influence br A growing political philosophy that incorporates veganism as part of its revolutionary praxis is veganarchism which seeks total abolition or total liberation for all animals including humans Veganarchists identify the state as unnecessary and harmful to animals both human and non human and advocate for the adoption of veganism in a stateless society The term was popularized in by Brian A Dominick s pamphlet Animal Liberation and Social Revolution described as a vegan perspective on anarchism or an anarchist perspective on veganism br Direct action is a common practice among veganarchists and anarchists generally with groups like the Animal Liberation Front ALF the Animal Rights Militia ARM the Justice Department JD and Revolutionary Cells Animal Liberation Brigade RCALB often engaging in such activities sometimes criminally to further their goals Steven Best animal rights activist and professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at El Paso advocates this approach and has been critical of vegan activists like Francione for supporting animal liberation but not total liberation which would include not only opposition to the property status of animals but also a serious critique of capitalism the state property relations and commodification dynamics in general In particular he criticizes the focus on the simplistic and apolitical Go Vegan message directed mainly at wealthy Western audiences while ignoring people of color the working class and the poor especially in the developing world noting that for every person who becomes vegan a thousand flesh eaters arise in China India and Indonesia The faith in the singular efficacy of conjectural education and moral persuasion Best writes is no substitute for direct action mass confrontation civil disobedience alliance politics and struggle for radical change Donald Watson has said he respects the people enormously who do it believing that it s the most direct and quick way to achieve their ends Sociologist David Nibert of Wittenberg University posits that any movement towards global justice would necessitate not only the abolition of animal exploitation particularly as a food source for humans but also transitioning towards a socioeconomic alternative to the capitalist system both of which dovetail into what he calls the animal industrial complex br Some vegans also embrace the philosophy of anti natalism as they see the two as complementary in terms of harm reduction to animals and the environment br Vegan social psychologist Melanie Joy described the ideology in which people support the use and consumption of animal products as carnism as a sort of opposite to veganism br br br Exploitation concerns br br The Vegan Society has written by extension veganism promotes the development and use of animal free alternatives for the benefit of humans Many ethical vegans and vegan organizations cite the poor working conditions of slaughterhouse workers as a reason to reject animal products The first vegan activist Donald Watson has asked If these butchers and vivisectors weren t there could we perform the acts that they are doing And if we couldn t we have no right to expect them to do it on our behalf Full stop That simply compounds the issue It means that we re not just exploiting animals we re exploiting human beings br br br Dietary veganism br Some people follow a vegan diet but not other aspects of veganism Dietary veganism is limited to following a plant based diet Dietary veganism is in contrast to ethical veganism which is defined as a philosophical belief that is a protected characteristic under the UK s Equality Act Authors like Richard Twine and Breeze Harper argue that dietary veganism cannot be called veganism as veganism is more than a diet Gary L Francione has argued that the promotion of dietary veganism lacks the moral imperative expressed by Leslie J Cross an early and influential vice president of The Vegan Society who said in that veganism was the abolition of the exploitation of animals by man br The Vegan Society of Canada have criticized dietary veganism stating since veganism is not a list of ingredients there is also no such thing as a dietary vegan Veganism cannot be split into sub components this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts Others have suggested that the arguments for dietary veganism can be extended to support ethical veganism br br br Environmental veganism br br Environmental vegans focus on conservation rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing hunting trapping and farming particularly factory farming are environmentally unsustainable According to a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report Livestock s Long Shadow around of the planet s terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing The report also concluded that livestock farming mostly of cows chickens and pigs affects the air land soil water biodiversity and climate change Livestock consumed million tonnes of food in including million tonnes of fishmeal and million tonnes of cereals one third of the global cereal harvest Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken major aquatic predators because livestock eat percent of the fish that are caught br A UN report Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production argued that animal products in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant based alternatives It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage br A study determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction with species rich habitats converted to agriculture for livestock production A World Wildlife Fund study found that of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals which puts enormous strain on natural resources resulting in extensive loss of lands and species In world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for among other things promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant based foods br A study found that global adoption of plant based diets would reduce agricultural land use by billion hectares an area the size of Africa and cut total global greenhouse gas emissions by Half of this emissions reduction came from avoided emissions from animal production including methane and nitrous oxide and half from trees re growing on abandoned farmland that remove carbon dioxide from the air The authors conclude that avoiding meat and dairy is the single biggest way to reduce one s impact on Earth br The IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found that industrial agriculture and overfishing are the primary drivers of the extinction crisis with the meat and dairy industries having a substantial impact On August the IPCC released a summary of the special report which asserted that a shift towards plant based diets would help to mitigate and adapt to climate change br A study found that for high income nations alone billion tons of carbon dioxide could be removed from the air by the end of the century through a shift to plant based diets and re wilding of farmland The researchers coined the term double climate dividend to describe the effect that re wilding after a diet shift can have But they note We don t have to be purist about this even just cutting animal intake would be helpful If half of the public in richer regions cut half the animal products in their diets you re still talking about a massive opportunity in environmental outcomes and public health br A study published in Nature Food found that a vegan diet vastly decreases the impact on the environment from food production such as reducing emissions water pollution and land use by reducing the destruction of wildlife by and the usage of water by br br br Feminist veganism br br br Pioneers br One leading activist and scholar of feminist animal rights is Carol J Adams Her premier work The Sexual Politics of Meat A Feminist Vegetarian Critical Theory noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption Since its release Adams has published several other works including essays books and keynote addresses In one of her speeches Why feminist vegan now adapted from her original address at the Minding Animals conference in Newcastle Australia she said the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to her in October Other authors have echoed Adams s ideas and expanded on them Feminist scholar Angella Duvnjak wrote in Joining the Dots Some Reflections on Feminist Vegan Political Practice and Choice that she was met with opposition when she pointed out the connection between feminist and vegan ideals even though the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars br br br Animal and human abuse parallels br One of the central concepts that animates feminist veganism is the idea that there is a connection between the oppression of women and the oppression of animals For example Marjorie Spiegal compared the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery This connection is further mirrored by feminist vegan writers like Carrie Hamilton who wrote that violent rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals suggesting there is a parallel between rape and animal cruelty br br br Capitalism and feminist veganism br Feminist veganism also relates to feminist thought through the common critique of the capitalist means of production In an interview Carol J Adams highlighted meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product because it takes so much to make the product it uses up so many resources This extensive use of resources for meat production is discouraged in favor of using that productive capacity for other food products that have a less detrimental impact on the environment br br br Religious veganism br Streams within a number of religious traditions encourage veganism sometimes on ethical or environmental grounds Scholars have especially noted the growth in the st century of Jewish veganism as well as Jain veganism Some religious interpretations such as Christian vegetarianism Hindu vegetarianism and Buddhist vegetarianism also recommend or mandate a vegan diet Donald Watson argued If Jesus were alive today he d be an itinerant vegan propagandist instead of an itinerant preacher of those days spreading the message of compassion which as I see it is the only useful part of what religion has to offer and sad as it seems I doubt if we have to enroll our priest as a member of the Vegan Society br br br Black veganism br br In the U S Black veganism is a social and political philosophy as well as a diet It connects the use of nonhuman animals with other social justice concerns such as racism and with the lasting effects of slavery such as the subsistence diets of enslaved people enduring as familial and cultural food traditions Dietary changes caused by the Great Migration also meant former farmers who had previously been able to grow or forage vegetables became reliant on processed foods br According to Oakland activist AshEL Eldridge the movement is about the Black community reclaiming its food sovereignty and decolonizing Black Americans diet According to Shah the area where most vegans of color feel the greatest rift with mainstream veganism is in its failure to recognize the intersectionality with other social justice issues such as food access br br br Politics and activism br br In vegan climate activist Greta Thunberg called for more vegan food production and consumption worldwide Parties like Tierschutzpartei in Germany and PACMA in Spain have pro vegan agendas They cooperate via Animal Politics EU In the European Union meat producers and vegans debate whether vegan food products should be allowed to use terms like sausages or burgers The EU bans labeling vegan products with dairy related words like almond milk a rule instated in As of six countries in Europe apply higher value added tax VAT rates to vegan plant milk than to cow milk which pro vegan activists have called discrimination br br br Demographics br One out of Americans over consider themselves vegan or vegetarian as of January A study comparing personality traits of vegans vegetarians and omnivores found that vegans were higher in openness and agreeableness than omnivores In the below chart polls with larger sample sizes are preferred over those with smaller sample size br br br Prejudice against vegans br br br Vegan rights br In some countries vegans have some rights to meals and legal protections against discrimination br br The German police sometimes provides on duty staff with food After not being provided a vegan option in this context a vegan employee has been granted an additional food allowance br In Portugal starting in public administration canteens and cafeterias such as schools prisons and social services must offer at least one vegan option at every meal br In Ontario a province of Canada there were reports that ethical veganism became protected under the Ontario Human Rights Code following a update to legal guidance by the Ontario Human Rights Commission However said body later issued a statement that this question is for a judge or tribunal to decide on a case by case basis br In the United Kingdom an employment tribunal ruled in that the Equality Act protects ethical veganism a belief it defined as veganism that extends beyond diet to all areas of life and is motivated by a concern for animals br In the United Kingdom prisoners who are vegan must be given a vegan meal with enough nutrients to sustain a healthy life Vegan prisoners should also be given clothing which is made from non animal materials This also applies to toiletries medication and it also means that they should not have to work on prison farms involving animals br br br Symbols br br Multiple symbols have been developed to represent veganism Several are used on consumer packaging including the Vegan Society trademark and the Vegan Action logo to indicate products without animal derived ingredients Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism such as a vegan flag br br br Media depictions br Veganism is often misrepresented in media Some argue that veganism has been dismissed in news media or that clickbait culture often portrays feminists and vegans as irrational extremists This is because in Western societies meat based diets are the norm with those who avoid meat still representing a small minority with more women than men as vegan and vegetarian with women being under represented in the mass media the latter influencing more to be vegetarians Others have noted those who are vegetarian and vegan are met with acceptance tolerance or hostility after they divulge they are vegetarian or vegan There are a number of vegan stereotypes including claims they hate meat eaters are always hungry weak angry or moralistic The hatred of vegans has been termed as vegaphobia by some individuals Farhad Manjoo in stated that preachy vegans are something of a myth and argued that in pop culture and generally it is still widely acceptable to make fun of vegans br br br Literature br Often vegan or vegetarian characters are portrayed as fringe characters although other novels cast them as protagonists or encourage people to become vegetarians or vegans Some have argued that there are more vegan cookbooks than vegan literature There are also books that introduce vegan identity to children or encourage people to write for animals Also Bruce Banner in Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk and Karolina Dean in Runaways who is also known as Lucy in the Sky or L S D are vegans The latter is a lesbian a vegan and an ardent animal lover committed to a life completely free of meat and dairy br br br TV shows br Jessica Cruz Green Lantern a lead character in the animated series DC Super Hero Girls is not only pacifist but also a vegan and environmentalist resulting in her becoming friends with Pam Isley She often professes her commitment to the environment and plant based meals br The series City of Ghosts featured a chef Sonya who runs a vegan cafe in Leimert Park Los Angeles Draculaura in Monster High has also been called one of the very few outspoken vegan cartoon characters out there br br br Social media br By the s social media sites like Instagram became prominent in the promotion of veganism more than a fad with people trying to change the world by being vegan as stated by various media outlets br br br Economics of veganism br br According to a study if everyone in the U S switched to a vegan diet the country would save billion in
