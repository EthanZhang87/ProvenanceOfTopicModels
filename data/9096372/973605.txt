comprises a string of man made islands in a natural lake The islands range in size from to square metres and are linked by wooden bridges to sleeping quarters on the lake shore br Some of the islands have climbing frames available for all the animals present in this location Areas of each island have been sectioned off with hot wire to facilitate the growth of vegetation and give each island a more natural appearance On some islands areas of foraging substrate such as bark have been provided to facilitate scatter feeding br The provision of large viewing windows in the sleeping quarters gives the public access to what is generally an off show area in many zoos However there are areas where the animals can hide from the public in order to receive privacy br br The islands mentioned above are inhabited by siamangs red ruffed lemurs ring tailed lemurs spider monkeys and Celebes crested macaques Each species has unlimited access to its outdoor enclosures both day and night all year round The zoo has succeeded in breeding the primates on these islands The Celebes crested macaque group have done exceptionally well since their introduction to the island and success has also been achieved with the lemurs and siamangs br In early an orangutan escaped her enclosure She had escaped for an hour and was on top of the Sumatran tiger night house before a group of school children alerted staff That same year an orangutan named Jorong was seen rescuing an injured moorhen chick from a pond patiently coaxing the bird ashore with a leaf before gently lifting it onto grass the rescue became known to the wider public in June when a four minute video of the event was posted to YouTube br br br Family Farm br br Family Farm formerly known as City Farm originally opened in and

Michael D Higgins opened the new Sea Lion Cove habitat in June Sea Lion Cove is home to the colony of California sea lions three females Cassie Florence and Seanna and one male Nico The new saltwater habitat is the biggest and most exciting development undertaken by Dublin Zoo in recent years It is inspired by the natural environment of the California sea lions and it includes a state of the art water filtration plant br br br Nocturnal House br A nocturnal house opened in July near Sea Lion cove to accommodate nocturnal Aye Aye lemurs transferred from Bristol Zoo Aye Aye are endangered on the IUCN red list br br br Other animals br Other animals in Dublin Zoo s collection that are not part of a specific themed area include Chilean flamingos meerkats red pandas South American tapirs little egrets and waldrapp ibises br br br Conservation br br The zoo is part of a worldwide programme to breed endangered species It is a member of the European Endangered Species Programme EEP which helps the conservation of endangered species in Europe Each species supervised by the EEP has a single coordinator that is responsible for the building of breeding groups with the aim of obtaining a genetically balanced population In November the Zoo opened the National Centre for Species Survival in partnership with the IUCN in the renovated Society House beside the Meerkat Restaurant br Dublin Zoo manages the EEP for the golden lion tamarin and the Moluccan cockatoo It also houses members of the species Goeldi s monkey and the white faced saki which are part of EEPs coordinated by other zoos The focus is on conservation which includes breeding and protecting endangered species as well as research study and education br br br Rodrigues fruit bats br Rodrigues fruit bats are one of Dublin Zoo s endangered species Fruit bats as their name suggests feed on fruit and because of that are very important to the rainforest Bats cannot digest the seeds and pips of the fruit that they eat and so the seeds leave the bat s digestive system wrapped in fertilizer Without bats many rainforest trees would not be able to sow their own seeds br Dublin Zoo has recently completed a larger Asian elephant enclosure complete with Asian rainforest and the Nesbit House bat house has been demolished The Rodrigues fruit bats are now in the Roberts House or bird house which is located beside the ring tailed lemurs br br br Golden lion tamarins br This tiny monkey named for the long gold coloured hair around its head which resembles a lion s mane is one of the rarest primates in the world Golden lion tamarins like many of the other tamarins found in South America are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study tamarins in Brazil br The forests that golden lion tamarins need in order to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches farms and urbanization Sometimes very small areas or pockets of forest are left but these are too small for the tamarins to survive in In the past tamarins were collected for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories The golden lion tamarins are located in the South American house br br br Moluccan cockatoos br Dublin Zoo holds the European studbook for Moluccan cockatoos A studbook is a record of all the individuals of a particular species that are held in zoos in a region It contains information such as the sex of the animal how old it is and who its parents were This information is then used to decide which birds should be paired with which to get the best genetic mix This ensures that the captive population stays as genetically healthy as possible Moluccan cockatoos are handsome birds white with a hint of pink feathers and a pink colour on the crest This cockatoo is on the endangered species list br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
