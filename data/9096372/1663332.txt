The Ludi Romani Roman Games see ludi was a religious festival in ancient Rome Usually including multiple ceremonies called ludi They were held annually starting in BC from September to September later extended to September to September In the last st century BC an extra day was added in honor of the deified Julius Caesar on September The festival first introduced drama to Rome based on Greek drama br br br Origins br These games the chief Roman festival were held in honor of Jupiter and are said to have been established by Tarquinius Priscus on the occasion of his conquest of the Latin town of Apiolae However Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Cicero date them to the Roman victory over the Latins at Lake Regillus during the early Republic ca BC br The games were originally organized by the consuls and later by the curule aediles At first they lasted only a day A second day was added on the expulsion of the kings in BC and a third after the first secession of the plebs in BC From to BC they lasted ten days and shortly before Caesar s death they apparently lasted fifteen days from September to After Caesar s death a day was added This day must have been September because Cicero says in Against Verres that there were days from the Ludi Romani to the Ludi Victoriae Sullanae on October Thus when this speech was composed in BC September was already the last day of the Ludi Romani br In calendars of the Augustan era the days of the games are noted as September to September The Epulum Jovis was celebrated on the th and the Equorum probatio a cavalry revue on the th Circus games lasted from the th to the th In the Calendar of Philocalus AD they run from September to br br br When and why br These games were not necessarily held every year from their inception In many cases games were based on a vow votum by a military commander and were celebrated as a special festival after his triumphal procession As the army used to go forth as a general rule each summer it became customary when it returned in autumn to celebrate such games though connected with no triumph and though no signal victory had been gained But still in all cases they were celebrated as extraordinary games and not as games regularly established by law They were sollemnes customary but had not yet become annui yearly Livy identifies the two kinds the ludi magni and the ludi Romani and so do Cicero Repub ii Festus l c and Pseudo Asconius In all his other books however Livy observes a distinction which has been pointed out by Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl Parerga zu Plautus c p that ludi magni is the term applied to extraordinary games originating in a vow ludi votivi while ludi Romani is that applied to the games when they were established as annual ludi stati Ludi Romani is first used by Livy in viii see Weissenborn ad loc and after that the terms varied according as the games are stati e g x xxv or votivi The distinction drawn by Ritschl is to be considered proven but it is unclear when the established games became annual br Most probably says Mommsen the games became annual when the first curule aediles were appointed in BC as these officials distinct from the existing plebeian aediles were described as curatores ludorum sollemnium In the oldest Roman calendars which likely date from the time of the Decemvirs in BC cf Mommsen Die r mische Chronologie c p these festivals are engraved in small letters rather than capitals so they must be additions made after that time Also in BC the ludi Romani are mentioned as a regular annual festival so they must have become established by then Therefore the most reasonable date for their institution is BC when many changes in government and society were effected including the addition of one day to the games and the appointment of curule aediles to superintend them br br br Facts of Ludi Romani br Yet Livy and the other authors who identify the ludi magni and Romani are not altogether in error for the arrangement of the two kinds of games was similar An incidental proof of this is that when Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus ludi votivi in BC they lasted days Cicero In Verrem i like the ludi Romani and we find similar sums viz asses bestowed for both ludi magni and ludi Romani The actual ludi Romani consisted of first a solemn procession pompa then a chariot race in which each chariot in Homeric fashion carried a driver and a warrior the latter at the end of the race leaping out and running on foot Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities vii and cf Orelli where a charioteer is spoken of as pedibus ad quadrigam This is a practice confined to the ludi Romani In the exhibitions of riding each rider had a second horse led by the hand Festus s v Paribus Equis as it appears the Roman horsemen in early times often used two horses in battle like the Tarentini in Greek warfare Livy xxxv Such riders were called desultores br Most likely originally there was only one contest of each kind and only two competitors in each contest Liv xliv since at all periods in the Roman chariot race only as many chariots competed as there were so called factions which were originally only two the white and the red Mommsen Roman History i note These few events allowed further minor exhibitions such as boxers dancers competition in youthful horsemanship ludus Trojae It was allowed that the wreath the victor won for this in Greek style was the prize of victory should be put on his bier when dead Twelve Tables and Mommsen s remarks Staatsrecht i note Also during the festival the successful warrior in real warfare as opposed to imaginary warfare wore the spoils he had won from the enemy and was crowned with a chaplet br After the introduction of the drama in plays were acted at the ludi Romani and in BC we know that ludi scenici took up four days of the festival Liv xxiv In BC the Phormio of Terence was acted at these games br br br History of scholarship br The classic work on the Ludi Romani is Mommsen s article Die Ludi Magni
