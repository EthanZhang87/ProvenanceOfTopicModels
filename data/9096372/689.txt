Asia AY zh UK also AY sh is the largest continent in the world by both land area and population It covers an area of more than million square kilometers about of Earth s total land area and of Earth s total surface area The continent which has long been home to the majority of the human population was the site of many of the first civilizations Its billion people constitute roughly of the world s population br Asia shares the landmass of Eurasia with Europe and of Afro Eurasia with both Europe and Africa In general terms it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East West cultural linguistic and ethnic differences some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa and to the east of the Turkish Straits the Ural Mountains and Ural River and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas separating it from Europe br China and India traded places as the largest economies in the world from to CE China was a major economic power for much of recorded history with the highest GDP per capita until The Silk Road became the main east west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route Asia has exhibited economic dynamism as well as robust population growth during the th century but overall population growth has since fallen Asia was the birthplace of most of the world s mainstream religions including Hinduism Zoroastrianism Judaism Jainism Buddhism Confucianism Taoism Christianity Islam Sikhism as well as many other religions br Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups cultures environments economics historical ties and government systems It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot deserts in West Asia temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia br br br Definition and boundaries br br br Asia Africa boundary br The boundary between Asia and Africa is the Suez Canal the Gulf of Suez the Red Sea and the Bab el Mandeb This makes Egypt a transcontinental country with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa br br br Asia Europe boundary br br The threefold division of the Old World into Africa Asia and Europe has been in use since the th century BCE due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River the modern Rioni river in Georgia of Caucasus from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea a convention still followed by Herodotus in the th century BCE During the Hellenistic period this convention was revised and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais the modern Don River This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius Strabo and Ptolemy br The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics br In Sweden five years after Peter s death in Philip Johan von Strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the Ural Mountains as the border of Asia Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid th century The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains although it is sometimes placed further north br br br Asia Oceania boundary br br The border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere in the Indonesia Archipelago specifically in Eastern Indonesia The Wallace Line separates the Asian and Wallacea biogeographical realms a transition zone of deep water straits between the Asian and Australian continental shelves The Weber s Line split the region in two with regard to the balance of fauna between Asian origin or Australo Papuan origin Wallacea s eastern boundary with Sahul is represented by the Lydekker s Line The Maluku Islands except the Aru Islands are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia with the Aru Islands and Indonesian New Guinea to the east of the Lydekker s Line being wholly part of Oceania as both lie on the Australian continental plate Culturally the Wallacea region denoted the transition between Austronesian and Melanesian people with varying degrees of intermixing between the two In general the further west and coastal a region is the stronger the Austronesian influences and the further east and inland a region is the stronger the Melanesian influences The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania devised in the th century have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception The chief factor in determining which islands of the Indonesian Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there not all European Lewis and Wigen assert The narrowing of Southeast Asia to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process br br br Asia North America boundary br The Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the United States The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaskan Peninsula toward Russia s Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula Most of them are always associated with North America except for the westernmost Near Islands group which is on Asia s continental shelf beyond the North Aleutians Basin and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia which could then allow the U S state of Alaska as well as the United States itself to be considered a transcontinental state The Aleutian Islands are sometimes associated with Oceania owing to their status as remote Pacific islands and their proximity to the Pacific Plate This is extremely rare however due to their non tropical biogeography as well as their inhabitants who have historically been related to Indigenous Americans br St Lawrence Island in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America as with the Rat Islands in the Aleutian chain At their nearest points Alaska and Russia are separated by only kilometres miles br br br Ongoing definition br br Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world beginning with the Ancient Greeks being imposed onto other cultures an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means Asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents br From the time of Herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three continent system Europe Africa Asia on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them For example Sir Barry Cunliffe the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely the western excrescence of the continent of Asia br Geographically Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of Eurasia with Europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass Asia Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass Afro Eurasia except for the Suez Canal and share a common continental shelf Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia east of the Chersky Range on the North American Plate br br br Etymology br br The term Asia is believed to originate in the Bronze Age placename Assuwa Hittite romanized a u wa which originally referred only to a portion of northwestern Anatolia The term appears in Hittite records recounting how a confederation of Assuwan states including Troy unsuccessfully rebelled against the Hittite king Tudhaliya I around BCE Roughly contemporary Linear B documents contain the term aswia Mycenaean Greek romanized a si wi ja seemingly in reference to captives from the same area br br Herodotus used the term in reference to Anatolia and the territory of the Persian Empire in contrast to Greece and Egypt He reports that Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of Prometheus but that Lydians say it was named after Asies son of Cotys who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis In Greek mythology Asia or Asie was the name of a Nymph or Titan goddess of Lydia The Iliad attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer mentions two Phrygians in the Trojan War named Asios an adjective meaning Asian and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as br The term was later adopted by the Romans who used it in reference to the province of Asia located in western Anatolia One of the first writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny br br br History br br The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions East Asia South Asia Southeast Asia Central Asia and West Asia The coastal periphery was home to some of the world s earliest known civilizations each of them developing around fertile river valleys The civilizations in Mesopotamia the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel Other innovations such as writing seem to have been developed individually in each area Cities states and empires developed in these lowlands br The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo Europeans who spread their languages into West Asia South Asia and the borders of China where the Tocharians resided The northernmost part of Asia including much of Siberia was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads owing to the dense forests climate and tundra These areas remained very sparsely populated br The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe However the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force for this and other reasons the nomads who conquered states in China India and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local more affluent societies br The Islamic Caliphate s defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the th century The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the th century an area extending from China to Europe Before the Mongol invasion Song dynasty reportedly had approximately million citizens the census which followed the invasion reported roughly million people br The Black Death one of the most devastating pandemics in human history is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia where it then travelled along the Silk Road br The Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the th century and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the th century The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia most of the Middle East North Africa and the Balkans from the mid th century onwards In the th century the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the th and th centuries respectively br Western European colonisation of Asia coincided with the Industrial Revolution in the West and the dethroning of India and China as the world s foremost economies The British Empire became dominant in South Asia with large parts of the region first being conquered by British traders before falling under direct British rule extreme poverty doubled to over during this era The Middle East was contested and partitioned by the British and French while Southeast Asia was carved up between the British Dutch and French Various Western powers dominated China in what later became known as the century of humiliation with the British supported opium trade and later Opium Wars resulting in China being forced into an unprecedented situation of importing more than it exported Foreign domination of China was furthered by the Empire of Japan which controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia New Guinea and the Pacific islands during this era Japan s domination was enabled by its rapid rise that had taken place during the Meiji era of the late th century in which it applied industrial knowledge learned from the West and thus overtook the rest of Asia br With the end of World War II in and the wartime ruination of Europe and imperial Japan many countries in Asia were able to rapidly free themselves of colonial rule The independence of India came along with the carving out of a separate nation for the majority of Indian Muslims which today has become the countries Pakistan and Bangladesh br Some Arab countries took economic advantage of massive oil deposits that were discovered in their territory becoming globally influential East Asian nations along with Singapore in Southeast Asia became economically prosperous with high growth tiger economies with China regaining its place among the top two economies of the world by the st century India has grown significantly because of economic liberalisation that started in the s with extreme poverty now below br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Geography br br Asia is the largest continent on Earth It covers of the Earth s total surface area or of its land area and has the longest coastline at kilometres mi Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four fifths of Eurasia It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains and south of the Caucasus Mountains or the Kuma Manych Depression and the Caspian and Black Seas It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean Asia is subdivided into countries five of them Georgia Azerbaijan Russia Kazakhstan and Turkey are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe Geographically Russia is partly in Asia but is considered a European nation both culturally and politically br The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Main regions br br There are various approaches to the regional division of Asia The following subdivision into regions is used among others by the UN statistics agency UNSD This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories br br North Asia Siberia br Central Asia br West Asia The Middle East or Near East and part of the Caucasus br South Asia br East Asia Far East br Southeast Asia East Indies and Indochina br br br Climate br br Asia has extremely diverse climate features Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia It is moist across southeast sections and dry across much of the interior Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer Southwestern sections of the continent are hot Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan br br br Climate change br br br Economy br br Asia has the largest continental economy in the world by both GDP nominal and PPP values and is the fastest growing economic region As of China is by far the largest economy on the continent making up nearly half of the continent s economy by GDP nominal It is followed by Japan India South Korea Indonesia Saudi Arabia and Turkey which are all ranked amongst the top largest economies both by nominal and PPP values Based on Global Office Locations Asia dominated the office locations with of the top being in Asia Hong Kong Singapore Tokyo and Seoul Around percent of international firms have an office in Hong Kong br In the late s and early s the economy of China had an average annual growth rate of more than According to economic historian Angus Maddison India had the world s largest economy during BCE and CE India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the st until th century contributing of the world s industrial output China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second largest of any single nation in the world after surpassing the Soviet Union measured in net material product in and Germany in NB A number of supernational economies are larger such as the European Union EU the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA or APEC This ended in when China overtook Japan to become the world s second largest economy It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by br In the late s and early s Japan s GDP by currency exchange rates was almost as large as that of the rest of Asia combined In Japan s economy nearly equaled that of the US as the largest economy in the world for a day after the Japanese currency reached a record high of yen US Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea Taiwan Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim known as the Asian tigers which are now all considered developed economies having amongst the highest GDP per capita in Asia br br Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin and it is rich in natural resources such as petroleum forests fish water rice copper and silver Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia particularly in China Taiwan South Korea Japan India the Philippines and Singapore Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads Many companies from Europe North America South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia s developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure br According to Citigroup in of Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth They are Bangladesh China India Indonesia Iraq Mongolia the Philippines Sri Lanka and Vietnam Asia has three main financial centers Hong Kong Tokyo and Singapore Call centers and business process outsourcing BPOs are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled English speaking workers The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry India has become a major hub for outsourcing br Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia Individual main routes have emerged from this The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Mal to East Africa Mombasa from there to Djibouti then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean there via Haifa Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach In contrast to the sea routes the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope Intra Asian trade including sea trade is growing rapidly br In Asia had million millionaires people with net worth over US million excluding their homes slightly below North America with million millionaires In Asia topped Europe in number of millionaires br Citigroup in The Wealth Report stated that Asian centa millionaire overtook North America s wealth for the first time as the world s economic center of gravity continued moving east At the end of there were Asian people mainly in Southeast Asia China and Japan who have at least million in disposable assets while North America with people and Western Europe with people br br br Tourism br br With growing

of any region in the world nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past years according to the report s analysis of health education and income data China the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since br is the only country on the Top Movers list due to income rather than health or education achievements Its per capita income increased a stunning fold over the last four decades also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty Yet it was not among the region s top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy br Nepal a South Asian country emerges as one of the world s fastest movers since mainly due to health and education achievements Its present life expectancy is years longer than in the s More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school compared to just one in five years ago br Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI number in the world which is in the very high human development category followed by Singapore Japan and South Korea Afghanistan ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the countries assessed br br br Languages br br Asia is home to several language families and many language isolates Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken For instance according to Ethnologue more than languages are spoken in Indonesia more than languages spoken in India and more than are spoken in the Philippines China has many languages and dialects in different provinces br br br Religions br br Many of the world s major religions have their origins in Asia including the five most practiced in the world excluding irreligion which are Christianity Islam Hinduism Chinese folk religion classified as Confucianism and Taoism and Buddhism Asian mythology is complex and diverse The story of the Great Flood for example as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah and later to Christians in the Old Testament and to Muslims in the Quran is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology in the En ma Eli and Epic of Gilgamesh Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control br br

Assyrian people or Syriac Christians Vibrant indigenous minorities in West Asia are adhering to the Eastern Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodoxy Saint Thomas Christians in India trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the st century Significant Christian communities also found in Central Asia South Asia Southeast Asia and East Asia br Islam which originated in the Hejaz located in modern day Saudi Arabia is the second largest and most widely spread religion in Asia with at least billion Muslims constituting around of the total population of Asia With of the world Muslim population the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is Indonesia followed by Pakistan India Bangladesh Iran and Turkey Mecca Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina Iran is the largest Shi a country br The Druze

Faith originated in Asia in Iran Persia and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire Central Asia India and Burma during the lifetime of Bah u ll h Since the middle of the th century growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries because Bah activities in many Muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities Lotus Temple is a big Bah temple in India br br br Indian and East Asian religions br br Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits whereas another school of thought from India C rv ka preached the enjoyment of the material world The

Lanka Laos and Mongolia Taiwan South Korea Malaysia Nepal Vietnam China North Korea and small communities in India and Bangladesh The Communist governed countries of China Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under reported br Jainism is found mainly in India and in overseas Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia especially Southeast Asia Confucianism is found predominantly in mainland China South Korea Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations Taoism is found mainly in mainland China Taiwan Malaysia and Singapore In many Chinese communities Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism thus

Asia Southeast Asia and West Asia These regions are defined by their cultural similarities including common religions languages and ethnicities West Asia also known as Southwest Asia or the Middle East has cultural roots in the ancient civilizations of the Fertile Crescent and Mesopotamia which gave rise to the Persian Arab Ottoman empires as well as the Abrahamic religions of Judaism Christianity and Islam These civilizations which are located in the Hilly flanks are among the oldest in the world with evidence of farming dating back to around BCE Despite the challenges posed by the vast size of the continent and the presence of natural barriers such as deserts and mountain ranges trade and commerce have helped to create a Pan Asian culture that is shared across the region br
