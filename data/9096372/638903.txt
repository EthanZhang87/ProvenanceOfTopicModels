version to every story br Assume the viewer is as smart and as caring and as good a person as I am br Assume the same about all people on whom I report br Assume personal lives are a private matter until a legitimate turn in the story absolutely mandates otherwise br Carefully separate opinion and analysis from straight news stories and clearly label everything br Do not use anonymous sources or blind quotes except on rare and monumental occasions br No one should ever be allowed to attack another anonymously br And finally I am not in the entertainment business br br br On air staff br br br

are making history on PBS David Leonard and Micah Schwalb of The Denver Post wrote One of the most trusted news programs on television Phil Owen of TheWrap wrote The least partisan analysis Tim Surette of TV Guide wrote The calm and credible information we need Jennifer Gerson of The th wrote Nawaz is stepping into history br In UCLA political scientist Tim Groseclose and Missouri economist Jeff Milyo evaluated various media programs based on think tank citations to map liberal versus conservative media slants and published a study alleging liberal media bias in general Based on their research PBS News Hour is the most centrist news program on television and the closest to a truly objective stance However their methodology has been questioned br br br FAIR study br In October the media criticism group Fairness Accuracy in Reporting FAIR accused the PBS News Hour of lacking balance diversity and viewpoints of the general public and for presenting corporate viewpoints FAIR found that the PBS News Hour s guest list from October to March had Republicans outnumbering Democrats and minorities accounting for percent of U S based sources FAIR also protested in when Liberty Media purchased a majority of the program citing Liberty s majority owner John Malone for his Machiavellian business tactics and right wing sentiments br News Hour executive producer Linda Winslow responded to many aspects br br FAIR seems to be accusing us of covering the people who make decisions that affect people s lives many of whom work in government the military or corporate America That s what we do we re a news program and that s who makes news I take issue with the way the FAIR report characterizes each guest which they have obviously done very subjectively Witness the trashing of Mark Shields and Tom Oliphant in the full report who are not liberal enough for FAIR s taste When you get down to arguing about degrees of left and rightness I think you undermine your own argument br She also accused FAIR of counting sound bites as interviews thereby skewing their numbers toward the political party holding a majority at the time of FAIR s report Republican Party br br br Partnership with NPR br The PBS News Hour partnered with NPR for the broadcast of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions of in a strategy to prepare for the election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton br br br br br br External links br Official website br PBS NewsHour Archived from the original on May Retrieved November br PBS NewsHour Archived from the original on June Retrieved November
