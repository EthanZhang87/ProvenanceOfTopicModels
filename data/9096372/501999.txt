buildings contained thatched roofs assembled by Zulu workers from South Africa About hand painted wooden horses were crafted in Bali under Disney supervision Parts of the park were designed to have an

exist in today s reality those that did exist but are now extinct i e dinosaurs and those that only exist in the realm of fantasy such as unicorns and dragons The original design for Animal Kingdom included a themed section called Beastly Kingdom devoted to creatures of legend and mythology During the final stages of planning of development Eisner decided that either Beastly Kingdom or DinoLand U S A would be built first because of budget cuts after the failure of Euro Disney known today as Disneyland Paris and the higher cost of the upkeep and care of the animals at the park DinoLand U S A was chosen first mostly because of its lower budget In Rohde said We had a vision and now it s become a placeholder We have all kinds of ideas and not all of them fit with the theme of Beastly Kingdom

balloons to be used in the park unlike the rest of the Disney parks This is so that plastic does not inadvertently enter an animal s habitat and hurt them Instead the park uses biodegradable paper straws and offers lids for hot drinks only The restrooms at Disney s Animal Kingdom all have doors at their entrances This practice is in place so that in the event of an animal escaping guests are able to shelter safely inside br br br Conservation efforts br br As a zoological park Disney s Animal Kingdom is engaged in research and conservation efforts involving its animal species Since the

eleven br In one of the park s white rhinoceros gave birth to a female calf named Nande In Nande and Hasani another of the park s rhinos were transferred to Uganda s Ziwa animal sanctuary in the first

when the park originally opened citing Walt Disney World s previous missteps in handling animals at the defunct Discovery Island The groups protested and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park On opening day the Orange County Sheriff s office sent about deputies about two dozen protesters showed up The protest lasted two hours and there were no arrests br Following a U S Department of Agriculture USDA inspection of the park it was revealed that animals died at Animal Kingdom between September and April from accidents poisonings fights and other causes Two Asian small clawed otters died after ingesting loquat seeds from trees planted in their exhibit two cheetah cubs died from ethylene glycol poisoning nine herd animals died from injuries caused by fights being entangled in fences while trying to escape and in one case being kicked by an ostrich Two crowned cranes were killed after being run over by safari vehicles in two separate incidents The USDA ultimately found no violations of animal welfare regulations Disney responded to the report by hiring additional security to prevent animals from fighting relocating the crowned cranes to walking paths as well as adding mirrors to the safari vehicles br One year after the park opened Animal Rights Foundation of Florida complained that a New Year s Eve fireworks show could upset the animals A USDA inspector came to the park and found no problems with launching low noise fireworks half a mile away In January the animal rights group In Defense of Animals listed the park at number on its list of worst zoos for elephants br br br Incidents br In October a snake dropped out of a tree and bit a boy precipitating the death of his great grandmother who suffered a cardiac arrest as a reaction to
