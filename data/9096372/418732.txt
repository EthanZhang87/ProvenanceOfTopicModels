Zhuoye in It is a major theme park competitor to Six Flags Cedar Fair Disney Experiences and Universal Destinations Experiences br The parks marine mammal collections have been the subject of public debate and criticism over the years with critics saying that the park s practices entail animal abuse The documentary film Blackfish produced after a SeaWorld Orlando trainer was killed by one of the park s orcas led to initial decreases in attendance profits and the company s share price In SeaWorld s attendance and revenue began to recover with the addition of new rides shows and animal exhibits at its parks as well as increased marketing about the parks conservation and rescue efforts br In SeaWorld announced that they would end their in park orca breeding program and eventually phase out their theatrical orca shows altogether due to state legislation in California that banned shows using orcas starting in San Diego It was announced later in the same year that SeaWorld would build their first park without killer whales and outside of the United States in Abu Dhabi However in SeaWorld reversed course and started introducing new orca live shows to guests br br br History br br SeaWorld was founded in by Milton Shedd Ken Norris David Demott and George Millay The four graduates of UCLA originally set out to build an underwater restaurant and marine life show When the underwater restaurant concept was deemed unfeasible they scrapped those plans and decided to build a park instead and SeaWorld San Diego was opened on March With only a few dolphins sea lions attractions and acres m the park proved to be a success and more than guests visited in the first months br After considering other locations in the midwest including the Lake Milton Newton Falls area west of Youngstown Ohio it was decided that Aurora Ohio would be the new home of a SeaWorld The park opened on May The Aurora site was approximately miles km northwest of the Lake Milton site and miles km southeast of Cleveland By this time the founders of the company had captured a few more species of animals including a killer whale that was brought to the new facility The harsh winter climate permitted the park to be open only from mid May until mid September br The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando Florida opened near the end of the second operating season of SeaWorld Ohio The success of Disney in Orlando provided a location that was already popular with tourists SeaWorld Orlando opened in br Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc HBJ purchased the company in and years later they

Corporation BPCC made an unsolicited bid to acquire HBJ HBJ defended itself from the hostile takeover attempt by going deeply into debt to make large cash payments to shareholders The strain of the debt from fighting off the takeover as well as a strategic decision to re focus on HBJ s core publishing and insurance businesses were factors in HBJ s decision to sell its theme park holdings in br The Anheuser Busch Company made an offer to purchase the SeaWorld parks HBJ also owned and operated two other parks Cypress Gardens and Boardwalk and Baseball and out of fear of not being able to find a buyer for the two other parks HBJ refused to sell the parks individually Despite a long negotiation Anheuser Busch bought all six parks in SeaWorld in San Diego Aurora Orlando and San Antonio as well as Cypress Gardens in Winter Haven and Boardwalk and Baseball in Haines City Soon after the sale was final Busch sold Cypress Gardens to the park s management and closed Boardwalk and Baseball

Entertainment Company operators of the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky Ohio Cedar Fair took the park back to its original Geauga Lake name and stripped the park itself of all Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding including walk around character costumes pertaining to either franchise since the company did not have licensing rights Since Six Flags retained ownership of the animals the

announced its plans for the non operational side That entire portion of the land would become an immense waterpark Wildwater Kingdom opening in two phases with the first phase in followed by the

San Antonio Kyuquot Takara Sakari Tuar and Kamea br Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society campaign against the captivity of dolphins and killer whales SeaWorld which holds most of the world s captive killer whales is cited for its role br Killer whale captivity is a widely debated topic Regarding anatomy captive killer whales can exhibit collapsed dorsal fins However this trait has been witnessed in the wild and a prominent theory proposes this phenomenon can occur when any orcas live in relatively warmer conditions Though since captive orcas are more likely to breach rising up to warmer waters captivity itself can increase the temperature in which these whales live Some evidence has shown that the condition can manifest in individuals after a month in captivity Some argue that aggression among captive killer whales is common whilst others claim that this also occurs in the wild In August a dominant female killer whale Kandu V attempted to rake a newcomer whale Corky II with her mouth during a live show and smashed her head into a wall Kandu V broke her jaw which severed an artery and then bled to death In November a dominant female killer whale Kasatka repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters to the bottom of the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools In February an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando Dawn Brancheau was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium The whale had been associated with the deaths of two

an year old SeaWorld orca Unna died from a fungal infection at the SeaWorld Park in San Antonio Texas br br br Blackfish br br In SeaWorld s treatment of killer whales in captivity was the basis of the film Blackfish which documents the history of Tilikum a killer whale captured by SeaLand of the Pacific later rescued by SeaWorld Orlando who has been involved in the deaths of three people In the aftermath of the release of the film Martina McBride Special REO Speedwagon Cheap Trick Heart Barenaked Ladies Trisha Yearwood and Willie Nelson canceled scheduled concerts at SeaWorld parks SeaWorld disputes the accuracy of the film calling it propaganda and emotionally manipulative It has spent million on an advertising campaign countering the allegations and emphasizing its contributions to the study of whales and their conservation br In August SeaWorld announced it planned to build new killer whale tanks that would be almost double the size of the existing ones to provide more space for its whales scheduled for completion in The company maintained the move was not in response to the release of the Blackfish documentary Wild killer whales may travel up to kilometres mi in a day and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity In it was announced by SeaWorld that they no longer had plans to complete the expansion project PETA which opposes whales being kept in captivity has proposed the theme park operator base its whales in seaside sanctuaries The company also pledged million in matching funds for killer whale research The plans to increase the size of the tanks in San Diego were put on hold in October after the California Coastal Commission ruled that the work could only go ahead if they banned captive breeding which would eventually lead to end of killer whale shows at the park On March SeaWorld announced the end of their breeding program which signifies the last generation of orcas in captivity in their care though Takara was still pregnant at the time Theatrical orca shows ended at SeaWorld San Diego in and ended in Orlando and San Antonio in br In November SeaWorld announced that attendance at the parks had

Entertainment has rescued and helped more than animals including ill orphaned or abandoned and injured manatees dolphins pilot whales sea turtles and birds As part of its animal rehabilitation program SeaWorld has claimed the first birth of a killer whale in captivity the first birth of a marine mammal via artificial insemination and the first hatching of captive green sea turtles While acknowledging the value of these programs critics and animal rights advocates have questioned SeaWorld s balance of conservation and education alongside the commercial activities of its theme parks In SeaWorld with the help of the US Coast Guard released the gray whale J J after the whale was rehabilitated at SeaWorld San Diego for months br Groups concerned for the health and safety of SeaWorld s captive killer whale population have asked for the animals to be released SeaWorld has defended their decision to keep the animals by citing their inability to survive in the wild after years of captivity br br br Response to drive hunt capture allegations br In response to claims leveled at SeaWorld and other marine parks by the movie The Cove which accuses them of obtaining dolphins taken in drive hunts SeaWorld spokesperson Fred Jacobs stated that We think we re being unfairly criticized for something we re opposed to It is illegal to bring drive hunt animals into the United States He adds that SeaWorld opposes the dolphin hunts documented in The Cove We do not purchase any animals from these hunts More than percent of the marine mammals in our care were born in our parks We haven t collected a dolphin from the wild in decades Since there have been no permits issued to facilities in the United States to import dolphins acquired through drive hunt methods Marilee Menard the executive director of the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums has also stated that she believes that The Cove filmmakers are misrepresenting that the majority of zoos and aquariums with dolphins around the world are taking these animals br br br br See also br Incidents at SeaWorld parks br Captive killer whales br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Hanashiro
