The Asian elephant Elephas maximus also known as the Asiatic elephant is a species of elephant distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east and Nepal in the north to Sumatra in the south Three subspecies are recognised E m maximus E m indicus and E m sumatranus The Asian elephant is characterised by its long trunk with a single finger like processing large tusks in males laterally folded large ears but smaller in contrast to African elephants and wrinkled grey skin The skin is smoother than African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk ears or neck Adult males average t long tons short tons in weight and females t long tons short tons br It is one of only three living species of elephants or elephantids anywhere in the world the others being the African bush elephant and African forest elephant and the only living species of the genus Elephas It is the second largest species of elephant after the African bush elephant It frequently inhabits grasslands tropical evergreen forests semi evergreen forests moist deciduous forests dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests They are herbivorous eating about kg lb of vegetation per day Cows and calves form groups while males remain solitary or form bachelor groups with other males During the breeding season males will temporarily join female groups to mate Asian elephants have a large and well developed neocortex of the brain are highly intelligent and self aware being able to display behaviors associated grief learning greeting etc br The Asian elephant is the largest living land animal in Asia Since the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the population has declined by at least per cent over the last three elephant generations which is about years It is primarily threatened by loss of habitat habitat degradation fragmentation and poaching Wild Asian elephants live to be about years old While female captive elephants are recorded to have lived beyond years when kept in semi natural surroundings Asian elephants die at a much younger age in captivity captive populations are declining due to a low birth and high death rate The earliest indications of captive use of Asian elephants are engravings on seals of the Indus Valley civilisation dated to the rd millennium BC br br br Taxonomy br Carl Linnaeus proposed the scientific name Elephas maximus in for an elephant from Ceylon Elephas indicus was proposed by Georges Cuvier in who described an elephant from India Coenraad Jacob Temminck named an elephant from Sumatra Elephas sumatranus in Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian elephant in These three subspecies are currently recognised as valid taxa Results of phylogeographic and morphological analyses indicate that the Sri Lankan and Indian elephants are not distinct enough to warrant classification as separate subspecies br Three subspecies are recognised br br Sri Lankan elephant E maximus maximus Linnaeus br br Indian elephant E maximus indicus Cuvier br br Sumatran elephant E maximus sumatranus Temminck br br Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies Their skin colour is darker than of E m indicus and of E m sumatranus with larger and more distinct patches of depigmentation on ears face trunk and belly The skin color of the Indian elephant is generally grey and lighter than that of E m maximus but darker than that of E m sumatranus br A potential fourth subspecies the Borneo elephant Elephas maximus borneensis occurs in Borneo s northeastern parts primarily in Sabah Malaysia and sometimes in Kalimantan Indonesia It was proposed by Paules Deraniyagala in who described an elephant in an illustration published in the National Geographic magazine but not as a living elephant in accordance with the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature These elephants living in northern Borneo are smaller than all the other subspecies but had larger ears a longer tail and straight tusks Results of genetic analysis indicate that their ancestors separated from the mainland population about years ago A study in using mitochondrial DNA analysis and microsatellite data indicated that the Borneo elephant population is derived from stock that originated in the region of the Sunda Islands and suggests that the Borneo population has been separated from the other elephant populations of southeast Asia since the Pleistocene br The following Asian elephants were proposed as extinct subspecies but are now considered synonymous with the Indian elephant br br Syrian elephant E m asurus proposed by Deraniyagala based on fossil remains and Bronze Age illustrations br Chinese elephant E m rubridens also proposed by Deraniyagala based on a Chinese bronze statuette br Javan elephant E m sondaicus also proposed by Deraniyagala based on an illustration of a carving on the Buddhist monument of Borobudur br br br Evolution br The genus Elephas of which the Asian elephant is the only living member is the closest relative of the extinct mammoths The two groups are estimated to have split from each other around million years ago Elephas originated in Sub Saharan Africa during the Pliocene and spread throughout Africa before expanding into the southern half of Asia The earliest Elephas species Elephas ekorensis is known from the Early Pliocene of East Africa around million years ago The oldest remains of the genus in Asia are known from the Siwalik Hills in the Indian subcontinent dating to the late Pliocene around million years ago assigned to the species Elephas planifrons The modern Asian elephant is suggested to have evolved from the species Elephas hysudricus which first appeared at the beginning of the Early Pleistocene around million years ago and is primarily known from remains of Early Middle Pleistocene age found on the Indian subcontinent Skeletal remains of E m asurus have been recorded from the Middle East Iran Iraq Syria and Turkey from periods dating between at least BC and likely BC br br br Description br br In general the Asian elephant is smaller than the African bush elephant and has the highest body point on the head The back is convex or level The ears are small with dorsal borders folded laterally It has up to pairs of ribs and caudal vertebrae The feet have five nail like structures on each forefoot and four on each hind foot The forehead has two hemispherical bulges unlike the flat front of the African elephants Its long trunk or proboscis has only one fingerlike tip in contrast to the African elephants which have two Hence the Asian species relies more on wrapping around a food item and squeezing it into its mouth rather than grasping with the tip Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks Cows usually lack tusks if tusks in that case called tushes are present they are barely visible and only seen when the mouth is open The enamel plates of the molars are greater in number and closer together in Asian elephants Some bulls may also lack tusks these individuals are called makhnas and are especially common among the Sri Lankan elephant population A tusk from an ft m tall elephant killed by Sir Victor Brooke measured ft m in length and nearly in cm in circumference and weighed lb kg This tusk s weight is however exceeded by the weight of a shorter tusk of about ft m in length which weighed lb kg and there have reportedly been tusks weighing over lb kg br br Skin colour is usually grey and may be masked by soil because of dusting and wallowing Their wrinkled skin is movable and contains many nerve centres It is smoother than that of African elephants and may be depigmented on the trunk ears or neck The epidermis and dermis of the body average mm in thick skin on the dorsum is mm in thick providing protection against bites bumps and adverse weather Its folds increase surface area for heat dissipation They can tolerate cold better than excessive heat Skin temperature varies from to C to F Body temperature averages C F br br br Size br On average when fully grown bulls are about m ft tall at the shoulder and t short tons in weight while cows are smaller at about m ft at the shoulder and t short tons in weight Sexual dimorphism in body size is relatively less pronounced in Asian elephants than in African bush elephants with bulls averaging and taller in the former and latter respectively Length of body and head including trunk is m ft with the tail being m ft long The largest bull elephant ever recorded was shot by the Maharajah of Susang in the Garo Hills of Assam India in it weighed an estimated t short tons stood m ft tall at the shoulder and was m ft long from head to tail There are reports of larger individuals as tall as m ft br br br Distribution and habitat br br Asian elephants are distributed throughout the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia from India in the west to Borneo in the east and Nepal in the north to Sumatra in the south They inhabit grasslands tropical evergreen forests semi evergreen forests moist deciduous forests dry deciduous forests and dry thorn forests in addition to cultivated and secondary forests and scrublands Over this range of habitat types elephants occur from sea level to over m ft In the eastern Himalaya in northeast India they regularly move up above m ft in summer at a few sites br In Bangladesh some isolated populations survived in the south east Chittagong Hills in the early s In Malaysia s northern Johor and Terengganu National Park two Asian elephants tracked using satellite tracking technology spent most of their time in secondary or logged over forest they travelled of their time in an area less than km mi away from a water source In China the Asian elephant survives only in the prefectures of Xishuangbanna Simao and Lincang of southern Yunnan As of the estimated population was around individuals br As of the estimated wild population in India account for nearly three fourths of the extant population at individuals In the Asian elephant population in India increased to an estimated individuals As of the global wild population was estimated at individuals br br br Ecology and behaviour br br Asian elephants are crepuscular They are classified as megaherbivores and consume up to kg lb of plant matter per day Around to of the day is devoted to eating They are generalist feeders and are both grazers and browsers They are known to feed on at least different plant species most commonly of the order Malvales as well as the legume palm sedge and true grass families They browse more in the dry season with bark constituting a major part of their diet in the cool part of that season They drink at least once a day and are never far from a permanent source of fresh water They need litres of water a day and use even more for bathing At times they scrape the soil for clay or minerals br br Cows and calves move about together as groups while bulls disperse from their mothers upon reaching adolescence Bulls are solitary or form temporary bachelor groups Cow calf units generally tend to be small typically consisting of three adults most likely related females and their offspring Larger groups of as many as adult females have also been recorded Seasonal aggregations of individuals including calves and young adults have been observed in Sri Lanka s Uda Walawe National Park Until recently Asian elephants like African elephants were thought to be under the leadership of older adult females or matriarchs It is now recognized that cows form extensive and very fluid social networks with varying degrees of associations between individuals Social ties generally tend to be weaker than in African bush elephants Unlike African elephants which rarely use their forefeet for anything other than digging or scraping soil Asian elephants are more agile at using their feet in conjunction with the trunk for manipulating objects They can sometimes be known for their violent behavior br br Asian elephants are recorded to make three basic sounds growls squeaks and snorts Growls in their basic form are used for short distance communication During mild arousal growls resonate in the trunk and become rumbles while for long distance communication they escalate into roars Low frequency growls are infrasonic and made in many contexts Squeaks come in two forms chirpings and trumpets Chirping consists of multiple short squeaks and signals conflict and nervousness Trumpets are lengthened squeaks with increased loudness and are produced during extreme arousal Snorts signal changes in activity and increase in loudness during mild or strong arousal During the latter case when an elephant bounces the tip of the trunk it creates booms which serve as threat displays Elephants can distinguish low amplitude sounds br Rarely tigers have been recorded attacking and killing calves especially if the calves become separated from their mothers stranded from their herd or orphaned Adults are largely invulnerable to natural predation There is a singular anecdotal case of a mother Asian elephant allegedly being killed alongside her calf however this account is contestable In and two instances were recorded of tigers successfully killing adult elephants one by a single tiger in Jim Corbett National Park on a year old young adult elephant cow and another on a year old sick adult bull in Kaziranga National Park further east which was taken down and eaten by several tigers hunting cooperatively Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller predators like leopards they react to leopards less fearfully and more aggressively br br br Reproduction br br Reproduction in Asian elephants can be attributed to the production and perception of signaling compounds called pheromones These signals are transmitted through various bodily fluids They are commonly released in urine but in males they are also found in special secretions from the temporal glands Once integrated and perceived these signals provide the receiver with information about the reproductive status of the sender If both parties are ready to breed reproductive ritualic behavior occurs and the process of sexual reproduction proceeds br br Bulls will fight one another to get access to oestrus cows Strong fights over access to females are extremely rare Bulls reach sexual maturity around the age of Between the ages of and years bulls undergo an annual phenomenon known as musth This is a period where the testosterone level is up to times greater than non musth periods and they become aggressive Secretions containing pheromones occur during this period from the paired temporal glands located on the head between the lateral edge of the eye and the base of the ear The aggressive behaviors observed during musth can be attributed to varying amounts of frontalin dimethyl dioxabicyclo octane throughout the maturation process of bulls Frontalin is a pheromone that was first isolated in bark beetles but can also be produced in the bulls of both Asian and African Elephants The compound can be excreted through urine as well as through the temporal glands of the bull allowing signaling to occur During musth increased concentrations of frontalin in the bull s urine communicate the reproductive status of the bull to female elephants br Similar to other mammals hormone secretion in female elephants is regulated by an estrous cycle This cycle is regulated by surges in Luteinizing hormone that are observed three weeks from each other This type of estrous cycle has also been observed in African Elephants but is not known to affect other mammals The first surge in Luteinizing hormone is not followed by the release of an egg from the ovaries However some female elephants still exhibit the expected mating protocols during this surge Female elephants give ovulatory cues by utilizing sex pheromones A principal component thereof Z dodecen yl acetate has also been found to be a sex pheromone in numerous species of insects In both insects and elephants this chemical compound is used as an attractant to assist the mating process In elephants the chemical is secreted through urination and this aids in the attraction of bulls to mate Once detected the chemical stimulates the vomeronasal organ of the bull thus providing information on the maturity of the female br Reproductive signaling exchange between male and female elephants are transmitted through olfactory cues in bodily fluids In males the increase in frontalin during musth heightens their sensitivity to the Z dodecen yl acetate produced by female elephants Once perceived by receptors in the trunk a sequence of ritualistic behaviors follow The responses in males vary based on both the stage of development and the temperament of the elephant This process of receiving and processing signals through the trunk is referred to as flehmen The difference in body movements give cues to gauge if the male is interested in breeding with the female that produced the secretion A bull that is ready to breed will move closer to the urine and in some cases an erection response is elicited A bull that is not ready to breed will be timid and try to dissociate themselves from the signal In addition to reproductive communication chemosensory signaling is used to facilitate same sex interactions When less developed males detect pheromones from a male in musth they often retreat to avoid coming in contact with aggressive behaviors Female elephants have also been seen to communicate with each other through pheromone in urine The purpose of this type of intersex communication is still being investigated However there are clear differences in signaling strength and receiver response throughout different stages of the estrous cycle br br The gestation period is months and the cow gives birth to one calf only occasionally twins The calf is fully developed by the th month but stays in the womb to grow so that it can reach its mother to feed At birth the calf weighs about kg lb and is suckled for up to three years Once a female gives birth she usually does not breed again until the first calf is weaned resulting in a four to five year birth interval During this period mother to calf communication primarily takes place through temporal means However male calves have been known to develop sex pheromone producing organs at a young age Early maturity of the vomeronasal organ allows immature elephants to produce and receive pheromones It is unlikely that the integration of these pheromones will result in a flehmen response in a calf Females stay on with the herd but mature males are chased away br Female Asian elephants sexually mature around the age of and keep growing until while males fully mature at more than the age of and constantly grow throughout their life Average elephant life expectancy is years in the wild and in captivity although this has been exaggerated in the past Generation length of the Asian elephant is years br br br Intelligence br br Asian elephants have a very large and highly developed neocortex a trait also shared by humans apes and certain dolphin species They have a greater volume of cerebral cortex available for cognitive processing than all other existing land animals Results of studies indicate that Asian elephants have cognitive abilities for tool use and tool making similar to great apes They exhibit a wide variety of behaviours including those associated with grief learning allomothering mimicry play altruism use of tools compassion cooperation self awareness memory and language Elephants reportedly head to safer ground during natural disasters like tsunamis and earthquakes but data from two satellite collared Sri Lankan elephants indicate this may be untrue Several students of elephant cognition and neuroanatomy are convinced that Asian elephants are highly intelligent and self aware Others contest this view br br br Threats br The pre eminent threats to the Asian elephant today are the loss degradation and fragmentation of its habitat which leads to increasing conflicts between humans and elephants Asian elephants are poached for ivory and a variety of other products including meat and leather The demand for elephant skin has risen due to it being an increasingly common ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine br br br Human elephant conflict br br In some parts of Asia people and elephants have co existed for thousands of years In other areas people and elephants come into conflict resulting in violence and ultimately the displacement of elephants The main causes of human elephant conflict includes the growing human population large scale development projects and poor top down governance Proximate causes includes habitat loss due to deforestation disruption of elephant migratory routes expansion of agriculture and illegal encroachment into protected areas br Destruction of forests through logging encroachment slash and burn shifting cultivation and monoculture tree plantations are major threats to the survival of elephants Human elephant conflicts occur when elephants raid crops of shifting cultivators in fields which are scattered over a large area interspersed with forests Depredation in human settlements is another major area of human elephant conflict occurring in small forest pockets encroachments into elephant habitat and on elephant migration routes However studies in Sri Lanka indicate that traditional slash and burn agriculture may create optimal habitat for elephants by creating a mosaic of successional stage vegetation Populations inhabiting small habitat fragments are much more liable to come into conflict with humans br Development such as border fencing along the India Bangladesh border has become a major impediment to the free movement of elephants In Assam more than humans and elephants died as a result of human elephant conflict between and In a study it was estimated that in India alone over people were killed by elephants each year and to million hectares were damaged affecting at least families across the country Moreover elephants are known to destroy crops worth up to US million annually This has major impacts on the welfare and livelihoods of local communities as well as the future conservation of this species In countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka the Asian elephant is one of the most feared wild animals even though they are less deadly than other local animals such as venomous snakes which were estimated to claim more than times more lives in Sri Lanka than elephants br As a whole Asian elephants display highly sophisticated and sometimes unpredictable behaviour Most untamed elephants try to avoid humans but if they are caught off guard by any perceived physical threat including humans they will likely charge This is especially true of males in musth and of females with young Gunfire and other similar methods of deterring which are known to be effective against many kinds of wild animals including tigers may or may not work with elephants and can even worsen the situation Elephants that have been abused by humans in the past often become rogue elephants which regularly attack people with no provocation br br br Poaching br br br For ivory br The demand for ivory during the s and s particularly in East Asia led to rampant poaching and the serious decline of elephants in both Africa and Asia In Thailand the illegal trade in live elephants and ivory still flourishes Although the amount of ivory being openly sold has decreased substantially since Thailand still has one of the largest and most active black markets for ivory seen anywhere in the world Tusks from Thai poached elephants also enter the market between and at least male elephants were killed for their tusks br Up to the early s Vietnamese ivory craftsmen used exclusively Asian elephant ivory from Vietnam and neighbouring Lao and Cambodia Before there were few tourists and the low demand for worked ivory could be supplied by domestic elephants Economic liberalisation and an increase in tourism raised both local and visitors demands for worked ivory which resulted in heavy poaching br br br For skin br The skin of the Asian elephant is used as an ingredient in Chinese medicine as well as in the manufacture of ornamental beads The practice has been aided by China s State Forestry Administration SFA which has issued licences for the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products containing elephant skin thereby making trading legal In four skinned elephants were found in a forest in Myanmar elephants were killed by poachers in and in According to the NGO Elephant Family Myanmar is the main source of elephant skin where a poaching crisis has developed rapidly since br br br Disease br The Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus EEHV is a member of the Proboscivirus genus a novel clade most closely related to the mammalian betaherpesviruses As of it is responsible for as many as deaths of both zoo and wild Asian elephants worldwide especially in young calves In particular several incidents of calves dying from elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus have been recorded in Myanmar The elephant schistosome is a parasitic trematode that uses the Asian elephant as a definitive host Two other hosts may be the Indian elephant and the greater one horned rhinoceros br br br Conservation br br The Asian elephant is listed on CITES Appendix I It is a quintessential flagship species deployed to catalyze a range of conservation goals including habitat conservation at landscape scales generating public awareness on conservation issues and mobilisation as a popular cultural icon both in India and the West A key aspect of conservation is connectivity of the preferred movement routes of Asian elephants through areas with high vegetation cover and low human population density br The World Elephant Day is celebrated annually on August since Events are organized to divulge information and to engage people about the problems that the Asian elephant is facing August has been established as the Asian Elephant Awareness Month by zoos and conservation partners in the United States br Karnataka state in India hosts the most Asian elephants of any known area and comprises of the total population in the country The distribution of elephants in the state according to one estimate is roughly km sq mi In a study an estimated elephants inhabited the Western Ghats and were primarily threatened by poaching and habitat fragmentation An increase in conflict with humans was also sited as a likely issue Conservation plans aim to establish wildlife corridors stop poaching of bulls and protect or manage land area Project Elephant was initiated in as a Centrally Sponsored Scheme CSS by the Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change of the Government of India The project was initiated to protect the Indian elephant and its habitats and to establish dedicated elephant reserves for sustaining elephant populations br The distribution of elephants in Sri Lanka is only two fifths of what it was in the late th and early th centuries Thus interactions with humans occur much more frequently During a survey the local people expressed some form of disapproval towards the conservation of Asian elephants as farmers viewed them as pests however most of the participants were supportive of the idea br In China Asian elephants are under first level protection Yunnan province has national and regional nature reserves In total the covered protected area in China is about ha acres In the population of Asian elephants in Yunnan was estimated at around individuals As conflicts between humans and wild elephants have emerged around protected areas in the last years the prefecture of Xishuangbanna built food bases and planted bananas and bamboo to create a better habitat br In Thailand Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary and Tham Than Lot National Park are protected areas hosting around elephants according to figures from In recent years the National Park has faced issues due to encroachment and over exploitation In India the National Board of Wildlife recommended to allow coal mining in Dehing Patkai National Park in April The decision raised concerns between students and environmental activists who launched an online campaign to stop the project br br br In captivity br br About half of the global zoo elephant population is kept in European zoos where they have less than half years the median life span of conspecifics years in protected populations in range countries This discrepancy is clearest in Asian elephants infant mortality is more than two to three times that seen in Burmese timber camps and adult survivorship in zoos has not improved significantly in recent years One risk factor for Asian zoo elephants is being moved between institutions with early removal from the mother tending to have additional adverse effects Another risk factor is being born into a zoo rather than being imported from the wild with poor adult survivorship in zoo born Asians apparently being conferred prenatally or in early infancy Likely causes for compromised survivorship is stress and or obesity Foot problems are commonly observed in captive elephants These are related to lack of exercise long hours standing on hard substrates and contamination resulting from standing in their dung Many of these problems are treatable However mistreatment may lead to serious disability or death br Demographic analysis of captive Asian elephants in North America indicates that the population is not self sustaining First year mortality is nearly per cent and fecundity is extremely low throughout the prime reproductive years Data from North American and European regional studbooks from to were analysed for deviations in the birth and juvenile death sex ratios Of captive calves born died prematurely They died within one month of birth major causes being stillbirth and infanticide by either the calf s mother or by one of the exhibition mates The sex ratio of stillbirths in Europe was found to have a tendency for excess of males br br br Handling methods br Young elephants are captured from the wild and illegally imported to Thailand from Myanmar for use in the tourism industry calves are used mainly in amusement parks and are trained to perform various stunts for tourists The calves are often subjected to a breaking in process which may involve being tied up confined starved beaten and tortured as a result two thirds may perish Handlers use a technique known as the training crush in which handlers use sleep deprivation hunger and thirst to break the elephants spirit and make them submissive to their owners moreover handlers drive nails into the elephants ears and feet br br br In culture br br The Asian elephant is the national animal of Thailand and Laos It has also been declared as the national heritage animal of India Bones of Asian elephants excavated at Mohenjo daro in the Indus Valley indicate that they were tamed in the Indus Valley Civilisation and used for work Decorated elephants are also depicted on seals and were modelled in clay The Asian elephant became a siege engine a mount in war a status symbol a beast of burden and an elevated platform for hunting during historical times in South Asia br br Asian elephants have been captured from the wild and tamed for use by humans Their ability to work under instruction makes them particularly useful for carrying heavy objects They have been used particularly for timber carrying in jungle areas Other than their work use they have been used in war in ceremonies and for carriage It is reported that war elephants are still used by the Kachin Independence Army KIA in Kachin State in northern Myanmar against Myanmar s military The KIA use about four dozen elephants to carry supplies br The Asian elephant plays an important part in the culture of the subcontinent and beyond being featured prominently in the Panchatantra fables and the Buddhist Jataka tales They play a major role in Hinduism the god Ganesha s head is that of an elephant and the blessings of a temple elephant are highly valued Elephants are frequently used in processions where the animals are adorned with festive outfits br The Asian elephant is depicted in several Indian manuscripts and treatises with notable amongst these including Matanga Lila elephant sport of Nilakantha The manuscript Hastividyarnava is from Assam in northeast India In the Burmese Thai and Sinhalese animal and planetary zodiac the Asian elephant both tusked and tuskless are the fourth and fifth animal zodiacs of the Burmese the fourth animal zodiac of the Thai and the second animal zodiac of the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka Similarly the elephant is the
