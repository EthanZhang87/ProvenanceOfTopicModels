city population of in the census making it the fourth most populous city in Florida behind Jacksonville Miami and Tampa It is the state s most populous inland city br Orlando is one of the most

Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and world renowned nightlife bars and clubs are located in Downtown Orlando Other attractions like The Orlando Eye at ICON Park are located along International Drive The city is also one of the busiest American cities for conferences and conventions Orange County Convention Center is the second largest convention facility in the United States br Like other major cities in the Sun Belt Orlando grew rapidly from the s into the first decade of the st century Orlando is home to the University of Central Florida which became the largest university campus in the United States in terms of enrollment as of In Orlando was listed as a Gamma level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network br br br Etymology br Fort Gatlin as the Orlando area was once known was established at what is now just south of the city limits by the th U S Artillery under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander C W Fanning on November during the construction of a series of fortified encampments across Florida during the Second Seminole War The fort and surrounding area were named for John S Gatlin an Army physician who was killed in Dade s Massacre on December The site of construction for Fort Gatlin a defensible position with fresh water between three small lakes was likely chosen because the location was on a main trail and is less than yards from a nearby Council Oak tree where Native Americans had traditionally met King Phillip and Coacoochee frequented this area and the tree was alleged to be the place where the previous ambush that had killed over soldiers had been planned When the U S military abandoned the fort in the surrounding community was built up by settlers br Prior to being known by its current name Orlando was once known as Jernigan This name originates from the first European permanent settlers Issac and Aaron Jernigan cattlemen who moved from the state of Georgia and acquired land miles km northwest of Fort Gatlin along the west end of Lake Holden in July by the terms of the Armed Occupation Act Aaron Jernigan became Orange County s first state representative in but his pleas for additional military protection went unanswered br Fort Gatlin was briefly reoccupied by the military for a few weeks during October and November and subsequently a volunteer militia was left to defend the settlement A historical marker indicates that by the Jernigan homestead or Fort Gatlin in some sources served as the nucleus of a village named Jernigan According to an account written years later by his daughter at that time about settlers were forced to shelter for about a year in a stockade that Aaron Jernigan built on the north side of Lake Conway One of the county s first records a grand jury s report mentions a stockade where it states homesteaders were driven from their homes and forced to huddle together in hasty defences sic Aaron Jernigan led a local volunteer militia during br A post office opened at Jernigan in Jernigan appears on an map of Florida and by the area had become the county seat of Orange County In the post office was removed from Jernigan and opened under the name of Orlando at a new location in present day downtown Orlando During the American Civil War the post office closed but reopened in The move is believed to have been sparked in part by Aaron Jernigan s fall from grace after he was relieved of his militia command by military officials in His behavior was so notorious that United States Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote It is said they Jernigan s militia are more dreadful than the Indians In Jernigan and his sons were accused of committing a murder at the town s post office They were then transported to Ocala but escaped br At a meeting in debate had grown concerning the name of the town Pioneer William B Hull recalled how James Speer a local resident and prominent figure in the stories behind the naming of Orlando rose in the heat of the argument and said This place is often spoken of as Orlando s Grave Let s drop the word grave and let the county seat be Orlando br The origin of the name is unknown but at least five stories relate how Orlando got its name The most common stories are that the name Orlando originated from the tale of a man who died in during an attack by Native Americans in the area during the Second Seminole War Several of the stories relay an oral history of the marker for a person named Orlando and the double entendre Here lies Orlando One variant includes a man named Orlando who was passing by on his way to Tampa with a herd of oxen died and was buried in a marked grave br Through a retelling of history a marker of some sort was believed to have been found by one of the original pioneers but Speer s family has since claimed that Speer simply used the Orlando Reeves legend to help push his plan for naming the settlement after the Shakespearean character from As You Like It his favorite play This has become the most common accepted version of how Orlando got its name br br br Orlando Reeves br Historians agree that likely no soldier was named Orlando Reeves Folklore is that Reeves was acting as a sentinel for a company of soldiers that had set up camp for the night on the banks of Sandy Beach Lake Several different lakes are mentioned in the various versions as no soldiers were in what is now downtown during br The legend grew throughout the early s particularly with local historian Olive Brumbaugh or Kena Fries retelling in various writings and on local radio station WDBO in Another historian Eldon H Gore promoted the Reeves legend in History of Orlando published in A memorial beside Lake Eola originally placed by students of Orlando s Cherokee Junior School in and updated in designates the spot where the city s supposed namesake fell br Conflicting legends exist One legend has Reeves killed during an extended battle with the Seminoles after being field promoted after his platoon commander fell An in depth review of military records in the s and s though turned up no record of Orlando Reeves ever existing Some versions attempt to account for Reeves having no military records by using the name of other people named Orlando that exist in some written records Orlando Acosta however not much is known about Acosta or whether he even existed Another version of the story has Orlando Reed supposedly an Englishman and mail carrier between Fort Gatlin and Fort Mellon allegedly killed while camping with his friends near Fort Gatlin br A second variation also places the story in during the Second Seminole War This name is taken from a South Carolinian cattle rancher named Orlando Savage Rees Rees owned a Volusia County sugar mill and plantation as well as several large estates in Florida and Mississippi Rees sugar farms in the area were burned out in the Seminole attacks of the year Orlando Reeves supposedly died Subsequently Rees led an expedition to recover stolen slaves and cattle In Rees also attempted to stop a peace treaty with the Seminoles because it did not reimburse him for the loss of slaves and crops br Rees could have left a pine bough marker with his name next to the trail later residents misread Rees as Reeves and also mistook it as a grave maker In subsequent years this story has merged with the Orlando Reeves story which may have originally incorporated part of Dr Gatlin s story br On two separate occasions relatives of Rees claimed their ancestor was the namesake of the city F K Bull of South Carolina Rees great grandson told an Orlando reporter of a story in years later Charles M Bull Jr of Orlando Rees great great grandson offered local historians similar information Unlike Orlando Reeves who cannot be traced to any historical record the record is considerable that Orlando Rees did exist and was in Florida during that time For example in John James Audubon met with Rees in his large estate at Spring Garden about minutes from Orlando br br br Orlando As You Like It br br The final variation has the city named after the protagonist in the Shakespeare play As You Like It br In Judge Donald A Cheney put forth a new version of the story in an Orlando Sentinel article Cheney a local historian and then chairman of the county historical commission recounted a story told to him by his father Judge John Moses Cheney a major figure in Orlando s history who arrived in Orlando in br The elder Cheney recounted that another gentleman at that time James Speer proposed the name Orlando after the character in As You Like It According to Cheney Speer was a gentleman of culture and an admirer of William Shakespeare Quoting a letter that Speer wrote Orlando was a veritable Forest of Arden the locale of As You Like It Speer s descendants have also confirmed this version of the naming and the legend has continued to grow br This account also has some validity in that as mentioned above Speer was instrumental in changing the name of the settlement from Jernigan to Orlando though he may have used the Orlando Reeves legend in lieu of his true intent to use the Shakespearean character According to yet another version of the story Orlando may have been the name of one of his employees One of downtown Orlando s major streets is named Rosalind Avenue Rosalind is the heroine of As You Like It but this could also be a coincidence br br br History br br br Settlement br In the Treaty of Moultrie Creek created a Seminole reservation encompassing much of central Florida including the area that would become Orlando The Indian Removal Act of authorized relocation of the Seminole from Florida to Oklahoma leading to the Second Seminole War In white settlement in the area was encouraged by the Armed Occupation Act The first settler Mr Aaron Jernigan of Camden County Georgia arrived the following year and settled near Lake Holden br br Mosquito County was renamed Orange County in with the county seat shortly thereafter relocated to Mellonville a few miles west of Sanford By settlement had begun in earnest in the interior of the county and a more centrally located Courthouse was sought The new town of Orlando laid out in consisted of four streets surrounding a courthouse square The fledgling village suffered greatly during the Union blockade The Reconstruction Era brought on a population explosion resulting in the incorporation of the Town of Orlando on July with residents voters For a short time in the town revoked its charter and was subsequently reincorporated Orlando was established as a city in br The period from to is remembered as Orlando s Golden Era when it became the hub of Florida s citrus industry The period ended with the Great Freeze of which forced many owners to give up their independent citrus groves thus consolidating holdings in the hands of a few citrus barons who shifted operations south primarily around Lake Wales in Polk County The freeze caused many in Florida including many Orlandoans to move elsewhere mostly to the North California or the Caribbean br br Notable homesteaders in the area included the Curry family Through their property in east Orlando flowed the Econlockhatchee River which travelers crossed by fording This was commemorated by the street s name Curry Ford Road Also just south of the Orlando International Airport in the Boggy Creek area are acres km of property homesteaded in the late th century by the Ward family This property is still owned by the Ward family and can be seen from southbound flights out of Orlando International Airport immediately on the south side of SR br br br Post Industrial Revolution br Orlando became a popular resort during the years between the Spanish American War and World War I In the s Orlando experienced extensive housing development during the Florida Land Boom causing land prices to soar During this period dozens of neighborhoods in the vicinity of downtown were constructed The boom ended when several hurricanes hit Florida in the late s along with the Great Depression br During World War II a number of Army personnel were stationed at the Orlando Army Air Base and nearby Pinecastle Army Air Field Some of these servicemen stayed in Orlando to settle and raise families In the aerospace and defense company Martin Marietta now Lockheed Martin established a plant in the city Orlando AAB and Pinecastle AAF were transferred to the United States Air Force in when it became a separate service and were redesignated as air force bases AFB In Pinecastle AFB was renamed McCoy Air Force Base after Colonel Michael N W McCoy a former commander of the th Bombardment Wing at the installation killed in the crash of a B Stratojet bomber north of Orlando In the s the base subsequently became home to the th Bombardment Wing of the Strategic Air Command operating B Stratofortress and KC Stratotanker aircraft in addition to detachment operations by EC and U aircraft br In Orlando AFB was transferred to the United States Navy and became Naval Training Center Orlando In addition to boot camp facilities the NTC Orlando was home of one of two Navy Nuclear Power Schools and home of the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division When McCoy AFB closed in its runways and territory to its south and east were imparted to the city to become Orlando International Airport while a small portion to the northwest was transferred to the Navy as McCoy NTC Annex That closed in and became a housing though the former McCoy AFB still hosts a Navy Exchange as well as national guard and reserve units for several branches of service NTC Orlando was completely closed by the end of by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission and converted into the Baldwin Park neighborhood The Naval Air Warfare Center had moved to Central Florida Research Park near UCF in br br br Tourism in history br Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando s economy occurred in when Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and Tampa for his park one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes Orlando s inland location although not free from hurricane damage exposed it to less threat than coastal regions The vacation resort opened in October ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area which now encompasses Orange Seminole Osceola and Lake Counties As a result tourism became the centerpiece of the area s economy Orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world br Another major factor in Orlando s growth occurred in when the new Orlando Jetport the precursor of the present day Orlando International Airport was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base By four major airlines Delta Air Lines National Airlines Eastern Airlines and Southern Airways were providing scheduled flights McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in and most of it is now part of the airport The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code

like much of the deep Southern United States The two basic seasons in Orlando are a hot and rainy season lasting from May until late October roughly coinciding with the Atlantic hurricane season and a warm and dry season from November through April The area s warm and humid climate is caused primarily by its low elevation its position relatively close to the Tropic of Cancer and its location in the center of a peninsula Many characteristics of its climate are a result of its proximity to the Gulf Stream which flows around the peninsula of Florida br During the height of Orlando s humid summer season high temperatures are typically in the low s F C while low temperatures rarely fall below the low s F C The average window for F C temperatures is April to October The area s humidity acts as a buffer usually preventing actual temperatures from exceeding F C but also pushing the heat index to over F C The city s highest recorded temperature is F C set on September During these months strong afternoon thunderstorms occur almost daily These storms are caused by air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean colliding over Central Florida They are highlighted by spectacular lightning and can also bring heavy rain sometimes several inches per hour and powerful winds as well as rare damaging hail br During the winter humidity is much lower and temperatures are more moderate and can fluctuate more readily The monthly daily average temperature in January is F C Temperatures dip below the freezing mark on an average of only nights per year and the lowest recorded temperature is F C set on December The annual mean minimum is just above F C putting Orlando in hardiness zone a Because the winter season is dry and freezing temperatures usually occur only after cold fronts and their accompanying precipitation have passed snow is exceptionally rare The only accumulation ever to occur in the city proper since record keeping began was in although some accumulation occurred in surrounding areas in a snow event in January that reached Miami Flurries have also been observed in and br The average annual rainfall in Orlando is inches mm a majority of which occurs in the period from June to September October through May are Orlando s dry season During this period especially in its later months often a wildfire hazard exists During some years fires have been severe In a strong El Ni o caused an unusually wet January and February followed by drought throughout the spring and early summer causing a record wildfire season that created numerous air quality alerts in Orlando and severely affected normal daily life including the postponement of that year s Pepsi NASCAR race in nearby Daytona Beach br Orlando is a major population center and has a considerable hurricane risk although it is not as high as in South Florida s urban corridor or other coastal regions Since the city is located miles km inland from the Atlantic and miles km inland from the Gulf of Mexico hurricanes usually weaken before arriving Storm surges are not a concern since the region is feet m above mean sea level Despite its location the city does see strong hurricanes During the notorious hurricane season Orlando was hit by three hurricanes that caused significant damage with Hurricane Charley the worst of these The city also experienced widespread damage during Hurricane Donna in br Tornadoes are not usually connected with the strong thunderstorms of the humid summer They are more common during the infrequent cold days of winter as well as in
