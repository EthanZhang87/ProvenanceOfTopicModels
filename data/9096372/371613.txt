The Jardin des Plantes French for Garden of the Plants also known as the Jardin des Plantes de Paris French a d d pl t d pa i when distinguished from other jardins des plantes in other cities is the main botanical garden in France Jardin des Plantes is the official name in the present day but it is in fact an elliptical form of Jardin Royal des Plantes M dicinales Royal Garden of the Medicinal Plants which is related to the original purpose of the garden back in the th century br Headquarters of the Mus um National d Histoire Naturelle National Museum of Natural History the Jardin des Plantes is situated in the th arrondissement Paris on the left bank of the river Seine and covers hectares m Since March the entire garden and its contained buildings archives libraries greenhouses m nagerie a zoo works of art and specimens collection are classified as a national historical landmark in France labelled monument historique br br br Garden plan br The grounds of the Jardin des Plantes include four buildings containing exhibited specimens These buildings are officially considered as museums following the French law they are labelled mus e de France and the French Museum of Natural History calls them galeries French for galleries br br The Grande Galerie de l volution Gallery of Evolution was inaugurated in as the Galerie de Zoologie Gallery of Zoology In the gallery was renamed Grande Galerie de l volution and its exhibited specimens were completely reorganised so that the visitor is oriented by the common thread of the evolution as the major subject treated by the gallery br The Galerie de Min ralogie et de G ologie Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology a mineralogy museum built as of inaugurated in br The Galerie de Pal ontologie et d Anatomie Compar e Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy a comparative anatomy museum in the ground floor and a paleontology museum in the first and second floors The building was inaugurated in br The Galerie de Botanique Gallery of Botany inaugurated in thanks to funds provided by the Rockefeller Foundation contains botany laboratories and the French Mus um s National Herbarium the biggest in the world with a collection of almost million samples of plants The building also contains a small permanent exhibition about botany br In addition to the gardens and the galleries there is also a small zoo the M nagerie du Jardin des Plantes founded in by Bernardin de Saint Pierre from animals of the M nagerie Royale de Versailles the menagerie at Versailles which was dismantled during the French Revolution br The Jardin des Plantes maintains a botanical school which trains botanists constructs demonstration gardens and exchanges seeds to maintain biotic diversity About plants are arranged by family on a one hectare m plot Three hectares are devoted to horticultural displays of decorative plants An Alpine garden has species with world wide representation Specialized buildings such as a large Art Deco winter garden and Mexican and Australian hothouses display regional plants not native to France The Rose Garden created in has hundreds of species of roses and rose trees br br br History br br br The Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants br br The garden was formally founded in as the Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants by an edict of King Louis XIII The garden was put under the authority of the Physician of the king Guy de la Brosse It was staffed by a group of demonstrateurs who lectured visitors particularly future physicians and pharmacists on botany chemistry and geology illustrated by the garden collections br In under Louis XIV and his new royal physician and director of the Garden Guy Crescent Fagon great nephew of Guy de la Brosse the garden was given a new amphitheater where dissections and other medical courses were conducted The lecturers included the celebrated physician and anatomist Claude Perrault who was equally famous as the architect he designed the facade of the Louvre Palace br In the early th century the chateau was given an additional floor to house the collections the royal botanist s medicinal plant collection This section was gradually turned into galleries to display the royal collection of minerals At the same time the greenhouses on the west and south were enlarged to hold the plants brought back to France by numerous scientific expeditions around the world New plants were studied dried and cataloged A group of artists made Herbiers books with detailed illustrations of each new plant and the plants of the collection were carefully studied for their possible medical or culinary uses One example was the group of coffee plants brought from Java to Paris which were raised and studied by Antoine de Jussieu for their possible medical and commercial use His studies led to the plantation of coffee in the French colonies of North America br br br The Buffon period br br br br br br br br br br br The most celebrated head of the garden was Georges Louis Leclerc who served as its head from until his death in While director of the garden he also owned and operated a large and successful iron works and foundry in Burgundy but lived in the garden in the house that now carries his name Buffon was responsible for doubling the size of the garden expanding down to the banks of Seine He enlarged the Cabinet of Natural History in the main building and added a new gallery to the south He also brought into the scientific community of the garden a team of important botanists and naturalists including Jean Baptiste Lamarck author of one of the earliest theories of Evolution br Under the sponsorship of Buffon explorers and botanists were sent to different corners of the world to collect specimens for garden and museum Michel Adanson was sent to Senegal and the navigator La Perouse to the islands of the Pacific They returned with shiploads of specimens which were carefully studied and classified This research caused a conflict between the scientists of Royal Gardens and the professors of the Sorbonne over the question of Evolution The scientists led by Buffon and his followers claimed that natural species gradually evolved while the theologians of the Sorbonne insisted that nature was exactly as it was at the time of the Creation Since the scientists had the backing of the Royal court they were able to continue their studies and publish their work br br br The French Revolution and the th Century The Menagerie br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br On June in the course of the French Revolution the new government the National Convention ordered a complete transformation of the former royal institutions They created a new Museum of Arts and Techniques transformed the Louvre from a royal residence to a museum of art and joined the Royal Garden of Plants and the Cabinet of Natural Sciences together into a single organization the Museum of Natural History It also received a number of important collections which had belonged to members of the aristocracy such as a famous group of wax models illustrating anatomy which had been created by Andr Pinson br The Museum and gardens also benefited from the expedition launched by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte to Egypt the military force was accompanied by one hundred and fifty four botanists astronomers archeologists chemists artists and other scholars including Gaspard Monge Joseph Fourier and Claude Louis Berthollet Drawings and paintings of their findings are found in the collections of the Natural History Museum br The holdings today include specimens of the herbarium collection of Joseph Tournefort donated on his death to the Jardin du Roi br The major addition to the garden in the late th century was the M nagerie du Jardin des Plantes It was proposed in by Bernardin de Saint Pierre the intendant of the gardens in large part to rescue the animals of the royal menagerie at the Palace of Versailles who had been largely abandoned during the Revolution The Duke of Orleans had a similar private zoo also abandoned At the same time the government of the Convention ordered the seizure of all the animals put on public display by various circuses in Paris In the government acquired the H tel de Magn the large estate of a French nobleman next to the gardens and installed the large cages that had housed the animals at Versailles It went through a very difficult early period when the majority of the animals died before it was given sufficient funding and more suitable structures by Napoleon It became the home of animals brought back to France in scientific expeditions in the early th century including a famous giraffe given to King Charles X by the Sultan of Cairo in br On August Allied American troops nd DB were stationed here for the night after the Liberation of Paris from Nazi Germany br br br Late th th century additions and experiments br Throughout the th and early th century the primary mission of the gardens and museums was research Working in the laboratories there the chemist Eugene Chevreul first isolated fatty acids and cholesterol and studied the chemistry of vegetal dyes The physiologist Claude Bernard studied the functions of the glycogen in the liver In the physicist Henri Becquerel working in a laboratory in the museum discovered radioactivity He wrapped uranium salts together with an unexposed photographic plate wrapped in black cloth to keep out the sunlight When he unwrapped them the photographic plate had changed color from exposure to the radiation He received the Nobel Prize in for his discovery br The Gallery of Paleontology and of Comparative Anatomy was opened in replacing structures built between and to contain and display the thousands of skeletons the museum had collected The buildings of menagerie were also expanded with the construction of immense Bird House by architect Jules Andr meters high meters long and meters long br The appearance of the gardens changed in late th and early th century with the construction of new buildings In the gallery of zoology the landmark building that overlooks the formal garden designed by Jules Andr was begun It was built to contain the immense zoological collections of the museum the central hall is a landmark of iron construction comparable to the Grand Palais and the Mus e d Orsay It was inaugurated in but thereafter suffered from a long lack of maintenance It was closed in In the s a new home was found for the museum s gigantic collections The Zooth que was constructed between and underneath the Esplanade Milne Edwards directly in front of the Gallery of Zoology It is accessible only to researchers and contains the thirty million specimens of insects five hundred thousand fish and reptiles one hundred fifty thousand birds and seven thousand other animals The building above underwent a major renovation from to to house the updated Grand Gallery of Evolution br br br National Museum of Natural History br br The National Museum of Natural History has been called the Louvre of the Natural Sciences It is contained in a five buildings laid out along the formal garden the Gallery of Evolution the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology the Gallery of Botany the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy and the Laboratory of Entomology br br br The Grand Gallery of Evolution br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The Grand Gallery of Evolution was designed by Jules Andr whose other works in Paris included in collaboration with Henri Labrouste the Beaux arts Bibliotheque National He became architect of the museum in and his works are found throughout the Jardin des Plantes It opened during the Paris Universal Exposition of though it was not finished as intended it still lacks a grand facade on the side of rue Geoffroy Saint Hilaire The main facade facing the two principal alleys of the formal garden is flanked by two lantern towers A series of medallions between the bays on the main facade overlooking the garden honors ten of the notable scientists who have worked in the Museum along with an allegorical statue of a woman holding an open book of knowledge br While the exterior is Beaux Arts architecture the interior iron structure was entirely modern contemporary with the Grand Palais and the new railroad station of the gare d Orsay now the Mus e d Orsay It encloses a rectangular hall meters long meters wide and meters high with the glass roof of one thousand square meters supported by rows of slender iron columns The structure deteriorated had to be closed in then underwent extensive restoration between and It now presents through preserved animals and media displays the evolution of species It gives special attention to species that has disappeared or are endangered The collection of preserved animals includes the rhinoceros brought to France in the th century by Louis XV br br br Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology br br br br br br br In front of the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology stands one of the trees of the royal garden a Sophora Japonica tree planted by Bernard de Jussieu in The gallery was constructed between and by Charles Rohault de Fleury in neoclassical style with triangular frontons and pillars The collection inside includes some six hundred thousand stones gens and fossils Among the notable exhibits is the petrified trunk of bald cypress tree from the tertiary geological era discovered in Essonne region of France in br br br Gallery of Botany br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In front of the Gallery of Botany is the oldest tree in Paris a Robinier Faux Acacia brought to France from America in The gallery was built in with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation The gallery keeps the Herbier National specimens of all known plant species with million plants represented The ground floor gallery is used for temporary exhibitions br br br Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br This gallery is sited next to the Iris garden which contains varieties of Iris The building was constructed between and by Ferdinand Dutert a specialist in metallic architecture whose most famous building was the Gallery of Machines at the Paris Exposition The gallery was expanded in with a brick addition by architect Henri Delage The interior is highly decorated with lace like iron stairways and detail It displays a large collection of fossilized skeletons of dinosaurs and other large vertebrates br br br Gardens br br br Formal Garden br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The garden covers an area of twenty four hectares acres It is bordered by the River Seine on the east on the west by the Rue Geofroy Saint Hilaire on the south by the Rue Buffon and on the north by Rue Cuvier all streets named for French scientists whose studies were carried out within the garden and its museums br The main entrance is on the east along the Seine at Place Valhubert reaching to the Grand Gallery which copies its width It is in the style of a French formal garden and extends for five hundred meters yards between two geometrically trimmed rows of platane trees Its rectangula beds contain over a thousand plants This part of the garden is bordered on the left by a row of galleries and on the right by the School of Botany the Alpine Garden and greenhouses br The iron grill gateways and fence at Place Valubuert were created in the beginning of the formal garden on the east is a statue of the botanist Jean Baptiste Lamarck the director the school of botany beginning in He is best known for devising the first coherent theory of biological evolution br At the other end of the formal garden facing the Grand gallery is a statue of another major figure in the garden s history the naturalist Buffon in a dressing gown seated comfortably in an armchair atop the skin of a lion holding a bird in his hand Between the statue and the Gallery is the Esplanade Mine Edwards beneath which is the Zooth que the massive underground storage area for the museum s collections It is not open to the public br br br Greenhouses br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Four large serres chaudes or greenhouses are placed in a row to the right front of the Gallery of Evolution facing onto the Esplanade Milne Edwards They replaced the earliest greenhouses built on the same site in the early th century to house the plants brought to France from tropical climates by French explorers and naturalists The Mexican greenhouse which houses succulents is separated by an alley from the Australian greenhouse which hosts plants from that country They were built between and by the architect Rohault de Fleury Each of the two greenhouses is meters by meters in size Their iron and glass structure was revolutionary for Paris preceding by fifteen years the similar pavilions built by Victor Baltard for the Paris markets of Les Halles br A larger structure the Jardin d hiver Winter Garden covering square meters was designed by Ren Berger and completed in It features an Art Deco entrance between two illuminated glass and iron pillars built for nighttime visits The heating system keeps the interior temperature at degrees Celsius year round creating a suitable environment for bananas palms giant bamboo and other tropical plants Its central feature designed to create a more natural environment is a fifteen meter high waterfall br br br Alpine Garden br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The Alpine Garden was created in and is about three meters higher than the other parts of the garden It is divided into two zones connected by a tunnel It contains several different microclimates controlled by the water distribution the orientation toward the sun the type of soil and the distribution of the rocks It is home to plants for Corsica the Caucasus North America and the Himalayas The oldest plant is a pistachio tree planted in about This tree was the subject of research by the botanist Sebastien Vaillant in the th century which confirmed the sexuality of plants Another ancient tree found there is the metasequoia or dawn redwood a primitive conifer br br br School of Botany Garden br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br A large section alongside the formal garden with an entrance on the Allee Bequrerel belongs to the School of Botany and is dedicated to plants that have medicinal or economic uses It was originally created in the th century and now has over three thousand eight hundred specimens organised by genus and family Regular tours my museum guides are given of this section One of its special attractions is the Pinus nigra or black pine of the variety Laricio from Corsica which was planted in the garden by Jussieu in the s br br br The Small Labyrinth br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The small garden is placed directly behind the Winter Garden greenhouse Its prominent features are a large platane tree from the Orient planted by Buffon in and a Ginkgo biloba a tree originating in China considered a living fossil since traces show that these trees existed in the Second Era of living things as defined by botanists It was planted in br In the center of the garden is monument to the botanist Bernardin de Saint Pierre the last director of the garden named by the King before the French Revolution and the creator of the menagerie He is better known in France as the author of a well known romantic movel Paul et Virginie published in br br br The Butte Copeaux and the Grand Labyrinth br br br br br br br br br br br The Grand Labyrinth features a winding path to the top of the Butte Copeaux a hill overlooking the garden It was originally created under Louis XIII then redone in its present form under Louis XVI on the site of an old garbage dump At the beginning of the upward path is a Cedar of Lebanon planted in by Jussieu with a trunk four meters in circumference The butte was largely planted with trees from the Mediterranean including an old erable tree from Crete planted in and still in place including from in it is topped by a picturesque th century cast iron viewing platform the oldest work of iron architecture in Paris The labyrinth was created under Louis XIII then redone by the garden director Buffon for Louis XVI br At the top is a neoclassical viewing platform called the Gloriette de Buffon It was made of cast iron bronze and copper in using metal from the foundry owned by Buffon It is considered the oldest metallic structure in Paris The eight iron columns carry a roof in the shape of a Chinese hat topped by a lantern with a frieze decorated with swastikas a popular motif in the period The top is inscribed with a tribute to Louis XVI honouring his justice humanity and munificence as well as a quotation from Bouffon in Latin translated I only count the hours without clouds It was originally equipped with a precise clock which chimed exactly at noon but it disappeared in br Nearby is the Lion Fountain built in into the wall of a former reservoir It is decorated with two bronze lions made in by the noted animal sculptor Henri Jacquemart br br br The Menagerie br br br br br br br br br br br The Menagerie is the second oldest public zoo in the world still in operation following the Tiergarten Sch nbrunn in Vienna Austria founded in It was laid out in its current form between and and occupies hectares acres Besides displaying and studying animals it has the mission in cooperation with the zoos of other European cities to preserve the genetic pool of certain endangered species with the longer term goal of trying to re introduce some of these species into nature br The menagerie in the style of th century zoos is composed of a series of fenced areas separated by paths each with Fabriques or shelters in pictureesque styles ranging from rustic to Art Deco The largest building is the rotunda built of brick and stone between and which unites five separate structures Its form is said to have been inspired by the medal of the Legion of Honor It was restored in It formerly contained the large animals of the collection including the elephants and the famous giraffe given to King Charles X of France which lived there for twenty seven years The trenches around the rotunda were part of the residence of bears In most of the large animals were moved to the new zoo in the Bois de Vincennes and now the building is used mainly for events and receptions br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The major structures in the Menagerie include the neoclassical Grand Volerie built for flying animals by Louis Jules Andr the designer of the garden s central building the Gallery of Evolution It was built in of iron stone and wood in an oval form Like the main building of the gardens it features two neoclassical lantern towers The Palace of Reptiles is also a work of Andr It was built between and Its decoration includes a bronze statue of The Snake Charmer from br The Vivarium is a gallery by Emmanuel Pontremoli from it is a modernist update of a Classical Greek villa with an Art Deco portico dating from Other notable buildings include the Art Deco Ape House from a ceramic covered oval building with the cages on the

director and chief creator of the gardens from to his death in It became part of the garden in not open to public br The Cuvier House next to the Gallery of Comparative Anatomy was the residence of the scientist Georges Cuvier until his death in Cuvier was one of the founders of Paleontology and the first to identify the skeleton of a mastodon as a prehistoric animal Its facade displays his motto in Latin The Transibunt et augebitur scientia The Hours Pass and science progresses The house was also the place where in Henri Becquerel carried out the experiment in which led to the discovery of uranium This event is marked by plaque on the facade not open to public br The Cuvier Fountain is across the street from the garden at the intersection of Rue Linn and Rue Cuvier across the street from the very decorative wrought iron gates of the garden The fountain honors George Cuvier considered the father of comparative anatomy with his statue surrounded by a varied collection of animals It was built by the park architect Vigoureux and the sculptor Jean Jacques Feuch re in br The Amphitheater near Rue Cuvier in the northwest corner was constructed in in the garden of the H tel de Magny on Rue Cuvier It was built under the direction of Buffon as a venue for lectures on natural science and the discoveries in the gardens It was built in a purely neoclassical or Paladian style The frontons are decorated with th century sculpture depicting the natural sciences The building was extensively restored in A large stone vase in front of the amphitheater is a vestige of the Royal Abbey of Saint Victor which occupied the site of the amphitheater and was destroyed during the French Revolution br The Pavilion of New Converts in the northwest corner of the garden on the All e Chevreul

fronton in the Louis XIV style contained the refectory a parlour and bedrooms After the French Revolution it became part of the gardens It was the residence and laboratory of a director of the museum for years the chemist Eugene Chevreul who died there in at the age of Chevreul developed the use of color wheels or chromatic circles to resolve the definition of colors His theory of colors was used at the Gobelins Manufactory of tapestries where his laboratory was located and inspired the palette of colors used by Eug ne Delacroix A statue of Chevreul is placed in the Carr Chevreul in the gardens br The H tel de Magny at Rue Cuvier is the administration building of the gardens It was built in about under Louis XIV as a residence designed by the royal architect Pierre Bullet whose works included the Porte Saint Martin and mansions in Le Marais and Place Vend me After the Revolution it turned into a boarding school the celebrated actor Talma was one of the students The house and
