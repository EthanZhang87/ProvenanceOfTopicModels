Solomon also called Jedidiah was a Jewish monarch of ancient Israel and the son and successor of King David according to the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament He is described as having been the penultimate ruler of an amalgamated Israel and Judah The hypothesized dates of Solomon s reign are from to BCE According to the Bible after his death his son and successor Rehoboam adopted a harsh policy towards the northern tribes eventually leading to the splitting of the Israelites between the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south Following the split the biblical narrative depicts his patrilineal descendants ruling over Judah alone br The Bible says Solomon built the First Temple in Jerusalem dedicating the temple to Yahweh or God Solomon is portrayed as wealthy wise and powerful and as one of the Jewish prophets He is also the subject of many later references and legends most notably in the Testament of Solomon part of first century biblical apocrypha br The historicity of Solomon is hotly debated Current consensus allows for a historical Solomon but regards his reign as king over Israel and Judah in the tenth century BCE as uncertain and the biblical description of his apparent empire s lavishness as most probably an anachronistic exaggeration br In the New Testament he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom excelled by Jesus of Nazareth and as arrayed in glory but excelled by the lilies of the field In the Quran he is considered to be a major Islamic prophet In mostly non biblical circles Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name br br br Biblical account br The life of Solomon is primarily described in Samuel Kings and Chronicles His two names are traditionally taken to mean peaceful and friend of God both considered predictive of the character of his reign A textbook described three possibilities for the etymology of Solomon s name compensation or a substitute the ruler of peace or based on the deified evening star Shalim br br br Chronology br The conventional dates of Solomon s reign are derived from biblical chronology and are set from about to BCE Regarding the Davidic dynasty to which King Solomon belongs its chronology can be checked against datable Babylonian and Assyrian records at a few points and these correspondences have allowed archaeologists to date its kings in a modern framework According to the most widely used chronology based on that by the Old Testament professor Edwin R Thiele the death of Solomon and the division of his kingdom would have occurred in the fall of BCE br br br Childhood br Solomon was born in Jerusalem the second born child of David and his wife Bathsheba widow of Uriah the Hittite The first child unnamed in that account a son conceived adulterously during Uriah s lifetime had died seven days after birth It is suggested in Scripture that this was a judgment from God Solomon had three named full brothers born to Bathsheba Nathan Shammua and Shobab besides six known older half brothers born of as many mothers br The biblical narrative shows that Solomon served as a peace offering between God and David due to David s adulterous relationship with Bathsheba In an effort to hide this sin David sent Bathsheba s husband Uriah the Hittite to battle and specifically to the front line wherein David ordered the commanding officer Joab to withdraw support for Uriah in order to have him killed in battle by the enemy After he died David was finally able to marry Bathsheba As punishment the first child who was conceived during the adulterous relationship died Solomon was born after David was forgiven It is this reason why his name which means peace was chosen Some historians cited that Nathan the Prophet brought up Solomon as his father was busy governing the realm This could also be attributed to the notion that the prophet held great influence over David because he knew of his adultery which was considered a grievous offense under the Mosaic Law br br br Succession and administration br br According to the First Book of Kings when David was old he could not get warm So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel and found Abishag the Shunamite and brought her to the king The young woman was very beautiful and she was of service to the king and attended to him but the king knew her not br While David was in this state court factions were maneuvering for power Adonijah David s heir apparent acted to have himself declared king but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the biblical prophet Nathan who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise not recorded elsewhere in the biblical narrative despite Solomon s being younger than his brothers br Solomon as instructed by David began his reign with an extensive purge including his father s chief general Joab among others and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts It is said that Solomon ascended to the throne when he was only about fifteen br Solomon greatly expanded his military strength especially the cavalry and chariot arms He founded numerous colonies some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts br Trade relationships were a focus of his administration In particular he continued his father s very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king Hiram I of Tyre see wealth below they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of Tarshish and Ophir to engage in the trade of luxury products importing gold silver sandalwood pearls ivory apes and peacocks Solomon is considered the most wealthy of the Israelite kings named in the Bible br br br Wisdom br br Solomon was the biblical king most famous for his wisdom In Kings he sacrificed to God and God later appeared to him in a dream asking what Solomon wanted from God Solomon asked for wisdom in order to better rule and guide his people Pleased God personally answered Solomon s prayer promising him great wisdom because he did not ask for self serving rewards like long life or the death of his enemies br Perhaps the best known story of his wisdom is the Judgement of Solomon two women each lay claim to being the mother of the same child Solomon easily resolved the dispute by commanding the child to be cut in half and shared between the two One woman promptly renounced her claim proving that she would rather give the child up than see it killed Solomon declared the woman who showed compassion to be the true mother entitled to the whole child br Solomon has traditionally been considered the author of several biblical books including Proverbs Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs He is traditionally ascribed authorship of the Wisdom of Solomon which is included in the Scriptures of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church but is considered apocryphal in Protestant traditions br br br Wealth br br According to the Hebrew Bible the ancient Kingdom of Israel gained its highest splendour and wealth during Solomon s reign of years In a single year according to Kings Solomon collected tribute amounting to talents kilograms of gold Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an Eastern monarch and his government prospered He entered into an alliance with Hiram I king of Tyre who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings br br br Construction projects br br For some years before his death David was engaged in collecting materials for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent home for Yahweh and the Ark of the Covenant Solomon is described as undertaking the construction of the temple with the help of an architect also named Hiram and other materials sent from King Hiram of Tyre br After the completion of the temple Solomon is described in the biblical narrative as erecting many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem For years he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on Ophel a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem This complex included buildings referred to as br br The House or Hall of the Forest of Lebanon br The Hall or Porch of Pillars br The Hall of the Throne or the Hall of Justice as well as his own residence and a residence for his wife Pharaoh s daughter br br Solomon s throne is said to have been spectacularly opulent and possessed moving parts making it one of the earliest mechanical devices in history Solomon also constructed great water works for the city and the Millo Septuagint Acra for the defense of the city However excavations of Jerusalem have discovered no monumental architecture from the era and no remains of either the Temple or Solomon s palace have been found br Solomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel creating the port of Ezion Geber and constructing Palmyra in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost Although the location of the port of Ezion Geber is known no remains have ever been found More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt for example Hazor Megiddo and Gezer These all have substantial ancient remains including impressive six chambered gates and ashlar palaces however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time according to the Bible when Solomon ruled br According to the Bible during Solomon s reign Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity with extensive traffic being carried on by land with Tyre Egypt and Arabia and by sea with Tarshish Ophir and South India br br br Wives and concubines br br According to the biblical account Solomon had wives and concubines The wives were described as foreign princesses including Pharaoh s daughter and women of Moab Ammon Edom Sidon and of the Hittites His marriage to Pharaoh s daughter appears to have cemented a political alliance with Egypt whereas he clung to his other wives and concubines in love The only wife mentioned by name is Naamah the Ammonite mother of Solomon s successor Rehoboam br The biblical narrative notes with disapproval that Solomon permitted his foreign wives to import their national deities building temples to Ashtoreth and Milcom br In the branch of literary analysis that examines the Bible called higher criticism the story of Solomon falling into idolatry by the influence of Pharaoh s daughter and his other foreign wives is customarily seen as the handiwork of the deuteronomistic historian s who are held to have written compiled or edited texts to legitimize the reforms of Hezekiah s great grandson King Josiah who reigned from about to BCE over years after Solomon s death according to Bible scholars Scholarly consensus in this field holds that Solomon s wives women were introduced in the Josianic customarily Dtr edition of Kings as a theological construct to blame the schism between Judah and the Northern Kingdom of Israel on his misdeeds br br br Relationship with Queen of Sheba br br In a brief unelaborated and enigmatic passage the Hebrew Bible describes how the fame of Solomon s wisdom and wealth reached even the far off Queen of Sheba The queen is described as visiting with gifts including gold spices and precious stones When Solomon gave her all her desire whatsoever she asked she left satisfied Kings br Whether the passage is simply to provide a brief foreign witness of Solomon s wealth and wisdom or whether the visit is meant to have more significance is unknown nevertheless the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories br Sheba is typically identified as Saba a nation once spanning the Red Sea on the coasts of what are now Eritrea Somalia Ethiopia and Yemen in Arabia Felix although other sources place it in the area of what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea br In a Rabbinical account e g Targum Sheni Colloquy of the Queen of Sheba Solomon was accustomed to ordering animals to dance before him a power granted by God and upon summoning the mountain cock or hoopoe Aramaic name nagar tura the bird told him it had discovered a land in the east rich in gold silver and plants whose capital was called Kitor and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba Solomon then sent the bird to request the queen s visit br An Ethiopian account from the th century Kebra Nagast maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth beside the Mai Bella stream in the province of Hamasien Eritrea The Ethiopian tradition has a detailed account of the affair The child was a son who became Menelik I King of Axum and founded a dynasty that would reign as the Jewish then Christian Empire of Ethiopia which lasted years until Haile Selassie was overthrown in Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the Ark of the Covenant by King Solomon and moreover that the original Ark was switched and went to Axum with him and his mother and is still there guarded by a single dedicated priest br The claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark was an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy through the centuries and had important and lasting effects on Ethiopian culture The Ethiopian government and church deny all requests to view the alleged ark br Some classical era Rabbis attacking Solomon s moral character have claimed instead that the child was an ancestor of Nebuchadnezzar II who destroyed Solomon s temple some years later br br br Sins and punishment br br Jewish scribes say that Solomon s teacher was Shimei ben Gera and while he lived he prevented Solomon from marrying foreign wives The Talmud says at Ber a For as long as Shimei the son of Gera was alive Solomon did not marry the daughter of Pharaoh see also Midrash Tehillim to Ps Solomon s execution of Shimei was his first descent into sin br According to Kings Solomon s wives turned his heart after other gods their own national deities to whom Solomon built temples thus incurring divine anger and retribution in the form of the division of the kingdom after Solomon s death Kings br Kings describes Solomon s descent into idolatry particularly his turning after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians and after Milcom the god of the Ammonites In Deuteronomy a king is commanded not to multiply horses or wives neither greatly multiply to himself gold or silver Solomon sinned in all three of these areas In addition to his wives he collected talents of gold each year Kings a huge amount for a small nation like Israel He gathered multitudes of horses and chariots from as far as Egypt and as Deuteronomy warns took Israel back to Egypt in spirit br br According to Kings and Kings it was because of these sins that the Lord punished Solomon by removing most of the tribes of Israel from rule by Solomon s house br br And the Lord was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord the God of Israel who had appeared to him twice and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods But he did not keep what the Lord commanded Therefore the Lord said to Solomon Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days but I will tear it out of the hand of your son However I will not tear away all the kingdom but I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen br br br Enemies br Near the end of his life Solomon was beset by several enemies including Hadad of Edom Rezon of Zobah and his own official Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim br br br Death succession of Rehoboam and kingdom division br br King Solomon is a central biblical figure who according to the Hebrew Bible was the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the last ruler of the united Kingdom of Israel After a reign of forty years Kings he died of natural causes at around years of age br Upon Solomon s death his son Rehoboam succeeded him but ten of the Tribes of Israel refused him as king splitting the monarchy into the northern Kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam while Rehoboam continued to reign over the smaller southern Kingdom of Judah Henceforth the two kingdoms were never again united br Solomon is associated with the peak golden age of the independent Kingdom of Israel and is a legendary source of judicial and religious wisdom br According to Jewish tradition King Solomon wrote three books of the Bible br br Mishlei Book of Proverbs a collection of fables and wisdom of life br Kohelet Ecclesiastes a book of contemplation and self reflection br Shir ha Shirim Song of Songs a collection of erotic verse The verse has been interpreted both literally describing a romantic and sexual relationship between a man and a woman and metaphorically describing a relationship between God and his people br The Hebrew word appears in the title of two hymns and in the Psalms This Hebrew word means to Solomon but it can also be translated as by Solomon thus suggesting to some that Solomon wrote the two psalms br br br Apocryphal or deuterocanonical texts br Rabbinical tradition attributes the Book of Wisdom included within the Septuagint to Solomon although this book was probably written in the nd century BCE In this work Solomon is portrayed as an astronomer Other books of wisdom poetry such as the Odes of Solomon and the Psalms of Solomon also bear his name The Jewish historian Eupolemus who wrote about BCE included copies of apocryphal letters exchanged between Solomon and the kings of Egypt and Tyre br The Gnostic Apocalypse of Adam which may date to the st or nd century refers to a legend in which Solomon sends out an army of demons to seek a virgin who had fled from him perhaps the earliest surviving mention of the later common tale that Solomon controlled demons and made them his slaves This tradition of Solomon s control over demons appears fully elaborated in the early pseudoepigraphical work called the Testament of Solomon with its elaborate and grotesque demonology br br br Historicity br br As with most biblical personages in the middle era of Israelite society the historicity of Solomon is hotly debated Current consensus states that regardless of whether or not a man named Solomon truly reigned as king over the Judean hills in the tenth century BCE the biblical description of his apparent empire s lavishness is almost surely an anachronistic exaggeration br As for Solomon himself scholars on both the maximalist and minimalist sides of the spectrum of biblical archeology generally agree that he probably existed However a historically accurate picture of the Davidic king is difficult to construct According to some archaeologists Solomon could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah and that the northern kingdom was a separate development Such positions have been criticized by other archaeologists and scholars who argue that a united monarchy did exist in the th century BCE while agreeing that the biblical account contains exaggerations br br br Arguments against biblical description br br Historical evidence of King Solomon other than the biblical accounts has been so minimal that some scholars have understood the period of his reign as a Dark Age Muhly The first century Romano Jewish scholar Josephus in Against Apion citing Tyrian court records and Menander gives a specific year during which King Hiram I of Tyre sent materials to Solomon for the construction of the Temple However no material evidence indisputably of Solomon s reign has been found Yigael Yadin s excavations at Hazor Megiddo Beit Shean and Gezer uncovered structures that he and others have argued date from Solomon s reign but others such as Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman argue that they should be dated to the Omride period more than a century after Solomon br According to Finkelstein and Silberman authors of The Bible Unearthed Archaeology s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts at the time of the kingdoms of David and Solomon Jerusalem was populated by only a few hundred residents or less which is insufficient for an empire stretching from the Euphrates to Eilath According to The Bible Unearthed archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom of Israel at the time of Solomon was little more than a small city state and so it is implausible that Solomon received tribute as large as talents of gold per year Although both Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real inhabitants of Judah about the th century BCE they claim that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about BCE and for Judah about BCE They suggest that because of religious prejudice the authors of the Bible suppressed the achievements of the Omrides whom the Hebrew Bible describes as being polytheist and instead pushed them back to a supposed golden age of Judaism and monotheists and devotees of Yahweh Some Biblical minimalists like Thomas L Thompson go further arguing that Jerusalem became a city and capable of being a state capital only in the mid th century Likewise Finkelstein and others consider the claimed size of Solomon s temple implausible br br br Arguments in favour of biblical description br br Andr Lemaire states in Ancient Israel From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple that the principal points of the biblical tradition of Solomon are generally trustworthy although elsewhere he writes that he could find no substantiating archaeological evidence that supports the Queen of Sheba s visit to king Solomon saying that the earliest records of trans Arabian caravan voyages from Tayma and Sheba unto the Middle Euphrates etc occurred in the mid th century BCE placing a possible visit from the Queen of Sheba to Jerusalem around this time some years later than the timeframe traditionally given for king Solomon s reign Seventeen years later traces of cinnamon were found in Phoenician clay flasks from three small sites in the Israeli coastal plain dating from the th century BCE The authors suggested that trade routes with South Asia existed much earlier than previously thought br Kenneth Kitchen argues that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy mini empire rather than a small city state and considers gold talents a modest amount of money Kitchen calculates that over years such a kingdom might have accumulated up to tons of gold which is small compared to other examples such as the tons of gold that Alexander the Great took from Susa Similarly Kitchen and others consider the temple of Solomon a reasonable and typically sized structure for the region at the time Dever states that we now have direct Bronze and Iron Age parallels for every feature of the Solomonic temple as described in the Hebrew Bible br br br Middle way br Some scholars have charted a middle path between minimalist scholars like Finkelstein Silberman and Philip Davies who believes that Solomon is a totally invented character and maximalist scholars like Lemaire and Kitchen For instance the archaeologist Avraham Faust has argued that biblical depictions of Solomon date to later periods and do overstate his wealth buildings and kingdom but that Solomon did have an acropolis and ruled over a polity larger than Jerusalem In particular his archaeological research in regions near Jerusalem like Sharon finds commerce too great not to be supported by a polity and such regions probably were ruled loosely by Jerusalem Scholars like Lester Grabbe also believe that there must have been a ruler in Jerusalem during this period and that he likely built a temple although the town was quite small William G Dever argues that Solomon only reigned over Israel and did build a temple but that descriptions of his lavishness and the other conquests are strongly exaggerated br br br Archaeology br br br General observations br The archaeological remains that are considered to date from the time of Solomon are notable for the fact that Canaanite material culture appears to have continued unabated there is a distinct lack of magnificent empire or cultural development indeed comparing pottery from areas traditionally assigned to Israel with that of the Philistines points to the latter having been significantly more sophisticated However there is a lack of physical evidence of its existence despite some archaeological work in the area This is not unexpected because the area was devastated by the Babylonians then rebuilt and destroyed several times br In professor of anthropology Jimmy Hardin and his team discovered six official clay br bullae seals at a site east of Gaza called Khirbet Summeily He states that these bullae are associated with an Iron Age IIA political entity typified by elite activities dated to the th century BCE The bullae appear to be the only known examples that date to this period In his view this lends general support to the historical veracity of David and Solomon as recorded in the Hebrew biblical texts br br br Temple Mount in Jerusalem br Little archaeological excavation has been done around the area known as the Temple Mount in what is thought to be the foundation of Solomon s Temple because attempts to do so are met with protests by Muslim authorities of the Jerusalem Waqf br br br Precious metals from Tarshish br The biblical passages that understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon s great wealth in metals especially silver but also gold tin and iron Ezekiel were linked to archaeological evidence from silver hoards found in Phoenicia in The metals from Tarshish were reportedly obtained by Solomon in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre Isaiah and the fleets of Tarshish and ships that sailed in their service The silver hoards provide the first recognized material evidence that agrees with the ancient texts concerning Solomon s kingdom and his wealth see Wealth above br Possible evidence for the described wealth of Solomon and his kingdom was discovered in ancient silver hoards which were found in Israel and Phoenicia and recognized for their importance in The evidence from the hoards shows that the Levant was a center of wealth in precious metals during the reigns of Solomon and Hiram and matches the texts that say the trade extended from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean br br br Cabul br The distribution of fortified cities between Phoenicia and Galilee in Iron Age IIA th th century BCE provides context on Solomon s sale of territory to Hiram which he derided as Cabul i e good for nothing Kyle H Keimer argues that they reflected Solomon s apathy to the tribe of Asher who lived in Phoenicia or his strategic thinking where these cities served as defense barriers against foreign invasions When it came to national defense Near Eastern states did not rely on walls Instead they guarded resources which they prioritized over the people In addition it revealed Solomon s political upper hand over Hiram These events were subsequently preserved in sources which a Deuteronomistic historian relied on when writing Kings br br br Biblical criticism Solomon s religiosity br From a critical point of view Solomon s building of a temple for Yahweh should not be considered an act of particular devotion to Yahweh because Solomon is also described as building places of worship for a number of other deities Some scholars and historians argue that the passages such as his dedication prayer Kings that describe Solomon s apparent initial devotion to Yahweh were written much later after Jerusalem had become the religious centre of the kingdom replacing locations such as Shiloh and Bethel Earlier historians maintain that there is evidence that these passages in Kings are derived from official court records at the time of Solomon and from other writings of that time that were incorporated into the canonical books of Kings More recent scholars believe that passages such as these in the Books of Kings were not written by the same authors who wrote the rest of the text instead probably by the Deuteronomist br br br Religious views br br br Judaism br King Solomon sinned by acquiring many foreign wives and horses because he thought he knew the reason for the biblical prohibition and thought it did not apply to him When King Solomon married Pharaoh s daughter a sandbank formed which eventually formed the great nation of Rome the nation that destroyed Herod s Temple Solomon gradually lost more and more prestige until he became like a commoner Some say he regained his status while others say he did not In the end however he is regarded as a righteous king and is especially praised for his diligence in building the Temple br King Josiah was also said to have had the Ark of the Covenant Aaron s rod vial of manna and the anointing oil placed within a hidden chamber which had been built by Solomon br The Seder Olam Rabbah holds that Solomon s reign was not in BCE but rather in the ninth century BCE during which time he built the First Temple in BCE However The Jewish Encyclopedia of gives the more common date of to BCE br br br Christianity br br Christianity has traditionally accepted the historical existence of Solomon though some modern Christian scholars have also questioned at least his authorship of those biblical texts ascribed to him Such disputes tend to divide Christians into traditionalist and modernist camps br Of the two genealogies of Jesus given in the Gospels Matthew mentions Solomon but Luke does not Some commentators see this as an issue that can be reconciled while others disagree For instance it has been suggested that Matthew is using Joseph s genealogy and Luke is using Mary s but Darrell Bock states that this would be unprecedented especially when no other single woman appears in the line Other suggestions include the use by one of the royal and the other of the natural line one using the legal line and the other the physical line or that Joseph was adopted br Jesus refers to Solomon using him for comparison in his admonition against worrying about life This account is recorded in Matthew and the parallel passage in Luke br In the Eastern Orthodox Church Solomon is commemorated as a saint with the title of Righteous Prophet and King His feast day is celebrated on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers two Sundays before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord br The staunchly Catholic King Philip II of Spain sought to model himself after King Solomon Statues of King David and Solomon stand on either side of the entrance to the basilica of El Escorial Philip s palace and Solomon is also depicted in a great fresco at the center of El Escorial s library Philip identified the warrior king David with his own father Charles V and himself sought to emulate the thoughtful and logical character which he perceived in Solomon Moreover the structure of the Escorial was inspired by that of Solomon s Temple br br br Islam br br In Islamic tradition Solomon is also known as Sulaim n ibn D w d and is considered a prophet and a messenger of God as well as a divinely appointed monarch Solomon inherited his position from his father as the prophetic King of the Israelites Unlike in the Bible according to Muslim tradition Solomon never participated in idolatry br The Quran ascribes to Solomon a great level of wisdom knowledge and power He knew the language of the birds Arabic romanized man iq al ayr br Solomon was also known in Islam to have other supernatural abilities bestowed upon him by God like controlling the wind ruling over the jinn enslaving divs and hearing the communication of ants br br And to Solomon We subjected the wind its morning stride was a month s journey and so was its evening stride And We caused a stream of molten copper to flow for him and We subjected some of the jinn to work under him by his Lord s Will And whoever of them deviated from Our command We made them taste the torment of the blaze br And when they came across a valley of ants an ant warned O ants Go quickly into your homes so Solomon and his armies do not crush you unknowingly br The Quran says br br They instead followed the magic promoted by the devils during the reign of Solomon Never did Solomon disbelieve rather the devils disbelieved They taught magic to the people along with what had been revealed to the two angels H r t and M r t in Babylon The two angels never taught anyone without saying We are only a test for you so do not abandon your faith Yet people learned magic that caused a rift even between husband and wife although their magic could not harm anyone except by Allah s Will They learned what harmed them and did not benefit them although they already knew that whoever buys into magic would have no share in the Hereafter Miserable indeed was the price for which they sold their souls if only they knew br The Quran makes a reference to a puppet posing as Solomon in exegetical literature understood as a jinni or demon who escaped captivity and took over his kingdom Solomon s loss of his throne to the demons has been understood in Islamic spirituality to represent a human losing its soul to demonic passion Attar of Nishapur writes If you bind the div demon you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon and You have no command over your self s kingdom for in your case the div is in the place of Solomon br Solomon s gifts are often used allegorically in popular literature The demons taking over Solomon s kingdom mirrors the Sufi concept of the mind giving in to evil urges The ant is depicted as a wise creature revealing to Solomon the reason behind his gift to control the wind and his name br During the Islamization of Iran Solomon became merged with Jamshid a great king from Persian mythology about who similar attributes are ascribed to br br br Bah Faith br In the Bah Faith Solomon is regarded as one of the lesser prophets along with David Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel along with others Bah s see Solomon as a prophet who was sent by God to address the issues of his time Baha ullah wrote about Solomon in the Hidden Words He also mentions Solomon in the Tablet of Wisdom where he is depicted as a contemporary of Pythagoras br br br Legends br br br One Thousand and One Nights br A well known story in the collection One Thousand and One Nights describes a genie who had displeased King Solomon and was punished by being locked in a bottle and thrown into the sea Since the bottle was sealed with Solomon s seal the genie was helpless to free himself until he was freed many centuries later by a fisherman who discovered the bottle In other stories from the One Thousand and One Nights protagonists who had to leave their homeland and travel to the unknown places of the world saw signs which proved that Solomon had already been there Sometimes protagonists discovered words of Solomon that were intended to help those who were lost and had unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places br br br Angels and magic br According to Rabbinic literature on account of his modest request for wisdom only Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants including all the beasts fowl and reptiles as well as the demons and spirits His control over the demons spirits and animals augmented his splendor the demons bringing him precious stones besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon s palace so that they might be used as food for him and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his wives and concubines with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house br br br Seal of Solomon br br The Seal of Solomon is the legendary signet ring attributed to Solomon in medieval mystical traditions from which it developed in parallel within Jewish mysticism Islamic mysticism and Western occultism It is the predecessor to the Star of David the contemporary cultural and religious symbol of the Jewish people It was often depicted in the shape of either a pentagram or a hexagram In religious lore the ring is described as having given Solomon the power to command the supernatural and also the ability to speak with animals Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman or a symbol or character in medieval magic and Renaissance magic occultism and alchemy br br br Solomon and Asmodeus br One legend concerning Asmodeus see The Story of King Solomon and Ashmedai goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish Asmodeus then swallowed the king stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth and spat out Solomon to a distance of miles The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon s having failed to follow three divine commands and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king s kitchens Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place the king s daughter Naamah subsequently fell in love with Solomon but the family thinking Solomon a commoner disapproved so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert Solomon and the king s daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city where they bought a fish to eat which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish s belly also appeared in Herodotus account of Polycrates the tyrant of Samos c BCE br In another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon Asmodeus disguises himself In some myths he s disguised as King Solomon himself The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon s grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it for if they do they would take the throne as king br br br Artifacts br Other magical items attributed to Solomon are his key and his Table The latter was said to be held in Toledo in Visigothic Spain and was part of the loot taken by Tariq ibn Ziyad during the Muslim conquest of Spain according to ibn Abd al Hakam s History of the Conquest of Spain The former appears in the title of The Lesser Key of Solomon a Christian grimoire whose framing story is Solomon capturing demons using his ring and forcing them to explain themselves to him br In The Book of Deadly Names purportedly translated from Arabic manuscripts found hidden in a building in Spain the King of the Jinn Fiqi ush brings jinn before King Solomon to confess their corruptions and places of residence Fiqitush tells King Solomon the recipes for curing such corruptions as each evil jinn confesses br br br Angels br Angels also helped Solomon in building the Temple though not by choice The edifice was according to rabbinical legend miraculously constructed throughout the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a shamir a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks According to Midrash Tehillim the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon s eagle but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm s haunts by Asmodeus The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone and the rooster had sworn to guard it well but Solomon s men found the bird s nest and covered it with glass When the bird returned it used the shamir to break the glass whereupon the men scared the bird causing it to drop the worm which the men could then bring to Solomon br br br In the Kabbalah br Early adherents of the Kabbalah portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels Uzza and Azzazel were chained the eagle would rest on the chains and Solomon using the magic ring would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know br br br The palace without entrance br According to one legend while traveling magically Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but they found only an eagle which said that it was years old but that it had never seen an entrance An elder brother of the eagle years old was then found but it also did not know the entrance The eldest brother of these two birds which was years old then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind Having discovered the entrance Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed years before the time of Solomon that the statue was of Shaddad the son of Ad and that it had reigned over a million cities rode on a million horses had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors yet it could not resist the angel of death br br br Throne br br Solomon s throne is described at length in Targum Sheni which is compiled from three different sources and in two later Midrash According to these there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions each facing a golden eagle There were six steps to the throne on which animals all of gold were arranged in the following order on the first step a lion opposite an ox on the second a wolf opposite a sheep on the third a tiger opposite a camel on the fourth an eagle opposite a peacock on the fifth a cat opposite a cock on the sixth a sparrow hawk opposite a dove On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow hawk in its claws symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne namely Solomon Rehoboam Hezekiah Manasseh Amon and Josiah There was also on the top of the throne a golden candelabrum on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam Noah Shem Abraham Isaac Jacob and Job and on the seven of the other the names of Levi Kohath Amram Moses Aaron Eldad Medad and in addition Hur another version has Haggai Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab Abihu and Eli and his two sons were engraved Over the throne twenty four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king s head br By a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go Supposedly due to another mechanical trick when the king reached the first step the ox stretched forth its leg on which Solomon leaned a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat near which a golden serpent lay coiled When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head the serpent uncoiled itself and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him The dove then descended took the scroll of the Law from the Ark and placed it on Solomon s knees When the king sat surrounded by the Sanhedrin to judge the people the wheels began to turn and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony Moreover while Solomon was ascending the throne the lions scattered various fragrant spices After Solomon s death Pharaoh Shishak when taking away the treasures of the Temple I Kings xiv carried off the throne which remained in Egypt until Sennacherib conquered that country After Sennacherib s fall Hezekiah gained possession of it but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh Necho the latter took it away However according to rabbinical accounts Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame Nebuchadnezzar into whose possession the throne subsequently came shared a similar fate The throne then passed to the Persians whose king Darius was the first to sit successfully on Solomon s throne after his death subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and Ahasuerus br br br Freemasonry br Masonic rituals
