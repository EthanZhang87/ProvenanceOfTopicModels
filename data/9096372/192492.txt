England Zoological Society Bristol Zoo was the world s oldest provincial zoo It was a Victorian walled zoo located between Clifton Down and Clifton College near Brunel s Clifton Suspension Bridge it

comic animal communicator Johnny Morris Morris would play keeper and voice all the animals there br The zoo s official name was Bristol Zoological Gardens Bristol Zoo Gardens for commercial purposes This was not in recognition of the flower displays but recognises the first use of that title at the Regent s Park Zoological Gardens Bristol like its earlier London counterpart included several original buildings which have been praised for their architectural quirks despite being unsuitable for the care of animals the former Giraffe House joined the main entrance lodge and the south gates on Guthrie Road as a Grade II listed building The old Monkey Temple resembling a southern Asian temple was home to an exhibit called Smarty plants an interactive exhibit which shows how plants use and manipulate animals to survive br The zoo also has breeding firsts including the first black rhino born in Britain in the first squirrel monkey born in captivity in and the first chimpanzee born in Europe in br br br Conservation br Bristol Zoological Society BZS supports wildlife conservation education and breeding programmes worldwide For example Bristol worked with other zoos around the world to breed lemurs in captivity Native to Madagascar the lemurs are critically endangered because their forest habitat is being destroyed br Similarly BZS supports the UK US charity Ape Action Africa which rescues and rehabilitates primates in Cameroon West Africa Closer to home the zoo helped to reintroduce the water vole and the white clawed crayfish to parts of Southern England They also had conservation projects for Kordofan giraffe Agalychnis lemur Negros bleeding heart pigeon Sanje Mangabey and Hogna ingens br In as part of the Bristol Zoological Society s focus on conservation the zoo
