Gaius Caesar Augustus Germanicus August January better known by his nickname Caligula was Roman emperor from AD until his assassination in AD He was the son of the Roman general Germanicus and Augustus granddaughter Agrippina the Elder members of the first ruling family of the Roman Empire He was born two years before Tiberius was made emperor Gaius accompanied his father mother and siblings on campaign in Germania at little more than four or five years old He had been named after Gaius Julius Caesar but his father s soldiers affectionately nicknamed him Caligula little boot br Germanicus died at Antioch in and Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Emperor Tiberius who was Germanicus biological uncle and adoptive father The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family with Caligula as the sole male survivor In Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri and in Caligula joined him there Tiberius died in and Caligula succeeded him as emperor at the age of br Of the few surviving sources about Caligula and his four year reign most were written by members of the nobility and senate long after the events they purport to describe They portray Caligula as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule but increasingly self indulgent cruel sadistic extravagant and sexually perverted thereafter an insane tyrant who demanded and received worship as a living god humiliated his Senate and planned to make his horse a consul Most modern commentaries seek to explain Caligula s position personality and historical context Many of the allegations against him are dismissed as misunderstandings exaggeration mockery or malicious fantasy br During his brief reign Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself He began the construction of two aqueducts in Rome the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus During his reign the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province He had to abandon an attempted invasion of Britain and the installation of his statue in the Temple of Jerusalem In early Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard senators and courtiers At least some of the conspirators might have planned this as an opportunity to restore the Roman Republic and aristocratic privileges but if so their plan was thwarted by the Praetorians who seem to have spontaneously chosen Caligula s uncle Claudius as the next emperor Caligula s death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line though the Julio Claudian dynasty continued to rule until the demise of Caligula s nephew the Emperor Nero br br br Early life br br Caligula was born in Antium on August AD the third of six surviving children of Germanicus and his wife and second cousin Agrippina the Elder Germanicus was a grandson of Mark Antony and Agrippina was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder making her the granddaughter of Augustus The future emperor Claudius was Caligula s paternal uncle Caligula had two older brothers Nero and Drusus and three younger sisters Agrippina the Younger Julia Drusilla and Julia Livilla At the age of two or three he accompanied his father Germanicus on campaigns in the north of Germania He wore a miniature soldier s outfit devised by his mother to please the troops including army boots caligae and armour The soldiers nicknamed him Caligula little boot Winterling believes he would have enjoyed the attention of the soldiers to whom he was something of a mascot though he later grew to dislike the nickname br br Germanicus was a respected immensely popular figure among his troops and Roman civilians of every class and was widely expected to eventually succeed his uncle Tiberius as emperor He was awarded the great honour of a triumph for his northern campaigns Caligula and his siblings shared their father s chariot during the triumphal procession through the city of Rome Germanicus was posted eastwards with his family at Assos Caligula gave a public speech aged only Germanicus died at Antioch Syria in AD aged after a lingering illness convinced that he had been poisoned by an enemy Many believed that he had been killed at the behest of Tiberius as a potential rival br Caligula was brought back to Rome and lived there with his mother Agrippina She made no secret of her imperial ambitions for herself and her sons and in consequence her relations with Tiberius rapidly deteriorated Tiberius believed himself under constant threat from treason conspiracy and political rivalry He forbade Agrippina to remarry for fear that a remarriage would serve her personal ambition and introduce yet another threat to himself Agrippina and Caligula s brother Nero were banished in the year on charges of treason The adolescent Caligula was sent to live with his great grandmother Tiberius mother Livia After her death two years later he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia Minor In the year Tiberius had Caligula s brothers Drusus and Nero declared public enemies by the Senate Drusus was imprisoned and Nero was exiled Caligula and his three sisters remained in Italy as hostages of Tiberius kept under close watch br In the year at the age of Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius at Villa Jovis on Capri He lived there for six years Roman historians describe Caligula at this time as a first rate orator well informed cultured and intelligent an excellent natural actor who recognized the danger he was in and hid his resentment of Tiberius maltreatment of himself and his family behind such an obsequious manner that it was said of him that there had never been a better slave or a worse master br br Caligula was befriended by Tiberius Praetorian prefect Naevius Sutorius Macro Macro had been active in the downfall of Sejanus his ambitious and manipulative predecessor in office and was a trusted communicant between the emperor and his senate in Rome Philo Jewish diplomat and later witness to several events in Caligula s court writes that Macro supported Caligula through this time attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor held towards the youth In Tiberius gave the year old Caligula an honorary quaestorship though not of the first rank in the cursus honorum a series of political promotions that could lead to consulship Caligula would hold this very junior senatorial post until his sudden nomination as emperor Meanwhile both Caligula s mother and his brother Drusus died in prison Nero died in exile In the same year Tiberius arranged Caligula s marriage to Junia Claudilla daughter of one of Tiberius most influential allies in the Senate Marcus Junius Silanus Claudilla died in childbirth the following year along with her baby In the year Caligula was named joint heir to Tiberius estate along with Tiberius Gemellus Tiberius grandson Gemellus was Caligula s junior by seven years not yet an adult but was otherwise a viable candidate for the throne Tiberius seemed in good health and likely to survive to Gemellus majority br In Philo s account Tiberius was genuinely fond of Gemellus but doubted his personal capacity to rule and feared for his safety should Caligula come to power Suetonius claims that Tiberius ever mistrustful but still shrewd in his mid s saw through Caligula s apparent self possession to an underlying erratic and unreliable temperament not one to be trusted in government Suetonius claims that Caligula was by this time already cruel and vicious and that Tiberius deliberately indulged the young man s taste for theatre dance and singing in the hope that this would help soften his otherwise savage nature he used to say now and then that to allow Gaius to live would prove the ruin of himself and of all men and that he was rearing a viper for the Roman people and a Phaethon for the world Winterling points out that this judgment draws on later not particularly accurate accounts of Caligula s rule and credits Tiberius with a knowledge of human nature which in reality was not only foreign to him but famously unsound At Capri Caligula learned to dissimulate He probably owed his life to that and as all the ancient sources agree to Macro Many believed or claimed to believe that given a little more time Tiberius would have eliminated Caligula as a possible successor but died before this could be done br br br Emperor br br br Early Reign br br Tiberius died hated by his subjects on March AD a day before the Liberalia festival Suetonius and Tacitus repeat rumours that Caligula possibly assisted by Macro smothered Tiberius with a pillow Philo leading Jewish Greek philosopher and diplomat who wrote during Tiberius reign and Josephus Romano Jewish writer who served Vespasian a generation later describe Tiberius death as natural On the same day Caligula was hailed as emperor by members of the Praetorian guard at Misenum His leadership of the domus Caesaris Caesar s household as its sole heir and pater familias was ratified by the senate who acclaimed him imperator two days later When he arrived in Rome on or March the Senate conferred on him the right and power to decide on all affairs br In a single day the year old Caligula though virtually unknown in Rome s political life was thus granted the same trappings authority and powers that Augustus had accumulated over a lifetime Until his first formal meeting with the Senate Caligula desisted from using the titles they had granted him His studied deference must have gone some way to reassure the more astute of their number some of whom must have resented the political manipulations that led to this extraordinary settlement Caligula was now entitled to make break or ignore any laws he chose He must play the challenging role of primus inter pares first among equals with self restraint decorum persuasion and above all tact as if the Senate still held the power they had voluntarily surrendered to him br Caligula dutifully asked the Senate to approve the deification of his predecessor but was turned down in line with senatorial and popular opinion regarding the dead emperor s worth Caligula did not push the issue he had made the necessary gesture of filial respect He gave Tiberius a magnificent funeral at public expense and a tearful eulogy Tiberius will naming two heirs was annulled with the standard justification that he had been insane incapable of good judgment Caligula continued to benefit from Macro s knowledge and advice concerning the behaviour and manners appropriate to a princeps at their morning salutations banquets games law courts debates and receptions of foreign dignitaries Caligula took up a first consulship on July two months after succession He refused the title pater patriae father of the fatherland on the grounds of his youth until September br Philo describes Caligula in these early days as the first emperor admired by all the world from the rising to the setting sun Suetonius writes that Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular Germanicus and for not being Tiberius Three months of public rejoicing ushered in the new reign Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula s reign as a Golden Age of happiness and prosperity br Although Tiberius will had been legally set aside Caligula honoured many of its terms Tiberius had provided each praetorian guardsman with a generous gratitude payment of sesterces Caligula doubled this and took credit for its payment as an act of personal generosity he also paid bonuses to the city troops and the army outside Italy Every citizen in Rome was given sesterces and heads of households twice that amount Building projects on the Palatine hill and elsewhere were also announced which would have been the largest of these expenditures br Caligula made a public show of burning Tiberius secret papers they outlined many of the senate s various acts of villainy betrayal and treason against Tiberius and their cooperation in trials of their own number Caligula claimed falsely as it later turned out that he had read none of these documents before burning them He used coinage issues to advertise his restoration of the rule of law and reduced a backlog of court cases in Rome by adding more jurors and suspending the requirement that sentences be confirmed by imperial office br Stressing his descent from Augustus Caligula retrieved the remains of his mother and brothers for interment in the Mausoleum of Augustus He granted his sisters and other family members including Claudius who had not been recognised as a member of the imperial household during Tiberius reign political and priestly honours He began work on a temple to Livia widow of Augustus she held the honorific title of Augusta while still living and when she died was eventually made a diva goddess of the Roman state under Claudius The temple had been vowed in her lifetime but not constructed Claudius was made Caligula s consular colleague in the new emperor s first consulship br br br Illness and recovery br Between approximately mid October and mid November Caligula fell seriously ill through unknown causes and hovered for a month or so between life and death Rome s public places filled with citizens who implored the gods for his recovery some even offering their own lives in exchange By late October their emperor had recovered and embarked on what seems to have been a purge of suspected opponents br Gemellus was happily adopted into the Imperial dynasty as Caligula s son and heir after the annulment of Tiberius will and given the adult toga virilis Then he was charged with having taken an antidote implicitly accusing Caligula of wanting to poison him and was forced to kill himself Tiberius political associate Silanus senior senator ex consul formerly Caligula s father in law and criticised by the historian Tacitus for his servile attitude was executed as a supporter of Gemellus in early Caligula forced suicide on his Praetorian Prefect Macro without whose help and protection he would not have survived let alone gained the throne as sole ruler br In Caligula nominated Marcus Aemilius Lepidus as his heir and married him to his beloved sister Drusilla but on June that year Drusilla died She was deified and renamed Panthea All Goddesses Her death is one of several events approximate to the time of Caligula s illness besides the death of Antonia and effects of the illness itself thought by some to explain a fundamental change in Caligula s attitudes Purges so early in Caligula s reign suggest to Weidemann that the new emperor had learnt a great deal from Tiberius and that attempts to divide his reign into a good beginning followed by unremitting atrocities are misplaced br br br Public profile br Caligula shared many of the popular passions and enthusiasms of the lower classes and young aristocrats public spectacles particularly gladiator contests chariot and horse racing the theatre and gambling He trained with professional gladiators and staged exceptionally lavish gladiator games being granted exemption by the senate from the sumptuary laws that limited the number of gladiators to be kept in Rome He was openly and vocally partisan in his uninhibited support or disapproval of particular charioteers racing teams gladiators and actors shouting encouragement or scorn sometimes singing along with paid performers or declaiming the actors lines and generally behaving as one of the crowd In gladiator contests he supported the parmularius type who fought using small round shields In chariot races he supported the Greens and personally drove his favourite racehorse Incitatus Speedy as a member of the Green faction Most of Rome s upper class would have thought this an unacceptable indignity for any of their number let alone their emperor Nevertheless in the first flush of his reign relations between himself and his senate were congenial though sullied a year or so later by the forced suicide of Silanus senior senator formerly Caligula s father in law br Caligula seems to have shown diminishing respect for distinctions of rank status or privilege among the senate whose members Tiberius had once described as men ready to be slaves Among those whom Caligula recalled from exile were actors and other public performers who had somehow caused Tiberius offence Caligula seems to have built a loyal following among his own loyal freedmen citizen commoners disreputable public performers on whom he lavished money and other gifts and the lower nobility equestrians rather than the senators and nobles whom he clearly and openly mistrusted despised and humiliated for their insincere simulations of loyalty Dio notes with approval that Caligula allowed some equestrians senatorial honours anticipating their later promotion to senator based on their personal merits To reverse declining membership of the equestrian order Caligula recruited new wealthy members empire wide and scrupulously vetted the order s membership lists for signs of dishonesty or scandal He seems to have ignored trivial misdemeanours and would have anticipated the creation of new men novi homines in the senate house who would owe him a debt of gratitude and loyalty for their advancement br Roman sources are unclear regarding Caligula s attitudes to the equestrian order Barrett describes some of the supposed equestrian offences punished by Caligula as decidedly trivial and their punishments as sensationalist Dio claims that Caligula had more than equestrians executed in a circus fracas in Suetonius biography more than lives were lost in what is almost certainly the same event described as a violent but accidental crush Some sources claim that Caligula forced equestrians and senators to fight in the arena as gladiators Condemnation to the gladiator arena as a combatant was a standard punishment doubling as public entertainment for non citizens found guilty of certain offences Such appearances were not exclusively punitive nor entirely reserved for the lowest classes Laws of AD by Augustus and Tiberius banned voluntary participation of the elite in any public spectacles but the ban which was never particularly effective was broadly ignored in Caligula s reign During Caligula s illness two citizens one of whom was an equestrian offered to fight as gladiators if only the gods would spare the emperor s life Caligula recovered and seems to have called in the debt in what Winterling describes as insincere offers taken at face value cynical but not without wit of a kind br br br Public reform and finance br br In Caligula lifted censorship and published accounts of public funds and expenditure Suetonius congratulates this as the first such act by any emperor Caligula was intelligent and well informed quite capable of recognising plans and decisions including his own as flawed and abandoning revising or reversing them when faced with opposition Very soon after his succession he restored the right of the popular assembly comitia to elect magistrates on behalf of the common citizenry a right that had been taken over by the Senate under Tiberius and Augustus The aediles elected officials who managed public games and festivals and maintained the fabric of roads and shrines would now have incentive to spend their own money on lavish high profile spectacles and other munera gifts to the state or people to win the popular vote When the Senate outright refused to accept this Caligula restored control of elections to them Dio writes that this though delighting the rabble grieved the sensible who stopped to reflect that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many many disasters would result Either way the emperor ultimately chose which candidates stood for election and which were elected Caligula was open to good advice but could just as easily take it as an insult to his youth or understanding Philo quotes his warning Who dares teach me Caligula abandoned his plan to convert the Temple of Jerusalem to a temple of the Imperial cult with a statue of himself as Zeus when warned that the plan would arouse extreme protests and injure the local economy He gave funds where they were needed he helped those who lost property in fires and abolished a deeply unpopular tax on sales but whether his extravagant gifts to favourites during his earliest reign be they actors charioteers or other public performers drew on his personal wealth or state coffers is not known At some time he ruled that bequests to office holders remain property of the office not of its holder br br br Tax and treasury br Dio remarks the beginnings of a financial crisis in and connects it to the cost of an extravagant bridge building project at Baiae Suetonius has presumably the same financial crisis starting in he does not mention a bridge but lists a broad range of Caligula s extravagances said to have exhausted the state treasury Suetonius claims that Caligula squandered billion sesterces in his first year and addressed the consequent treasury deficit by confiscating the estates of wealthy individuals after false accusations fines or outright seizure even the death penalty as a means of raising money This seems to have started in earnest around the time of Caligula s confrontation with the senate in early Suetonius s retrospective balance sheet overlooks what would have been owed to Caligula personally and in his capacity as emperor on Tiberius death and the release of his hoarded wealth into the economy at large Caligula s inheritance included the deceased empress Livia s vast bequest which Caligula distributed among its nominated public private and religious beneficiaries Barrett asserts that this massive cash injection would have given the Roman economy a tremendous boost br To Wilkinson Caligula s uninterrupted use of precious metals in coin issues does not suggest a bankrupt treasury though there must have been a blurring of boundaries between Caligula s personal wealth and his income as head of state Caligula s immediate successor Claudius abolished taxes embarked on various costly building projects and donated sesterces to each Praetorian Guard in as his own reign began which suggests that Caligula had left him a solvent treasury br In the long term the occasional windfall aside Caligula s spending exceeded his income Fund raising through taxation became a major preoccupation Provincial citizens were liable for direct payment of taxes used to fund the military a payment from which Italians were exempt Although Caligula abolished some taxes including the deeply unpopular sales tax he introduced an unprecedented range of new ones and rather than employ professional tax farmers publicani he made their collection a duty of the notoriously forceful Praetorian Guard this proved very profitable Dio and Suetonius describe these taxes as shameful some were remarkably petty Caligula taxed taverns artisans slaves and the hiring of slaves edibles sold in the city litigation anywhere in the Empire weddings or marriages the wages of porters or perhaps couriers and most infamously a tax on prostitutes active retired or married or their pimps liable for a sum equivalent to a single transaction Citizens of provincial Italy lost their previous tax exemptions Most individual tax bills were fairly small but cumulative over Caligula s brief reign taxes were doubled overall Even then the revenue was nowhere near enough and the imposition was deeply resented by Rome s commoners Josephus claims that this led to riotous protests at the Circus Barrett remarks that stories of consequent mass executions there by the military should almost certainly be dismissed as standard exaggeration br Property or money left to Tiberius as emperor but not collected on his death would have passed to Caligula as office holder Roman inheritance law recognised a legator s obligation to provide for his family Caligula seems to have considered his fatherly duties to the state entitled him to a share of every will from pious subjects The army was not exempt centurions who left nothing or too little to the emperor could be judged guilty of ingratitude and have their wills set aside Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to turn over their spoils to the state br Stories of a brothel in the Imperial palace staffed by Roman aristocrats matrons and their children are taken literally by Suetonius and Dio McGinn believes they could be based on a single incident extended to an institution in the telling Similar allegations would be made in the future against Commodus and Elagabalus Winterling traces the outline of the story to Cassius Dio s account for AD and his allegation that the noble tennants of newly built suites of rooms at the palace were compelled to pay exorbitant rents for the privilege of living so close to Caligula and under the protection of the praetorians No brothel is mentioned in this account Suetonius appears to reverse the traditional aristocratic client patron ceremonies of mutual obligation and have Caligula accepting payments for maintenance from his loyal consular friends at morning salutations evening banquets and bequest announcments The sheer numbers of friends involved meant that meticulous records were kept of who had paid how much and who still owed His agents would then visit the very same consuls who had been involved in conspiracies against him rail against the Senate s treachery en masse but ask for gifts from individuals to express their loyal friendship in return A refusal was unthinkable Winterling describes the families who occupied these rooms as hostage under the supervision of the Praetorians some paid up willingly some reluctantly but all paid Caligula made loans available at high interest to those who lacked the necessary funds to complete the humiliation of Rome s elite especially the old Republican families br Despite his biographers attempts to ridicule Caligula s taxes many of these taxes were continued after his death The military remained responsible for all tax collection and the tax on prostitution continued up to the reign of Severus Alexander Caligula s ruling that bequests made to any reigning emperor became property of his office not himself as a private individual was made constitutional under Antoninus Pius br br br Coinage br Caligula did not change the structure of the monetary system established by Augustus and continued by Tiberius but the contents of his coinage differed from theirs The location of the imperial mint for the coins of precious metals gold and silver is a matter of debate among ancient numismatists It seems that Caligula initially produced his precious coins from Lugdunum now Lyon France like his predecessors then moved the mint to Rome in although it is possible that this move occurred later under Nero His base metal coinage was struck in Rome br Unlike Tiberius whose coins remained almost unchanged throughout his reign Caligula used a variety of types mostly featuring Divus Augustus as well as his parents Germanicus and Agrippina his dead brothers Nero and Drusus and his three sisters Agrippina Drusilla and Livilla The reason for the extensive emphasis on his relatives was to highlight Caligula s double claim to the Principate from both the Julian and Claudian sides of the dynasty and to call for the unity of the family The sesterce with his three sisters was discontinued after due to Caligula s suspicion regarding their loyalty He also made a sesterce celebrating the Praetorian cohorts as a mean to give them the bequest of Tiberius at the beginning of his reign Caligula minted a quadrans a small bronze coin to mark the abolition of the ducentesima a tax on sales The output of the precious metal mints was small and his sesterces were mostly made in limited quantities which make his coins now very rare This rarity cannot be attributed to Caligula s alleged damnatio memoriae reported by Dio as removing his coins from circulation would have been impossible besides Mark Antony s coins continued to circulate for two centuries after his death Caligula s common coins are base metal types with Vesta Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder and the most common is an as with his grandfather Agrippa Finally Caligula kept open the mint at Caesarea in Cappadocia which had been created by Tiberius in order to pay military expenses in the province with silver drachmae br Numismatists Harold Mattingly and Edward Sydenham consider that the artistic style of Caligula s coins is below those of Tiberius and Claudius they especially criticize the portraits which are too hard and lack details br br br Construction br br In the city of Rome Caligula completed the temple of Augustus and the theatre of Pompey began an amphitheatre beside the Saepta He supervised the extension and rebuilding of the imperial palace to include a gallery to display his art collection Philo s description of Caligula as a would be connoisseur and aesthete is probably not very wide of the mark To meet Rome s burgeoning demands for fresh water he began the construction of aqueducts Aqua Claudia and Anio Novus which Pliny the Elder considered to be engineering marvels He built a large racetrack now known as the Circus of Gaius and Nero and had an Egyptian obelisk now known as the Vatican obelisk transported by sea on a gigantic purpose built ship and erected in the central spine of his Circus Construction of the Porta Maggiore aqueduct was started during his reign br At Syracuse he repaired the city walls and temples He pushed to keep roads in good condition throughout the empire and extended the existing network to this end Caligula investigated the financial affairs of current and past highway commissioners Those guilty of negligence embezzlement or misuse of funds were forced to repay what they had dishonestly used for other purposes or fulfil their commissions at their own expense Caligula planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city high up in the Alps He intended to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the site br Among Caligula s various public works Josephus mentions only the large scale harbour extension at Rhegium and Sicily as being of benefit It was probably intended to manage increased grain imports from Egypt It was too far south to supply the city of Rome so it might have been meant to supply Southern Italy This project was not completed br br Caligula is credited with the construction of two very large ships at Lake Nemi near the ancient onshore temple and cult centre to Diana Nemorensis One was a floating palace with plumbing and marble floors and the other slightly smaller was a floating temple to Diana br br br Treason trials br In the course of Caligula s increasingly tense relationship with his Senate deteriorated into outright hostility and confrontation This is one of Dio s more confusing accounts involving conspiracies denunciations and trials for treason maiestas following Caligula s launch of invective at the entire senate reviewing and condemning their current and past behaviour He accused them of servility treachery and hypocrisy in voting honours to Tiberius and Sejanus while they lived and rescinding those honours once they were safely dead He declared that it would be folly to seek the love or approval of such men as they hated him and wanted him dead so it would be better that they should fear him Caligula s diatribes exposed the idealised princeps or First Senator as illusion and imposture When the senate returned next day they seemed to confirm his suspicions and voted him a special guard for his protection and that of his statues Apparently seeking to please him the Senate proposed that his senatorial chair be raised on a high platform even in the very Senate house They offered a thanksgiving to Caligula as to a monarch expressing gratitude for allowing them to live when others had died Winterling suggests that Caligula s three subsequent consulships sworn at the Rostra were vain attempts to make amends public statements of respect for the senators as his equals Barrett perceives these later consulships as symbolic of Caligula s continued intention to dominate the senate and the state the change in Caligula s rule is a gradual unravelling a descent into serious mismanagement and impenetrable mistrust and latterly into arbitrary terror Dio claims that in fact there was nothing but slaughter br Caligula had not after all destroyed Tiberius records of treason trials He reviewed them and decided that numerous senators discharged from Tiberius court hearings seemed to have been guilty of conspiracy all along against emperor and State the worst form of maiestas treason Tiberius treason trials had encouraged professional delatores informers who were loathed by the populace but many of the accused had testified against each other and against Caligula s own family even to the point of initiating the prosecutions themslves If they had acted against Caligula s family they might act against Caligula himself New investigations were launched Dio names five once trusted consular senators tried for maiestas but his allegation that senators or others were put to death in great numbers is unsupported Two of the five prospered under his rule and beyond Despite allegations of his sadistic cruelty Caligula preferred public humiliation and degradation to the death penalty In early September he dismissed the two suffect consuls citing their inadequate low key celebration of his birthday August and excessive attention to the anniversary of Actium September This was last battle in a damaging civil war between two of his close ancestors which he found no cause for celebration One of the dismissed consuls killed himself Caligula may have suspected him of conspiracy br br br Incitatus br Suetonius and Dio outline Caligula s supposed proposal to promote his favourite racehorse Incitatus Swift to consul and later a priest of his own cult This could have been an extended joke created by Caligula himself in mockery of the senate A persistent popular belief that Caligula actually promoted his horse to consul has become a byword for the promotion of incompetents especially in political life It may have been one of Caligula s many oblique malicious or darkly humorous insults mostly directed at the senatorial class but also against himself and his family Winterling sees it as an insult to the consulars themselves An aristocrat s highest ambition the consulship could be laid open to ruinous competition and at the same time to ridicule Woods believes it unlikely that Caligula meant to insult the post of consul as he had held it himself Suetonius possibly failing to get the joke presents it as further proof of Caligula s insanity adding circumstantial details more usually expected of the senatorial nobility including palaces servants and golden goblets and invitations to banquets br br br Bridge at Baiae br In or by Suetonius reckoning Caligula ordered a temporary floating bridge to be built using a double line of ships as pontoons earth paved and stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae near Naples to the neighbouring port of Puteoli with resting places between Some ships were built on site but grain ships were also requisitioned brought to site secured and temporarily resurfaced Any practical purpose for the bridge is unclear Winterling believes that it might have been intended as a ceremonial replacement for triumphal ceremony to mark Caligula s attempted invasion of Britain A two day ceremony was performed with offerings to the sea god Neptune and Invidia Envy and a satisfactory result in that the sea remained completely calm The bridge was said to rival the Persian king Xerxes pontoon bridge across the Hellespont br For the opening ceremony Caligula donned the supposed breastplate of Alexander the Great and rode his favourite horse Incitatus across the bridge perhaps defying a prediction attributed by Suetonius to Tiberius soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes that Caligula had no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae On the second day he rode the bridge from end to end several times at full tilt accompanied by the soldiery famous nobles and hostages Seneca and Dio claim that grain imports were dangerously depleted by Caligula s re purposing of Rome s grain ships as pontoons Barrett finds these accusations absurd if the bridge was finished in that was far too early to have had any effect on the annual grain supply and a genuine grain crisis was simply blamed on the most outlandish episode at hand Dio places this episode soon after Caligula s furious denunciation of the Senate Barrett speculates that Caligula may have intended the whole event as an object lesson on how completely he was in charge it may also provide the most striking example of his wasteful extravagance its pointlessness might have been the whole point br br br Provinces br br br Judaea and Egypt br Caligula s reign saw an increase of tensions between Jews native to their homeland of Judea Jews of the diaspora and ethnic Greeks Greeks and Jews had settled throughout the Roman Empire and Judaea was ruled as a Roman client kingdom Jews and Greeks had settled in Egypt following its conquest by Macedonian Greeks and remained there after its conquest by Rome The causes of tensions between these communities were complex involving the spread of Greek culture Roman law and the rights of Jews in the empire and differences in religious practices and prohibitions within Judaism While the Alexandrian Greeks held citizen status Alexandrian Jews were classified as mere settlers with no statutory or citizen rights other than those granted them by their Roman governors The Greeks feared that official recognition of Jews as citizens would undermine their own status and privilege br Caligula had replaced the prefect of Egypt Aulus Avilius Flaccus with Herod Agrippa who was governor of Batanaea and Trachonitis and was a personal friend Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius and Gemellus had conspired against Caligula s mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists In Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus According to Philo the visit was met with jeers and mockery from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as a gimcrack king of the Jews In Philo s account a mob of Greeks broke into synagogues to erect statues and shrines of Caligula against Jewish religious law Flaccus responded by declaring the Jews foreigners and aliens and expelled them from all but one of Alexandria s five districts where they lived under dreadful conditions Philo gives an account of various atrocities inflicted on Alexandria s Jews within and around this ghetto by the city s Greek population Caligula held Flaccus responsible for the disturbances exiled him and eventually executed him br In Agrippa accused his uncle Herod Antipas the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of Parthia Herod Antipas confessed Caligula exiled him and Agrippa was rewarded with his territories Riots again erupted in Alexandria in between Jews and Greeks when Jews who refused to venerate the emperor as a god were accused of dishonouring him In the Judaean city of Jamnia resident Greeks built a shoddy sub standard altar to the Imperial cult intending to provoke a reaction from the Jews they immediately tore it down This was interpreted as an act of rebellion In response Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem a political rather than a religious act for Rome but a blasphemy for the Jews and in conflict with Jewish monotheism In this context Philo wrote that Caligula regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his br In May of Philo accompanied a deputation of Alexandrian Jews and Greeks to Caligula and a second deputation after August that year during the worst of the Alexandrian riots Neither of these encounters proved decisive Both gave Caligula ample opportunity for casual friendly banter which seems to have included humiliating levity always at the Jewish delegation s expense but he made no claims of divinity either in his dress nor his speech merely asking at the second encounter more or less rhetorically why Jews found his veneration so difficult Philo who was both a diplomat and scholar and his co religionist Josephus believe that Caligula s behaviour was driven by his claim of personal divinity which for a Jew would have virtually defined him as fundamentally insane despite appearances otherwise br The ethnically Greek population of Alexandria had already made their loyalty to the new emperor clear with displays of his image as focus for his cult The destruction of the altar at Jamlia and presumably removal of idolatrous images placed in synagogues by Greek citizens might have been intended as an expression of Jewish religious fervour rather than a response aimed at one tyrant s offensive claims of personal godhood Philo seems to have loathed Caligula from the start but his belief that Caligula hated the Jews and was preparing their destruction has no basis in evidence To place Caligula s statue in Temple precincts showing him dressed as Jupiter would have been consistent with the Empire wide religious phenomenon known as Imperial cult from whose full expression Jews had so far been exempted they could offer prayer for the emperor rather than to him Caligula found this most unsatisfactory Rome expected relations between different religions and different peoples within its Empire to be founded on reciprocity mutual accommodation and respect not the imposition of religious extremes or blasphemous obligations on fellow subjects br The Governor of Syria Publius Petronius ordered a statue from Sidon then postponed its installation for as long he could for fear of provoking a serious Jewish rebellion In some versions Caligula proved amenable to rational discussion with Agrippa and Jewish authorities Faced with threats of rebellion destruction of property and loss of the grain harvest if the plan went ahead Caligula abandoned the project In more hostile versions Caligula being incapable of rational discussion impulsively changed his mind once again and reissued the order to Petronius along with the threat of enforced suicide if he failed Accordingly an even larger statue of Caligula Zeus was ordered from Rome the ship carrying it was still under way when news of Caligula s death reached Petronius Caligula s plan was abandoned Petronius survived and the statue was never installed br Philo reports a rumour that in Caligula announced to the Senate that he planned to leave Rome permanently move to Alexandria and rule the Empire from there as a divine monarch a Roman pharaoh Philo is the only source for this but very similar rumours attended Julius Caesar s last days up to his assassination and very much to his discredit Caligula s ancestor Mark Antony took refuge there with Cleopatra Augustus had made Egypt a so called Imperial province under his direct control rather than that of the Senate It was the main source of Italy s grain supply and was administered by members of the equestrian order who were directly responsible to the ruling emperor Senators had very little control of its affairs despite their higher status in Rome Egypt was more or less Caligula s property to dispose of as he wished It was a source of fascination to Romans strange and exotic a hot bed of immorality and corruption Roman knowledge of pharaonic brother sister marriages to maintain the royal bloodline would have shored up the many flimsy scandalised allegations of adolescent incest between Caligula and Drusilla supposedly discovered by Antonia but reported as rumour and only by Suetonius Gossip aside Barrett finds no further evidence for these allegations and advises a skeptical attitude br br br Germany and the Rhine frontier br In late or early Caligula ordered the concentration of military forces and supplies in upper Germany and made his way there with a baggage train that supposedly included actors gladiators women and a detachment of Praetorians He might have meant to follow the paths of his father and grandfather and attack the Germanic tribes along the upper Rhine but he was ill prepared and retreated in a panic According to Dio his achievement was negligible but Caligula used the opportunity to seize the wealth of rich allies whom he conveniently suspected of treason putting some to death on the grounds that they were plotting or rebelling Caligula accused the Imperial legate Gaetulicus of nefarious plots and had him executed according to Dio he was killed for being popular with his troops Lepidus along with Caligula s two sisters Agrippina and Livilla was accused of being part of this conspiracy he too was executed and Caligula s two sisters were exiled after being condemned pro forma for adultery br A senatorial embassy arrived from Rome headed by Caligula s uncle Claudius to congratulate the emperor for suppressing this latest conspiracy It met with a hostile reception in which Claudius was supposedly ducked in the Rhine though this might have been the loser s award in a contest of Latin and Greek oratory held by Caligula in Gaul that winter On Caligula s return from the north he abandoned the theatre seating plans that Augustus had introduced so that rank alone would determine one s place In the consequent free for all seating was left to chance doubtless to Caligula s pleasure fights broke out as senators competed with common citizens for the best seats Very late in his reign possibly in its last few days Caligula sent a communique in preparation for his imminent ovation in Rome following his military activities in the North and his suppression of Lepidus He announced that he would only be returning to those who wanted him back to the Equestrians and the People he did not mention the Senate or senators of whom he had grown increasingly mistrustful br br br Auctions br In late Caligula wintered at Lugdunum modern Lyon in Gaul where he auctioned off his sisters portable property including their jewellery slaves and freedmen Lugdunum was a wealthy provincial capital and elite bidders were seemingly prepared to pay far more than items were worth some to show their loyalty and others to rid themselves of some of the wealth that could render their execution worthwhile Caligula is said to have auctioned off gladiators to wealthy spectators after matches using intimidation and various auctioneer s tricks and tactics to boost prices br Caligula s auctions of his surviving gladiators after arena matches are said to have been extremely profitable but the context and locations are confused In an event that Suetonius describes as well known a Praetorian gentleman nodding off after a match woke to find that he had bought gladiators for the vastly over inflated sum of million sesterces Caligula s first Lugdunum auction proved such a successful fundraiser that he had many of the furnishings of his palace in Rome carted to Lugdunum and auctioned off they included many precious family heirlooms Caligula recited their provenance during the auction in an attempt to help ensure a fair return on objects intrinsically valuable and seemingly much sought after by the wealthy for their Imperial associations br Income from this second auction was relatively moderate Kleijwegt describes Caligula s performance as vendor and auctioneer at this second auction as completely out of character with the image of a tyrant Auctions of Imperial property were acceptable ways to balance the books practiced by Augustus and later by Trajan they were expected to benefit the bidders as well as the vendor Roman auctioneers were held in very low esteem but Kleijwegt claims that Caligula seems to have behaved more like a benevolent princeps in this second auction without malice greed or intimidation br br br Britannia br In the spring of Caligula tried to extend Roman rule into Britannia Two legions had been raised for this purpose both likely named Primigeniae in honour of Caligula s newborn daughter Ancient sources depict Caligula as being too cowardly to have attacked or as mad but stories of his threatening a decimation of his troops indicate mutinies Broadly it is impossible to judge why the army never embarked on the invasion Beyond mutinies it may have simply been that British chieftains acceded to Rome s demands removing any justification for war Alternatively it could have been merely a training and scouting mission or a short expedition to accept the surrender of the British chieftain Adminius Suetonius reports that Caligula ordered his men to collect seashells as spoils of the sea this may also be a mistranslation of musculi meaning siege engines The conquest of Britannia was later achieved during the reign of his successor Claudius br br br Mauretania br br In Caligula annexed Mauretania a client kingdom ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then suddenly had him executed Mauretania was divided into two provinces Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis separated by the river Malua Pliny claims that division was the work of Caligula but Dio states that the uprising was subdued in after Caligula s death by Gaius Suetonius Paulinus and Gnaeus Hosidius Geta and the division only took place after this This confusion might mean that Caligula decided to divide the province but postponed the division because of the rebellion The first known equestrian governor of the joint provinces was Marcus Fadius Celer Flavianus in office in br Details on the Mauretanian events of are lost including an entire chapter on the annexation written by Cassius Dio Caligula s reputed actions there may have been motivated by fear and jealousy of his cousin Ptolemy rather than pressing military or economic needs The rebellion of Tacfarinas had shown how exposed Africa Proconsularis was to its west and how the Mauretanian client kings were unable to provide protection to the province and it is thus possible that Caligula s expansion was a prudent response to potential future threats br br br Religion br br Philo Caligula s contemporary claims that Caligula costumed himself as various heroes and deities starting with demigods such as Dionysos Herakles and the Dioscuri and working up to major deities such as Mercury Venus and Apollo Philo describes these impersonations in a context of private pantomime or theatrical performances he may have witnessed or heard of during his diplomatic visit as evidence that Caligula wanted to be venerated as a living god Philo as a Jew and a monotheist took this as proof of the emperor s insanity br Caligula s impersonations had a precedent Augustus had once thrown a party in which he and his guests dressed up as the Olympian gods Augustus was made up and dressed as Apollo No one was thought insane in consequence and none claimed to be the god they impersonated but the event was not repeated It showed near blasphemous disrespect to the gods in question and insensitivity to the population at large the feast was staged during a famine Coin issues of the official Roman mint dated to the early s BC show Octavian as Apollo Jupiter and Neptune This too may have been thought a transgression and was not repeated Caligula took his own impersonations less seriously than some certainly less seriously than Philo did According to Dio when a Gallic shoemaker laughed to see Caligula dressed as Jupiter pronouncing oracles at the crowd from a lofty place Caligula asked and who do you think I am The shoemaker answered a complete idiot Caligula seems to have appreciated his straightforward honesty br Dio claims that Caligula impersonated Jupiter to seduce various women that he sometimes referred to himself as a divinity in public meetings and that he was sometimes referred to as Jupiter in public documents Caligula s special interest in Jupiter as Rome s chief deity is confirmed by all surviving sources Simpson believes that Caligula may have considered Jupiter an equal perhaps a rival br To Gradel Caligula s performances as various deities prove no more than a penchant for theatrical fancy dress and a mischievous desire to shock as emperor Caligula was also pontifex maximus one of Rome s most powerful and influential state priests The promotion of mortal rulers to godlike status to honour their superior standing and perceived merits was a commonplace phenomenon among Rome s eastern allies and client states during their eastern tour Germanicus Agrippina and their children including Caligula were officially received as living deities by several cities of the Greek East The recognition of social superiors as deities was also a well established feature of Roman culture a client could flatter their living patron as Jupiter on Earth without reprimand The divi deceased members of the Imperial family promoted to divine status were creations of the Senate who voted them into official existence appointed their priesthood and granted them cult at state expense Cicero could protest at the implications of Caesar s divine honours while living but address Publius Lentulus as parens ac deus parent and god to thank him for his help as aedile against the conspirator Catiline Daily reverence was offered as a matter of course to patrons heads of household and the powerful by their clients families and social inferiors In BC libation offerings to the genius of Octavian later Augustus became a duty at public and private banquets and from BC state oaths were sworn by the genius of Augustus as the living emperor Notwithstanding Dio s claims that cult to living emperors was excluded from Rome itself there is abundant evidence of municipal cult to Augustus while he lived in Italy and elsewhere locally organised and financed As Gradel observes no Roman was ever prosecuted for sacrificing to his emperor br Caligula seems to have taken his own religious duties very seriously He found a replacement for the aged priest of Diana at Lake Nemi reorganised the Salii priests of Mars and pedantically insisted that as it was nefas religiously improper for Jupiter s leading priest the Flamen Dialis to swear any oath he could not swear the imperial oath of loyalty Caligula wished to take over or share the half finished but splendid Temple of Apollo in Greek Didyma for his own cult Seemingly his statue was prepared but possibly not installed When Pausanias visited the still unfinished temple a century later its cult statue was of Apollo br br Suetonius and Dio mention a temple to Caligula in the city of Rome Most modern scholarship agrees that if such a temple existed it was probably on the Palatine Augustus had already linked the Temple of Castor and Pollux directly to his imperial residence on the Palatine and established an official priesthood of lesser magistrates to serve its cults the seviri Augustales usually promoted from his own freedmen to serve the genius Augusti his family spirit and Lares the twin ancestral spirits of his household Dio claims that Caligula stationed himself to receive veneration dressed as Jupiter Latiaris between the images of Castor and Pollux the twin Dioscuri to whom he referred humorously as his doorkeepers Dio s claim that two temples were built for Caligula in Rome is unconfirmed Simpson believes it likely that Caligula voted a temple on the Palatine by the Senate funded it himself br An embassy from Greek states to Rome greeted Caligula as the new god Augustus In the Greek city of Cyzicus a public inscription from the beginning of Caligula s reign gives thanks to him as a New Sun god Egyptian provincial coinage and some state dupondii show Caligula enthroned the first reigning Roman princeps to be described as the New Sun Neos Helios with the radiate crown of the Sun god or of Caligula s divine antecedent the divus Augustus Caligula s image on other state coinage carries no such trappings of divinity Compared to the full blown cults to major deities of state genius cults were quite modest in scope Augustus once deceased was officially worshipped as a divus immortal but somewhat less than a full blown deity Tiberius his successor forbade his own personal cult outright in Rome itself probably in consideration of Julius Caesar s assassination following his hubristic promotion as a living divinity Both emperors insisted that if temples to honour them in the provinces were proposed by the local elite they must be shared by the genius of the Senate or the personification of the Roman people or the genius of Rome itself br Caligula sold priesthoods for his unofficial genius cult to the wealthiest nobles for a per capita fee of million sesterces and made loans available to those who could not afford immediate full payment His priests supposedly included his wife Caesonia and his uncle Claudius whom Dio claims was bankrupted by the cost The circumstances mark this out as private cult and personal humiliation among the wealthy elite not subsidised by the Roman state Throughout his reign Caligula seems to have remained popular with the masses in Rome and the empire There is no sound evidence that he caused the removal replacement or imposition of Roman or other deities or even that he threatened to do so outside the hostile anecdotes of his biographers Barrett asserts that the emphatic and unequivocal message of the material evidence is that Caligula had no desire for the world to identify him as a god even if like most people he enjoyed being treated like one He did not demand worship as a living god but he permitted it when it was offered He seems to have taken his own genius cult very seriously but his fatal offense was to willfully insult or offend everyone who mattered including the military officers who assassinated him br br br Assassination and aftermath br br On January the day before his due departure for Alexandria Caligula was assassinated by the Praetorian tribunes Cassius Chaerea and Cornelius Sabinus and a number of centurions Josephus names many of Caligula s inner circle as conspirators and Dio seems to have had access to a senatorial version which purported to name many others More likely very few conspirators would have been involved and not all need have been directly in touch with each other The fewer who knew the greater the chance of success Previous attempts had foundered or faded out when faced with the rewards and risks of betrayal by colleagues whether through torture fear of torture or promised reward The Senate was a disunited body of self interested wealthy and mistrustful aristocrats unwilling to risk their own prospects and determined to present a virtuous united front In Josephus account of Caligula s assassination Chaerea was a noble idealist deeply committed to Republican liberties he was also motivated by resentment of Caligula s routine personal insults and mockery Suetonius and all other sources confirm that Caligula had insulted Chaerea giving him watchwords like the ribald Priapus or Venus the latter said to refer to Chaerea s weak high voice and either his soft hearted attitude when collecting taxes or his duty to collect the tax on prostitutes He was also known to do Caligula s dirty work for him including torture br Chaerea Sabinus and others accosted Caligula as he addressed an acting troupe of young men beneath the palace during a series of games and dramatics being held for the Divus Augustus The source details vary but all agree that Chaerea was first to stab Caligula The narrow space available offered little room for escape or rescue and by the time Caligula s loyal Germanic guard could come to his defence their Emperor was already dead They killed several of Caligula s party including some innocent senators and bystanders The killing only stopped when the Praetorians took control br Josephus reports that the Senate tried to use Caligula s death as an opportunity to restore the Republic This would have meant the abolition of the office of emperor the end of dynastic rule and restoration of the former social stature and privilege of nobles and senators At least one senator Lucius Annius Vinicianus seems to have thought it an opportunity for a takeover Some modern scholars believe he was the conspiracy s main instigator Most ordinary citizens were taken aback by Caligula s murder and found no cause to celebrate in losing the benefits of his rule Almost all the named conspirators were from the elite When Caligula s death was confirmed the nobles and senators who had prospered through hypocrisy and sycophancy during his reign dared to claim prior knowledge of the plot and therefore shared the credit for its success with their peers Others sought to distance themselves from anything to do with the assassination br The assassins fearing continued support for Caligula s family and allies sought out and murdered Caligula s wife Caesonia and their young daughter Julia Drusilla but were unable to reach Caligula s uncle Claudius In the traditional account a soldier Gratus found Claudius hiding behind a palace curtain A sympathetic faction of the Praetorian Guard smuggled him out to their nearby camp and nominated him as emperor The Senate faced with what now seemed inevitable made Claudius emperor Caligula s most powerful and universally feared adviser the freedman Callistus may have engineered this succession having discreetly shifted his loyalty from Caligula to Claudius while Caligula lived br The killing of Caligula had been extralegal without due process of law and those who carried it out had broken their oaths of loyalty It was tantamount to regicide Claudius as a prospective replacement for Caligula could acknowledge his predecessor s failings but could not be seen to condone his murder or find fault with the principate as an institution Caligula had been popular with a clear majority of Rome s lesser citizenry and the Senate could not afford to ignore the fact Claudius appointed a new Praetorian prefect and executed Chaerea a tribune named Lupus and the centurions involved He allowed Sabinus to commit suicide Claudius refused the Senate s requests to formally declare Caligula hostis a public enemy or condemn his memory see damnatio memoriae He also turned down a proposal to officially condemn all the Caesars and destroy their temples Caligula s name was removed from the official lists of oaths and dedications certain of Caligula s statues and inscriptions were discreetly removed but most of his statues had the heads recut to resemble Augustus or Claudius or in one case Nero who would suffer a similar fate br According to Suetonius Caligula s body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters br br br Personal life br In his earliest years Caligula s health seems to have been delicate enough for Augustus to send two physicians to accompany his journey north to join his parents in AD Suetonius is the only source to connect this to possible bouts of epilepsy Caligula remained subject to fainting fits as he grew older He was a habitually light sleeper prone to nodding off during banquets sleeping no more than hours in any one night and subject to vivid nightmares Barrett describes him as nervous and highly strung When speaking in public he would fidget and move about overcome by the flood of his own words and ideas He grew stronger with age but was probably never robust or particularly athletic even counting his arduous journeys north and his use of a purpose built chariot racing circuit in Rome itself Little is known of his illness in nor what it changed if anything but it was a serious possibly life threatening event Philo claims that Caligula became more ruthless after it br Caligula s first wife was Junia Claudia daughter of ex consul Marcus Junius Silanus Like most marriages in Rome s upper echelons this was a political alliance Junia and her baby died during birth less than a year later Soon after Macro seems to have persuaded his own wife Ennia Thrasylla to take up a sexual affair with Caligula perhaps to help him through the loss The sources are somewhat contradictory on the matter of Caligula s sex life Seneca claims that he would sometimes leave a banquet with another man s wife and when he was done offer her husband an appraisal of her sexual performance He is said to have had enormous appetites several mistresses and male lovers but in relation to the alleged perversions practised at Corfu by Tiberius and in some sources by Caligula himself Barrett finds him remarkably prudish in expelling the so called spintriae from the island on his accession br He was briefly married to Livia Orestilla His marriage to the Beautiful very wealthy and extravagant Lollia Paulina was quickly followed by divorce His fourth and last marriage to Caesonia seems to have been a love match in which he was both uxorious and monogamous and fathered a daughter whom he named Julia Drusilla in commemoration of his late sister Caligula s contemporaries could not understand Caligula s attraction to Caesonia she had proved herself fertile in previous marriages but also had a reputation for high living and low morals very far from the model of an aristocratic Roman wife Tales of Caligula s sexual dynamism are inconsistent with rumours that Caesonia had to arouse his interest with a love potion which turned his mind and brought on his madness br Allegations of incest between Caligula and his sisters or just he and his favourite Drusilla go back no further than Suetonius who admits that in his own time they were hearsay Seneca and Philo moralising contemporaries of Caligula do not mention these stories even after Caligula s death when it would have been safe to do so Caligula s devotion to his youngest sister was evident but then as now allegations of incest fit the amoral mad Emperor stereotype promiscuous with money sex and the lives of his subjects Dio repeats as fact the allegation that Caligula also had improper relations with his two older sisters Agrippina and Livilla br br br Mental condition br br There is no reliable evidence of Caligula s mental state at any time in his life In the course of their narratives all the primary and contemporary sources give reasons to discredit and ultimately condemn him for offences against proprieties of class religion or his role as emperor They are unreliable guides to Caligula himself or his motives Thus his acts should be seen from other angles and the search for mad Caligula abandoned Barrett suggests that from a very early age with the loss of his father then of his mother and what remained of his family Caligula was preoccupied with his own survival Given near limitless powers to use as he saw fit he used them to feed his sense of self importance practically devoid of any sense of moral responsibility a man for whom the tenure of the principate was little more than an opportunity to exercise power Caligula clearly had a highly developed sense of the absurd resulting in a form of humour that was often cruel sadistic and malicious and which made its impact essentially by cleverly scoring points over those who were in no position to respond in kind br Philo saw Caligula s illness of as a form of nervous collapse a response to the extreme stresses and strains of Imperial rule Philo Josephus and Seneca see Caligula s apparent insanity as a personality trait accentuated through self indulgence and the unlimited exercise of power Seneca acknowledges that the stress of Caligula s promotion to emperor seemed to make him more arrogant angry and insulting Several modern sources offer medical diagnoses including encephalitis epilepsy and meningitis Suetonius claims that Caligula had falling sickness epilepsy in his youth Benediktson refines this to a diagnosis of interictal temporal lobe epilepsy and a consequent fear of seizures that prevented his learning to swim In Romano Greek medical theory severe epilepsy attacks were associated with the full moon and the moon goddess Selene with whom Caligula was claimed to converse and enjoy sexual congress Suetonius descriptions of Caligula as physically repulsive are neither reliable nor likely considering his ecstatic and enthusiastic reception as a youthful princeps by the populace In the ancient world a person s physique was believed to be a reliable guide to their character and behaviour br br br Contemporary historiography br br Most facts and circumstances of Caligula s reign are lost to history Philo s works On the Embassy to Gaius and Flaccus give some details on Caligula s early reign but more on events involving Jews in Judea and Egypt whose political and religious interests conflicted with those of the ethnically Greek pro Roman population Philo saw Caligula as responible for the suffering of the Jews whom he invariably portrays in a morally positive light Seneca s various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula s personality probably written in the reign of Claudius who had a vested interest in the portrayal of his predecessor as cruel despotic even mad Seneca was prone to grovelling flattery of whoever reigned at the time His experience under Caligula could have clouded his judgment He narrowly avoided a death sentence in AD probably imposed for his association with known conspirators Caligula had a low opinion of his literary style br Further contemporaneous histories of Caligula s reign are attested by Tacitus who describes them as biased for or against Caligula of Tacitus own work little of relevance to Caligula survives Among the known losses of his works is a substantial portion of the Annals His unmitigated hostility to the Imperial system and its dynasties is evident in what survives Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus wrote histories now lost condemning Caligula Tacitus describes Fabius Rusticus as a friend of Seneca prone to embellishments and misrepresentations Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in Caligula s assassination he was a competent historian br Caligula s sister Agrippina the Younger wrote an autobiography that included a detailed account of Caligula s reign but it too is lost Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus who conspired against him Caligula also seized the inheritance of Agrippina s son the future emperor Nero Gaetulicus flattered Caligula in writings now lost Suetonius wrote his biography of Caligula years after his assassination and Cassius Dio over years after the latter offers a loose chronology Josephus gives a detailed account of Caligula s assassination and its aftermath published around AD but it is thought to draw upon a richly embroidered and historically imaginative anonymous biography of Herod Agrippa presented as a Jewish national hero Pliny the Elder s Natural History has a few brief references to Caligula The two most important literary sources on Caligula are Suetonius born around AD and essentially a biographer rather than historian and Cassius Dio a Bithynian provincial who held consulships in AD and and took years to collect and transcribe his material None of the few surviving sources paints Caligula in a favourable light Little has survived on the first two years of his reign and only limited details on later significant events such as the annexation of Mauretania Caligula s military actions in Britannia and the basis of his feud with the Senate
