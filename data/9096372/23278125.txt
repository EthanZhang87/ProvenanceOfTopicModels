id: 23278125
Bullfighting is a physical contest that involves a bullfighter attempting to subdue immobilize or kill a bull usually according to a set of rules guidelines or cultural expectations br There are several variations including some forms which involve dancing around or leaping over a cow or bull or attempting to grasp an object tied to the animal s horns The best known form of bullfighting is Spanish style bullfighting practiced in Spain Portugal Southern France Mexico Ecuador Venezuela and Peru In Colombia it has been outlawed but is being phased out with a full ban coming in effect in The Spanish Fighting Bull is bred for its aggression and physique and is raised free range with little human contact br The practice of bullfighting is controversial because of a range of concerns including animal welfare funding and religion While some forms are considered a blood sport in some countries for example Spain it is defined as an art form or cultural event and local regulations define it as a cultural event or heritage Bullfighting is illegal in most countries but remains legal in most areas of Spain and Portugal as well as in some Hispanic American countries and some parts of southern France br br br History br br Bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric bull worship and sacrifice in Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean region The first recorded bullfight may be the Epic of Gilgamesh which describes a scene in which Gilgamesh and Enkidu fought and killed the Bull of Heaven The Bull seemed indestructible for hours they fought till Gilgamesh dancing in front of the Bull lured it with his tunic and bright weapons and Enkidu thrust his sword deep into the Bull s neck and killed it Bull leaping was portrayed in Crete and myths related to bulls throughout Greece br The cosmic connotations of the ancient Iranian practice of Bull sacrifice are reflected in Zoroaster s Gathas and the Avesta The killing of the sacred bull tauroctony is the essential central iconic act of the Iranian Mithras which was commemorated in the mithraeum wherever Roman soldiers were stationed The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the Celtiberian tombstone from Clunia and the cave painting El toro de hachos both found in Spain br Bullfighting is often linked to Rome where many human versus animal events were held as competition and entertainment the Venationes These hunting games spread to Africa Asia and Europe during Roman times There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor Claudius as a substitute for gladiators when he instituted a short lived ban on gladiatorial combat The latter theory was supported by Robert Graves picadors are related to warriors who wielded the javelin but their role in the contest is now a minor one limited to preparing the bull for the matador Spanish colonists took the practice of breeding cattle and bullfighting to the American colonies the Pacific and Asia In the th century areas of southern and southwestern France adopted bullfighting developing their distinctive form br br Religious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor and the populace enjoyed the excitement In the Middle Ages across Europe knights would joust in competitions on horseback In Spain they began to fight bulls br In medieval Spain bullfighting was considered a noble sport and reserved for the rich who could afford to supply and train their horses The bull was released into a closed arena where a single fighter on horseback was armed with a lance This spectacle was said to be enjoyed by Charlemagne Alfonso X the Wise and the Almohad caliphs among others The greatest Spanish performer of this art is said to have been the knight El Cid According to a chronicle of the time in when Alfonso VII of Le n and Castile married Berengaria of Barcelona daughter of Ramon Berenguer III Count of Barcelona at Salda a among other celebrations there were also bullfights br In the time of Emperor Charles V Pedro Ponce de Leon was the most famous bullfighter in Spain and a renovator of the technique of killing the bull on a horse with blindfolded eyes Juan de Quir s the best Sevillian poet of that time dedicated to him a poem in Latin of which Benito Arias Montano transmits some verses br Francisco Romero from Ronda Spain is generally regarded as having been the first to introduce the practice of fighting bulls on foot around using the muleta in the last stage of the fight and an estoc to kill the bull This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds Thus the modern corrida or fight began to take form as riding noblemen were replaced by commoners on foot This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings initially square like the Plaza de Armas and later round to discourage the cornering of the action br The modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to Juan Belmonte generally considered the greatest matador of all time Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style in which he stayed within a few centimeters of the bull throughout the fight Although extremely dangerous Belmonte was gored on many occasions his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated br br br Styles br br Originally at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting were practised in southwestern Europe Andalusia Aragon Navarre Alentejo Camargue Aquitaine Over time these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below The classic style of bullfighting in which the rule is kill the bull is the style practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries br Bullfighting stadia are named bullrings There are many historic bullrings the oldest are the s Spanish plazas of Sevilla and Ronda The largest bullring is the Plaza M xico in Mexico City which seats people br br br Spanish br br Spanish style bullfighting is called corrida de toros literally coursing of bulls or la fiesta the festival In the traditional corrida three matadores each fight two bulls each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than kg lb Each matador has six assistants two picadores lancers mounted on horseback three banderilleros who along with the matadors are collectively known as toreros bullfighters and a mozo de espadas sword page Collectively they comprise a cuadrilla entourage In Spanish the more general torero or diestro literally right hander is used for the lead fighter and only when needed to distinguish a man is the full title matador de toros used in English matador is generally used for the bullfighter br br br Structure br The modern corrida is highly ritualized with three distinct stages or tercios thirds the start of each being announced by a bugle sound The participants enter the arena in a parade called the pase llo to salute the presiding dignitary accompanied by band music Torero costumes are inspired by th century Andalusian clothing and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their traje de luces suit of lights as opposed to the lesser banderilleros who are also known as toreros de plata bullfighters of silver br br br Tercio de Varas br The bull is released into the ring where he is tested for ferocity by the matador and banderilleros with the magenta and gold capote cape This is the first stage the tercio de varas the lancing third The matador confronts the bull with the capote performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull br Next a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a vara lance To protect the horse from the bull s horns the animal wears a protective padded covering called peto Prior to the horses did not wear any protection Often the bull would disembowel the horse during this stage Until the use of protection was instituted the number of horses killed during a fiesta generally exceeded the number of bulls killed br At this point the picador stabs just behind the morrillo a mound of muscle on the fighting bull s neck weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal s first loss of blood The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about the bull such as which horn the bull favors As a result of the injury and also the fatigue of striving to injure the armoured heavy horse the bull holds its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behavior of a bull distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves conserving their diminished energy reserves br br br Tercio de Banderillas br In the next stage the tercio de banderillas the third of banderillas each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two banderillas sharp barbed sticks into the bull s shoulders These anger and agitate the bull reinvigorating him from the aplomado literally leadened state his attacks on the horse and injuries from the lance left him in Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas If so he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employs more varied maneuvers than the standard al cuarteo method commonly used by banderilleros br br br Tercio de Muerte br In the final stage the tercio de muerte a third of death the matador re enters the ring alone with a smaller red cloth or muleta and a sword It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull the animals are functionally colorblind in this respect the bull is incited to charge by the movement of the muleta The muleta is thought to be red to mask the bull s blood although the color is now a matter of tradition The matador uses his muleta to attract the bull in a series of passes which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and creating sculptural forms between man and animal that can fascinate or thrill the audience and which when linked together in a rhythm create a dance of passes or faena The matador will often try to enhance the drama of the dance by bringing the bull s horns especially close to his body The faena refers to the entire performance with the muleta br The faena is usually broken down into tandas or series of passes The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador using the cape tries to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades going over the horns and thus exposing his own body to the bull The sword is called estoque and the act of thrusting the sword is called an estocada During the initial series while the matador in part is performing for the crowd he uses a fake sword estoque simulado This is made of wood or aluminum making it lighter and much easier to handle The estoque de verdad real sword is made out of steel At the end of the tercio de muerte when the matador has finished his faena he will change swords to take up the steel one He performs the estocada with the intent of piercing the heart or aorta or severing other major blood vessels to induce a quick death if all goes according to plan Often this does not happen and repeated efforts must be made to bring the bull down sometimes the matador changing to the descabello which resembles a sword but is actually a heavy dagger blade at the end of a steel rod which is thrust between the cervical vertebrae to sever the spinal column and induce instant death Even if the descabello is not required and the bull falls quickly from the sword one of the banderilleros will perform this function with an actual dagger to ensure the bull is dead br If the matador has performed particularly well the crowd may petition the president by waving white handkerchiefs to award the matador an ear of the bull If his performance was exceptional the president will award two ears In certain more rural rings the practice includes an award of the bull s tail Very rarely if the public and the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely and the breeder of the bull agrees to have it return to the ranch the event s president may grant a pardon indulto If the indulto is granted the bull s life is spared it leaves the ring alive and is returned to its home ranch for treatment and then to become a semental or seed bull for the rest of its life br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Recortes br br Recortes a style of bullfighting practiced in Navarre La Rioja north of Castile and Valencia has been much less popular than the traditional corridas But recortes have undergone a revival in Spain and are sometimes broadcast on TV br This style was common in the early th century Etchings by painter Francisco de Goya depict these events br Recortes differ from corridas in the following manners br br The bull is not physically injured Drawing blood is rare and the bull is allowed to return to his pen at the end of the performance br The men are dressed in common street clothes rather than traditional bullfighting dress br Acrobatics are performed without the use of capes or other props Performers attempt to evade the bull solely through the swiftness of their movements br Rituals are less strict so the men have the freedom to perform stunts as they please br Men work in teams but with less role distinction than with corridas br Teams compete for points awarded by a jury br Since horses are not used and performers are not professionals recortes are less costly to produce br br br Comic bullfighting br Comical spectacles based on bullfighting called espect culos c mico taurinos or charlotadas are still popular in Spain and Mexico Troupes include El empastre or El bombero torero br br br Encierros br br An encierro or running of the bulls is an activity related to a bullfighting fiesta Before the events that are held in the ring people usually young men run in front of a small group of bulls that have been let loose on a course of a sectioned off subset of a town s streets br br br Toro embolado br br A toro embolado in Spanish bou embolat in Catalan roughly meaning bull with balls is a festive activity held at night and typical of many towns in Spain mainly in the Valencian Community and Southern Catalonia Balls of flammable material are attached to a bull s horns The balls are lit and the bull is set free in the streets at night participants dodge the bull when it comes close It can be considered a variant of an encierro correbous in Catalan This activity is held in a number of Spanish towns during their local festivals br br br Portuguese br br Most Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases the spectacle of the cavaleiro and the pega In the cavaleiro a horseman on a Portuguese Lusitano horse specially trained for the fights fights the bull from horseback The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four bandeiras small javelins into the back of the bull br In the second stage called the pega holding the forcados a group of eight men challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defense The frontman provokes the bull into a charge to perform a pega de cara or pega de caras face grab The frontman secures the animal s head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of damask or velvet with long knitted hats as worn by the campinos bull headers from Ribatejo br The bull is not killed in the ring and at the end of the corrida leading oxen are let into the arena and two campinos on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen The bull is usually killed out of sight of the audience by a professional butcher Some bulls after an exceptional performance are healed released to pasture and used for breeding br In the Portuguese Azores islands there is a form of bullfighting called tourada corda in which a bull is led on a rope along a street while players taunt and dodge the bull who is not killed during or after the fight but returned to pasture and used in later events br R dio e Televis o de Portugal RTP ceased to broadcast bullfights in Portugal since br br br French br br Since the th century Spanish style corridas have been increasingly popular in Southern France where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights particularly during holidays such as Whitsun or Easter Among France s most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of N mes and Arles although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts Bullfights of this kind follow the Spanish tradition and even Spanish words are used for all Bullfighting related terms Minor cosmetic differences exist such as music This is not to be confused with the bloodless bullfights referred to below which are indigenous to France br br br Course camarguaise course libre br br A more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the Provence and Languedoc areas and is known alternately as course libre or course camarguaise This is a bloodless spectacle for the bulls in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull The participants or raseteurs begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the Camargue region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and N mes but also in other Proven al and Languedoc towns and villages Before the course an abrivado a running of the bulls in the streets takes place in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls The course itself takes place in a small often portable arena erected in a town square For a period of about minutes the raseteurs compete to snatch rosettes cocarde tied between the bulls horns They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw shaped metal instrument called a raset or crochet hook in their hands hence their name Afterward the bulls are herded back to their pen by gardians Camarguais cowboys in a bandido amidst a great deal of ceremony The stars of these spectacles are the bulls br br br Course landaise br Another type of French bullfighting is the course landaise in which cows are used instead of bulls This is a competition between teams named cuadrillas which belong to certain breeding estates A cuadrilla is made up of a teneur de corde an entra neur a sauteur and six carteurs The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow s horns and the entra neur positions the cow to face and attack the player The carteurs will try at the last possible moment to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps This is the main scheme of the classic form the course landaise formelle However different rules may be applied in some competitions For example competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes br At one point it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it but had to back down in the face of local opposition The bulls themselves are generally fairly small much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the corrida Nonetheless the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns Participants and spectators share the risk it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators The course landaise is not seen as a dangerous sport by many but carteur Jean Pierre Rachou died in when a bull s horn tore his femoral artery br br br Non bloodsport variations br br In Bolivia bulls are not killed nor injured with any sticks The goal of Bolivian toreros is to provoke the bull with taunts without getting harmed themselves br In El Seibo Province of the Dominican Republic bullfights are not about killing or harming the animal but taunting and evading it until it is tired br In Canada Portuguese style bullfighting was introduced in by Portuguese immigrants in the town of Listowel in southern Ontario Despite objections and concerns from local authorities and a humane society the practice was allowed as the bulls were not killed or injured in this version In the nearby city of Brampton Portuguese immigrants from the Azores practice tourada a corda bullfight by rope br Jallikattu is a traditional spectacle in Tamil Nadu India as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day A breed of bos indicus humped bulls called Jellicut are used During jallikattu a bull is released into a group of people and participants attempt to grab the bull s hump and hold onto it for a determined distance length of time or with the goal of taking a pack of money tied to the bull s horns The goal of the activity is more similar to bull riding staying on br Savika is a zebu wrestling sport found in Madagascar particularly among the Betsileo people br American freestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American rodeo The style was developed by the rodeo clowns who protect bull riders from being trampled or gored by a loose bull Freestyle bullfighting is a second competition in which the bullfighter rodeo clown avoids the bull by means of dodging jumping and use of a barrel The bullfighter is then scored points based on his performance br In California s Central Valley the historically Portuguese community has developed a form of bullfight in which the bull is taunted by a matador but the lances are tipped with fabric hook and loop e g Velcro and they are aimed at hook and loop covered pads secured to the bull s shoulder Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays While California outlawed bullfighting in this type of bloodless bullfighting is still allowed if carried out during religious festivals or celebrations br In Tanzania bullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to Zanzibar and to Pemba Island in modern Tanzania where it is known as mchezo wa ngombe Similar to the Portuguese Azorean tourada a corda the bull is restrained by a rope generally neither bull nor player is harmed and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight br br In Japan bullfighting is bull wrestling with a history of at least from the th century as the Emperor Go Toba was recorded to have been entertained by bullpushing when he was exiled to the Oki Islands br In Zhejiang China guanniu is a traditional form of bullfighting in which contestants attempt to physically wrestle a bull to the ground br br br Hazards br br Spanish style bullfighting is usually fatal for the bull and it is also dangerous for the matador Matadors are usually gored every season with picadors and banderilleros being gored less often With the discovery of antibiotics and advances in surgical techniques fatalities are now rare although over the past three centuries professional bullfighters have died in the ring or from injuries sustained there Most recently Iv n Fandi o died of injuries he sustained after being gored by a bull on June in Aire sur l Adour France br Some matadors notably Juan Belmonte have been seriously gored many times according to Ernest Hemingway Belmonte s legs were marred by many ugly scars A special type of surgeon has developed in Spain and elsewhere to treat cornadas or horn wounds br The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida and where a priest can be found in case a sacrament is needed The most relevant sacrament is now called Anointing of the Sick it was formerly known as Extreme Unction or the Last Rites br The media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries such as the September goring of matador Juan Jos Padilla s head by a bull in Zaragoza resulting in the loss of his left eye use of his right ear and facial paralysis He returned to bullfighting five months later with an eyepatch multiple titanium plates in his skull and the nickname The Pirate br Until the early twentieth century the horses were unprotected and were commonly gored and killed or left close to death intestines destroyed for example The horses used were old and worn out with little value Starting in the twentieth century horses were protected by thick blankets and wounds though not unknown were less common and less serious br However the danger lurks not only from a bull but also from other causes such as too weak infrastructure One of such cases happened in in Colombia when several people were killed and more than were injured after a stand collapsed during the bullfight The incident happened in El Espinal Tolima in central Colombia br br br Cultural aspects br br Many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained integral part of their national cultures in Spain bullfighting is nicknamed la fiesta nacional the national fiesta The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull Rather than a competitive sport the bullfight is more of a ritual of ancient origin which is judged by aficionados based on artistic impression and command American author Ernest Hemingway wrote of it in his non fiction book Death in the Afternoon Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter s honor Bullfighting is seen by some as a symbol of Spanish national culture br The bullfight is regarded as a demonstration of style technique and courage by its participants and as a demonstration of cruelty and cowardice by its critics While there is usually no doubt about the outcome the bull is not viewed by bullfighting supporters as a sacrificial victim it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary deserving of respect in its own right br Those who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is a sadistic tradition of torturing and killing a bull amidst pomp and pageantry Supporters of bullfights called aficionados claim to respect the bulls that the bulls live better than other cattle and that bullfighting is a grand tradition a form of art important to their culture br br br Women in bullfighting br br Conchita Cintr n was a Peruvian female bullfighter who began her career in Portugal before being active in Mexican and other South American bullfights Patricia McCormick began bullfighting as a professional Matadora in January and was the first American to do so Bette Ford was the

bullfighting on a scale of through only responded with A majority of of responded with among those aged this figure was and for those aged it reached With a fall in attendance the bullfighting sector has come under financial stress as many local authorities have reduced subsidies because of public criticism br br When the COVID pandemic hit Spain and the country entered into lockdown in March all bullfighting events were cancelled indefinitely In mid May the bullfighting industry alike other sectors of Spanish economy demanded that the government compensate them for their losses estimated at million This prompted outrage and more than people signed a petition launched by AnimaNaturalis urging the government not to rescue spectacles based on the abuse and mistreatment of animals with taxpayer money at a time when people were struggling to survive and public finances were already heavily strained A May YouGov survey commissioned by HuffPost showed that of the Spaniards questioned

assistant director for public affairs David Bowles said The RSPCA is strongly opposed to bullfighting It is an inhumane and outdated practice that continues to lose support including from those living in the countries where this takes place such as Spain Portugal and France br The bullfighting guide The Bulletpoint Bullfight warns that bullfighting is not for the squeamish advising spectators to be prepared for blood The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse mounted lancers the charging by the bull of a blindfolded armored horse who is sometimes doped up and unaware of the proximity of the bull the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros and the matador s fatal sword thrust The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous The guide further warns those attending bullfights to Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down br Alexander Fiske Harrison who trained as a bullfighter to research for his book on the topic and trained in biological sciences and moral philosophy before that has pointed out that the bull lives three times longer than do cattle reared exclusively for meat and lives wild during that period in meadows and forests which are funded by the premium the bullfight s box office adds on to the price of their meat should be taken into account when weighing concerns about both animal welfare and the environment He also speculated that the adrenalizing nature of the minute spectacle may reduce the bull s suffering even below that of the stress and anxiety of queueing in the abattoir However zoologist and animal rights activist Jordi Casamitjana argues that the bulls do experience a high degree of suffering and all aspects of any bullfight from the transport to the death are in themselves causes of suffering br br br Funding br br The question of public funding is particularly controversial in Spain since widely disparaged claims have been made by supporters and opponents of bullfighting According to government figures bullfighting in Spain generates billion a year and jobs of which are directly linked to the industry Furthermore bullfighting is the cultural activity that generates the most tax revenue for the Spanish state million in VAT and over million in social security br According to a poll of Spaniards oppose public funding for bullfighting activities br Critics often claim that bullfighting is financed with public money However though bullfighting attracts million spectators annually it represents just of state subsidies allocated to cultural activities and less than of the cultural budget of regional provincial and local authorities The bulk of subsidies is paid by town halls in localities where there is a historical tradition and support for bullfighting and related events which are often held free of charge to participants and spectators The European Union does not subsidize bullfighting but it does subsidize cattle farming in general which also benefits those who rear Spanish fighting bulls br In of members of the European Parliament voted in favour of amending the E U budget to indicate that the Common Agricultural Policy CAP appropriations or any other appropriations from the budget should not be used for the financing of lethal bullfighting activities br br br Politics br In the late th and early th century some Spanish regeneracionista intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of pan y toros bread and bulls an analogue of Roman panem et circenses Such belief was part of the wider current of thought known as anti flamenquismo a campaign against the popularity of both bullfighting and flamenco music which were believed to be oriental elements of Spanish culture that were responsible for Spain s perceived culture gap compared to the rest of Europe In Francoist Spain bullfights received great governmental support as they were considered a demonstration of greatness of the Spanish nation and received the name of fiesta nacional Bullfighting was therefore highly associated with the regime After Spain s transition to democracy popular support for bullfighting declined br Opposition to bullfighting from Spain s political parties is typically highest among those on the left PSOE the main left wing political party has distanced itself from bullfighting but refuses to ban it while Spain s far left political party Podemos has repeatedly called for referendums on the matter and has shown disapproval of the practise PP the largest conservative party strongly supports bullfighting and has requested large public subsidies for it The government of Jos Luis Rodr guez Zapatero was the first to oppose bullfighting prohibiting children under from attending events and imposing a six year ban on live bullfights broadcast on state run national television although the latter measure was reversed after Zapatero s party lost in the elections br Despite its long history in Barcelona bullfighting was outlawed across the Catalonia region in following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called Prou Enough in Catalan Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of Catalan separatism and identity politics In October the Constitutional Court ruled that the regional Catalan Parliament did not have the authority to ban events that are legal in Spain br The Spanish Royal Family is divided on the issue Former queen consort Sof a of Spain disapproves of bullfights but former king Juan Carlos occasionally presided over bullfights from the royal box Their daughter Princess Elena is well known for her support of the practice and often attends bullfights br Pro bullfighting supporters include former prime minister Mariano Rajoy and his party Partido Popular as well as most leaders of the opposition PSOE party including former prime minister Felipe Gonzalez and the current presidents of Andalusia Extremadura and Castilla La Mancha br br br Religion br br Bullfighting is thought to have been practised since prehistoric times throughout the entire Mediterranean coast but it survives only in Iberia and in part of France During the Muslim rule of Iberia the ruling class tried to ban bullfighting considering it a pagan celebration and heresy In the th century Pope Pius V banned bullfighting for its ties to paganism and for the danger that it posed to the participants Anyone who would sponsor watch or participate in a bullfight was to be excommunicated by the church Spanish and Portuguese bullfighters kept the tradition alive covertly and Pius s successor Pope Gregory XIII relaxed the church s position However Pope Gregory advised bullfighters to not use the sport as means of honoring Jesus Christ or the saints as was typical in Spain and Portugal br Although Pope Francis statement that every act of cruelty towards any creature is contrary to human dignity in his encyclical letter Laudato si does not mention bullfighting as such it has been taken as supporting religious opposition to bullfighting br Bullfighting has been intertwined with religion and religious folklore in Spain at a popular level particularly in the areas in which it has been most popular Bullfighting events are celebrated during festivities celebrating local patron saints along with other activities games and sports The bullfighting world is also inextricably linked to iconography related to religious devotion in Spain with bullfighters seeking the protection of Mary and often becoming members of religious brotherhoods br br br Media prohibitions br State run Spanish TVE had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August until September claiming that the coverage was too violent for children and that live coverage violated a voluntary industry wide code attempting to limit sequences that are particularly crude or brutal In a October statement to Congress Luis Fern ndez the president of Spanish state broadcaster TVE confirmed that the station would no longer broadcast live bullfights because of high production costs and a lack of advertiser support However the station continued to broadcast Tendido Cero a bullfighting magazine programme Other regional and private channels kept broadcasting it with good audiences Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s government lifted the ban and live bullfights were shown at the traditional p m time on TVE as of September br A television station in Costa Rica stopped the broadcast of bullfights in January over concerns that they were too violent for minors br br br Declaration as cultural patrimony br A growing list of Spanish Portuguese and South American cities and regions have formally declared their bullfighting celebrations as part of their protected cultural patrimony or heritage Most of these declarations have been enacted in reaction to the ban in Catalonia In April the Andalusian city of Seville declared bullfighting to be part of the city s cultural heritage br br br Laws br br br Pre th century br br In November Pope Pius V issued a papal bull titled De Salute Gregis forbidding the fighting of bulls and other beasts as a voluntary risk to life which endangered the soul of the combatants However it was rescinded eight years later by his successor Pope Gregory XIII at the request of King Philip II br Chile banned bullfighting shortly after gaining independence in but the Chilean rodeo which involves horseriders in an oval arena blocking a female cow against the wall without killing it is still legal and has even been declared a national sport br Bullfighting was introduced in Uruguay in by Spain and abolished by Uruguayan law in February thus the Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos built in only operated for two years Bullfighting was also introduced in Argentina by Spain but after Argentina s independence the event drastically diminished in popularity and was
