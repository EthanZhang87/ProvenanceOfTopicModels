title: Testing cosmetics on animals
id: 12877273
Cosmetic testing on animals is a type of animal testing used to test the safety and hypoallergenic properties of cosmetic products for use by humans br Since this type of animal testing is often harmful to the animal subjects it is opposed by animal rights activists and others Cosmetic animal testing is banned in many parts of the world including Colombia the European Union the United Kingdom India and Norway br Cosmetics that have been produced without any testing on animals are sometimes known as cruelty free cosmetics Some popular cruelty free beauty brands include E L F Charlotte Tilbury Farsali Fenty Beauty Fenty Skin Glow Recipe and others The website Cruelty Free Kitty was created to assess which brands are cruelty free Furthermore some brands have participated in animal testing in the past however if they currently do not test on animals these cosmetics are considered cruelty free br br br Definition br Using animal testing in the development of cosmetics may involve testing either a finished product or the individual ingredients of a finished product on animals often rabbits as well as mice rats monkeys dogs guinea pigs and other animals Cosmetics can be defined as products applied to the body to enhance the body s appearance or to cleanse the body This includes all hair products makeup and skin products br The United States Food and Drug Administration FDA continues to endorse animal testing methods br Re using existing test data obtained from previous animal testing is generally not considered to be cosmetic testing on animals however the acceptability of this to opponents of testing is inversely proportional to how recent the data is br br br Methods br Methods of testing cosmetics on animals include various tests that are categorized differently based on which areas the cosmetics will be used for One new ingredient in any cosmetic product used in these tests could lead to the deaths of at least animals br Dermal penetration Rats are mostly used in this method that analyzes chemical movement through the penetration of the chemical into the bloodstream Dermal penetration is a method that creates a better understanding of skin absorption br Skin sensitization This is a method that tests for allergic reactions to different chemicals In some tests a chemical adjuvant is injected to boost the immune system which was typically performed on guinea pigs In some tests no chemical adjuvant is injected with the test chemical or the chemical is applied on a shaved patch of skin The reaction is then recorded by the appearance of the skin afterward br Acute toxicity This test is used to determine the danger of exposure to a chemical by mouth skin or inhalation It shows the various dangerous effects of a substance that result from a short period of exposure Large amounts of rats and mice are injected in Lethal Dose LD tests that continue until half of the test subjects die Other tests can use a smaller number of animals but can cause convulsions loss of motor function and seizures The animals are often then killed afterward to gather information about the internal effects of the chemicals br Draize test This is a method of testing that may cause irritation or corrosion to the skin or eye on animals dermal sensitization airway sensitization endocrine disruption and LD which refers to the lethal dose which kills of the treated animals br Skin corrosivity or irritation This method of the test assesses the potential of a substance causing irreversible damage to the skin It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin This determines the level of damage to the skin including itching inflammation swelling etc br br br Alternatives br A variety of alternatives exists to of animal testing Cosmetics manufacturers who do not test on animals may use in vitro screens to test for endpoints that can determine the potential risk to humans with very high sensitivity and specificity Companies such as CeeTox in the USA acquired by Cyprotex specialize in such testing and organizations like the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing CAAT PETA and many other organizations advocate the use of in vitro and other non animal tests in the development of consumer products br Using safe ingredients from a list of that have already been tested in conjunction with modern methods of cosmetics testing the need for tests using animals is negated br EpiSkin EpiDerm SkinEthic and BioDEpi are lab made reconstructed artificial human skin models that are non animal alternative testing platforms with histological similarity with native skin tissues Artificial skin can imitate the actual human skin on which cosmetic products can be tested For example using UV light on EpiSkin can cause it to resemble older skin and adding melanocytes will turn the skin a darker color This helped create a spectrum of different skin colors that are then used to compare the results of sunblock on a different variety of people To address potential issues with other parts of the human body research companies such as NOTOX have developed a synthetic model of the human liver which is the main organ to detox the body to test harmful ingredients and chemicals to see if the liver can detox those elements br Lab grown tissues are now being used to test chemicals in makeup products MatTek is one of the companies that do this It sells small amounts of skin cells to companies to test their products on them Some of these companies are those that make laundry detergent makeup toilet bowl cleaner anti aging creams and tanning lotion Without these tissues companies would be testing their products on living animals Lab grown tissues are a great alternative to testing harmful products on animals One lab was able to grow different types of tissues in a petri dish The downfall was that the tissues were not fully functional on their own in fact many of these tissues only resembled tiny parts of an actual sized human organ most of which were too small to transplant into humans The bright side is that they were a great learning experience for many of the students researching there This technology could potentially be great but it was a major downfall Ministomachs that took about nine weeks to cultivate in a petri dish formed oval shaped hollow structures br Research companies can also use body parts and organs taken from animals slaughtered for the meat industry to perform tests such as the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test br Many companies have not made the switch to cruelty free yet for many reasons one of them being the time it takes for lab grown tissues to be useable Animals on the other hand can mature quickly Rats for example have a much quicker growth rate From birth to adult rats take about three weeks to mature and begin fending for themselves The rodents reach sexual maturity in about five weeks and begin mating soon after to produce the next generation to start the rat life cycle over again On top of the extremely short time it takes a rat to mature they can provide us with a complete set of organ systems not just a paper thin sheet of cells Rats can also reproduce and they do so at a very fast pace In general rats produce about seven offspring per litter and can reach up to at times Typical gestation periods last only a few weeks allowing each female rat to produce around five litters a year br br br History br The first known tests on animals were done as early as BC Writings of ancient civilizations all document the use of animal testing These civilizations led by men like Aristotle and Erasistratus used live animals to test various medical procedures This testing was important because it led to new discoveries such as how blood circulated and the fact that living beings needed air to survive The idea of taking an animal and comparing it to how human beings survived was a completely new idea It would not have existed at least not as quickly as it did without our ancestors studying animals and how their bodies worked br Proving the germ theory of disease was the crowning achievement of the French scientist Louis Pasteur He was not the first to propose that diseases were caused by microscopic organisms but the view was controversial in the th century and opposed the accepted theory of spontaneous generation The idea of germs and other microscopic organisms was an entirely new idea and would not have come to be without the use of animals In scientists Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek discovered and studied how germs worked They published a book about their discovery which was not accepted by very many people including the science community at first After some time scientists were able to give animals diseases from microbes and realized that microbes really did exist From there they were able to use animals to understand how the disease worked and the effects it could potentially have on the human body br All of this has led up to something a bit more recent the use of animals to test beauty products This has become a very controversial topic in recent years There are various people who are extremely against the use of animals for this purpose and for a good reason Typically animal tests for cosmetics include skin and eye irritation tests where chemicals are rubbed onto the shaved skin or dripped into the eyes of rabbits repeated oral force feeding studies lasting weeks or months to look for signs of general illness or specific health hazards such as cancer or birth defects and even widely condemned lethal dose tests in which animals are forced to swallow massive amounts of a test chemical to determine the dose that causes death This kind of testing can be vital in finding important information about products but can be harmful to the animals it is tested on br In a mistake was made that ended up changing the pharmaceutical industry drastically A company created a medicine elixir sulfanilamide to treat streptococcal infections and without any scientific research the medicine was out on shelves This medicine turned out to be extremely poisonous to people leading to large poisoning outbreaks followed by over deaths This epidemic led to a law being passed in called the U S Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act enforcing more rigorous guidelines on cosmetic products After this law was passed companies looked to animals to test their products in turn creating the first encounters of cosmetic animal testing br br br Non profit organizations br br Cruelty Free International Cruelty Free International and its partners manage the certification of all the companies across the world looking to be cruelty free Companies producing beauty and household products which do not test their products on animals for any market can request membership of The Leaping Bunny Program which allows that company to feature Cruelty Free International s Leaping Bunny logo on their products This program sets global standard of operations and sales Companies headquartered internationally can obtain certification from Cruelty Free International Companies headquartered in the United States and Canada can obtain certification from The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics CCIC In over companies were certified However some companies certifications were revoked after it was discovered they continued to test on animals in Asia br Humane Society International This is a global animal protection organization that works to help all animals including animals in laboratories This organization promotes human animal interaction to tackle the existence of all cruelty that innocent animals experience br PETA PETA certifies cosmetics and beauty products as free from animal testing or as cruelty free free from animal testing and also vegan br br br Procedures of animal testing br br There is a strategy used in animal testing laboratories titled the Three R s Reduction refinement and replacement Doke Alternatives to Animal Testing A Review br br Replacement This provides the opportunity to study the response of cellular models but in other words replacement searches for alternatives that could be done rather than testing on animal subjects br Reduction This approach is built upon the ethics to have a minimal number of animal subjects being tested on for current and later tests br Refinement This suggests that the planned distress and pain caused to an animal subject be as little as possible This approach focuses on making a home for the animals before entering testing grounds to elongate the life of laboratory animals Discomfort in animals causes an imbalance in hormonal levels which creates fluctuating results during testing br br br Legal requirements and status br br Due to the strong public backlash against cosmetic testing on animals most cosmetic manufacturers say their products are not tested on animals However they are still required by trading standards and consumer protection laws in most countries to show their products are not toxic and not dangerous to public health They also need to show that the ingredients are not dangerous in large quantities such as when in transport or in the manufacturing plant In some countries it is possible to meet these requirements without any further tests on animals Other countries may require animal testing to meet legal requirements The United States and Japan are frequently criticized for their insistence on stringent safety measures which often require animal testing br Some retailers distinguish themselves in the marketplace by their stance on animal testing br br br Legal requirements in Japan br Although Japanese law does not require non medicated cosmetics to be tested on animals it does not prohibit it either leaving the decision to individual companies Animal testing is required when the product contains newly developed tar colours br ultraviolet ray protective ingredients or preservatives and when the amount of any ingredient regulated in terms of how much can be added is increased br Japanese brands such as Shiseido and Mandom have ended much but not all of their animal testing However most other leading cosmetics companies in Japan still test on animals br br br Jurisdictions with bans br br br Brazil S o Paulo br S o Paulo in Brazil banned cosmetic animal testing in br br br Canada br In June the Government of Canada banned the testing of cosmetics on animals and the sale of cosmetics tested on animals Amendments to the Food and Drugs Act to end cosmetic animal testing through Bill C the Budget Implementation Act No went into effect on December br br br Colombia br In June the Senate of the Republic of Colombia approved a resolution banning the commercialization and testing of cosmetics on animals In August presidential assent was granted to the resolution thus effectively banning the testing of cosmetics on animals in Colombia br br br European Union br The European Union EU followed suit after it agreed to phase in a near total ban on the sale of animal tested cosmetics throughout the EU from and to ban cosmetics related animal testing Animal testing is regulated in EC Regulation on cosmetics Imported cosmetics ingredients tested on animals were phased out for EU consumer markets in by the ban but can still be sold to outside of the EU Norway banned cosmetics animal testing at the same time as the EU In May the European Parliament voted for the EU and its Member States to work towards a UN convention against the use of animal testing for cosmetics br br br European Free Trade Association br The four EFTA countries that are not in the EU i e Norway Liechtenstein Switzerland and Iceland also banned cosmetic testing br br br Guatemala br In Guatemala banned cosmetic animal testing br br br India br In early India announced a ban on testing cosmetics on animals in the country thereby becoming the second country in Asia to do so Later India banned import of cosmetics tested on animals in November br br br Israel br Israel banned the import and marketing of cosmetics toiletries or detergents that were tested on animals in br br br New Zealand br In New Zealand also banned animal testing However the ban on testing cosmetics on animals was unlikely to lead to products being stripped from shelves in New Zealand as around percent of cosmetic products sold in New Zealand were made overseas br br br Taiwan br In Taiwan launched a bill proposing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals It passed in and went into effect in Shortly before the ban went into effect on November however it was noted that most Taiwan cosmetic companies already did not experiment with animals br br br Turkey br Turkey banned any animal testing for cosmetic products that have already been introduced to the market br br br UK br Animal testing on cosmetics or their ingredients was banned in the UK in br br br Jurisdictions where prohibitions are considered br br br Association of Southeast Asian Nations br The Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN is potentially making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals br br br Australia br In Australia the End Cruel Cosmetics Bill was introduced to Parliament in March which would ban local testing which generally does not happen there and importation of cosmetics tested on animals In a bill was passed to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals which came into effect in July br br br United States br In March the Humane Cosmetics Act was introduced to the U S Congress It would ban cosmetic testing on animals and eventually would ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals The bill did not advance br Similar bills have been introduced and passed at the state level and testing cosmetics on animals has been banned in ten US states as of California Nevada Illinois Hawaii Maryland Maine New Jersey Virginia Louisiana and New York br br br Mexico br On March the Mexican Senate unanimously passed legislation banning testing cosmetics on animals The proposed ban now awaits approval from the lower house of the Mexican Congress the Mexican Chamber of Deputies br br br South Korea br South Korea is also potentially making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals br br br Other statuses br br br China br China passed a law on June to eliminate the requirement for animal testing of cosmetics Though domestically produced ordinary cosmetic goods do not require testing animal testing is still mandated by law for Chinese made cosmeceuticals cosmetic goods which make a functional claim which are available for sale in China Cosmetics intended solely for export are exempt from the animal testing requirement As of March post market testing i e tests on cosmetics after they hit the market for finished imported and domestically produced cosmetic products will no longer require animal testing Chinese law was further amended in April fully dropping all remaining mandatory animal testing requirements for all cosmetics both locally produced and imported instead creating a regulatory preference for non animal based testing methods in the safety certification of cosmetic products br br br Russia br In the Russian Ministry of Health stated Toxicological testing is performed by means of testing for skin allergic reaction or test on mucous tissue eye area with use of lab animals or by use of alternative general toxicology methods IN VITRO In this manner the technical regulations include measures which provide an alternative to animal testing br br br See also br Animal testing on invertebrates br
