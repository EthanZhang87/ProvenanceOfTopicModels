title: Conservation movement
id: 45441
The conservation movement also known as nature conservation is a political environmental and social movement that seeks to manage and protect natural resources including animal fungus and plant species as well as their habitat for the future Conservationists are concerned with leaving the environment in a better state than the condition they found it in Evidence based conservation seeks to use high quality scientific evidence to make conservation efforts more effective br The early conservation movement evolved out of necessity to maintain natural resources such as fisheries wildlife management water soil as well as conservation and sustainable forestry The contemporary conservation movement has broadened from the early movement s emphasis on use of sustainable yield of natural resources and preservation of wilderness areas to include preservation of biodiversity Some say the conservation movement is part of the broader and more far reaching environmental movement while others argue that they differ both in ideology and practice Conservation is seen as differing from environmentalism and it is generally a conservative school of thought which aims to preserve natural resources expressly for their continued sustainable use by humans br br br History br br br Early history br br The conservation movement can be traced back to John Evelyn s work Sylva presented as a paper to the Royal Society in Published as a book two years later it was one of the most highly influential texts on forestry ever published Timbre resources in England were becoming dangerously depleted at the time and Evelyn advocated the importance of conserving the forests by managing the rate of depletion and ensuring that the cut down trees get replenished br The field developed during the th century especially in Prussia and France where scientific forestry methods were developed These methods were first applied rigorously in British India from the early th century The government was interested in the use of forest produce and began managing the forests with measures to reduce the risk of wildfire in order to protect the household of nature as it was then termed This early ecological idea was in order to preserve the growth of delicate teak trees which was an important resource for the Royal Navy br Concerns over teak depletion were raised as early as and when the Navy was undergoing a massive expansion during the Napoleonic Wars this pressure led to the first formal conservation Act which prohibited the felling of small teak trees The first forestry officer was appointed in to regulate and preserve the trees necessary for shipbuilding br This promising start received a setback in the s and s when laissez faire economics and complaints from private landowners brought these early conservation attempts to an end br In American poet George Pope Morris published Woodman Spare that Tree a Romantic poem urging a lumberjack to avoid an oak tree that has sentimental value The poem was set to music later that year by Henry Russell Lines from the song have been quoted by environmentalists br br br Origins of the modern conservation movement br Conservation was revived in the mid th century with the first practical application of scientific conservation principles to the forests of India The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles that human activity damaged the environment that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations and that scientific empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting this ideology publishing many medico topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large scale deforestation and desiccation and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments Edward Percy Stebbing warned of desertification of India The Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in headed by Alexander Gibson a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles This was the first case of state management of forests in the world br These local attempts gradually received more attention by the British government as the unregulated felling of trees continued unabated In the British Association in Edinburgh formed a committee to study forest destruction at the behest of Hugh Cleghorn a pioneer in the nascent conservation movement br He had become interested in forest conservation in Mysore in and gave several lectures at the Association on the failure of agriculture in India These lectures influenced the government under Governor General Lord Dalhousie to introduce the first permanent and large scale forest conservation program in the world in a model that soon spread to other colonies as well the United States In the same year Cleghorn organised the Madras Forest Department and in the department banned the use shifting cultivation Cleghorn s manual The forests and gardens of South India became the definitive work on the subject and was widely used by forest assistants in the subcontinent In the Forest Department extended its remit into the Punjab br br Sir Dietrich Brandis a German forester joined the British service in as superintendent of the teak forests of Pegu division in eastern Burma During that time Burma s teak forests were controlled by militant Karen tribals He introduced the taungya system in which Karen villagers provided labor for clearing planting and weeding teak plantations After seven years in Burma Brandis was appointed Inspector General of Forests in India a position he served in for years He formulated new forest legislation and helped establish research and training institutions The Imperial Forest School at Dehradun was founded by him br Germans were prominent in the forestry administration of British India As well as Brandis Berthold Ribbentrop and Sir William P D Schlich brought new methods to Indian conservation the latter becoming the Inspector General in after Brandis stepped down Schlich helped to establish the journal Indian Forester in and became the founding director of the first forestry school in England at Cooper s Hill in He authored the five volume Manual of Forestry on silviculture forest management forest protection and forest utilization which became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students br br br Conservation in the United States br br The American movement received its inspiration from th century works that exalted the inherent value of nature quite apart from human usage Author Henry David Thoreau made key philosophical contributions that exalted nature Thoreau was interested in peoples relationship with nature and studied this by living close to nature in a simple life He published his experiences in the book Walden which argued that people should become intimately close with nature The ideas of Sir Brandis Sir William P D Schlich and Carl A Schenck were also very influential Gifford Pinchot the first chief of the USDA Forest Service relied heavily upon Brandis advice for introducing professional forest management in the U S and on how to structure the Forest Service br Both conservationists and preservationists appeared in political debates during the Progressive Era the s early s There were three main positions br br Laissez faire The laissez faire position held that owners of private property including lumber and mining companies should be allowed to do anything they wished on their properties Environmental protection therefore becomes their choice Businesses are pressured somewhat by the incentive of occupational preservation which requires that they not wholly destroy or consume the resources they rely upon Said businesses need to innovate or pivot in the event that the exhaustion of a resource is imminent br Conservationists The conservationists led by future President Theodore Roosevelt and his close ally George Bird Grinnell were motivated by the wanton waste that was taking place at the hand of market forces including logging and hunting This practice resulted in placing a large number of North American game species on the edge of extinction Roosevelt believed that the laissez faire approach of the U S Government was too wasteful and inefficient In any case they noted most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government The best course of action they argued was a long term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long term economic benefits of natural resources To accomplish the mission Roosevelt and Grinnell formed the Boone and Crockett Club whose members were some of the best minds and influential men of the day Its contingency of conservationists scientists politicians and intellectuals became Roosevelt s closest advisers during his march to preserve wildlife and habitat across North America br Preservationists Preservationists led by John Muir argued that the conservation policies were not strong enough to protect the interest of the natural world because they continued to focus on the natural world as a source of economic production br The debate between conservation and preservation reached its peak in the public debates over the construction of California s Hetch Hetchy dam in Yosemite National Park which supplies the water supply of San Francisco Muir leading the Sierra Club declared that the valley must be preserved for the sake of its beauty No holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man br President Roosevelt put conservationist issues high on the national agenda He worked with all the major figures of the movement especially his chief advisor on the matter Gifford Pinchot and was deeply committed to conserving natural resources He encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of to promote federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed million acres sq mi km under federal protection Roosevelt set aside more federal land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined br br Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service signed into law the creation of five national parks and signed the year Antiquities Act under which he proclaimed new national monuments He also established the first bird reserves four game preserves and national forests including Shoshone National Forest the nation s first The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately acres km br Gifford Pinchot had been appointed by McKinley as chief of Division of Forestry in the Department of Agriculture In his department gained control of the national forest reserves Pinchot promoted private use for a fee under federal supervision In Roosevelt designated million acres km of new national forests just minutes before a deadline br In May Roosevelt sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House with a focus on natural resources and their most efficient use Roosevelt delivered the opening address Conservation as a National Duty br In Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with John Muir who had a very different view of conservation and tried to minimize commercial use of water resources and forests Working through the Sierra Club he founded Muir succeeded in in having Congress transfer the Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the federal government While Muir wanted nature preserved for its own sake Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot s formulation to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees br Theodore Roosevelt s view on conservationism remained dominant for decades Franklin D Roosevelt authorised the building of many large scale dams and water projects as well as the expansion of the National Forest System to buy out sub marginal farms In the Pittman Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act was signed into law providing funding for state agencies to carry out their conservation efforts br br br Since br Environmental reemerged on the national agenda in with Republican Richard Nixon playing a major role especially with his creation of the Environmental Protection Agency The debates over the public lands and environmental politics played a supporting role in the decline of liberalism and the rise of modern environmentalism Although Americans consistently rank environmental issues as important polling data indicates that in the voting booth voters rank the environmental issues low relative to other political concerns br The growth of the Republican party s political power in the inland West apart from the Pacific coast was facilitated by the rise of popular opposition to public lands reform Successful Democrats in the inland West and Alaska typically take more conservative positions on environmental issues than Democrats from the Coastal states Conservatives drew on new organizational networks of think tanks industry groups and citizen oriented organizations and they began to deploy new strategies that affirmed the rights of individuals to their property protection of extraction rights to hunt and recreate and to pursue happiness unencumbered by the federal government at the expense of resource conservation br In convivial conservation was an idea proposed by Bram B scher and Robert Fletcher Convivial conservation draws on social movements and concepts like environmental justice and structural change to create a post capitalist approach to conservation Convivial conservation rejects both human nature dichotomies and capitalistic political economies Built on a politics of equity structural change and environmental justice convivial conservation is considered a radical theory as it focuses on the structural political economy of modern nation states and the need to create structural change Convivial conservation creates a more integrated approach which reconfigures the nature human configuration to create a world in which humans are recognized as a part of nature The emphasis on nature as for and by humans creates a human responsibility to care for the environment as a way of caring for themselves It also redefines nature as not only being pristine and untouched but cultivated by humans in everyday formats The theory is a long term process of structural change to move away from capitalist valuation in favor of a system emphasizing everyday and local living Convivial conservation creates a nature which includes humans rather than excluding them from the necessity of conservation While other conservation theories integrate some of the elements of convivial conservation none move away from both dichotomies and capitalist valuation principles br br br The five elements of convivial conservation br Source br br The promotion of nature for to and by humans br The movement away from the concept of conservation as saving only nonhuman nature br Emphasis on the long term democratic engagement with nature rather than elite access and tourism br The movement away from the spectacle of nature and instead focusing on the mundane everyday nature br The democratic management of nature with nature as commons and in context br br br Racism and the Conservation Movement br The early years of the environmental and conservation movements were rooted in the safeguarding of game to support the recreation activities of elite white men such as sport hunting This led to an economy to support and perpetuate these activities as well as the continued wilderness conservation to support the corporate interests supplying the hunters with the equipment needed for their sport Game parks in England and the United States allowed wealthy hunters and fishermen to deplete wildlife while hunting by Indigenous groups laborers and the working class and poor citizens especially for the express use of sustenance was vigorously monitored Scholars have shown that the establishment of the U S national parks while setting aside land for preservation was also a continuation of preserving the land for the recreation and enjoyment of elite white hunters and nature enthusiasts br While Theodore Roosevelt was one of the leading activists for the conservation movement in the United States he also believed that the threats to the natural world were equally threats to white Americans Roosevelt and his contemporaries held the belief that the cities industries and factories that were overtaking the wilderness and threatening the native plants and animals were also consuming and threatening the racial vigor that they believed white Americans held which made them superior Roosevelt was a big believer that white male virility depended on wildlife for its vigor and that consequently depleting wildlife would result in a racially weaker nation This lead Roosevelt to support the passing of many immigration restrictions eugenics legislations and wildlife preservation laws For instance Roosevelt established the first national parks through the Antiquities Act of while also endorsing the removal of Indigenous Americans from their tribal lands within the parks This move was promoted and endorsed by other leaders of the conservation movement including Frederick Law Olmsted a leading landscape architect conservationist and supporter of the national park system and Gifford Pinchot a leading eugenicist and conservationist Furthering the economic exploitation of the environment and national parks for wealthy whites was the beginning of ecotourism in the parks which included allowing some Indigenous Americans to remain so that the tourists could get what was to be considered the full wilderness experience br Another long term supporter partner and inspiration to Roosevelt Madison Grant was a well known American eugenicist and conservationist Grant worked alongside Roosevelt in the American conservation movement and was even secretary and president of the Boone and Crockett Club In Grant published the book The Passing of the Great Race or The Racial Basis of European History which based its premise on eugenics and outlined a hierarchy of races with white Nordic men at the top and all other races below The German translation of this book was used by Nazi Germany as the source for many of their beliefs and was even proclaimed by Hitler to be his Bible br One of the first established conservation agencies in the United States is the National Audubon Society Founded in its priority was to protect and conserve various waterbird species However the first state level Audubon group was created in by Harriet Hemenway and Minna B Hall to convince women to refrain from buying hats made with bird feathers a common practice at the time The organization is named after John Audubon a naturalist and legendary bird painter Audubon was also a slaveholder who also included many racist tales in his books Despite his views of racial inequality Audubon did find black and Indigenous people to be scientifically useful often using their local knowledge in his books and relying on them to collect specimens for him br The ideology of the conservation movement in Germany paralleled that of the U S and England Early German naturalists of the th century turned to the wilderness to escape the industrialization of cities However many of these early conservationists became part of and influenced the Nazi party Like elite and influential Americans of the early th century they embraced eugenics and racism and promoted the idea that Nordic people are superior br br br Conservation in Costa Rica br br br World Wide Fund for Nature br br You know when we first set up WWF our objective was to save endangered species from extinction But we have failed completely we haven t managed to save a single one If only we had put all that money into condoms we might have done some good br The World Wide Fund for Nature WWF is an international non governmental organization founded in working in the field of the wilderness preservation and the reduction of human impact on the environment It was formerly named the World Wildlife Fund which remains its official name in Canada and the United States br WWF is the world s largest conservation organization with over five million supporters worldwide working in more than countries supporting around conservation and environmental projects They have invested over billion in more than conservation initiatives since WWF is a foundation with of funding from individuals and bequests from government sources such as the World Bank DFID USAID and from corporations in br WWF aims to stop the degradation of the planet s natural environment and to build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature The Living Planet Report is published every two years by WWF since it is based on a Living Planet Index and ecological footprint calculation In addition WWF has launched several notable worldwide campaigns including Earth Hour and Debt for Nature Swap and its current work is organized around these six areas food climate freshwater wildlife forests and oceans br br br Conservation Far approach br Institutions such as the WWF have historically been the cause of the displacement and divide between Indigenous populations and the lands they inhabit The reason is because of the organization s historically colonial paternalistic and neoliberal approaches to conservation Claus in her article Drawing the Sea Near Satoumi and Coral Reef Conservation in Okinawa expands on this approach called conservation far in which access to lands is open to external foreign entities such as researchers and or tourists but prohibited to local populations The conservation initiatives are therefore taking place far away This entity is largely unaware of the customs and values held by those within the territory surrounding nature and their role within it br br br Conservation Near Approach br In Japan the town of Shiraho had traditional ways of tending to nature that were lost due to colonization and militarization by the United States The return to traditional sustainability practices constituted a conservation near approach This engages those near in proximity to the lands in the conservation efforts and holds them accountable for their direct effects on its preservation While conservation far drills visuals and sight as being the main interaction medium between people and the environment conservation near includes a hands on full sensory experience permitted by conservation near methodologies An emphasis on observation only stems from a deeper association with intellect and observation The alternative to this is more of a bodily or primitive consciousness which is associated with lower intelligence and people of color A new integrated approach to conservation is being investigated in recent years by institutions such as WWF The socionatural relationships centered on the interactions based in reciprocity and empathy making conservation efforts being accountable to the local community and ways of life changing in response to values ideals and beliefs of the locals Japanese seascapes are often integral to the identity of the residents and includes historical memories and spiritual engagements which need to be recognized and considered The involvement of communities gives residents a stake in the issue leading to a long term solution which emphasizes sustainable resource usage and the empowerment of the communities Conservation efforts are able to take into consideration cultural values rather than the foreign ideals that are often imposed by foreign activists br br br Evidence based conservation br br br Areas of concern br br Deforestation and overpopulation are issues affecting all regions of the world The consequent destruction of wildlife habitat has prompted the creation of conservation groups in other countries some founded by local hunters who have witnessed declining wildlife populations first hand Also it was highly important for the conservation movement to solve problems of living conditions in the cities and the overpopulation of such places br br br Boreal forest and the Arctic br The idea of incentive conservation is a modern one but its practice has clearly defended some of the sub Arctic wildernesses and the wildlife in those regions for thousands of years especially by indigenous peoples such as the Evenk Yakut Sami Inuit and Cree The fur trade and hunting by these peoples have preserved these regions for thousands of years Ironically the pressure now upon them comes from non renewable resources such as oil sometimes to make synthetic clothing which is advocated as a humane substitute for fur See Raccoon dog for case study of the conservation of an animal through fur trade Similarly in the case of the beaver hunting and fur trade were thought to bring about the animal s demise when in fact they were an integral part of its conservation For many years children s books stated and still do that the decline in the beaver population was due to the fur trade In reality however the decline in beaver numbers was because of habitat destruction and deforestation as well as its continued persecution as a pest it causes flooding In Cree lands however where the population valued the animal for meat and fur it continued to thrive The Inuit defend their relationship with the seal in response to outside critics br br br Latin America Bolivia br The Izoce o Guaran of Santa Cruz Department Bolivia is a tribe of hunters who were influential in establishing the Capitania del Alto y Bajo Isoso CABI CABI promotes economic growth and survival of the Izoceno people while discouraging the rapid destruction of habitat within Bolivia s Gran Chaco They are responsible for the creation of the square kilometre Kaa Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Area KINP The KINP protects the most biodiverse portion of the Gran Chaco an ecoregion shared with Argentina Paraguay and Brazil In the Wildlife Conservation Society joined forces with CABI to institute wildlife and hunting monitoring programs in Izoce o communities The partnership combines traditional beliefs and local knowledge with the political and administrative tools needed to effectively manage habitats The programs rely solely on voluntary participation by local hunters who perform self monitoring techniques and keep records of their hunts The information obtained by the hunters participating in the program has provided CABI with important data required to make educated decisions about the use of the land Hunters have been willing participants in this program because of pride in their traditional activities encouragement by their communities and expectations of benefits to the area br br br Africa Botswana br In order to discourage illegal South African hunting parties and ensure future local use and sustainability indigenous hunters in Botswana began lobbying for and implementing conservation practices in the s The Fauna Preservation Society of Ngamiland FPS was formed in by the husband and wife team Robert Kay and June Kay environmentalists working in conjunction with the Batawana tribes to preserve wildlife habitat br The FPS promotes habitat conservation and provides local education for preservation of wildlife Conservation initiatives were met with strong opposition from the Botswana government because of the monies tied to big game hunting In BaTawanga Chiefs and tribal hunter adventurers in conjunction with the FPS founded Moremi National Park and Wildlife Refuge the first area to be set aside by tribal people rather than governmental forces Moremi National Park is home to a variety of wildlife including lions giraffes elephants buffalo zebra cheetahs and antelope and covers an area of square kilometers Most of the groups involved with establishing this protected land were involved with hunting and were motivated by their personal observations of declining wildlife and habitat br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br br br World br Barton Gregory A Empire Forestry and
