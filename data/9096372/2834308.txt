A ar d apil Ekur who had briefly preceded him and he ruled for years He was the last king of the Middle Assyrian Empire and his later reign was preoccupied with a revolution against his rule led by one Tukulti Mer which by the end of his reign allowed hordes of Arameans to press in on Assyria s western borders He is perhaps best known for his zoological collection br br br Biography br His reign marks the point at which the tide turned against the middle Assyrian empire and substantial Levantine territory to the west was captured by the invading Arameans A r b l kala was the last of the monarchs of the second millennium for whom there are any significant surviving inscriptions His annals are recorded on numerous fragments from A ur and Nineveh br br br The Broken Obelisk br The Broken Obelisk an unfinished part of a monumental inscription in the British Museum is usually attributed to him following the arguments made by Weidner Jaritz and Borger despite its apparent imitation of the campaigns of Tukult apil E arra I and his hunting of a n iru a sea horse in the Mediterranean the upper sea of the land of Amurru These arguments include the introduction of Babylonian month names its discovery with a limestone statue of a naked I tar inscribed with his name the designation of the Arameans as living in KUR a re me and their evident progress into traditionally Assyrian ruled lands It was discovered by the ethnic Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam in mid August at a locality about half way between Sennacherib s palace and that of Assurbanipal and depicts the enlarged king towering over bound supplicant prisoners under five symbols of the gods Any reconstruction of the events of his reign consequently depends heavily on whether this object is correctly assigned br In his first year he campaigned in the north against Urar u delaying his adoption of the eponym office until the following year In his second he turned his attention to the countries Himme ab u and Mari the latter of which was under the authority of Tukulti Mer a pretender to the Assyrian throne Thereafter his attention was largely absorbed with endless counterattacks against the hordes of Arameans pressing on his borders whom he even pursued in rafts of inflated goatskins I crossed the Euphrates He fought them as far as Carchemish which he plundered and in the rb r valley the Broken Obelisk referencing at least campaigns Texts recovered from Giricano ancient Dunnu a Uzibi mostly dated to the eponym year of Ili iddina his th or th year include one that recalls the fighting the preceding year the eponymy of A ur rem ni e u in Dunnu a Li ur ala A ur in the district of inamu when territory was lost Sometime later the entire region fell to the invaders br br br Building works and zoo br br Among his civic construction activities were the re excavation of a city moat and the irrigation of a public garden br br I built the palace of cedar box wood terebinth and tamarisk in my city A ur The canal which Ashur dan I king of Assyria excavated the source of that canal had fallen in and for thirty years water had not flowed therein I again excavated the source of that canal directed water therein and planted gardens br The continued prestige of Assyria was acknowledged by the gift of exotic animals by the Egyptians which ni m t u u ebri he displayed the animals to the people of his land These he added to his collection of rare animals which he bred and dispatched merchants to acquire more such as a large female ape and a crocodile and a river man beasts of the Great Sea and the dromedaries he displayed in herds A r b l kala s interests were not solely zoological as he enjoyed hunting and boasts killing wild bulls and cows at the city of Araziqu which is before the land of atti and at the foot of Mount Lebanon br He rebuilt from top to bottom the storehouses of my lordly palace which are at the fore part of the enclosure and A ur n din a s terrace of the New Palace at Nineveh placed gate guardians inspired by the n iru he had supposedly hunted He also repaired a quay wall originally built by Adad n r r I c BC br br br Relations with Babylonia br After his inauguration he was apparently visited by the reigning Babylonian king Marduk pik z ri who established friendly relations with A r b l kala and then returned to Sippar This treaty followed the earlier poor relations of their predecessors Tukult apil E arra and Marduk n din a who had sparred and was probably motivated by their need to unite to fight their common enemy the Arameans Marduk pik z ri died around five years later and this seems to have galvanized A r b l kala into intervening militarily to install a successor of his choice br br In that year the eponym of A ur ra im ni e u in the month of ebat the chariots and went from the Inner City of Assur and conquered the cities of x x indi ulu and sand cities which are in the district of the city of D r Kurigalzu They captured Kada man Buria the son of Itti Marduk bal u governor of their land br The Synchronistic History relates that the next king Adad apla iddina son of Esagil aduni son of a nobody was appointed by A r b l kala who married his daughter and took her with a vast dowry to Assyria while the Eclectic Chronicle gives his father as Itti Marduk bal u The Synchronistic History concludes with noting that the people of Assyria and Babylonia mingled peacefully with one another br His tomb was one of the five found on the lower reaches of the palace at Assur He was briefly succeeded by his son Er ba Adad II whose short reign was followed by that of his brother am i Adad IV br br br Inscriptions br br br br br br Further reading br Albert Kirk Grayson Assyrian
