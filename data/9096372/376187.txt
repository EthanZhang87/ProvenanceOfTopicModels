The National Audubon Society Audubon is an American non profit environmental organization dedicated to conservation of birds and their habitats Located in the United States and incorporated in Audubon is one of the oldest of such organizations in the world There are completely independent Audubon Societies in the United States which were founded several years earlier such as the Massachusetts Audubon Society Indiana Audubon Society and Connecticut Audubon Society The societies are named for th century naturalist John James Audubon br The society has nearly local chapters each of which is an independent c non profit organization voluntarily affiliated with the National Audubon Society They often organize birdwatching field trips and conservation related activities It also coordinates the Christmas Bird Count held each December in the U S a model of citizen science in partnership with Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Great Backyard Bird Count each February Together with Cornell University Audubon created eBird an online database for bird observation The National Audubon Society also has many global partners to help birds that migrate beyond the U S s borders including BirdLife International based in Great Britain Bird Studies Canada American Bird Conservancy and many partners in Latin America and in the Caribbean Audubon s International Alliances Program IAP brings together people throughout the Western Hemisphere to work together to implement conservation solutions at Important Birds Areas IBAs br br br History br br br Development of Audubon societies br In Forest and Stream editor George Bird Grinnell was appalled by the negligent mass slaughter of birds that he saw taking place As a boy Grinnell had avidly read Ornithological Biography a work by the bird painter John James Audubon he also lived in his early years in a development of the former Audubon estate Audubon Park in upper Manhattan and attended a school for boys conducted by Lucy Audubon The Audubon name would become the namesake of the society he founded and after its failure that of local state and a national organization bearing that name br Within a year of Grinnell founding it his early Audubon Society claimed members eventually growing to Each member signed a pledge to not molest birds Prominent members included jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr abolitionist minister Henry Ward Beecher and poet John Greenleaf Whittier In under a decade this society was discontinued but the name and plan survived br Organizations for the protection of birds were not a wholly new idea Even before Grinnell s Audubon Society was organized the American Ornithologists Union founded in was aware of the dangers facing many birds in the United States There were however influential ornithologists who defended the collection of birds In Charles B Cory the president elect of the AOU refused to attend a meeting of the District of Columbia Audubon Society stating that I do not protect birds I kill them br br In a second iteration of the Audubon Society was created with an unbroken history that traces to today Cousins and Boston socialites Harriet Hemenway and Minna B Hall disturbed by the destruction left by plume hunters organized a series of afternoon teas with other wealthy local women encouraging them to avoid feathered garments They also sent literature asking these women to in Hall s words join a society for the protection of birds especially the egret Later that same year they founded the Massachusetts Audubon Society Over women came together with Hemenway and Hall and across the country many others were doing the same These boycotts were largely successful and the efforts of the early society members helped bring about the end of the plume trade and assisted in the introduction of early conservation legislation such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act In Pennsylvania created their Audubon Society and during the next few years bird lovers in many other states followed suit St Louis Audubon Society SLAS was established in as the St Louis Bird Club In the Bird Club became the first local Audubon chapter in the United States The national committee of Audubon societies was organized at a meeting held in Washington D C in saw the organization of the National Association of Audubon Societies for the Protection of Wild Birds and Animals William Dutcher was president and T Gilbert Pearson was secretary and financial agent During this time Albert Willcox provided financial support more than in and At the end of the Association had an interest bearing endowment fund of more than and an income from other sources of approximately br br br Bird protection br br Birds in the United States were threatened by market hunting as well as for the fashion industry Pressure from shooting enthusiasts was intense For example great auks whose habit of crowding together on rocks and beaches made them especially easy to hunt had been driven to extinction early in the century During one week in the spring of nature author Florence Merriam claimed to have seen robins for sale in one market stall in Washington alone By the start of the th century the sale of bird flesh had never been greater The second equally great threat to the bird population was the desire for their plumage In the late s the American Ornithologists Union estimated that five million birds were killed annually for the fashion market In the final quarter of the th century plumes and even whole birds decorated the hair hats and dresses of women Poachers killed game warden Guy Bradley on July poachers killed Game Warden Columbus G McLeod in November in Florida and Audubon Society employee Pressly Reeves of South Carolina also in br Public opinion soon turned on the fashion industry Bolstered by the support of Boston socialite Harriet Hemenway President of the United States and avowed Audubon Society sympathizer Theodore Roosevelt and a widespread letter writing campaign driven by church associations many of whom distributed the Audubon message in their various newsletters the plume trade was halted by such laws as the New York State Audubon Plumage Law May which banned the sales of plumes of all native birds in the state By similar laws were enacted in about other states Audubon Society activities are responsible for many laws for the establishment of game commissions and game warden forces or prohibiting the sale of game br br br Refuges br br In the NAS actively lobbied for the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act In the s the organization also played a vital role in convincing the U S government to protect vital wildlife areas by including them in a National Wildlife Refuge system br The association also acquired land through purchases and donation The Theodore Roosevelt Sanctuary and Audubon Center in Oyster Bay New York was donated to New York Audubon in by Emlen Roosevelt and Christine Roosevelt in memory of their cousin who is buried in the adjacent Youngs Memorial Cemetery The Audubon Center of Greenwich Connecticut was founded in The Paul J Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary in Louisiana was acquired in and at acres km it is still the largest br In the late th century the organization began to place a new emphasis on the development of Centers in urban locations including Brooklyn New York East Los Angeles California Phoenix Arizona and Seattle Washington br br br Field guides br In with membership at a low of and with the nation in the Great Depression John H Baker became the NAS president He was a World War I aviator and ardent bird lover and also a businessman and he set about to invigorate the society and bolster its budget prosperity through publication Baker began publishing book length field guides on major forms of bird and mammal life Soon in association with New York publisher Alfred A Knopf the Audubon Field Guides became a staple of every artist s and environmentalist s library Today many Audubon field guides have been adapted for mobile phone apps This field guide series covers a wide range of nature related topics including the night sky rocks and minerals wildflowers and many animals This series has sold million copies and uses photographs instead of the commissioned paintings or other drawings that many other field guides possess such as the Peterson Field Guides br br br DDT whaling and politics br During the post World War II period the NAS was consumed by the battle over the pesticide DDT As early as the society circulated draft legislation to establish pesticide control agencies at the state level In the publication of Silent Spring by long time Audubon member Rachel Carson gave the campaign against persistent pesticides a huge national forum Following her death in the NAS established a fund devoted strictly to the various legal fights in the war against DDT br Today Audubon selects outstanding women in conservation to receive its prestigious Rachel Carson Award Honorees include Bette Midler singer actress and founder of the New York Restoration Project Dr Sylvia Earle oceanographer and founder of Deep Search International Majora Carter Founder and Executive Director of Sustainable South Bronx actress and conservation activist Sigourney Weaver and NRDC President Frances Beinecke br Through the s and s the society began to use its influence to focus attention on a wider range of environmental issues and became involved in developing major new environmental protection policies and laws Audubon staff and members helped legislators pass the Clean Air Clean Water Wild and Scenic Rivers and Endangered Species acts In the society opened an office in Washington D C in an effort to keep legislators informed of Audubon s priorities br By the s NAS had also extended to global interests One area that NAS became actively involved with was whaling Between and alone the poorly regulated whaling industry had succeeded in harvesting whales But by following the th annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Bournemouth England which was attended by officials from the National Audubon Society and other U S based environmental organizations a worldwide moratorium on whaling was declared So successful has this moratorium been in restoring populations of many whales that non consumptive uses of whales may once again be permitted in some areas br br br Television specials br During the s and s the National Audubon Society produced a notable series of nature documentary television specials many of which were entitled The World of Audubon These included specials on many animals other than birds the traditional focus of this organization and on natural areas such as the Great Lakes This series included a special documenting the rescue efforts to save the black footed ferret from extinction Arthur Unger of the Christian Science Monitor reviewed this special very favorably and wrote that this special was further proof that the Audubon series deserves a place in television s splendid wildlife triumvirate alongside Nature and National Geographic Specials br br br Audubon Medal br The Audubon Medal

br Current activities br br In Audubon created a new model for positioning energy transmission lines along the East Coast to help preserve bird and wildlife habitat Audubon President David Yarnold has made environmentally friendly siting for renewable energy one of the organization s highest priorities br Audubon played an important part in bird rescue and Gulf Coast wetlands recovery efforts in the aftermath of the April BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry Audubon recruited over volunteers to assist in rescuing cleaning and releasing injured brown pelicans and other water birds In addition Audubon was a leader in pushing for legislation to use BP oil spill penalties to rebuild the Gulf Coast br Audubon s Mississippi River and Louisiana Coastal Initiatives have been helping to restore coastal wetlands and to rebuild Mississippi River delta marshlands The Mississippi Delta loses an area the size of Manhattan to the sea every year stripping away coastal protections for both human communities and wildlife habitat br Audubon s Important Bird Area program has been protecting million acres along migratory bird flyways in the United States and is a key part of Audubon s work with BirdLife International and other conservationists around the globe Audubon is leading the campaign for U S Congressional Reauthorization of the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act which would generate as much as million each year to advance hemispheric bird conservation br In Wyoming and across the Intermountain west Audubon s Sagebrush Initiative works with industry government ranchers and conservationists to protect million acres of greater sage grouse Core habitat It also helps promote the development of renewable energy projects in the area br Audubon also helped to secure the preservation of acres of wild lands at the Tejon Ranch the largest land conservation area created in California history br In March the Arkansas chapter of the Audubon Society announced its plan to spend to install solar panels on its grounds which will make their Little Rock office the state s first nonprofit to utilize solar energy br br br Sanctuaries and nature centers br Nature centers and wildlife sanctuaries continue to be an important part of Audubon s work to educate and inspire the public about the environment and how to conserve it Some of the Audubon s earliest nature centers are still teaching young and old alike about the natural world In Audubon s Hog Island Camp in Maine marked its th anniversary Audubon s national network currently includes nearly local chapters state programs nature centers After nearly three quarters of a century the National Wildlife Refuge Campaign also remains a key component of overall NAS policy br br br Conservation ranching initiative br Audubon has begun to certify bird friendly ranching facilities such as the Blue Nest Beef enterprise in order to provide consumers with a method of determining the environmental credentials of the businesses advertising that they are providing bird friendly grass fed and similar products as options for beef that is raised sustainably and benefits wildlife habitat br br br Native plants database br An online database is provided by Audubon that displays which native plants are important for birds in different areas that is searchable by USA zip code br br br Invasive species br Audubon has recently expanded its outreach about the detrimental impact of invasive species like Norway maples Tatarian honeysuckle and other ecological threats to human health and wildlife br br br Drilling for natural gas br The Audubon society opposes drilling for gas on national reserves Natural gas has been drilled for and produced at its Paul J Rainey Wildlife Sanctuary The society said it was legally compelled to allow gas and oil drilling at the sanctuary under the terms of the land s donation by its original owners This explanation however has been challenged The presence of oil and gas drilling on Audubon s sanctuaries has been used to illustrate the difference between private and public decision making br An August an open letter was sent to the U S Senate Environment and Public Works Committee calling for stronger climate protections including an end to subsidies for drilling companies This signatories of this letter included the Central New Mexico Audubon Society Champaign County Audubon Society Delaware Audubon Society Elisha Mitchell Audubon Society Huachuca Audubon Society Kalmiopsis Audubon Society San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society Sequoia Audubon Society and Audubon South Carolina br br br Dan W Lufkin Prize for Environmental Leadership br The Dan W Lufkin Prize for Environmental Leadership is a new award that recognizes Dan W Lufkin s lifetime commitment to the environment and honors individuals who have dedicated their lives to on the ground conservation As part of this award the recipient receives a cash prize made through an endowment established by Dan s family and friends to help further his or her conservation efforts This award will become a signature prize in the field of conservation innovation George Archibald was the inaugural Dan W Lufkin Prize recipient for his tireless efforts to protect all species of cranes and their habitats throughout the world The Wall Street Journal featured Dan W Lufkin as the Donor of the Day for the creation of this new Audubon prize br br br Women in Conservation Program br The Rachel Carson Award is part of a broader Audubon initiative called Women in Conservation Project Their mission statement is To recognize outstanding women leaders in today s conservation movement to support environmental opportunities for girls and young women and to educate women on important issues related to conservation and the environment Audubon New York created the Rachel Carson Field Internship in which is given to young women seeking experience in the fields of habitat stewardship and wildlife management There is also the Women in Conservation Fellowship These internships are given to women who wish to learn about areas such as public relations management and event planning br br br Climate change report br In September the Audubon Society released its Audubon Birds and Climate Change report which found that expected changes to North American climate will have a major detrimental impact on birds in the United States The scope of the report includes species of birds and found that of those species could lose up to half of their climatic range during the st century br br br Namesake controversy br The society was named in honor of John James Audubon a Franco American ornithologist and naturalist who painted cataloged and described the birds of North America in his famous Birds of America book Despite these accolades John James Audubon s legacy has been tarnished by numerous accusations of plagiarism and scientific fraud which his biographers and Audubon s leadership have routinely dismissed or minimized even while admitting to his history of racism and slavery John James Audubon was also a body snatcher who collected human skulls to assist the scientific racism work of Samuel G Morton In the wake of the protests following the murder of George Floyd there have been public appeals to strip the name Audubon from the society and change the names of species that honor him The Audubon Society has publicly supported the removal of Confederate monuments including acknowledging that it s not just an issue of physical monuments br An internal Board of Directors vote in resulted in a decision to retain the Audubon name for the national organization with the subsequent resignation of three of its board members In February the union representing Audubon employees renamed itself The Bird Union Seven months earlier in July the Seattle chapter of Audubon announced they would change the name and later announced the new name would be Birds Connect Seattle effective June Shortly after the Seattle chapter s announcement in February the Chicago chapter also announced they will change their name In March the New York City chapter announced that after studying the issue for eight months it will change its name Jessica Wilson executive director of the NYC chapter stated that the current name served as a barrier to getting all New Yorkers involved Chapters in other cities such as Washington D C Portland Oregon and Buffalo New York have made similar announcements br br br Leadership br David Yarnold became Audubon s th president in September expressing a commitment to build on the organization s strong conservation legacy and expand its commitment to improving the quality of life for both birds and people by aligning Audubon s conservation work along the migratory flyways that millions of birds travel each spring and fall Following layoffs and complaints about diversity and inclusion programs an Audubon union organizing drive went public in March with about workers Yarnold stepped down the next month following an internal audit into Audubon s workplace culture and toxic workplace complaints Elizabeth Gray was named Audubon s CEO in November br br br Audubon magazine br br The National Audubon Society publishes
