id: 43989914
Windows is a major release of Microsoft s Windows NT operating system It is the direct successor to Windows which was released nearly two years earlier It was released to manufacturing on July and later to retail on July Windows was made available for download via MSDN and TechNet as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows and Windows users via the Microsoft Store and to Windows users via Windows Update Windows receives new builds on an ongoing basis which are available at no additional cost to users in addition to additional test builds of Windows which are available to Windows Insiders Devices in enterprise environments can receive these updates at a slower pace or use long term support milestones that only receive critical updates such as security patches over their ten year lifespan of extended support In June Microsoft announced that support for Windows editions which are not in the Long Term Servicing Channel LTSC will end on October br Windows received generally positive reviews upon its original release Critics praised Microsoft s decision to provide the desktop oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows contrasting the tablet oriented approach of Windows although Windows s touch oriented user interface mode was criticized for containing regressions upon the touch oriented interface of its predecessor Critics also praised the improvements to Windows s bundled software over Windows Xbox Live integration as well as the functionality and capabilities of the Cortana personal assistant and the replacement of Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge However media outlets have been critical of the changes to operating system behaviors including mandatory update installation privacy concerns over data collection performed by the OS for Microsoft and its partners and adware like tactics used to promote the operating system on its release br Microsoft initially aimed to have Windows installed on over one billion devices within three years of its release that goal was ultimately reached almost five years after release on March and Windows is now the most used version in virtually all countries By January Windows had surpassed Windows as the most popular version of Windows worldwide Its market share peaked at in December shortly after the introductions of its successor as of it is estimated to have a share of Windows PCs still times its successor Windows s share of and times Windows s share The share has been declining from a January peak of since Windows s release which is now the second most popular Windows version in many countries Windows has an estimated share of all traditional PCs the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems such as macOS and Linux and an estimated share of all devices including mobile tablet and console are running Windows On June Microsoft announced Windows s successor Windows which was released on October br It is the last version of Microsoft Windows that supports bit processors IA and ARMv based br br br Development br At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in Andrew Lees the chief of Microsoft s mobile technologies said that the company intended to have a single software ecosystem for PCs smartphones tablets and other devices We won t have an ecosystem for PCs and one for phones and one for tablets they ll all come together br In December technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft was working on an update to Windows codenamed Threshold after a planet in its Halo franchise Similarly to Blue which became Windows Foley described Threshold not as a single operating system but as a wave of operating systems across multiple Microsoft platforms and services quoting Microsoft sources scheduled for the second quarter of She also stated that one of the goals for Threshold was to create a unified application platform and development toolkit for Windows Windows Phone and Xbox One which all use a similar kernel based on Windows NT br At the Build Conference in April Microsoft s Terry Myerson unveiled an updated version of Windows build that added the ability to run Microsoft Store apps inside desktop windows and a more traditional Start menu in place of the Start screen seen in Windows The new Start menu takes after Windows s design by using only a portion of the screen and including an application listing in the left column The right column displays Windows style app tiles Myerson said that these changes would occur in a future update but did not elaborate Microsoft also unveiled the concept of a universal Windows app allowing Windows Store apps created for Windows to be ported to Windows Phone and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase with an interface designed for different device form factors and allowing user data and licenses for an app to be shared between multiple platforms Windows Phone would share nearly of the common Windows Runtime APIs with Windows on PCs br Screenshots of a Windows build purported to be Threshold were leaked in July showing the previously presented Start menu and windowed Windows Store apps followed by a further screenshot of a build identifying itself as Windows Technical Preview numbered in September showing a new virtual desktop system a notification center and a new File Explorer icon br br br Announcement br br On September Microsoft officially announced that Threshold would be unveiled during a media event as Windows Myerson said that Windows would be Microsoft s most comprehensive platform ever providing a single unified platform for desktop and laptop computers tablets smartphones and all in one devices He emphasized that Windows would take steps towards restoring user interface mechanics from Windows to improve the experience for users on non touch devices noting criticism of Windows s touch oriented interface by keyboard and mouse users Despite these concessions Myerson noted that the touch optimized interface would evolve as well on Windows br In regards to Microsoft naming the new operating system Windows instead of Windows Terry Myerson said that based on the product that s coming and just how different our approach will be overall it wouldn t be right to call it Windows He also joked that they could not call it Windows One referring to several recent Microsoft products with a similar brand such as OneDrive OneNote and the Xbox One because Windows already existed At a San Francisco conference in October Tony Prophet Microsoft s Vice President of Windows Marketing said that Windows came and went and that Windows would not be an incremental step from Windows but a material step We re trying to create one platform one eco system that unites as many of the devices from the small embedded Internet of Things through tablets through phones through PCs and ultimately into the Xbox br Further details surrounding Windows s consumer oriented features were presented during another media event held on January titled Windows The Next Chapter The keynote featured the unveiling of Cortana integration within the operating system new Xbox oriented features Windows Mobile an updated Office Mobile suite Surface Hub a large screened Windows device for enterprise collaboration based upon Perceptive Pixel technology along with HoloLens augmented reality eyewear and an associated platform for building apps that can render holograms through HoloLens br Additional developer oriented details surrounding the Universal Windows Platform concept were revealed and discussed during Microsoft s Build developers conference Among them were the unveiling of Islandwood which provides a middleware toolchain for compiling Objective C based software particularly iOS to run as universal apps on Windows and Windows Mobile A port of Candy Crush Saga made using the toolkit which shared much of its code with the iOS version was demonstrated alongside the announcement that the King developed game would be bundled with Windows at launch br At the Ignite conference Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated that Windows would be the last version of Windows a statement reflecting the company s intent to apply the software as a service business model to Windows with new versions and updates to be released over an indefinite period In however Microsoft announced that Windows would be succeeded on compatible hardware by Windows and that Windows support will end on October marking a departure from what had been dubbed Windows as a service br br br Marketing br On July Microsoft began Upgrade Your World an advertising campaign centering on Windows with the premiere of television commercials in Australia Canada France Germany Japan the United Kingdom and the United States The commercials focused on the tagline A more human way to do emphasizing new features and technologies supported by Windows that sought to provide a more personal experience to users The campaign culminated with launch events in thirteen cities on July which celebrated the unprecedented role our biggest fans played in the development of Windows br br br Release br On July Microsoft officially announced that Windows would be released for retail purchase as a free upgrade from earlier versions of Windows In comparison to previous Windows releases which had a longer turnover between the release to manufacturing RTM and general release to allow for testing by vendors and in some cases the development of upgrade kits to prepare systems for installation of the new version an HP executive explained that because it knew Microsoft targeted the operating system for a release the company was able to optimize its then current and upcoming products for Windows in advance of its release negating the need for such a milestone br The general availability build of Windows numbered was first released to Windows Insider channels for pre launch testing on July prior to its formal release Although a Microsoft official said there would be no specific RTM build of Windows was described as an RTM build by media outlets because it was released to all Windows Insider members at once rather than to users on the Fast ring first it no longer carried pre release branding and desktop watermark text and its build number had mathematical connections to the number in reference to the operating system s naming The Enterprise edition was released to volume licensing on August br Windows is distributed digitally through the Media Creation Tool which is functionally identical to the Windows online installer and can also be used to generate an ISO image or USB install media In place upgrades are supported from most editions of Windows with Service Pack and Windows with Update while users with Windows must first upgrade to Windows Changing between architectures e g upgrading from bit edition to a bit editions via in place upgrades is not supported a clean installation is required In place upgrades may be rolled back to the device s previous version of Windows provided that days have not passed since installation and backup files were not removed using Disk Cleanup br Windows was available in countries and languages upon its launch and as part of efforts to re engage with users in China Microsoft also announced that it would partner with Qihoo and Tencent to help promote and distribute Windows in China and that Chinese PC maker Lenovo would provide assistance at its service centers and retail outlets for helping users upgrade to Windows At retail Windows is priced similarly to editions of Windows with U S prices set at and for Windows Home and Pro respectively A Windows Pro Pack license allows upgrades from Windows Home to Windows Pro Retail copies only ship on USB flash drive media however system builder copies still ship as DVD ROM media New devices shipping with Windows were also released during the operating system s launch window br Windows RT devices cannot be upgraded to Windows br br br Free upgrade offer br br During its first year of availability upgrade licenses for Windows could be obtained at no charge for devices with a genuine license for an eligible edition of Windows or br This offer did not apply to Enterprise editions as customers under an active Software Assurance SA contract with upgrade rights are entitled to obtain Windows Enterprise under their existing terms All users running non genuine copies of Windows and those without an existing Windows or license were ineligible for this promotion although upgrades from a non genuine version were possible they result in a non genuine copy of br On the general availability build of Windows the original release to activate and generate the digital entitlement for Windows the operating system must have first been installed as an in place upgrade During the free upgrade a genuineticket xml file is created in the background and the system s motherboard details are registered with a Microsoft Product Activation server Once installed the operating system can be reinstalled on that particular system via normal means without a product key and the system s license will automatically be detected via online activation in essence the Microsoft Product Activation Server will remember the system s motherboard and give it the green light for product re activation Because of installation issues with Upgrade Only installs the November Update version included additional activation mechanisms This build treated Windows and Windows product keys as Windows product keys meaning they could be entered during installation to activate the free license without the need to upgrade first to activate the hardware with Microsoft s activation servers For major Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs Windows and Windows OEM product keys are embedded in the firmware of the motherboard and if the correct edition of Windows is present on the installation media they are automatically inputted during installation Since the release of the Fall Creators Update version Microsoft decided to release multi edition installation media to alleviate installation and product activation issues users experienced because of accidentally installing the wrong edition of Windows br The Windows Insider Preview version of Windows automatically updated itself to the generally released version as part of the version progression and continues to be updated to new beta builds as it had throughout the testing process Microsoft explicitly stated that Windows Insider was not a valid upgrade path for those running a version of Windows that is ineligible for the upgrade offer although if it was not installed with a license carried over from an in place upgrade to Insider Preview from Windows or the Insider Preview does remain activated as long as the user does not exit the Windows Insider program br The offer was promoted and delivered via the Get Windows application also known as GWX which was automatically installed via Windows Update ahead of Windows s release and activated on systems deemed eligible for the upgrade offer Via a notification area icon users could access an application that advertised Windows and the free upgrade offer check device compatibility and reserve an automatic download of the operating system upon its release On July a pre download process began in which Windows installation files were downloaded to some computers that had reserved it Microsoft said that those who reserved Windows would be able to install it through GWX in a phased rollout process The operating system could alternatively be downloaded at any time using a separate Media Creation Tool setup program that allows for the creation of DVD or USB installation media br In May Microsoft announced that the free upgrade offer would be extended to users of assistive technologies however Microsoft did not implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer which some outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a free Windows upgrade Microsoft said that the offer is not intended to be used in this manner In November Microsoft announced that this program would end on December br However another method was found that allowed Windows and users to upgrade to Windows using existing licenses even though the free upgrade offers officially ended in Some outlets have continued to promote it as a free method of upgrading from the now unsupported Windows This free upgrade method was officially closed by Microsoft on September However as of there are some reports that it still works under certain conditions br br br Licensing br During upgrades Windows licenses are not tied directly to a product key Instead the license status of the system s current installation of Windows is migrated and a Digital license known as Digital entitlement in version or earlier is generated during the activation process which is bound to the hardware information collected during the process If Windows is reinstalled cleanly and there have not been any significant hardware changes since installation such as a motherboard change the online activation process will automatically recognize the system s digital entitlement if no product key is entered during installations However unique product keys are still distributed within retail copies of Windows As with previous non volume licensed variants of Windows significant hardware changes will invalidate the digital entitlement and require Windows to be re activated br br br Features br br Windows makes its user experience and functionality more consistent between different classes of device and addresses many shortcomings of the user interface introduced in Windows Windows Mobile the successor to Windows Phone shared some user interface elements and apps with its PC counterpart br Windows supports universal apps an expansion of the Metro style first introduced in Windows Universal apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code including PCs tablets smartphones embedded systems Xbox One Surface Hub and Mixed Reality The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse oriented interface and a touchscreen optimized interface based on available input devices particularly on in PCs Both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates elements of Windows s traditional Start menu with the tiles of Windows Windows also introduced the Microsoft Edge web browser a virtual desktop system a window and desktop management feature called Task View support for fingerprint and face recognition login new security features for enterprise environments and DirectX br The Windows Runtime app ecosystem was revised into the Universal Windows Platform UWP These universal apps are made to run across multiple platforms and device classes including smartphones tablets Xbox One consoles and other devices compatible with Windows Windows apps share code across platforms have responsive designs that adapt to the needs of the device and available inputs can synchronize data between Windows devices including notifications credentials and allowing cross platform multiplayer for games and are distributed through the Microsoft Store rebranded from Windows Store since September Developers can allow cross buys where purchased licenses for an app apply to all of the user s compatible devices rather than only the one they purchased on e g a user purchasing an app on PC is also entitled to use the smartphone version at no extra cost br The ARM version of Windows allows running applications for x processors through bit software emulation br On Windows the Microsoft Store serves as a unified storefront for apps video content and eBooks Windows also allows web apps and desktop software using either Win or NET Framework to be packaged for distribution on the Microsoft Store Desktop software distributed through Windows Store is packaged using the App V system to allow sandboxing br br br User interface and desktop br br A new iteration of the Start menu is used on the Windows desktop with a list of places and other options on the left side and tiles representing applications on the right The menu can be resized and expanded into a full screen display which is the default option in Tablet mode A new virtual desktop system was added by a feature known as Task View which displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them or switch between multiple workspaces Universal apps which previously could be used only in full screen mode can now be used in self contained windows similarly to other programs Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner When a window is snapped to one side of the screen Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen called Snap Assist The Windows system icons were also changed br Charms have been removed their functionality in universal apps is accessed from an App commands menu on their title bar In its place is Action Center which displays notifications and settings toggles It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area or dragging from the right of the screen Notifications can be synced between multiple devices The Settings app formerly PC Settings was refreshed and now includes more options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel br Windows is designed to adapt its user interface based on the type of device being used and available input methods It offers two separate user interface modes a user interface optimized for mouse and keyboard and a Tablet mode designed for touchscreens Users can toggle between these two modes at any time and Windows can prompt or automatically switch when certain events occur such as disabling Tablet mode on a tablet if a keyboard or mouse is plugged in or when a in PC is switched to its laptop state In Tablet mode programs default to a maximized view and the taskbar contains a back button and hides buttons for opened or pinned programs by default Task View is used instead to switch between programs The full screen Start menu is used in this mode similarly to Windows but scrolls vertically instead of horizontally br br br System security br br Windows incorporates multi factor authentication technology based upon standards developed by the FIDO Alliance The operating system includes improved support for biometric authentication through the Windows Hello platform Devices with supported cameras requiring infrared illumination such as Intel RealSense allow users to log in with iris or face recognition similarly to Kinect Devices with supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint recognition Support was also added for palm vein scanning through a partnership with Fujitsu in February Credentials are stored locally and protected using asymmetric encryption br In researchers demonstrated that Windows Hello could be bypassed on fully updated Windows version with a color printout of a person s picture taken with an IR camera In researchers were again able to bypass the Windows Hello functionalities by using custom hardware disguised as a camera which presented an IR photo of the owner s face br In addition to biometric authentication Windows Hello supports authentication with a PIN By default Windows requires a PIN to consist of four digits but can be configured to permit more complex PINs However a PIN is not a simpler password While passwords are transmitted to domain controllers PINs are not They are tied to one device and if compromised only one device is affected Backed by a Trusted Platform Module TPM chip Windows uses PINs to create strong asymmetric key pairs As such the authentication token transmitted to the server is harder to crack In addition whereas weak passwords may be broken via rainbow tables TPM causes the much simpler Windows PINs to be resilient to brute force attacks br When Windows was first introduced multi factor authentication was provided by two components Windows Hello and Passport not to be confused with the Passport platform of Later Passport was merged into Windows Hello br The enterprise edition of Windows offers additional security features administrators can set up policies for the automatic encryption of sensitive data selectively block applications from accessing encrypted data and enable Device Guard a system which allows administrators to enforce a high security environment by blocking the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted vendor or Microsoft Device Guard is designed to protect against zero day exploits and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation remains separated from the operating system itself br br br Command line br The console windows based on Windows Console for any console app not just PowerShell and Windows Command Prompt can now be resized without any restrictions can be made to cover the full screen by pressing Alt Enter and can use standard keyboard shortcuts such as those for cut copy and paste Other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added These functions can be disabled to revert to the legacy console if needed br br The Anniversary Update added Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL which allows the installation of a user space environment from a supported Linux distribution that runs natively on Windows The subsystem translates Linux system calls to those of the Windows NT kernel only claims full system call compatibility as of WSL included in a later Windows update The environment can execute the Bash shell and bit command line programs WSL also supports bit Linux programs and graphics assuming supporting software installed and GPUs support for other uses Windows applications cannot be executed from the Linux environment and vice versa Linux distributions for Windows Subsystem for Linux are obtained through Microsoft Store The feature initially supported an Ubuntu based environment Microsoft announced in May that it would add Fedora and OpenSUSE environment options as well br br br Storage requirements br To reduce the storage footprint of the operating system Windows automatically compresses system files The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately GB for bit systems and GB for bit systems The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance Furthermore the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead making a separate recovery partition redundant allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation and further reducing the amount of space required for Windows by up to GB These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows Update which allowed OEMs to configure low capacity devices with flash based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery Windows also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device s storage capacity is being used by different types of files and determine whether certain types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default br br br Online services and functionality br Windows introduces Microsoft Edge a new default web browser It initially featured a new standards compliant rendering engine derived from Trident and also includes annotation tools and integration with other Microsoft platforms present within Windows Internet Explorer is maintained on Windows for compatibility purposes but is deprecated in favor of Edge and since mid June is no longer supported on editions which follow Microsoft s Modern Lifecycle Policy The initial version of Edge was later succeeded by a new iteration derived from the Chromium Project and Blink layout engine which replaced the previous EdgeHTML based version of Edge renamed Microsoft Edge Legacy and is bundled with the OS by default from build H onwards br Windows incorporates a universal search box located alongside the Start and Task View buttons which can be hidden or condensed into a single button Previous versions featured Microsoft s intelligent personal assistant Cortana which was first introduced with Windows Phone in and supports both text and voice input Many of its features are a direct carryover from Windows Phone including integration with Bing setting reminders a Notebook feature for managing personal information as well as searching for files playing music launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails Since the November update Microsoft has begun to downplay Cortana as part of a repositioning of the product towards enterprise use with the May update removing its Windows shell integration and consumer oriented features br Microsoft Family Safety is replaced by Microsoft Family a parental controls system that applies across Windows platforms and Microsoft online services Users can create a designated family and monitor and restrict the actions of users designated as children such as access to websites enforcing age ratings on Microsoft Store purchases and other restrictions The service can also send weekly e mail reports to parents detailing a child s computer usage Unlike previous versions of Windows child accounts in a family must be associated with a Microsoft account which allows these settings to apply across all Windows devices that a particular child is using br Windows also offers the Wi Fi Sense feature originating from Windows Phone users can optionally have their device automatically connect to suggested open hotspots and share their home network s password with contacts either via Skype People or Facebook so they may automatically connect to the network on a Windows device without needing to manually enter its password Credentials are stored in an encrypted form on Microsoft servers and sent to the devices of the selected contacts Passwords are not viewable by the guest user and the guest user is not allowed to access other computers or devices on the network Wi Fi Sense is not usable on X encrypted networks Adding optout at the end of the SSID will also block the corresponding network from being used for this feature br Universal calling and messaging apps for Windows are built in as of the November update Messaging Skype Video and Phone These offer built in alternatives to the Skype download and sync with Windows Mobile br br br Multimedia and gaming br br Windows provides greater integration with the Xbox ecosystem Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox Console Companion formerly the Xbox app which allows users to browse their game library including both PC and Xbox console games and Game DVR is also available using a keyboard shortcut allowing users to save the last seconds of gameplay as a video that can be shared to Xbox Live OneDrive or elsewhere Windows also allows users to control and play games from an Xbox One console over a local network The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps and future wireless Xbox One accessories such as controllers are supported on Windows with an adapter Microsoft also intends to allow cross purchases and save synchronization between Xbox One and Windows versions of games Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as being exclusive to Windows and Xbox One br Candy Crush Saga and Microsoft Solitaire Collection are also automatically installed upon installation of Windows br Windows adds native game recording and screenshot capture ability using the newly introduced Game Bar Users can also have the OS continuously record gameplay in the background which then allows the user to save the last few moments of gameplay to the storage device br Windows adds FLAC and HEVC codecs and support for the Matroska media container allowing these formats to be opened in Windows Media Player and other applications Windows Media Center is no longer bundled br Windows includes DirectX alongside WDDM Unveiled March at GDC DirectX aims to provide console level efficiency with closer to the metal access to hardware resources and reduced CPU and graphics driver overhead Most of the performance improvements are achieved through low level programming which allow developers to use resources more efficiently and reduce single threaded CPU bottlenecking caused by abstraction through higher level APIs DirectX will also feature support for vendor agnostic multi GPU setups WDDM introduces a new virtual memory management and allocation system to reduce workload on the kernel mode driver br br br Font support br br Windows adds three new default typefaces compared to Windows but omits several others The removed typefaces are available in supplemental packs and may be added manually over a non metered internet connection br br br Editions and pricing br br Windows is available in five main editions for personal computing devices the Home and Pro editions of which are sold at retail in most countries and as pre loaded software on new computers Home is aimed at home users while Pro is aimed at power users and small businesses Each edition of Windows includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it and adds additional features oriented towards its market segments for example Pro adds additional networking and security features such as BitLocker Device Guard Windows Update for Business and the ability to join a domain Enterprise and Education the other editions contain additional features aimed towards business environments and are only available through volume licensing br As part of Microsoft s unification strategies Windows products that are based on Windows s common platform but meant for specialized platforms are marketed as editions of the operating system rather than as separate product lines An updated version of Microsoft s Windows Phone operating system for smartphones and also tablets was branded as Windows Mobile Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for embedded systems along with Windows IoT Core which is designed specifically for use in small footprint low cost devices and Internet of Things IoT scenarios and is similar in scope to Windows Embedded Compact br On May Microsoft unveiled Windows S referred to in leaks as Windows Cloud a feature limited edition of Windows which was designed primarily for devices in the education market competing in particular with ChromeOS netbooks such as the Surface Laptop that Microsoft also unveiled at this time The OS restricts software installation to applications obtained from Microsoft Store the device may be upgraded to Windows Pro for a fee to enable unrestricted software installation As a time limited promotion Microsoft stated that this upgrade would be free on the Surface Laptop until March Windows S also contains a faster initial setup and login process and allows devices to be provisioned using a USB drive with the Windows Intune for Education platform In March Microsoft announced that Windows S would be deprecated because of market confusion and would be replaced by S Mode an OEM option wherein Windows defaults to only allowing applications to be installed from Microsoft Store but does not require payment in order to disable these restrictions br br br Support lifecycle br br Windows was originally released following Microsoft s fixed lifecycle policy receiving mainstream support for five years after its original release followed by five years of extended support However starting in February this was switched to the modern lifecycle policy excluding LTSC with each build receiving or only for H versions months of support after release depending on edition Furthermore Home edition does not support the deferral of feature updates and will thus often receive a new version of Windows prior to the end of the month support period br Microsoft s support lifecycle policy for the operating system notes that updates are cumulative with each update built upon all of the updates that preceded it that a device needs to install the latest update to remain supported and that a device s ability to receive future updates will depend on hardware compatibility driver availability and whether the device is within the OEM s support period a new aspect not accounted for in lifecycle policies for previous versions This policy was first invoked in to block Intel Clover Trail devices from receiving the Creators Update as Microsoft asserts that future updates require additional hardware support to provide the best possible experience and that Intel no longer provided support or drivers for the platform Microsoft stated that these devices would no longer receive feature updates but would still receive security updates through January br Microsoft will continue to support at least one standard Windows release until October On April Microsoft announced that version H would be the last of Windows meaning this version will extend beyond the normal months of support br br br Extended Security Updates br Microsoft announced an Extended Security Update ESU service in December for Windows devices lasting until October on an annual pricing plan Unlike previous Windows ESU services Windows ESU will be available to individual consumers as well br Regarding pricing annual pricing doubles each year For businesses per device the pricing will be for the first year for the second and for the third Businesses using a cloud based update management solution such as Microsoft Intune will get a discount For education users per device pricing is for the first year then and for each subsequent year Consumer pricing has yet to be announced br br br Support and update branches br The following table collects current status of the aforementioned updating and support of different branches of Windows br br br Updates and support br br Unlike previous versions of Windows Windows Update does not allow the selective installation of updates and all updates including patches feature updates and driver software are downloaded and installed automatically Users can only choose whether their system will reboot automatically to install updates when the system is inactive or be notified to schedule a reboot If a wireless network is designated as Metered a function which automatically reduces the operating system s background network activity to conserve limits on Internet usage most updates are not downloaded until the device is connected to a non metered network Version allows wired Ethernet networks to be designated as metered but Windows may still download certain updates while connected to a metered network br In version by installing the August security update and later versions driver and non security updates pushed via Windows Update that are considered optional are no longer automatically downloaded and installed in their devices Users can access them on Settings Update Security Windows Update View optional update br Updates can cause compatibility or other problems a Microsoft troubleshooter program allows bad updates to be uninstalled br Under the Windows end user license agreement users consent to the automatic installation of all updates features and drivers provided by the service and implicitly consent without any additional notice to the possibility of features being modified or removed The agreement also states specifically for users of Windows in Canada that they may pause updates by disconnecting their device from the Internet br Windows Update can also use a peer to peer system for distributing updates by default users bandwidth is used to distribute previously downloaded updates to other users in combination with Microsoft servers Users can instead choose to only use peer to peer updates within their local area network br br br Preview releases br br A public beta program for Windows known as the Windows Insider Program began with the first publicly available preview release on October Insider preview builds are aimed towards enthusiasts and enterprise users for the testing and evaluation of updates and new features Users of the Windows Insider program receive occasional updates to newer preview builds of the operating system and continue to be able to evaluate preview releases after general availability GA in July this is in contrast to previous Windows beta programs where public preview builds were released less frequently and only during the months preceding GA Windows Insider builds continue to be released post release to manufacturing RTM of Windows br br br Versions br br br Feature updates br Windows is often described by Microsoft as being a service as it receives regular feature updates that contain new features and other updates and fixes In April Microsoft stated that these updates would be released twice a year every March and September in the future which eventually continued until version H Mainstream builds of Windows up to were labeled YYMM with YY representing the two digit year and MM representing the month of release For example version was released in September the ninth month of This was changed with the H release where MM represents the half of the year in which the update was released for example H for the first half and H for the second half br Before version the pace at which feature updates are received by devices was dependent on which release channel was used The default branch for all users of Windows Home and Pro was Semi Annual Channel Targeted formerly Current Branch or CB which received stable builds after they were publicly released by Microsoft Each build of Windows is supported for either or only for H versions months after its original release dependent on edition In enterprise environments Microsoft officially intended that this branch was used for targeted deployments of newly released stable versions so that they could be evaluated and tested on a limited number of devices before a wider deployment Once a stable build is certified by Microsoft and its partners as being suitable for broad deployment the build is then released on the Semi Annual Channel formerly Current Branch for Business or CBB which is supported by the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows Semi Annual Channel receives stable builds on a four month delay from their release on the Targeted channel Administrators can also use the Windows Update for Business system as well as existing tools such as WSUS and System Center Configuration Manager to organize structured deployments of feature updates across their networks br The Windows Insider branches receive unstable builds as they are released it is divided into two channels Dev which receives new builds immediately after their release and Beta whose releases are slightly delayed from their Dev release br Enterprise licensees may use the Windows Enterprise LTSC formerly LTSB edition where LTSC stands for Long Term Servicing Channel which only receive quality of life updates i e security patches and has a full or year support lifecycle for each build This edition is designed for special purpose devices that perform a fixed function such as automated teller machines and medical equipment For this reason it excludes Cortana Microsoft Store and all bundled Universal Windows Platform apps including but not limited to Microsoft Edge hence these builds ship only with Internet Explorer as browser Microsoft director Stella Chernyak explained that we have businesses that may have mission critical environments where we respect the fact they want to test and stabilize the environment for a long time Four LTSC builds have been released correlating with the and H versions of Windows respectively br In July Microsoft announced changes in the terminology for Windows branches as part of its effort to unify the update cadence with that of Office ProPlus and Windows Server The branch system now defines two paces of upgrade deployment in enterprise environments targeted initial deployment of a new version on selected systems immediately after its stable release for final testing and broad deployment afterwards Hence Current Branch is now known as Semi Annual Channel Targeted and Current Branch for Business for broad deployment is now referred to as Semi Annual Channel br In February Microsoft announced changes again in delivering updates beginning with release of version a single SAC will be released SAC T will be retired and users are no longer able to switch to different channels Instead these updates can be deferred from to days or depending on how the device was configured to defer the updates In April it was announced that in addition feature updates will no longer be automatically pushed to users However after the release of version the update only pushed for those running a feature update version that is nearing end of service or it can be paused for up to days In November following the launch of version H Microsoft made a commitment to deliver feature updates every October or November Thus Microsoft rebranded the Semi Annual Channel to the General Availability Channel On April Microsoft announced that version H released in November would be the last feature update for Windows br Feature updates prior to version were distributed solely as an in place upgrade installation requiring the download of a complete operating system package approximately GB in size for bit systems Unlike previous builds version was designed primarily as an update rollup version of which focused primarily on minor feature additions and enhancements For upgrades to from a new delivery method was used where its changes were delivered as part of the monthly cumulative update but were left in a dormant state until the update enablement patch is installed The full upgrade process was still used for those using builds prior to br br br Features in development br In May Microsoft unveiled Fluent Design System previously codenamed Project Neon a revamp of Microsoft Design Language that includes guidelines for the designs and interactions used within software designed for all Windows devices and platforms The new design language will include the more prominent use of motion depth and translucency effects Microsoft stated that the implementation of this design language would be performed over time and it had already started to implement elements of it in the Creators Update and Fall Creators Update br On December Microsoft announced that as part of a partnership with Qualcomm it planned to introduce support for running Win software on ARM architecture with a bit x processor emulator in Terry Myerson stated that this move would enable the production of Qualcomm Snapdragon based Windows devices with cellular connectivity and improved power efficiency over Intel compatible devices and still capable of running the majority of existing Windows software unlike the previous Windows RT which was restricted to Windows Store apps Microsoft is initially targeting this project towards laptops Microsoft launched the branding Always Connected PCs in December to market Windows devices with cellular connectivity which included two ARM based in laptops from Asus and HP featuring the Snapdragon system on chip and the announcement of a partnership between AMD and Qualcomm to integrate its Snapdragon X gigabit LTE modem with AMD s Ryzen Mobile platform br In August Microsoft began testing changes to its handling of the user interface on convertible devices downplaying the existing Tablet Mode option in favor of presenting the normal desktop with optimizations for touch when a keyboard is not present such as increasing the space between taskbar buttons and displaying the virtual keyboard when text fields are selected br In April the ability to run Linux applications using a graphical user interface such as Audacity directly in Windows was introduced as a preview This feature would later be included as part of the updated Windows Subsystem for Linux for Windows only br In November Microsoft released Windows Subsystem For Linux on the Microsoft Store for both Windows and allowing Linux graphical user interface applications to be used natively using WSL br br br System requirements br br The basic hardware requirements to install Windows were initially the same as those for Windows and Windows and only slightly higher than for Windows and Windows Vista As of the May update the minimum disk space requirement has been increased to GB In addition on new installations Windows permanently reserves up to GB of disk space in order to ensure proper installation of future feature updates br The bit variants require a CPU that supports certain instructions Devices with low storage capacity must provide a USB flash drive or SD card with sufficient storage for temporary files during upgrades br Some pre built devices may be described as certified by Microsoft Certified tablets must include Power Volume up and Volume down keys Win and Rotation lock keys are no longer required br As with Windows all certified devices must ship with UEFI Secure Boot enabled by default Unlike Windows OEMs are no longer required to make Secure Boot settings user configurable meaning that devices may optionally be locked to run only Microsoft signed operating systems A supported infrared illuminated camera is required for Windows Hello face authentication and a supported fingerprint reader is required for Windows Hello fingerprint authentication Device Guard requires a UEFI system with no third party certificates loaded and CPU virtualization extensions including SLAT and IOMMU enabled in firmware br Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge Windows is the only version of Windows that Microsoft will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures Terry Myerson stated that Microsoft did not want to make further investments in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors These policies were criticized by the media who especially noted that Microsoft was refusing to support newer hardware particularly Intel s Skylake CPUs which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted on Windows a version of Windows that was still in mainstream support until January In addition an enthusiast created modification was released that disabled the check and allowed Windows and earlier versions to continue to work on the platform br Windows versions and later do not support Intel Clover Trail system on chips per Microsoft s stated policy of only providing updates for devices during their OEM support period br Starting with Windows version Microsoft will require new OEM devices to use bit processors and will therefore cease the distribution of x bit variants of Windows via OEM channels The bit variants of Windows will remain available via non OEM channels and Microsoft will continue to provide feature and security updates on these devices This was later followed by Windows dropping support for bit hardware altogether thus making Windows the final version of Windows to have a bit version available br br br Physical memory limits br The maximum amount of RAM that Windows can support varies depending on the product edition and the processor architecture All bit editions of Windows including Home and Pro support up to GB bit editions of Windows Education and Pro support up to TB bit editions of Windows Pro for Workstations and Enterprise support up to TB while the bit edition of Windows Home is limited to GB br br br Processor limits br Windows supports up to two physical processors A maximum of cores is supported in bit versions of Windows whereas up to cores are supported in the bit versions br br br Reception br br Windows received generally positive reviews with most reviewers considering it superior to its predecessor Windows CNN Business praised every aspect of Windows TechRadar felt that it could be the new Windows citing the operating system s more familiar user interface improvements to bundled apps performance improvements a rock solid search system and the Settings app being more full featured than its equivalents on and The Edge browser was praised for its performance although it was not in a feature complete state at launch While considering them a great idea in principle concerns were shown for Microsoft s focus on the universal app ecosystem br br It s by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows from iOS and Android simply because they can convert their apps easily It may well become a no brainer for them but at the moment a conscious decision is still required br Engadget was similarly positive noting that the upgrade process was painless and that Windows s user interface had balanced aspects of Windows with those of previous versions with a more mature aesthetic Cortana s always on voice detection was considered to be its true strength also citing its query capabilities and personalization features but noting that it was not as pre emptive as Google Now Windows s stock applications were praised for being improved over their Windows counterparts and for supporting windowed modes The Xbox app was also praised for its Xbox One streaming functionality although recommending its use over a wired network because of inconsistent quality over Wi Fi In conclusion it was argued that Windows delivers the most refined desktop experience ever from Microsoft and yet it s so much more than that It s also a decent tablet OS and it s ready for a world filled with hybrid devices And barring another baffling screwup it looks like a significant step forward for mobile Heck it makes the Xbox One a more useful machine br On the other hand Ars Technica panned the new Tablet mode interface for removing the charms and app switching making the Start button harder to use by requiring users to reach for the button on the bottom left rather than at the center of the screen when swiping with a thumb and for making application switching less instantaneous through the use of Task View Microsoft Edge was praised for being tremendously promising and a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was but criticized it for its lack of functionality on launch In conclusion contrasting Windows as being a reliable platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts Windows was considered the best Windows yet and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be comfortable and effective across a wide array of form factors but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on launch br ExtremeTech felt that Windows restricted the choices of users citing its more opaque setting menus forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer to peer distribution of updates and for taking away user control of specific functions such as updates explaining that it feels once again as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea like providing users with security updates automatically and shoved the throttle to maximum Windows has also received criticism because of deleting files without user permission after auto updates br Critics characterized the release of Windows as being forced onto users of past versions of Windows Critics have also noted that Windows heavily emphasizes freemium services and contains various advertising facilities Some outlets have considered these to be a hidden cost of the free upgrade offer Examples of these have included microtransactions in bundled games such as Microsoft Solitaire Collection default settings that display promotions of suggested apps in the Start menu tips on the lock screen that may contain advertising ads displayed in File Explorer for Office subscriptions on Creators Update and various advertising notifications displayed by default which promote Microsoft Edge when it is not set as the default web browser including in a September build nag pop ups displayed to interrupt the installation process of competitors br Due to the high system requirements of its successor Windows some critics have cited Windows being better than its successor and have warned not to switch to Windows given its high system requirements despite very limited new features compared to Windows at the time of release br br br Market share and sales br br Up to August Windows usage was increasing with it then plateauing while eventually in it became more popular than Windows though Windows was still more used in some countries in Asia and Africa in As of March the operating system is running on over a billion devices reaching the goal set by Microsoft two years after the initial deadline br Twenty four hours after it was released Microsoft announced that over million devices were running Windows On August Microsoft said over million devices were running Windows in countries and on over unique PC or tablet models According to Terry Myerson there were over million devices running Windows as of October On January Microsoft reported that Windows had been activated on over million devices since the operating system s launch in July br According to StatCounter Windows overtook Windows in December Iceland was the first country where Windows was ranked first not only on the desktop but across all platforms with several larger European countries following For one week in late November Windows overtook first rank from Windows in the United States before losing it again By February Windows was losing market share to Windows br In mid January Windows had a slightly higher global market share than Windows with it noticeably more popular on weekends while popularity varies widely by region e g Windows was then still behind in Africa and far ahead in some other regions e g Oceania br br br Update system changes br Windows Home is permanently set to download all updates automatically including cumulative updates security patches and drivers and users cannot individually select updates to install or not Tom Warren of The Verge felt that given web browsers such as Google Chrome had already adopted such an automatic update system such a requirement would help to keep all Windows devices secure and felt that if you re used to family members calling you for technical support because they ve failed to upgrade to the latest Windows service pack or some malware disabled Windows Update then those days will hopefully be over br Concerns were raised that because of these changes users would be unable to skip the automatic installation of updates that are faulty or cause issues with certain system configurations although build upgrades will also be subject to public beta testing via Windows Insider program There were also concerns that the forced installation of driver updates through Windows Update where they were previously designated as optional could cause conflicts with drivers that were installed independently of Windows Update br Criticism was also directed towards Microsoft s decision to no longer provide specific details on the contents of cumulative updates for Windows On February Microsoft retracted this decision and began to provide release notes for cumulative updates on the Windows website br Some users reported that during the installation of the November upgrade some applications particularly utility programs such as CPU Z and Speccy were automatically uninstalled during the upgrade process and some default programs were reset to Microsoft specified defaults such as Photos app and Microsoft Edge for PDF viewing both without warning br Further issues were discovered upon the launch of the Anniversary Update Redstone including a bug that caused some devices to freeze but addressed by cumulative update KB released on August and that fundamental changes to how Windows handles webcams had caused many to stop working br In June a Redstone Insider build RS EDGE CASE in PC and rs IoT on Mobile was accidentally released to both Insider and non Insider users on all Windows devices but the update was retracted with Microsoft apologizing and releasing a note on their Windows Insider Program blog describing how to prevent the build from being installed on their device According to Dona Sarkar this was due to an inadvertent deployment to the engineering system that controls which builds which rings to push out to insiders br A Gartner analyst felt that Windows Pro was becoming increasingly inappropriate for use in enterprise environments because of support policy changes by Microsoft including consumer oriented upgrade lifecycle length and only offering extended support for individual builds to Enterprise and Education editions of Windows br Critics have acknowledged that Microsoft s update and testing practices had been affecting the overall quality of Windows In particular it was pointed out that Microsoft s internal testing departments had been prominently affected by a major round of layoffs undertaken by the company in Microsoft relies primarily on user testing and bug reports via the Windows Insider program which may not always be of sufficient quality to identify a bug as well as correspondence with OEMs and other stakeholders In the wake of the known folder redirection data loss bug in the version it was pointed out that bug reports describing the issue had been present on the Feedback Hub app for several months prior to the public release Following the incident Microsoft updated Feedback Hub so that users may specify the severity of a particular bug report When announcing the resumption of s rollout Microsoft stated that it planned to be more transparent in its handling of update quality in the future through a series of blog posts that will detail its testing process and the planned development of a dashboard that will indicate the rollout progress of future updates br br br Distribution practices br Microsoft was criticized for the tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade campaign for Windows including adware like behaviors using dark patterns to coax users into installing the operating system downloading installation files without user consent and making it difficult for users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to Windows The upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using the Get Windows GWX application which was first downloaded and installed via Windows Update in March Third party programs were created to assist users in applying measures to disable GWX br In September it was reported that Microsoft was triggering automatic downloads of Windows installation files on all compatible Windows or systems configured to automatically download and install updates regardless of whether or not they had specifically requested the upgrade Microsoft officially confirmed the change claiming it was an industry practice that reduces the time for installation and ensures device readiness This move was criticized by users with data caps or devices with low storage capacity as resources were consumed by the automatic downloads of up to GB of data Other critics argued that Microsoft should not have triggered any downloading of Windows installation files without user consent br In October Windows began to appear as an Optional update on the Windows Update interface but pre selected for installation on some systems A Microsoft spokesperson said that this was a mistake and that the download would no longer be pre selected by default However on October Microsoft announced that it planned to classify Windows as a recommended update in the Windows Update interface sometime in which would cause an automatic download of installation files and a one time prompt with a choice to install to appear In December it was reported that a new advertising dialog had begun to appear only containing Upgrade now and Upgrade tonight buttons and no obvious method to decline installation besides the close button br In March some users also alleged that their Windows and devices had automatically begun upgrading to Windows without their consent In June the GWX dialog s behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade In December Microsoft s chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted that the company had gone too far by using these tactics stating we know we want people to be running Windows from a security perspective but finding the right balance where you re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and for a lot of the year I think we got it right br On January Microsoft was sued in small claims court by a user whose computer had attempted to upgrade to Windows without her consent shortly after the release of the operating system The upgrade failed and her computer was left in a broken state thereafter which disrupted the ability to run her travel agency The court ruled in favor of the user and awarded her in damages but Microsoft appealed However in May Microsoft dropped the appeal and chose to pay the damages Shortly after the suit was reported on by the Seattle Times Microsoft confirmed it was updating the GWX software once again to add more explicit options for opting out of a free Windows upgrade the final notification was a full screen pop up window notifying users of the impending end of the free upgrade offer and contained Remind me later Do not notify me again and Notify me three more times as options br In March Microsoft announced that it would display notifications informing users on Windows devices of the upcoming end of extended support for the platform and direct users to a website urging them to upgrade to Windows or purchase new hardware This dialog will be similar to the previous Windows upgrade prompts but will not explicitly mention Windows br br br Privacy and data collection br Privacy advocates and other critics have expressed concern regarding Windows s privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data Under the default Express settings Windows is configured to send various information to Microsoft and other parties including the collection of user contacts calendar data and associated input data to personalize speech typing and inking input typing and inking data to improve recognition allowing apps to use a unique advertising ID for analytics and advertising personalization functionality introduced by Windows and allow apps to request the user s location data and send this data to Microsoft and trusted partners to improve location detection Windows had similar settings except that location data collection did not include trusted partners Users can opt out from most of this data collection but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft and this cannot be disabled on non Enterprise editions of Windows Microsoft s privacy policy states however that Basic level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot be used to identify an individual user or device The use of Cortana also requires the collection of data such as Your PC location data from your calendar the apps you use data from your emails and text messages who you call your contacts and how often you interact with them on Your PC to personalize its functionality br Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer argued that Microsoft s intent for this data collection lacked transparency stating that there is no world in which pages of policy documents and opt out settings split across different settings screens and an external website constitutes real transparency Joel Hruska of ExtremeTech wrote that the company that brought us the Scroogled campaign now hoovers up your data in ways that would make Google jealous However it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri In August Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows to be banned from use within the Russian government as it sends user data to servers in the United States The Russian government had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September or be blocked Writing for ZDNet Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows indicated how utterly normal those privacy terms are in In a Computerworld editorial Preston Gralla said that the kind of information Windows gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather But Microsoft is held to a different standard than other companies br The Microsoft Services agreement reads that the company s online services may automatically download software updates or configuration changes including those that prevent you from accessing the Services playing counterfeit games or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices Critics interpreted this statement as implying that Microsoft would scan for and delete unlicensed software installed on devices running Windows However others pointed out that this agreement was specifically for Microsoft online services such as Microsoft account Office Skype as well as Xbox Live and that the offending passage most likely referred to digital rights management on Xbox consoles and first party games and not plans to police pirated video games installed on Windows PCs Despite this some torrent trackers announced plans to block Windows users also arguing that the operating system could send information to anti piracy groups that are affiliated with Microsoft Writing about these allegations Ed Bott of ZDNet compared Microsoft s privacy policy to Apple s and Google s and concluded that he did not see anything that looks remotely like Big Brother Columnist Kim Komando argued that Microsoft might in the future run scans and disable software or hardware it sees as a security threat consistent with the Windows update policy br In September Microsoft hid the option to create a local account during a fresh installation if a PC is connected to the internet This move was criticized by users who did not want to use an online Microsoft account Additionally in Windows Home the first Microsoft account linked to the primary user s account can no longer be unlinked but other users can unlink their own Microsoft accounts from their user accounts br In late July Windows Defender began to classify modifications of the hosts file that block Microsoft telemetry servers as being a severe security risk br br br See also br br Comparison of operating systems br History of operating systems br List of operating systems br Microsoft Windows version
