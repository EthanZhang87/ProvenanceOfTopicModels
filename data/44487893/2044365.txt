Reception br br In August Namco claimed accumulated sales of units for the Namco Museum series in Japan alone In the United States The NPD Group in listed Namco Museum among the all time top ten best selling video games in the United States The franchise has sold a total of at least million copies worldwide br The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Volume an out of citing the excellent quality of the emulation and the interesting virtual museum content Mark Lefebvre summarized that Namco has given gamers what they ve always been asking for old titles Next Generation likewise complimented the emulation quality and the virtual museum and concluded that for those interested in retro compilations this is as good as this sort of thing gets They scored it four out of five stars Maximum gave it three out of five stars reasoning that On the one hand this is a collection of six indisputably classic games three of which rank among the most influential titles in the history of videogames On the other hand all the games on the disk are over ten years old and influential or not they re definitely well past their sell by date Pole Position may have revolutionised the racing genre in but would you really choose to play it over Ridge Racer Revolution in While GamePro found that all of the games save ToyPop remained great fun the reviewer criticized the absence of the voice samples from Pole Position and compared the D museum unfavorably to the bonus content in Williams Arcade s Greatest Hits He concluded the compilation to be worth renting at the least and a must have for retro gaming fans br Reviews for Volume were also mixed to positive though most critics found the selection of games weaker than that of Volume The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave Volume a out of with all four remarking that the compilation had two or three genuine classics with the remaining three or four games being mediocre and overly obscure However they disagreed on which games fell into which group for example Dan Hsu said that Super Pac Man stinks while Crispin Boyer called it the best reason to buy NM and the height of the yellow pellet eater s evolution Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot similarly commented While Mappy Xevious Gaplus and Super Pac Man are infinitely playable the lesser known Grobda and Dragon Buster are mediocre at best He gave the compilation a out of praising the charm of the antiquated graphics and sound effects and the still potent gameplay Next Generation picked Grobda Dragon Buster and Mappy as the mediocre games in the compilation reasoning that all are examples of game genres that have evolved way beyond these originals and with good reason They scored it two out of five stars In direct contradiction to GameSpot and Next Generation GamePro said that of the six games Super Pac Man s weak control makes it the biggest disappointment while Dragon Buster s action adventure swordplay and Grobda s rapid fire tank shooting hold up the best They recommended the compilation for those who enjoy simple classic gameplay br Volume continued the trend of increasingly mixed reviews for the series Jeff Gerstmann and Next Generation both commented that Dig Dug Ms Pac Man and Galaxian are genuine classics Pole Position II is good but suffers from the absence of the voice clips from the arcade version The Tower of Druaga has aged poorly and Phozon was a terrible game to begin with However while Gerstmann concluded the collection to be a real letdown after the first two volumes and advised gamers to skip it giving it a out of Next Generation concluded that the number of true classics on Volume outweigh the ones that never should have been unearthed and gave it three out of five stars GamePro approved of both the entire set of games and the quality of the emulation and deemed Volume must have arcade fun Though Electronic Gaming Monthly never reviewed Volume they named it a runner up for Best Compilation behind Street Fighter Collection at their Editors Choice Awards br Volume saw a particularly steep decline in the series critical standing with most critics agreeing that of the five games included only Ordyne and Assault were at all worthwhile Gerstmann gave it a out of and said the collection is just plain depressing It contains five games and most of them are little known games that were little known for a reason Electronic Gaming Monthly s review team gave it a out of The team was evenly split Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer each voting a out of found the interesting museum content and the two or three enjoyable games make the collection worthwhile while Dan Hsu and Sushi X both gave it a and said it was a disappointment compared to the earlier volumes Both Gerstmann and GamePro commented that the first three volumes of Namco Museum had exhausted the series concept and Namco s backlog of genuine classics and that Namco should have let the series end with volume br br
