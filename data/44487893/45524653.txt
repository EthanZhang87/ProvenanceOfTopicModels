title: The dress
id: 45524653
The dress was a online viral phenomenon centred on a photograph of a dress Viewers disagreed on whether the dress was blue and black or white and gold The phenomenon revealed differences in human colour perception and became the subject of scientific investigations into neuroscience and vision science br The phenomenon originated in a photograph of a dress posted on the social networking service Facebook The dress was black and blue but the conditions of the photograph caused many to perceive it as white and gold creating debate Within a week more than ten million tweets had mentioned the dress The retailer of the dress Roman Originals reported a surge in sales and produced a one off version in white and gold sold for charity br br br Origin br In February about a week before the wedding of Grace and Keir Johnston of Colonsay Scotland the bride s mother Cecilia Bleasdale took a photograph of a dress at Cheshire Oaks Designer Outlet north of Chester England Bleasdale intended to wear the dress at the wedding and sent the photograph to Grace The dress was coloured blue with black lace However Grace told her mother she perceived it in the photograph as white with gold lace br After Grace posted the photograph on Facebook her friends also disagreed some saw it as white with gold while others saw it as blue with black For a week the debate became well known in Colonsay a small island community br On the day of the wedding Caitlin McNeill a friend of the bride and groom performed with her band at the wedding Even after seeing that the dress was obviously blue and black in reality the musicians remained preoccupied by the photograph They said they almost failed to make it on stage because they were caught up discussing the dress A few days later on February McNeill reposted the image to her blog on Tumblr creating further public discussion surrounding the image br br br Response br br br Initial viral spread br br Cates Holderness who ran the Tumblr page for BuzzFeed at the site s New York offices received a message from McNeill asking for help resolving the colour dispute of the dress She dismissed it but checked the page near the end of her workday and saw that it had received around notes a large amount for Tumblr Tom Christ Tumblr s director of data said at its peak the page was receiving views a second or views per minute well over the normal rates Later that night the number of notes increased tenfold br Holderness showed the picture to other members of the BuzzFeed social media team who immediately began arguing about the dress colours She created a simple poll for Tumblr users then left work and took the subway home When she got off the train and checked her phone it was overwhelmed by messages That evening the page set a new record at BuzzFeed for concurrent visitors and eventually peaked at br The image became a worldwide Internet meme across social media On Twitter users created the hashtags whiteandgold blueandblack and dressgate to discuss their opinions on what the colour of the dress was and theories surrounding their arguments The number of tweets about the dress increased throughout the night at pm GMT when the first increase in the number of tweets about the dress occurred there were five thousand tweets per minute using the hashtag TheDress increasing to tweets per minute with the hashtag by am GMT The photo also attracted discussion relating to the triviality of the matter as a whole The Washington Post described the dispute as the drama that divided a planet Some articles humorously suggested that the dress could prompt an existential crisis over the nature of sight and reality or that the debate could harm interpersonal relationships Others examined why people were making such a big argument over a seemingly trivial matter br br br Overnight popularity br On the evening BuzzFeed posted the article the Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway gave some comments about the phenomenon to the Wired reporter Adam Rogers Before they hung up Rogers warned him Your tomorrow will not be the same Conway thought he was exaggerating Rogers s story eventually received million unique visitors When Conway woke up the next morning his inbox had so many emails he initially thought it had been hacked until he saw that most were interview requests from major media organisations I did interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day said Conway br Celebrities with larger Twitter followings began to comment A tweet by the American songwriter Taylor Swift in which she saw the dress as blue and black and said she was confused and scared was retweeted times and liked times Jaden Smith Frankie Muniz Demi Lovato Mindy Kaling and Justin Bieber saw the dress was blue and black while Anna Kendrick B J Novak Katy Perry Julianne Moore and Sarah Hyland saw it as white and gold Kim Kardashian tweeted that she saw it as white and gold while her then husband Kanye West saw it as blue and black Lucy Hale Phoebe Tonkin and Katie Nolan saw different colour schemes at different times Lady Gaga described the dress as periwinkle and sand while David Duchovny called it teal Other celebrities including Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande mentioned the dress on social media without mentioning specific colours Politicians government agencies and social media platforms of major brands also wrote humorous posts Ultimately the dress was the subject of million tweets within hours br The dress was designed and manufactured by Roman Originals In the UK where the phenomenon had begun Ian Johnson creative manager for Roman Originals learned of the controversy from his Facebook news feed that morning I was pretty gobsmacked I just laughed and told the wife that I d better get to work he said TV presenter Alex Jones wore the dress on that night s edition of The One Show br br Businesses that had nothing to do with the dress or even the clothing industry devoted social media attention to the phenomenon Adobe retweeted another Twitter user who had used some of the company s apps to isolate the dress s colours We jumped in the conversation and thought Let s see what happens recalled Karen Do the company s senior manager for social media Jenna Bromberg a digital brand manager for Pizza Hut saw the dress as white and gold and quickly sent out a tweet with a picture of pizza noting that it too was the same colours Do called it literally a tweet heard around the world br Ben Fischer of the New York Business Journal reported that interest in the first BuzzFeed article about the dress exhibited vertical growth instead of the typical bell curve of a viral phenomenon leading BuzzFeed to assign two editorial teams to generate additional articles about the dress to drive ad revenue and by March the original BuzzFeed article had received over million views The dress was cited by CNN commentator Mel Robbins as a viral phenomenon having the requisite qualities of positivity bias incorporating awe laughter and amusement and was compared to and contrasted with a story about escaped llamas in an Arizona retirement community earlier that day as well as to tributes paid to actor Leonard Nimoy after his death the following day br br br Real colours of dress confirmed br The dress was confirmed as a royal blue Lace Bodycon Dress from the retailer Roman Originals The dress is black and blue although it was available in three other colours red pink and ivory each with black lace a white and gold version was not available at the time The day after McNeill s post Roman Originals website experienced a major surge in traffic and sold out of the dress within minutes On February Roman Originals announced that they would make a single white and gold dress for a Comic Relief charity auction br On March the Johnstons Bleasdale and MacNeill appeared as guests on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in the United States The presenter Ellen DeGeneres presented each of them with gifts of underwear patterned after the dress and combining both colour schemes The show sponsors also gave the Johnstons a gift of and a honeymoon trip to Grenada as they had left their honeymoon early to participate in the show br By March over two thirds of BuzzFeed users polled responded that the dress was white and gold Some people have suggested that the dress changes colours on its own Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance causing its colours to be washed out giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold br br br Scientific explanations br br There is no consensus on why the dress elicits such discordant perceptions The neuroscientists Bevil Conway and Jay Neitz believe they are a result of how the human brain perceives colour and chromatic adaptation Conway believes it is connected to how the brain processes the various hues of a daylight sky Your visual system is looking at this thing and you re trying to discount the chromatic bias of the daylight axis people either discount the blue side in which case they end up seeing white and gold or discount the gold side in which case they end up with blue and black Neitz said br br Our visual system is supposed to throw away information about the illuminant and extract information about the actual reflectance but I ve studied individual differences in colour vision for years and this is one of the biggest individual differences I ve ever seen br Similar theories have been expounded by the University of Liverpool s Paul Knox who stated that what the brain interprets as colour may be affected by the device the photograph is viewed on or the viewer s own expectations Anya Hurlbert and collaborators also considered the problem from the perspective of colour perception They attributed the differences in perception to individual perception of colour constancy br The neuroscientist and psychologist Pascal Wallisch states that while inherently ambiguous stimuli have been known to vision science for many years this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was brought to the attention of science by social media He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch If it does it does so only on very long time scales which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli so perceptual learning might be at play In addition he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently Daniel Hardiman McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture The philosopher Barry C Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit duck illusion although the rabbit duck illusion is an ambiguous image where for most people the alternative perceptions switch very easily br The Journal of Vision a scientific journal about vision research announced in March that a special issue about the dress would be published with the title A Dress Rehearsal for Vision Science The first large scale scientific study on the dress was published in Current Biology three months after the image went viral The study which involved respondents found that per cent saw the dress as blue and black per cent saw it as white and gold per cent saw it as blue and brown and two per cent reported it as other Women and older people disproportionately saw the dress as white and gold The researchers further found that if the dress was shown in artificial yellow coloured lighting almost all respondents saw the dress as black and blue while they saw it as white and gold if the simulated lighting had a blue bias Another study in the Journal of Vision by Pascal Wallisch found that people who were early risers were more likely to think the dress was lit by natural light perceiving it as white and gold and that night owls saw the dress as blue and black br A study carried out by Schlaffke et al reported that individuals who saw the dress as white and gold showed increased activity in the frontal and parietal regions of the brain These areas are thought to be critical in higher cognition activities such as top down modulation in visual perception br br br Legacy br The dress was included on multiple year end lists of notable Internet memes in As the original authors of the photograph that sparked the viral phenomenon Bleasdale and her partner Paul Jinks later expressed frustration and regret over being completely left out from the story including their lack of control over the story the omission of their role in the discovery and the commercial use of the photograph In South Africa the Salvation Army used the dress in a campaign to raise awareness of domestic violence with the slogan Why is it so hard to see black and blue br br br See also br br Checker shadow illusion br List of Internet phenomena br Yanny or Laurel br List of individual dresses br br br br br br External links br br
