Jr Pac Man is an arcade video game developed by General Computer Corporation and released by Bally Midway in It has the same gameplay as prior entries in the series but the maze in Jr Pac Man scrolls horizontally and has no escape tunnels The bonus item which moves around the maze changes dots into a form which slows Jr Pac Man as they are being eaten br br br Gameplay br br The core gameplay of Jr Pac Man is similar to its predecessors The player controls the eponymous Jr Pac Man who wears an animated propeller beanie and scores points by eating all of the dots in the maze while four ghosts Blinky Pinky Inky and Tim who replaces Clyde chase him around the maze and attempt to catch him Eating a power pellet turns the ghosts blue briefly allowing the player to eat them for extra points Once the maze is cleared a new maze is presented and the gameplay continues br The mazes are now twice the width of the monitor and scroll horizontally A total of seven mazes appear throughout the game and five of them have six power pellets instead of four but none of them have tunnels that wrap around from one side of the screen to the other br Bonus items such as tricycles kites and balloons appear in each round starting above the ghosts lair and moving around the maze as in Ms Pac Man As an item encounters dots it changes them into larger ones that award more points but slow Jr Pac Man down while he is eating them After a certain length of time the item will move toward one of the remaining power pellets if any and explode on contact if not eaten destroying both itself and the pellet Contact between Jr Pac Man and a non vulnerable ghost costs the player one life and makes any large dots either disappear or revert to normal ones depending on how many dots overall are left in the maze br The between level intermissions show the developing relationship between Jr Pac Man and a small red ghost named Yum Yum who is apparently the daughter of Blinky br br br Development br Tim Hoskins worked at General Computer Corporation GCC as Jr Pac Man s project lead Hoskins recalled that GCC s founder Doug Macrae came up with the idea of Jr Pac Man as a project to develop referring to the game as Pac Baby in his project notes Macrae echoed this while adding that in their previous game Ms Pac Man they had created intermissions involving Ms Pac Man and Pac Man meeting with Junior Arriving being the third and final intermission As Pac Man and Jr Pac Man were what Macrae described as huge successes the continued with the series During this period in Arcade development they had the option to develop the game as new arcade cabinet or implement a new hardware kit Macrae had etched out a plan that involved editing the original Pac Man kits which changed the collectible items of fruits in the original to baby oriented items He developed new gameplay that would allow the maze to scroll horizontally br Just like with Ms Pac Man there was no source code available to the team to develop the game leading the team to have to reverse engineer Pac Man from ROM dumps Unlike Ms Pac Man which was developed in a few weeks Jr Pac Man took months to make Situations involving adding scrolling to the map led to difficulties handling items such a when the ghosts were off screen When investigating the Pac Man ROM the found unused elements such as a fat dot and another that resembled a flame This led the team to hypothesize what these items may have done leading them to introduce a fat dot which slowed the player down even more than regular dots did when Jr Pac Man ate them For the bouncing toys they thought of the flame items they discovered and decided to implement an explosion when the fat dot interacted a power pellet giving the player urgency to collect the toy item before risking losing a power pellet They also had it so if the player had died in the game the fat dots would vanish This was implemented to encourage more skilled players to collect them as they were worth more points br The team also adjusted graphics from the original game giving Jr Pac Man a twirling beanie cap and giving the game a lower case font The group experimented with several ways to show the characters death sequence eventually settling on having him shrink down only leaving his beanie cap Earlier experiments were coarsers including having Jr Pac Man pause then slowly ooze a red substance before the top of his body fell off The team described creating the new intermissions as difficult involving creating new graphics and software to drive them br The game would be the final Pac Man game made by GCC Hoskins envisioned other ideas to potentially make as a follow up such as a Pac Man game from a first person perspective but this was never made br br br Ports br The Atari version of the game was programmed in by Ava Robin Cohen of GCC The game was not released until when the Atari was experiencing what game historian Brett Weiss described as a resurgence of sorts after Nintendo had success in the marketplace with the Nintendo Entertainment System Atari had just re released the system a smaller budget priced revision in Jr Pac Man was released for the Atari in October br Ports for the Atari and the Atari bit computers were finished in but were scrapped along with Super Pac Man when the home divisions of Atari were sold to Jack Tramiel br An unofficial port for the Atari was published in by AtariAge br br br br br br Sources br Grannell Craig The Making of Jr Pac Man Retro Gamer No br Weiss Brett The Greatest Console Video Games Schiffer Publishing ISBN
