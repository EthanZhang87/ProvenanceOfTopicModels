Blinky Pinky Inky and Clyde collectively known as the Ghost Gang are a quartet of characters from the Pac Man video game franchise Created by Toru Iwatani they first appear in the arcade game Pac Man as the main antagonists The ghosts have appeared in every Pac Man game since sometimes becoming minor antagonists or allies to Pac Man such as in Pac Man World and the Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures animated series br Some entries in the series went on to add other ghosts to the group such as Sue in Ms Pac Man Tim in Jr Pac Man and Funky and Spunky in Pac Mania however these did not appear in later games The group has since gained a positive reception and is cited as one of the most recognizable video game villains of all time br br br Concept and creation br The ghosts were created by Toru Iwatani who was the head designer for the original Pac Man arcade game The idea for the ghosts was made from Iwatani s desire to create a video game that could attract women and younger players particularly couples at a time where most video games were war type games or Space Invaders clones In turn he made the in game characters cute and colorful a trait borrowed from Iwatani s previous game Cutie Q which featured similar kawaii characters Iwatani cited Casper the Friendly Ghost or Little Ghost Q Taro as inspiration for the ghosts Their simplistic design was also attributed to the limitations of the hardware at the time only being able to display a certain amount of colors for a sprite To prevent the game from becoming impossibly difficult or too boring to play each of the ghosts were programmed to have their own distinct traits the red ghost would directly chase Pac Man the pink and blue ghosts would position themselves in front of him and the orange ghost would be random br Originally all four of the ghosts were meant to be red instead of multicolored as ordered by Namco president Masaya Nakamura Iwatani was against the idea as he wanted the ghosts to be distinguishable from one another Although he was admittedly afraid of Nakamura he conducted a survey with his colleagues that asked if they wanted single colored enemies or multicolored enemies After being present with a to result in favor of multicolored ghosts Nakamura agreed to the decision The original Japanese version of the game had the ghosts named Oikake Machibuse Kimagure and Otoboke translating respectively to chaser ambusher fickle and stupid When the game was exported to the United States Midway Games changed their names to Shadow Speedy Bashful and Pokey their nicknames being changed to Blinky Pinky Inky and Clyde respectively Early promotional material would sometimes refer to the ghosts as monsters or goblins br Uproxx argues that the ghost are really just people in costumes based on what is revealed between rounds in the game A cutscene that appears after the th round of the game shows the ghost Blinky chasing after Pac Man and their ghost costume snags on a nail and rips revealing a leg underneath In a later cutscene they have a rip in their ghost costume then after going off screen they are seen back on the screen dragging the red costume behind them br br br Cartoons br In the Pac Man cartoon the hero faced five Ghosts four males wearing various styles of hats and a female ghost named Sue who wore earrings The Ghost Monsters work for Mezmaron who assigns them the job of finding the Power Pellet Forest br br The battle of Pac Man vs Ghost Monsters would have to address the issue of the original arcade game s cannibalism somewhere along the line after all the basic appeal of Pac Man was the indiscriminate ingestion of his foes This was handled with such nonviolent dexterity that Hanna Barbera could have written a textbook for Action for Children s Television on the subject Pac Man only chomped the Ghost Monsters when defending his loved ones or the Power Forest as opposed to the videogame where the lead character was on the offensive and once chomped the Ghost Monsters merely disappeared temporarily re emerging unscathed after picking up new shrouds from Mezmaron s wardrobe closet br In the TV series Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures featured Pac Man as a high school student confronted by four ghosts commanded by Lord Betrayus br br br Reception br The ghosts have received a positive reception from critics and have been cited as one of the most recognizable video game villains of all time IGN commented on each of the ghosts having their own personality and adorable design Boy s Life praised their simplicity
