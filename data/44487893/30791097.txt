of six games from the Pac Man and Galaxian franchises Pac Man Galaga Pac Man Championship Edition Galaga Legions Pac Man Tilt and Galaga D Impact the last two being exclusive to this collection Pac Man and Galaga are both arcade games from the early s while Pac Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions are modernized updates that were first published on the Xbox and PlayStation All of the

choose from the American upright Japanese upright or tabletop cabinets for the screen border The collection also includes access to an online ranking system and a trailer for the Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures animated series br In Pac Man Tilt players control Pac Man as he must make it to the end of each level while avoiding ghosts and other obstacles in his way Tilting the DS changes the direction of gravity which is used to easily climb up steep inclines or turn into a ball to roll down hills and smash through bricks Pac Man can defeat the ghosts by finding glowing Power Pellets throughout the level In Galaga D Impact players control a starship from a first person perspective throughout a series of levels destroying formations of enemies and avoiding collision with their projectiles Moving the DS in a fixed direction controls the player in the game Players can also capture enemies and use their weapons against other enemies and bosses br br br Development and release br br Pac Man Galaga Dimensions was designed by Takahiro Okano and Takahisa Sugiyama of Namco Bandai Games As a way to celebrate the th anniversaries of Pac Man and Galaga the two were commissioned to create a compilation that bridged the two franchises together into a single game Okano and Sugiyama designed Dimensions to utilize the hardware capabilities of the recently launched Nintendo DS as both showed interest in the system s specifications Their interest lead to the creation of the two exclusive games Galaga D Impact and Pac Man Tilt which became the first games they designed for the company Okano created Tilt based on his fascination with the handheld s gyroscopic sensor He created an early prototype where players launched Pac Man into a goal by tilting the DS which while interested in the idea believed its concept proved confusing for players In response Okano reworked it into a side scrolling platformer where players titled the system to move Pac Man through a series of levels br Galaga D Impact was designed by Sugiyama He also designed the game after the gyro sensor as he believed it was a unique concept for a shooter Early iterations of D Impact were third person shooters that allowed players to view the entirety of their ship which was changed to a first person view to feel more immersive Sugiyama had difficulties with implementing the D effects creating multiple revisions to make objects pop out while also making sure they weren t blurry on the eyes A separate team of programmers worked on the ports of Pac Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions their inclusion was due to neither having received a portable version prior and for being important installments in their respective series The angled monitor display for the original Pac Man and Galaga were inspired by the depth perception of dioramas br Namco Bandai announced Pac Man Galaga Dimensions in February alongside DualPenSports and Ridge Racer D and demonstrated it at E In a preview GameSpot showed interest in the two exclusives and the inclusion of online leaderboards The game was published in Japan on June in North America on July in Australia on August and in Europe on August The Japanese Australian and European versions of Dimensions were published by Namco Bandai while the North American version was published under the original Namco brand name br br br Reception br br According to the review aggregator website Metacritic Pac Man Galaga Dimensions received mixed reviews The game sold units in Japan alone Critics were generally divided by the amount of content included and if it was worth the price While the four reviewers at Famitsu said that Dimensions offered a great deal of games for a good pricepoint Jack DeVries of IGN stated otherwise writing that it is far too high for such a mediocre collection DeVries also criticized the game for being a generally weak collection and for actually a bastardization of two awesome game series br Critics generally agreed that one of the strong points of Dimensions was the inclusion of Pac Man Championship Edition and Galaga Legions DeVries said that the games were entertaining and almost a reason to buy the collection However he also argued that they should have been downloads on the Nintendo eShop instead Nintendojo s Aaron Roberts believed that both games were great and solid updates to their predecessors Galaga Legions in particular was liked by Kyle Hilliard of GamesRadar but claimed Galaga Legions DX was a better game and that the graphics weren t as well done as those in the Xbox iteration Writing for Nintendo Life Jon Wahlgren listed Championship Edition and Legions as the highlight of the package He stated they were both gripping new spins on their respective elders and would entice console gamers with their action packed gameplay Wahlgren noted that Legions suffered from slowdown when there was too much going on but said it wasn t enough to distract players br The included ports of the original Pac Man and Galaga were also met with mixed reactions Critics unanimously agreed that both games were timeless and still fun to play but that the squashed screen resolution made them difficult to play Nintendo World Report s Andy Goregen commended the D support for making the games much more unique than previous re releases Wahlgren agreed with Goregen and added that the ability to swap between using an upright or tabletop border design would please fans but said the almost comical screen resolution makes them tough to play especially with the D mode DeVries said they both lack an impressive presentation The ports were viewed by Hilliard as being more of a novelty than anything else saying the poor screen resolution and size made these less appealing than players would think br Reviewers were split regarding the two new games Galaga D Impact and Pac Man Tilt While some said they were both fun and great extras others claimed they lacked polish and could have used some definite improvement The reviewers at Famitsu dedicated most of their review to them finding them to be entertaining and solid additions to Dimensions On the contrary DeVries stated they were only noteworthy for the novelty and that in actuality they re boring awkward titles that completely miss why either of these franchises are fun He disliked Tilt for its controls and D Impact for coming off as a shallow clone of Panzer Dragoon GamePro s Ray Barnholt liked Tilt for being a cute interesting platformer and said it made it worth the purchase of Dimensions Furthermore he said D Impact could entertain players but was way too short and felt more like a virtual theme park attraction than a full game Critics agreed that D Impact in particular was hindered by its D effect which made the game hard to play and were ineffective Roberts compared D Impact to the first person segments in Steel Diver and said the exclusives helped increase the attractiveness of the compilation Goregen liked the game s layer of strategy through its multiple weapons but said it suffered from poor D effects Critics also directed attention towards the inclusion of the trailer for Pac Man and the Ghostly Adventures Wahlgren called it utterly bizarre and something that needed to be seen to be believed Overall many critics concluded that Dimensions was an incomplete collection and needed plenty of polish to be of good quality Barnholt told readers that they should instead buy D Classics Xevious if they wanted some classic Namco action in portable form While the game received criticism for its inability to erase high scores a representative of Namco Bandai reached out to publications and confirmed that it was possible via a button code br br br Notes br br br
