Unity is a cross platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies first announced and released in June at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop mobile console augmented reality and virtual reality platforms It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development br The engine can be used to create three dimensional D and two dimensional D games as well as interactive simulations The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film automotive architecture engineering construction and the United States Armed Forces br br br History br The Unity game engine launched in aiming to democratize game development by making it accessible to more developers It was shown at Worldwide Developers Conference by Scott Forstall on Mac OS X The next year Unity was named runner up in the Best Use of Mac OS X Graphics category in Apple Inc s Apple Design Awards Unity was initially released for Mac OS X later adding support for Microsoft Windows and Web browsers br br br Unity br Unity launched in with approximately new features DirectX support was added in The release included an optimized terrain engine for detailed D environments real time dynamic shadows directional lights and spotlights video playback and other features The release also added a version control system to allow developers to collaborate more easily It included a Networking Layer for developers to create multiplayer games based on the User Datagram Protocol offering Network Address Translation State Synchronization and Remote Procedure Calls When Apple launched its App Store in Unity added support for the iPhone Unity released in March added editor support for Windows br br br Unity br Unity launched in September with features expanding the engine s graphics features for desktop computers and video game consoles In addition to Android support Unity featured integration of Illuminate Labs Beast Lightmap tool deferred rendering a built in tree editor native font rendering automatic UV mapping and audio filters among other things In VentureBeat wrote Few companies have contributed as much to the flowing of independently produced games as Unity Technologies More than million developers are using its tools to create gee whiz graphics in their iOS Android console PC and web based games Unity wants to be the engine for multi platform games period A May survey by Game Developer magazine indicated Unity as its top game engine for mobile platforms br br br Unity br In November Unity Technologies delivered Unity This version added DirectX and Adobe Flash support new animation tools called Mecanim and access to the Linux preview br Facebook integrated a software development kit for games using the Unity game engine in This featured tools that allowed tracking advertising campaigns and deep linking where users were directly linked from social media posts to specific portions within games and easy in game image sharing In Facebook developed a new PC gaming platform with Unity Unity provided support for Facebook s gaming platforms and Unity developers could more quickly export and publish games to Facebook br br br Unity br The Verge said of s Unity release Unity started with the goal of making game development universally accessible Unity is a long awaited step towards that future With Unity the engine improved its lighting and audio Through WebGL Unity developers could add their games to compatible Web browsers with no plug ins required for players Unity offered real time global illumination light mapping previews Unity Cloud a new audio system and the Nvidia PhysX physics engine The fifth generation of the Unity engine also introduced Cinematic Image Effects to help make Unity games look less generic Unity began offering an experimental and unsupported Linux editor build in August Unity added new lighting and particle effects updated the engine s overall performance and added native support for Nintendo Switch Facebook Gameroom Google Daydream and the Vulkan graphics API It introduced a K video player capable of running degree videos for virtual reality br However some gamers criticized Unity s accessibility due to the high volume of quickly produced games published on the Steam distribution platform by inexperienced developers Former CEO John Riccitiello said in an interview that he believes this to be a side effect of Unity s success in democratizing game development If I had my way I d like to see million people using Unity although I don t think we re going to get there any time soon I d like to see high school and college kids using it people outside the core industry I think it s sad that most people are consumers of technology and not creators The world s a better place when people know how to create not just consume and that s what we re trying to promote br br br Annual releases br In December Unity Technologies announced that they would change the version numbering system for Unity from sequence based identifiers to year of release to align the versioning with their more frequent release cadence Unity was therefore followed by Unity Unity tools featured a real time graphics rendering engine color grading and worldbuilding live operations analytics and performance reporting Unity underscored Unity Technologies plans beyond video games This included new tools such as Timeline which allowed developers to drag and drop animations into games and Cinemachine a smart camera system within games Unity also integrated Autodesk s DS Max and Maya tools into the Unity engine for a streamlined asset sharing in game iteration process br Unity featured the Scriptable Render Pipeline for developers to create high end graphics This included the High Definition Rendering Pipeline for console and PC experiences and the Lightweight Rendering Pipeline later renamed to the Universal Render Pipeline for mobile virtual reality and augmented reality Unity also included machine learning tools such as Imitation Learning whereby games learn from real player habits support for Magic Leap and templates for new developers br The C source code of Unity was published under a reference only license in March which prohibits reuse and modification br As of software built with Unity s game engine was running on more than billion devices According to Unity apps made with their game engine account for percent of all mobile games and are downloaded more than billion times per month and approximately new projects are started daily with its software Financial Times reported that Unity s engine powers some of the world s most lucrative mobile games such as Pok mon Go and Activision s Call of Duty Mobile br In June Unity introduced the Mixed and Augmented Reality Studio MARS which provides developers with additional functionality for rules based generation of augmented reality AR applications Unity released Unity Forma an automotive and retail solution tool on December br In June Unity announced the Unity Editor will support Apple Silicon The first beta version shipped later that year br Unity brought multiple new features such as Bolt Unity s Visual Scripting system a new multiplayer library to support multiplayer games improved Il cpp runtime performance Volumetric clouds for the High Definition Render pipeline Shadow caching and Screen Space Global Illumination for HDRP For the Universal Render Pipeline it added new features such as point light shadows Deferred renderer and general core engine improvements and fixes Full Apple Silicon support was also added in Unity Unity Hub support for Apple Silicon editors arrived in version in January br Changes to Unity were intended to improve productivity by reducing the time required to enter play mode and import files and implementing visual search queries and multi selection in the package manager For D projects changes focused on accelerating core software import animation and physics Sprite atlasing was revised Support for PSD extension files and layer management were added to the D PSD Importer and Delaunay tessellation for D physics was added br br br Unity br On November Unity announced that the next version of the engine would be called Unity reverting to the previous version numbering convention Unity is planned for release in with planned features including new generative AI tools called Unity Muse and Unity Sentis Unity also makes use of the revised licensing agreement including the runtime fee br br br Features br Unity gives users the ability to create games and experiences in both D and D and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C using Mono for both the Unity editor in the form of plugins and games themselves as well as drag and drop functionality Prior to C being the primary programming language used for the engine it previously supported Boo which was removed with the release of Unity and a Boo based implementation of JavaScript called UnityScript which was deprecated in August after the release of Unity in favor of C br Within D games Unity allows importation of sprites and an advanced D world renderer For D games Unity allows specification of texture compression mipmaps and resolution settings for each platform that the game engine supports and provides support for bump mapping reflection mapping parallax mapping screen space ambient occlusion SSAO dynamic shadows using shadow maps render to texture and full screen post processing effects br Two separate render pipelines are available High Definition Render Pipeline HDRP and Universal Render Pipeline URP previously LWRP in addition to the legacy built in pipeline All three render pipelines are incompatible with each other Unity offers a tool to upgrade shaders using the legacy renderer to URP or HDRP br Creators can develop and sell user generated assets to other game makers via the Unity Asset Store This includes D and D assets and environments for developers to buy and sell Unity Asset Store launched in By there had been approximately million downloads through the digital store br br br Supported platforms br Unity is a cross platform engine The Unity editor is supported on Windows macOS and the Linux platform while the engine itself currently supports building games for more than different platforms including mobile desktop consoles and virtual reality Unity LTS officially supports the following platforms br br Mobile platforms iOS Android Android TV tvOS br Desktop platforms Windows Universal Windows Platform Mac Linux br Web platform WebGL br Console platforms PlayStation PlayStation Xbox One Xbox Series X S Nintendo Switch br Virtual Extended reality platforms Oculus PlayStation VR Google s ARCore Apple s ARKit Windows Mixed Reality HoloLens Magic Leap and via Unity XR SDK Steam VR Google Cardboard br Formerly supported platforms are Wii Wii U PlayStation Xbox Tizen PlayStation Vita DS BlackBerry Windows Phone Samsung Smart TV Gear VR Daydream Vuforia Facebook Gameroom and Stadia Unity formerly supported other platforms including its own Unity Web Player a Web browser plugin However it was deprecated in favor of WebGL Since version Unity has been offering its WebGL bundle compiled to JavaScript using a stage language translator C to C and finally to JavaScript br Unity was the default software development kit SDK used for Nintendo s Wii U video game console with a free copy included by Nintendo with each Wii U developer license Unity Technologies called this bundling of a third party SDK an industry first br In August Unity China announced that it would soon launch a Chinese edition called Tuanjie Engine Chinese pinyin Tu nji Y nq ng based on Unity LTS which includes support for Chinese platforms like Weixin Mini Game OpenHarmony and AliOS br br br Licensing br During its first ten years as a product the paid versions of Unity were sold outright in the corporation changed to a subscription model Unity has free and paid licensing options The free license is for personal use or smaller companies generating less than annually later raised to and the subscriptions are based on revenues generated by the games using Unity The subscription based versions also include additional features geared towards professional projects including analytics performance analysis and error reporting and Cloud Build among others br The paid option Unity Pro had been required for developers that had over in annual revenue but this also could have been provided for console developers through a Preferred Platform License from the console manufacturer The Unity Pro keys would have been part of the other SDK from the console manufacturer that the developer paid for In May Unity released Unity Plus a mid range tier between Personal and Pro that provides tools and benefits oriented towards first time commercial developers br In June Unity changed its licensing terms to require any developer making games on the closed console systems PlayStation Nintendo Switch and Xbox regardless of revenue to have a Unity Pro license or a Preferred Platform License Key from the manufacturers Sony and Nintendo provide this as part of the SDK but Microsoft had yet to implement this functionality for their SDK The engine source code is licensed on a per case basis via special arrangements br br br Runtime fee reception br On September Unity announced that use of the engine would become subject to royalties referred to as a runtime fee beginning in January calculated per installation and charged monthly if the product reaches specific revenue and lifetime installation thresholds Unity states that monetizing the runtime in this manner is required to allow creators to keep the ongoing financial gains from player engagement br The new terms faced criticism from game developers who had been using Unity for years particularly regarding how this fee would be calculated and enforced and the implications for demos freemium games and bundles distributed for charitable causes The change was considered to be contradictory to statements made by former CEO John Riccitiello in when Unity originally announced its shift to free and subscription based models stating that all users would get the full power of Unity for free and that there would not be royalties in contrast to Unreal Engine which had recently switched to free distribution but with royalties paid above a specific revenue threshold br Unity subsequently issued a statement clarifying the definition of a chargeable installation and announced that the fee would not apply to charity games or bundles Many indie developers including Among Us developer Innersloth and Slay the Spire developer Mega Crit announced that they would switch to other game engines br An analysis by Ars Technica found that several older versions of Unity s terms of service would allow developers to continue to release their software without having to pay the new fee as long as they did not update their project after the January date Ars Technica also discovered that Unity had apparently removed a GitHub repository that permitted developers to track changes in Unity s terms of service Mega Crit accused Unity of having done so to apply their new financial model to games retroactively An analysis by Game Developer came to the conclusion that the changes were intended to encourage games with large install bases such as Genshin Impact Subway Surfers and Hearthstone to migrate to Unity services in order to get a fee reduction The article noted that the Operate Solutions division handling in app purchase services for example was far more profitable than the Create division and added that The many indie developers who will be left by the roadside are completely incidental to Unity s goals and are not going to be a significant factor in its future decision making Gameindustry biz described the move as self combustion and identified the changes as an example of enshittification br In response to this negative feedback Unity Technologies introduced revised runtime fee terms on September These included removing any fees for uses of Unity Personal for projects funded up to an increase from the previous threshold fees would only apply to games developed with Unity and beyond without any retroactive fees and the fee would be based on the lesser of of monthly revenue or a calculated value based on monthly engagements both which rely only on self reporting of these numbers br br br Usage br br br Video games br The engine is used in games including Pok mon Go Monument Valley Call of Duty Mobile Beat Saber and Cuphead according to the Financial Times in Some early commercial games in include Splume Flashbang Studios Magical Flying Pink Pony Game Starscene Software and Global Conflicts Palestine Serious Games Interactive br As of Unity had been used to create approximately half of the mobile games on the market and percent of augmented reality and virtual reality content including approximately percent on emerging augmented reality platforms such as Microsoft HoloLens and percent of Samsung Gear VR content Unity technology is the basis for most virtual reality and augmented reality experiences and Fortune said Unity dominates the virtual reality business Unity Machine Learning Agents is open source software whereby the Unity platform connects to machine learning programs including Google s TensorFlow Using trial and error in Unity Machine Learning Agents virtual characters use reinforcement learning to build creative strategies in lifelike virtual landscapes The software is used to develop robots and self driving cars br br br Non gaming industries br In the s Unity Technologies used its game engine to transition into other industries using the real time D platform including film and automotive Unity first experimented in filmmaking with Adam a short film about a robot escaping from prison Later Unity partnered with filmmaker Neill Blomkamp whose Oats Studios used the engine s tools including real time rendering and Cinemachine to create two computer generated short films Adam The Mirror and Adam The Prophet At the Unite Europe conference in Amsterdam Unity focused on filmmaking with Unity s new Cinemachine tool In Disney Television Animation launched three shorts called Baymax Dreams that were created using the Unity engine The Unity engine was also used by Disney to create backgrounds for the film The Lion King br Automakers use Unity s technology to create full scale models of new vehicles in virtual reality build virtual assembly lines and train workers Unity s engine is used by DeepMind an Alphabet Inc company to train artificial intelligence Other uses being pursued by Unity Technologies include architecture engineering and construction br br br Mascot br On December Unity Technologies Japan revealed an official mascot character named Unity chan Yuniti chan real name Kohaku tori tori Kohaku voiced by Asuka Kakumoto The character s associated game data was released in early The character was designed by Unity Technologies Japan designer ntny as an open source heroine character The company allows the use of Unity chan and related characters in secondary projects under certain licenses For example Unity chan appears as a playable character in Runbow br br br
