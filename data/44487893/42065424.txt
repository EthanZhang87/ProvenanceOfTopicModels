executive producer and as a possible candidate direct the film Chris Columbus became involved in the project in May Columbus said he first met Sandler to discuss a possible remake of Hello Ghost and as he left the meeting the director was handed a script for Pixels The script affected Columbus who considered it one of the most original ideas I had seen since the Amblin days and a good opportunity to harken back to the s comedies he worked on Characters from classic arcade games such as Space Invaders Pac Man Frogger Galaga and Donkey Kong among several others were licensed for use in the film

handled by Digital Domain and Sony Pictures Imageworks with nine other VFX companies playing supporting roles all under the leadership of supervisor Matthew Butler and producer Denise Davis Early tests began in October with the majority of the effects work starting after principal photography wrapped in September and finishing by June The video game characters would be built out of boxy voxels to resemble the low resolution pixel based arcades while also emitting light and having raster scan defects in its animation to appear more like they came from a CRT monitor Along with the actual sprite sheets a major inspiration to build the D versions was the cabinet art where Imageworks visual effects supervisor Daniel Kramer considered that was the intention the game creators wanted their technology to be but the technology couldn t live up to creating that The most complex characters to model were Q Bert which interacted the most with humans and had the problem of looking round despite being built out of cubes and Donkey Kong whom the animators wanted to remain recognizable even in different angles br br br Music br The score was composed by Henry Jackman In June Waka Flocka

Salon com Andrew O Hehir called the film another lazy Adam Sandler exercise in s Nostalgia as well as an overwhelmingly sad experience characterized by soul sucking emptiness The Guardian called it casually sexist awkwardly structured bro centric and warned Pity the poor souls who go into the comedy blockbuster thinking they ve signed up to watch The Lego Movie by way of Independence Day They ll be disappointed Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film no stars and wrote Someone please retire Adam Sandler Pixels is the last straw for this has been Every joke is forced every special effect is un special The dipstick Pixels is about as much fun as a joystick and not even half as smart It manages to achieve the weird effect of feeling overlong and choppy at the same time like someone edited the film with a pair of garden shears wrote Randy Cordova in The Arizona Republic br Everything is wrong here wrote Megan Garber in The Atlantic Monthly cinematically creatively maybe even morally Because Pixels is one of those bad movies that isn t just casually bad or shoot the moon bad or too close to the sun bad or actually kind of delightfully bad It is tediously bad It is bafflingly bad It is in its million budget and minute run time wastefully bad Its badness seems to come not from failure in the classic sense a goal set and unachieved but from something much worse laziness Ambivalence A certain strain of cinematic nihilism Peter Sobczynski writing for RogerEbert com called the premise promising but the execution abysmal br Conversely Katie Walsh reviewing for the Chicago Tribune was more positive saying despite its unfortunate shortcomings Pixels has its funny and fresh moments thanks in large part to the supporting comic actors and inventive special effects br br br Accolades br The film was nominated at the Golden Raspberry Awards which distinguishes the worst films of each year br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Pixels
