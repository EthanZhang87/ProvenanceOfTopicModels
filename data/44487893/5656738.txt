id: 5656738
Pac Man is a maze video game developed and published by Atari Inc under official license by Namco and an adaptation of the arcade game Pac Man The player controls the title character who attempts to consume all of the wafers in a maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursue him Eating flashing wafers at the corners of the screen causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue and flee allowing Pac Man to eat them for bonus points Once eaten a ghost is reduced to a pair of eyes which return to the center of the maze to be restored br Programmed by Tod Frye Pac Man took six months to complete Expecting high sales Atari produced over a million copies of the highly anticipated game and held a National Pac Man Day on April to promote its release br It remains the best selling Atari game of all time selling over million copies and was the all time best selling video game for several years Despite its commercial success Pac Man was panned by critics for poor graphics and sound and for bearing little resemblance to the original game It has been considered one of the worst video games ever made and one of the worst arcade game ports released on the system br br br Gameplay br br The player uses a joystick to control Pac Man navigating him through a maze of consumable dashes called video wafers opposed by a quartet of multi colored ghosts The goal of the game is to earn a high score by having Pac Man eat video wafers power pills vitamins and ghosts Every time Pac Man eats all the video wafers in the maze he earns an extra life and a new maze full of wafers A group of ghosts roam the maze trying to eat Pac Man If one touches Pac Man he loses a life The player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of a level Pac Man can be played as a one player game or a two player game with the players alternating turns after Pac Man is eaten by a ghost br Near the corners of the maze are four larger flashing consumables known as Power Pills that turn the ghosts into a blue transparent colour Pac Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn points When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the big square chamber in the center of the maze to respawn The blue ghosts turn pink during the last moments of a Power Pill s effect signaling that they are about to become dangerous again The final consumable items are the Vitamins which appear periodically directly below the nest an award the player with further points br The game has eight variations offering two different starting speeds for Pac Man and four speeds for the ghosts Setting the console s A B difficulty switches can also handicap one or both players If the switch is set to A position the power pills effects do not last as long br br Pac Man for the Atari has various changes from the original game Visual changes include the ghosts not having unique colors and not looking in the direction they are moving in Pac Man now features eyes in the game and only facing side to side as he navigates the maze The game no longers features collectible items such as fruits or the key which are now replaced by the and orange box called the vitamin The game also lacks the cut scenes and sounds from the arcade version br The game has a different maze than the arcade game br There are fewer video wafers and are displayed as thin rectangles instead of dots like in the arcade version The maze in this version of the game is simplified in structure and appearance lacking the rounded edges lacking the more intricate passages of the arcade and changes the escape passages from the sides to the top and bottom of the screen br br br Development br br After Pac Man proved to be a success in the United States Atari decided to license the game and produce it for its Atari console br Programming was assigned to Tod Frye who was not provided with any arcade design specifications to work from and had to figure out how the game worked by playing it He spent hour weeks over six months developing it The finished game uses a KB ROM cartridge chosen for its lower manufacturing costs compared to KB bank switched cartridges which had recently become available As with any contemporary arcade port the simple Atari hardware was a considerable limitation The arcade PAC MAN system board contained KB of main RAM random access memory in which to run the program KB of video RAM to store the screen state and KB of ROM read only memory to store the game code whereas the Atari featured only bytes of RAM memory and none dedicated to video effectively times less RAM The Zilog Z CPU microprocessor used by the Namco Pac Man arcade system is clocked at three times the speed of the MOS CPU in the Atari though the Z typically does less work per clock cycle br To deal with these limitations Frye simplified the maze s intricate pattern of corridors to a more repetitive pattern The small tan pellets in the arcade original were changed to rectangular wafers that shared the wall color on a change necessitated because both the pellets and walls were drawn with the s Playfield graphics which have a fixed width To achieve the visual effect of wafers disappearing as Pac Man eats them the actual map of the maze was updated as the data was written into the Playfield registers excluding those pellets that had been eaten The s Player Missile graphics system sprites was used for the remaining objects the one bit wide Missiles were used to render the flashing power pills and the center of the vitamin Pac Man and ghost characters were implemented using the s two Player objects with one being used for Pac Man and the other being used for all four ghosts with the result that each ghost only appears once out of every four frames which creates a flickering effect This effect takes advantage of the slow phosphorescent fade of CRT monitors and the concept of persistence of vision resulting in the image appearing to linger on screen longer but the flickering remains noticeable and makes each individual ghost s color nearly impossible to discern Frye chose to abandon plans for a flicker management system to minimize the flashing in part because Atari didn t seem to care about that issue in its zeal to have the game released According to Frye his game also did not conform to the arcade game s color scheme in order to comply with Atari s official home product policy that only space type games should feature black backgrounds Another quality impact was his decision that two player gameplay was important which meant that the bytes required to store the current difficulty state of the dots on the current maze remaining lives and the score had to be doubled for a second player consuming of the s meager byte memory which precluded its use for additional game data and features br Oft repeated stories claim that the company wanted to or did release a prototype in order to capitalize on the holiday season however the retail release was a final product Frye states that there were no negative comments within Atari about these elements but after seeing the game Coin Division marketing manager Frank Ballouz reportedly informed Ray Kassar Atari s president and CEO that he felt enthusiasts would not want to play it His opinion however was dismissed The company ran newspaper ads and promoted the product in catalogs describing it as differing slightly from the original br To help sales Atari promoted and protected its exclusive licensing of Pac Man It took legal action against companies that released clones similar to Pac Man Atari sued Philips for its Magnavox Odyssey game K C Munchkin alleging copyright infringement In the landmark case Atari Inc v North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp the Court of Appeals allowed a preliminary injunction against Philips to prevent the sale of Munchkin cartridges However Atari failed to stop other games such as On Line Systems Jawbreaker and Gobbler br Several retailers assisted Atari with the release of the game JCPenney was the first retailer to launch a nationwide advertising campaign on television for a software title Continuing a long standing relationship between it and Sears Atari also produced Pac Man cartridges under the department store s label br br br Reception br br br Sales br Anticipation for the game was high Atari stated in that it had preorders for three or four million copies of the Atari version Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Simon predicted the sale of million units during which would yield a profit of million Pac Man met with initial commercial success more than one million cartridges had been shipped in less than one month helped by Atari s million publicity campaign It was the best selling home video game of with over million cartridges sold that year and over million million adjusted for inflation in gross revenue It replaced Space Invaders as the best selling Atari title and also became the overall best selling video game up until then a title it held for several years until eventually being surpassed by Super Mario Bros Pac Man also propelled Atari VCS sales to million units by Frye reportedly received in royalties per copy br Purchases had slowed by the summer of with unsold copies available in large quantities Atari went on to sell over cartridges in It had sold a cumulative cartridges by and a further units for equivalent to in between and for a total of over million cartridges sold by By the cartridges were still very common among collectors and enthusiasts though the Sears versions were rarer and priced lower br br br Critical response br br At release critics negatively compared the port to its original arcade form panning the audio visuals and gameplay On May Electronic Games Magazine published its first bad review ever for an Atari video game saying Considering the anticipation and considerable time the Atari designers had to work on it it s astonishing to see a home version of a classic arcade contest so devoid of what gave the original its charm Video Magazine admitted it was challenging and there are a few visual pluses before lamenting Unfortunately those who cannot evaluate Pac Man through lover s eyes are likely to be disappointed The premiere issue of Video Games Player from Fall called Pac Man just awful Electronic Games gave the game a rating of four out of ten Video Games Player magazine gave the graphics and sound its lowest rating of C while giving the game an overall B rating Electronic Fun with Computers Games br gave it an overall B rating with a C rating for graphics br In Creative Computing Video Arcade Games reviewer Danny Goodman commented that the game fails as a replica of its arcade form Atari stated clearly in its description of the cartridge that Atari s Pac Man differs slightly from the original That perhaps was an understatement Conversely he stated that such criticism was unfair because the hardware could not properly emulate the arcade game Goodman further said that the port is a challenging maze game in its own right and it would have been a success if fans had not expected to play a game closer to the original That year Phil Wiswell of Video Games criticized the game s poor graphics mockingly referring to it as Flickerman while Softline questioned why Atari opposed Pac Man clones when the version was less like the original than any of the pack of imitators br The game has remained poorly rated Computer and Video Games magazine rated the game in Next Generation magazine editors in called it the worst coin op conversion of all time and attributed the mass dissatisfaction to its poor quality In IGN s Craig Harris echoed similar statements and listed it as the worst arcade conversion citing poor audio visuals that did not resemble the original Another IGN editor Levi Buchanan described it as a disastrous port citing the color scheme and flickering ghosts Skyler Miller of AllGame said that although the game was only a passing resemblance to the original it was charming despite its many differences and faults br Frye did not express regret over his part in Pac Man s port and felt he made the best decisions he could at the time However Frye stated that he would have done things differently with a larger capacity ROM Video game industry researchers Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost attribute the poor reception to the technical differences between the Atari console and the arcade hardware used in Pac Man cabinets They further stated that the conversion is a lesson in maintaining the social and cultural context of the original source Montfort and Bogost commented that players were disappointed with the flickering visual effect which made the ghosts difficult to track and tired the players eyes The two further said that the effect diminishes the ghosts personalities present in the arcade version Chris Kohler of Wired commented that the game was poorly received upon its release and in contemporary times because of the poor quality However he further described the game as an impressive technical achievement given its console s limitations br br br Impact and legacy br br Initially the excitement generated by Pac Man s home release prompted retail stores to expand their inventory to sell video games Drugstores began stocking video game cartridges and toy retailers vied for new releases Kmart and J C Penney competed against Sears to become the largest vendor of video games The game s release also led to an increase in sales of the Atari console br In retrospect however critics often cite Atari s Pac Man as a major factor in the drop of consumer confidence in the company which contributed to the video game crash of Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra stated that the game s poor quality damaged the company s reputation Buchanan commented that it disappointed millions of fans and diminished confidence in Atari s games Former Next Generation editor in chief Neil West attributes his longtime skepticism of Atari s quality to the disappointment he had from buying the game as a child Calling the game the top video game disaster Buchanan credits Pac Man as a factor to the downfall of Atari and the industry in the s Author Steven Kent also blames the game along with Atari s E T the Extra Terrestrial for severely damaging the company s reputation and profitability Montfort and Bogost stated that the game s negative reception seeded mistrust in retailers which was reinforced by later factors that culminated in the crash br On December Atari owner Warner Communications announced that revenue forecasts for were cut from a increase over to a increase Immediately following the announcement the company s stock value dropped by around from to amounting to a loss of billion in the company s market valuation Warner admitted that Pac Man s good sales despite poor quality made Atari overconfident about E T and Raiders of the Lost Ark which did not sell well In the company decreased its workforce by and lost million br In late Atari ported Pac Man to its new console the Atari This version was a more accurate conversion of the original arcade game and was a launch title for the console along with eleven other games br The port was followed by conversions of Pac Man s arcade sequels Ms Pac Man and Jr Pac Man for the Atari These used KB ROM cartridges instead of Pac Man s KB and dispensed with two player games They were better received than Atari s first Pac Man title and addressed many critics complaints of Pac Man br br br
