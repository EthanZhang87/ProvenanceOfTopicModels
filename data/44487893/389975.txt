Frogger is a arcade action game developed by Konami and published by Sega In North America it was distributed by Sega Gremlin The object of the game is to direct five frogs to their homes by dodging traffic on a busy road then crossing a river by jumping on floating logs and alligators br Frogger was positively received as one of the greatest video games ever made It was followed by numerous clones and several home only sequels in the Frogger series The Atari version from Parker Brothers sold million cartridges making it one of the best selling Atari games By million copies of its various home video game incarnations had been sold worldwide br br br Gameplay br The objective of the game is to guide a frog to each of the empty homes at the top of the screen The game starts with three five or seven frogs depending on the machine s settings Losing all frogs is game over The player uses the direction joystick to hop the frog once Frogger is either single player or two players alternating turns br br The frog starts at the bottom of the screen which contains a horizontal road occupied by speeding vehicles such as race cars dune buggies trucks and bulldozers The player must guide the frog between opposing lanes of traffic to avoid becoming roadkill and losing a life After crossing the road a median strip separates the two major parts of the screen The upper half consists of a river with logs alligators and turtles all moving horizontally across the screen in opposite directions By jumping on swiftly moving logs and the backs of alligators and turtles the player can guide the frog to safety The player must avoid snakes otters and the open mouths of alligators A brightly colored female frog is sometimes on a log and may be carried for bonus points The very top of the screen contains five frog homes and at least one is always open and available These sometimes contain bonus insects or deadly alligators br When all five frogs are in their homes the game progresses to the next level with increased difficulty After five levels the difficulty briefly eases and yet again progressively increases after each level The timer gives seconds to guide each frog into one of the homes and resets back to ticks whenever a life is lost or a frog reaches home safely br In Softline stated that Frogger has earned the ominous distinction of being the arcade game with the most ways to die There are many different ways to lose a life illustrated by a skull and crossbones symbol where the frog was including being run over by a road vehicle jumping into the river running into snakes otters or an alligator s jaws sinking while on top of a diving turtle riding a log alligator or turtle off the side of the screen jumping into a home already occupied by a frog or alligator jumping into the side of a home or the bush or running out of time br The opening tune is the first verse of a Japanese children s song called Inu No Omawarisan The Dog Policeman Other Japanese tunes include the themes to the anime series Hana no Ko Lunlun and Rascal the Raccoon The American release has the same opening song plus Yankee Doodle br br br Scoring br Every forward step scores ten points and every frog arriving safely home scores points Ten points are also awarded per each unused second of time Guiding a lady frog home or eating a fly scores points each and when all five frogs reach home to end the level the player earns points A single bonus frog is given at points points is the maximum high score that can be achieved on an original arcade cabinet Players may exceed this score but the game rolls over and only keeps the last digits br br br Release br The game was developed by Konami On July Sega gained the exclusive rights to manufacture the game worldwide

check Gremlin s library of video presentations to see if there was anything worth licensing and she stumbled across Frogger br Thinking the game deserved a chance though being cute she requested a licensing window for playtesting She persuaded executives who denigrated Frogger as a women and kids game by reminding them of Pac Man Sega Gremlin agreed to pay Konami per day for a day licensing
