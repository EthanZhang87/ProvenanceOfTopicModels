The game received downloadable content adding new fighters stages and other content from its release until October br br br Gameplay br br Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a platform fighter for up to eight players in which characters from Nintendo games and third party franchises fight to knock each other out of an arena Each player has a percentage meter which raises as they take damage thus increasing the knockback they take and making them easier to launch in the air and out of the arena Standard battles use one of three victory conditions Timed where players aim to win the most points by defeating opponents within a time limit Stock where players have a set number of lives and aim to be the last player standing and Stamina where players reduce their opponent s health down to zero to defeat them Players can adjust the rules to their liking and save them as presets for future matches br Players can also enable various items which attack enemies or grant them power ups along with Pok Balls and Assist Trophies which respectively summon Pok mon and other non playable characters to assist them in battle In Timed matches certain Assist Trophies can be attacked and defeated to earn points Each character also possesses a powerful Final Smash attack which can be performed either by obtaining a Smash Ball or by filling up a special meter both of which can be toggled on and off The base game features different stages with additional stages being added alongside DLC fighters Stages can be played in alternative Battlefield and Omega forms or toggled to remove stage hazards A new feature called Stage Morph allows players to select two stages that the game alternates between at certain intervals during a match Other tweaks include new icons and gauges for character specific abilities such as Cloud s Limit gauge br In addition to returning modes such as Classic Special Smash and Home Run Contest Ultimate adds new modes These are Smashdown where each character can only be played once Squad Strike where players battle in teams of multiple characters and a tournament mode that allows up to players to battle in playoff brackets br br br Spirits br br Ultimate introduces the Spirits mechanic replacing the collectible trophies from previous games Each of these Spirits based on characters from represented franchises can be used to power up a fighter with unique abilities Players mainly gain Spirits through pre made challenges called Spirit Battles that represent the character the Spirit depicts which are embodied by one or more of the game s fighters and other specific level effects For example the Spirit battle of Rayquaza a flying dragon Pok mon requires players to defeat a large version of Ridley with a similar color palette and wind effects Players are encouraged to strategically choose Spirits based on the level effects in the same example a player would need to equip a Spirit that provides wind resistance or immunity or one that allows them to deal extra damage to a giant opponent A separate mode called the Spirit Board presents a rotating set of Spirit battles for players to gain Spirits from Spirits have a growth and evolution system in which they can be leveled up to become more powerful or converted into Cores to summon new Spirits Certain Spirits will also become an enhanced form upon reaching max level but will return to level Nintendo offers limited timed Spirit events in cross promotion with other games and franchises with the Spirits featured only available to collect during the event Eventually these Spirits make their way into general rotation and can be found on the Spirit Board The local multiplayer mode also allows for the option to use Spirits br br br World of Light br Ultimate features the return of Adventure Mode which was absent in DS Wii U It is now integrated into the Spirits mode with a new story World of Light which prominently uses the game s Spirit mechanics The mode s narrative begins with an evil entity Galeem destroying the Smash Bros world vaporizing almost all of the fighter characters and placing them under his imprisonment only Kirby due to his Warp Star evades this attack Players explore the titular World of Light a new world that Galeem created in the original world s place to rescue captured fighters and Spirits the remnants of other characters physical forms by completing marked Spirit Battles Players can use regained allies and Spirits to overcome certain challenges on the map and defeat Galeem However after Galeem is defeated a new enemy Dharkon emerges after Dharkon s defeat it wages war against Galeem If just Galeem is defeated Dharkon will engulf the world in darkness but if just Dharkon is defeated then Galeem will cover the universe with light However by defeating an equal amount of light and dark Spirits on the final map players are able to challenge and defeat both of them freeing the Spirits from their control and allowing them to return to the real world br br br Additional features br The game supports local multiplayer local wireless with other systems and online play via Wi Fi or LAN connections By defeating players online players

computer only matches in VR or play in a on mode against the computer An update in September added the Home Run Contest mode from previous Smash games br br br Playable characters br br Super Smash Bros Ultimate like other games in the Super Smash Bros series features a crossover cast of fighters from several different Nintendo franchises as well as fighters from series by third party developers such as Konami Sega Capcom Bandai Namco Entertainment Square Enix PlatinumGames Microsoft SNK and Disney The base game features playable fighters consisting of all previous fighters from past entries and newcomers the Inklings from Splatoon Princess Daisy from the Mario series Ridley and Dark Samus from the Metroid series Simon Belmont and Richter Belmont from the Castlevania series Chrom from Fire Emblem Awakening King K Rool from the Donkey Kong series Isabelle from the Animal Crossing series Ken Masters from the Street Fighter series and Incineroar from Pok mon Sun and Moon When starting the game players only have access to the eight starter characters of the original Super Smash Bros and unlock the rest by completing the game s Classic modes playing through World of Light or fighting a certain amount of battles br Certain characters whose movesets are directly based on other characters are now classified as Echo Fighters possessing similar movesets and proportions to the fighters they are based on but with unique animations and gameplay differences On the character selection screen these characters can either be listed individually or stacked with the fighters they are based on Select characters also have alternative skins featuring different genders or sometimes other characters such as Bowser Jr who has the other Koopalings as skins but with identical animations and abilities Several returning characters received updates to their appearances such as Mario having Cappy from Super Mario Odyssey accompanying him and The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild s incarnation of Link replacing the one from Twilight Princess br Additional fighters have been added to the game via post release downloadable content DLC The first of these Piranha Plant from the Mario series was released in January and made available for free to those who purchased and registered the game with a My Nintendo account before the end of that month Additional fighters each coming with a unique stage and related music have been released both individually and as part of two Fighters Pass bundles The first Fighters Pass consisted of five characters Joker from Atlus Persona released in April the Hero from Square Enix s Dragon Quest series released in July Banjo Kazooie from Rare s Banjo Kazooie series released in September Terry Bogard from SNK s Fatal Fury series released in November and Byleth from Fire Emblem Three Houses released in January br The second Fighters Pass titled Fighters Pass Volume consisted of six additional fighters and was the final content planned for Ultimate The first character in this collection Min Min from ARMS was released in June Steve the default player avatar from Mojang Studios Minecraft was released in October Sephiroth the antagonist from Square Enix s Final Fantasy VII was released in December with players able to unlock him a few days early by defeating him in a limited time boss battle known as the Sephiroth Challenge Pyra and Mythra a dual character from Xenoblade Chronicles were released in March Kazuya Mishima from Bandai Namco s Tekken series was released in June Sora from Disney and Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts was the final fighter to be added in October br br br Development br br Super Smash Bros Ultimate was developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd the same studios that developed Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U for the Nintendo Switch with series creator Masahiro Sakurai returning as game director Unlike previous Super Smash Bros games the team was not assembled from the ground up which sped up preparation time The project plan for the game was in the works by December when the DLC for DS and Wii U was in development and finished after it was completed Staff gathering was done soon afterward The development period was shorter compared to previous entries in the series Hatena assisted with the development of some elements and tri Crescendo contributed to programming and design br According to Sakurai producing a Super Smash Bros game for the Switch was the last request that former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata had given him before his death in and he wanted to make the game the best possible product he could to respect him Sakurai sought to include every character from previous games as to not disappoint fans However he knew this would be a complex problem for both development and licensing it would also drastically increase the cost of development The return of Bandai and Sora made it easier for this to happen Sakurai also wanted to adjust character abilities to speed up the game although not to an extent that would alienate players unfamiliar with the series Sakurai knew that Ultimate was a core game for Nintendo and that it had a dedicated player base that he did not want to disappoint and believed that completing this goal was necessary to satisfy them Sakurai was also faced with the decision to either create a completely new game system or build off of pre existing ones he chose to build off pre existing ones because there would only be about a third of the characters he desired in the final game All the returning characters abilities had to be re balanced so they could work in Ultimate Originally gameplay would differ between the Switch s docked and handheld modes but Sakurai scrapped this idea since the system s screen in handheld mode was better than he thought Sakurai believed this would be the only Smash game to have the full roster of returning characters calling the effort to include the characters music stage settings and other elements as unprecedented and cautioned that future games in the series would likely be smaller in scope However he still wanted to add as many fighters as possible through DLC br Voice lines recorded by David Hayter for Snake were re used for Ultimate Xander Mobus who voiced Crazy Hand Master Hand and the announcer in Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U also made a return with new voice clips in addition to reprising his role as Joker from Persona when he was added as DLC The addition of Ridley from Metroid as a playable character had been highly requested within the Super Smash Bros community for some time In Sakurai stated that he knew Ridley was a high demand character but thought that he was impossible to add unless they were able to sacrifice the character s size for balancing purposes So that Ridley could be included in the game Sakurai studied the art of the character and redesigned him so he could stand upright All characters were chosen at the beginning of development except for Incineroar who had not been created yet the team instead left a space open for a Sun and Moon Pok mon The Inklings ink mechanic proved challenging to implement due to its interactions with environments br The team built Ultimate from scratch with new assets and content Localization manager Nate Bihldorff stated that the game significantly upgraded lighting effects and texture rendering from the game engine of the Wii U version The World of Light mode was inspired by Brawl s Subspace Emissary and Sakurai chose to start it with a cataclysmic event because he thought it would leave a greater impact on players The team conceived the Spirits mechanic because they wanted to create an enjoyable single player mode but did not have enough resources to create character models While it did not let them tell stories for individual fighters or create new locations and rules it let them use various characters and assets One part of the team chose Spirits to include in the game and had to thoroughly research them according to Sakurai the Spirits mode was essential for using various franchises br br br Music br Like previous games in the series Ultimate features several well known video game music composers and arrangers providing a mix of original music and rearrangements of various tracks for the represented franchises with over tracks in total New to Ultimate is the tying of tracks to franchises instead of individual stages as well as the ability to create custom playlists to listen to outside the game when the Switch is in handheld mode Sakurai stated that he began contacting composers over a year before release providing them with a database of over a thousand suggested track ideas In addition he allowed them to submit their own personal favorites with those choices being given priority for inclusion While Sakurai oversaw the process and preferred that the music retain the spirit of the original games the direction of them was generally handled by the composers themselves The main theme Lifelight composed by Hideki Sakamoto is the basis of most of the game s original music br br br Downloadable content br As with previous entries Nintendo planned to offer new fighters through DLC however unlike with the DS and Wii U where players could request which characters they wished to see in the game Nintendo chose which characters they would add by November Like the previous title additional Mii costumes were released as paid DLC with certain costumes also adding new music tracks to the game Sakurai believed that despite characters like Joker the first announced DLC fighter not being from games usually associated with Nintendo they were added because they were emblematic of the types of characters they wanted to add to Ultimate He also stated that they bring just a whole different level of fun and enjoyment for players The Piranha Plant was chosen as a DLC character because Sakurai wanted to add diversity to the roster Nintendo met with Rare studio head Craig Duncan at E to discuss the possibility of including Banjo and Kazooie as downloadable content Duncan believing it to be a great opportunity agreed and connected the two development teams for further discussions Sakurai noted that Banjo and Kazooie were the second most requested character for Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U in a Nintendo sanctioned fan vote in and that their addition happened quite easily despite the property being owned by Microsoft through its acquisition of Rare Phil Spencer the head of Xbox stated that negotiating their inclusion was an easy deal to make thanks to Microsoft s strong partnership with Nintendo br The development of Fighters Pass Volume was heavily affected by the COVID pandemic in as due to stay at home orders in Japan Sakurai and his development team had to work remotely According to Daniel Kaplan of Mojang Studios early discussions between Nintendo and Microsoft including Minecraft content in the Super Smash Bros series had begun roughly five years prior to Steve s addition into the game The character s inclusion required the development team to rework every stage in the game to accommodate Steve s gameplay mechanics Sakurai had wanted to include Sora from Kingdom Hearts in the game because he was the top fighter requested for Nintendo DS and Wii U in the fan vote However they initially thought that the legality surrounding the intellectual property with Disney would be insurmountable and originally planned for only five fighters in the second pass However Sakurai met a Disney representative at an award venue which facilitated the start of negotiations for Sora s inclusion Nintendo Disney and Square Enix saw towards including Sora in the game and overseeing all aspects related to his inclusion with several limitations and guidelines they were required to follow The Sora Challenger Pack featured a promotional tie in with the rhythm game Kingdom Hearts Melody of Memory players with Melody of Memory save data on their Nintendo Switch would unlock the music track Dearly Beloved Swing Version br br br Release br br Ultimate was teased during a Nintendo Direct presentation on March under the working title Super Smash Bros with the release year shown to be Nintendo formally announced the game at E revealing that the full roster of characters from past games would be included as well as its release date Demo versions were playable at E in June and at the San Diego Comic Con the following month IGN nominated Ultimate for its Best Game of E award the game won Best Nintendo Switch Game from both IGN and Gamescom Two Nintendo Direct presentations in one on August and another one on November were devoted to the game revealing new characters stages and game modes br Nintendo released Super Smash Bros Ultimate worldwide on December In addition to the standard retail version a special edition containing a Super Smash Bros themed Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and a Switch with a download code was also released An additional special edition contained a pair of Super Smash Bros themed Joy Con as well as a Switch console a Super Smash Bros themed dock and a download code for the game A GameCube controller with the Super Smash Bros Ultimate logo was released on November br One of the game s new additions had the character Mr Game Watch assuming the appearance of a feather and loincloth wearing Native American when using one of his attacks a reference to Fire Attack in which players controlled a cowboy defending his fort from attacking indigenous people Some users on social media saw this as racist leading to Nintendo of America apologizing and removing the animation in an update shortly after release Two weeks before its release a leaked copy of the game was distributed across the internet Nintendo took steps to issue copyright strikes on YouTube videos using data mined content while fans worked to isolate spoilers particularly the World of Light story mode from those that had played the leaked version br br br Reception br br Ultimate received universal acclaim from critics according to the review aggregator platform Metacritic Critics lauded the huge cast of characters and levels new game modes and combining of the best elements from its predecessors French video game website Jeuxvideo com called it the best game in the series praising its features which brilliantly mix gargantuan content with nostalgia Bleacher Report hailed the game s colorful art style faster gameplay and unique stages IGN praised the game s decision to bring back every character from the series as ambitious and excellent The game s massive soundtrack and portable music player were praised by The Verge br However the game s online mode received criticism for its technical performance and matchmaking Many players found significant lag affecting their games even when using wired connections over wireless while the game s matchmaking features did not adhere to players criteria with players frequently playing matches with rule sets they did not choose The matchmaking process was further criticized for making it difficult for friends to join matches over random players and not allowing multiple local players to join in online matches There had been so many complaints on Ultimate s subreddit that the administrators forwarded all complaints to a separate thread Ultimate s World of Light mode also received mixed reviews While some found the single player mode both accessible and challenging others found the mode tedious and excessive br br br Sales br In November Nintendo announced Ultimate was the most pre ordered game for the Switch and in the series The Association for UK
