entered the home console market in with conversions of its arcade games for the MSX and the Nintendo Family Computer Its American division majority acquired Atari Games in before selling a portion of

industry and its advancements in technology Its successor Bandai Namco Entertainment and its subsidiaries continue to use the Namco brand for their video arcades and other entertainment products br br br History br br br Origins and acquisition of Atari Japan br br On June Japanese businessman Masaya Nakamura founded Nakamura Seisakusho Co Ltd in Ikegami Tokyo The son of a shotgun repair business owner Nakamura proved unable to find work in his chosen profession of ship building in the struggling post World War II economy Nakamura established his own company after his father s business saw success with producing pop cork guns Beginning with only US Nakamura spent the money on two hand cranked rocking horses that he installed on the roof garden of a Matsuya department store in Yokohama br The horses were loved by children and turned a decent profit for Nakamura who began expanding his business to cover other smaller locations A business reorganization renamed the company Nakamura Seisakusho Company Ltd The Mitsukoshi department store chain noticed his success in and approached him with the idea of constructing a rooftop amusement space for its store in Nihonbashi Tokyo It consisted of horse rides a picture viewing machine and a goldfish scooping pond with the centerpiece being a moving train named Roadaway Race The space was a hit and lead to Mitsukoshi requesting rooftop amusement parks for all of its stores br Along with Taito Rosen Enterprises and Nihon Goraku Bussan Nakamura Seisakusho became one of Japan s leading amusement companies As the business grew in size it used its clout to purchase amusement machines in bulk from other manufacturers at a discount and then sell them to smaller outlets at full price While its machines sold well Nakamura Seisakusho lacked the manufacturing lines and distribution networks of its competitors which made the production of them longer and more expensive br The company was unable to place its machines inside stores because other manufacturers already had exclusive rights to these locations In response Nakamura Seisakusho opened a production plant in February moving its corporate office to a four story building in ta Tokyo The company secured a deal with Walt Disney Productions to produce children s rides in the likenesses of its characters in addition to those using popular anime characters like Q Taro this move allowed the business to further expand its operations and become a driving force in the Japanese coin op market br Though the manufacturing facility was largely reserved for its Disney and anime rides Nakamura also used it to construct larger more elaborate electro mechanical games The first of these was Torpedo Launcher a submarine warfare shooting gallery later titled Periscope Its other products included Ultraman themed gun games and pinball like games branded with Osomatsu kun characters br The name Namco was introduced in as a brand for several of its machines The company grew to having ten employees which included Nakamura himself It saw continued success with its arcade games which had become commonplace in bowling alleys and grocery stores The company also established a robotics division to produce robots for entertainment centers and festivals such as those that distributed pamphlets ribbon making machines and a robot named Putan that solved pre built mazes br In August American game company Atari began establishing a series of divisions in Asia one of which was named Atari Japan Its president Kenichi Takumi approached Nakamura in early to have his business become the distributor of Atari games across Japan Nakamura already planning global expansion following his company s success agreed to the deal In part due to employee theft Atari Japan was a financial disaster and nearly collapsed in its first few years of operation br When Takumi stopped showing up to work the company was handed to Hideyuki Nakajima a former employee of the Japan Art Paper Company Atari co founder Nolan Bushnell whose company was already struggling in America chose to sell the Japanese division His fixer Ron Gordon was given the task of finding the buyer for Atari Japan After being turned down by Sega and Taito Gordon s offer was accepted by Nakamura for million M though Nakamura informed Bushnell his company was unable to pay the money by the deadline With no other takers for Atari Japan Bushnell ultimately allowed Nakamura to only pay and then a year for three years The acquisition allowed Nakamura Seisakusho to distribute Atari games across Japan and would make it one of the country s largest arcade game companies br The Atari Japan purchase was not an immediate success in part due to the medal game fad of the s While Nakamura Seisakusho saw some success with imports such as Kee Games s Tank the Japanese video game industry s decrease in popularity did not make them as profitable as hoped The market became more viable once restrictions on medal games were imposed by the Japanese government in as Nakamura Seisakusho began returning higher profits its import of Atari s Breakout was so successful that it led to rampant piracy in the industry By the end of the year Nakamura Seisakusho was one of Japan s leading video game companies br br br Galaxian Pac Man and arcade success br br Nakamura Seisakusho changed its corporate name to Namco in June It opened a division in Hong Kong named Namco Enterprises Asia which maintained video arcades and amusement centers As Namco s presence in Japan was steadily rising Nakajima suggested to Nakamura that he open a division in the United States to increase worldwide brand awareness Nakamura agreed to the proposal and on September established Namco America in Sunnyvale California With Nakajima as its president and Satashi Bhutani as vice president Namco America s aim was to import games and license them to companies such as Atari and Bally Manufacturing Namco America would release a few non video arcade games itself such as Shoot Away br As the video game industry prospered in Japan during the s with the release of Taito s Space Invaders Namco turned its attention towards making its own video games While its licensed Atari games were still profitable sales were decreasing and the quality of the hardware used began deteriorating Per the recommendation of company engineer Shigekazu Ishimura the company retrofitted its ta manufacturing facility into a small game division and purchased old stock computers from NEC for employees to study br Namco released Gee Bee its first original game in October Designed by new hire Toru Iwatani it is a video pinball game that incorporates elements from Breakout and similar block breaker clones Though Gee Bee fell short of the company s sales expectations and was unable to compete with games such as Space Invaders it allowed Namco to gain a stronger foothold in the video game market br In Namco published its first major hit Galaxian one of the first video games to incorporate RGB color graphics score bonuses and a tilemap hardware model Galaxian is considered historically important for these innovations and for its mechanics building off those in Space Invaders It was released in North America by Midway Manufacturing the video game division of Bally where it became one of its best selling titles and formed a relationship between Midway and Namco br br The space shooter genre became ubiquitous by the end of the decade with games such as Galaxian and Space Invaders becoming commonplace in Japanese amusement centers As video games often depicted the killing of enemies and shooting of targets the industry possessed a predominately male playerbase Toru Iwatani began work on a maze video game that was targeted primarily towards women with simplistic gameplay and recognizable characters Alongside a small team he created a game named Puck Man where players controlled a character that had to eat dots in an enclosed maze while avoiding four ghosts that pursued them br Iwatani based the gameplay off eating and designed its characters with soft colors and simplistic facial features Puck Man was test marketed in Japan on May and given a wide scale in July It was only a modest success players were more accustom to the shooting gameplay of Galaxian as opposed to Puck Man s visually distinctive characters and gameplay style In North America it was released as Pac Man in November Pac Man s simplicity and abstract characters made it a fixture in popular culture spawning a multi million selling media franchise br Namco regularly released several successful games throughout the early s It published Galaga the follow up to Galaxian in to critical acclaim usurping its predecessor in popularity with its fast paced action and power ups saw the release of Pole Position a racing game that is the first to use a real racetrack the Fuji Speedway and helped laydown the foundations for the racing genre It released Dig Dug the same year a maze chaser that allowed players to create their own mazes br Namco s biggest post Pac Man success was the vertical scrolling shooter Xevious in designed by new hire Masanobu End Xevious s early usage of pre rendered visuals boss fights and a cohesive world made it an astounding success in Japan recording record breaking sales figures that had not been seen since Space Invaders The game s success led to merchandise tournament play and the first video game soundtrack album The same year Namco released Mappy an early side scrolling platformer and the Pole Position sequel Pole Position II br End went on to design The Tower of Druaga a year later a maze game that helped establish the concept for the action role playing game Druaga s design influenced games such as Nintendo s The Legend of Zelda also saw the release of Pac Land a Pac Man themed platform game that paved the way for similar games such as Super Mario Bros and Gaplus a moderately successful update to Galaga The success of Namco s arcade games prompted it to launch its own print publication Namco Community Magazine NG to allow its fans to connect with developers br br br Success with home consoles br br In July Nintendo released the Family Computer a video game console that utilized interchangeable cartridges to play games The console s launch came with ports of some of Nintendo s popular arcade games like Donkey Kong which at the time were considered high quality Though Namco recognized the system s potential to allow consumers to play accurate versions of its games the company chose to hold off on the idea after its ports for platforms such as the Sord M flopped Nakamura suggested that his son in law Shigeichi Ishimura work with a team to reverse engineer and study the Famicom s hardware in the meantime br His team created a conversion of Galaxian with their newfound knowledge of the console s capabilities which exceeded the quality of previous home releases The port was presented to Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi alongside notification that Namco intended to release it with or without Nintendo s approval Namco s demonstration was the impetus for Nintendo s decision to create a licensing program for the console Namco signed a five year royalties contract that included several preferential terms such as the ability to produce its own cartridges br A subsidiary named Namcot was established in to act as Namco s console game division It released its first four titles in September Galaxian Pac Man Xevious and Mappy Xevious sold over million copies and became the Famicom s first killer app Namcot also began releasing games for the MSX a popular Japanese computer Namco s arcade game ports were considered high quality and helped increase sales of the console br Namcot was financially successful and became an important pillar within the company when Namco moved its headquarters to ta Tokyo in it used the profits generated from the Famicom conversion of Xevious to fund its construction the building was nicknamed Xevious as a result The Talking Aid a speech impairment device was part of the company s attempts in venturing into other markets br By the time the Video game crash of concluded in with the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System NES Atari had effectively collapsed After enduring numerous financial difficulties and losing its control in the industry parent Warner Communications sold the company s personal computer and home console divisions to Commodore International founder Jack Tramiel who renamed his company Tramel Technology to Atari Corporation Warner was left with Atari s arcade game and computer software divisions which it renamed Atari Games Namco America purchased a stake in Atari Games on February through its AT Games subsidiary with Warner holding the remaining The acquisition gave Namco the exclusive rights to distribute Atari games in Japan br Nakamura began losing interest and patience in Atari Games not long after the acquisition As he started viewing Atari as a competitor to Namco he was hesitant to pour additional funds and resources into the company Nakamura also disliked having to share ownership with Warner Communications Nakajima grew frustrated with Nakamura s attempts at marketing Atari video games in Japan and had constant disagreements with him over which direction to take the company Viewing the majority acquisition as a failure in Namco America sold of its ownership stake to a group of Atari Games employees led by Nakajima br This prompted Nakajima to resign from Namco America and become president of Atari Games He established Tengen a publisher that challenged Nintendo s licensing restrictions for the NES by selling several unlicensed games which included ports of Namco arcade games Though its selloff made Atari Games an independent entity Namco still held a minority stake in the company and Nakamura retained his position as its board chairman until the middle of br In Japan Namco continued to see expeditious growth It published Pro Baseball Family Stadium for the Famicom which was critically acclaimed and sold over million copies Its sequel Pro Baseball Family Stadium sold an additional two million In Namco entered the restaurant industry by acquiring the Italian Tomato caf chain It also released Sweet Land a popular candy themed prize machine br One of Namco s biggest hits from the era was the racing game Final Lap from It is credited as the first arcade game to allow multiple machines to be connected or linked together to allow for additional players Final Lap was one of the most profitable coin operated games of the era in Japan remaining towards the top of sales charts for the rest of the decade br Namco s continued success in arcades provided its arcade division with the revenue and resources needed to fund its research and development R D departments Among their first creations was the helicopter shooter Metal Hawk in fitted in a motion simulator arcade cabinet Its high development costs prevented it from being massed produced While most of its efforts were commercially unsuccessful Namco grew interested in motion based arcade games and began designing those at a larger scale In Namco became involved in film production when it distributed the film Mirai Ninja in theaters with a tie in video game coinciding with its release br Namco also developed the beat em up Splatterhouse which attracted attention for its fixture on gore and dismemberment and Gator Panic a derivative of Whack a Mole that became a mainstay in Japanese arcades and entertainment centers In early Namco unveiled its System arcade system one of the earliest arcade boards to utilize true D polygonal graphics Nicknamed Polygonizer the company demonstrated its power through the Formula One racer Winning Run br With an arcade cabinet that shook and swayed the player as they drove the game was seen as a breakthrough product in term of programming technique and garnered significant attention from the press Winning Run was commercially successful convincing Namco to continue researching D video game hardware Video arcades under the Namco banner continued opening up in Japan and overseas such as the family friendly Play City Carrot chain br br br Expansion into other markets br Namco saw continued success in the consumer game market as a result of the Famicom boom in the late s By sales of games for the Famicom and NES accounted for of its annual revenue During the same time frame the company s licensing contract with Nintendo expired when Namco attempted to renew its license Nintendo chose to revoke many of the preferential terms it originally possessed Hiroshi Yamauchi insisted that all companies including Namco had to follow the same guidelines br The revocation of Namco s terms enraged Nakamura who announced the company would abandon Nintendo hardware and focus on production of games for competing systems such as the PC Engine Executives resisted the idea fearing it would severely impact the company financially Against Nakamura s protest Namco signed Nintendo s new licensee contract anyway While it continued to produce games for Nintendo hardware most of Namco s quality releases came from the PC Engine and Mega Drive br br In it was reported that Namco was underway with developing its own video game console to compete against companies such as Nintendo and NEC Electronic Gaming Monthly claimed that the system which was nearing completion featured hardware comparable to the then upcoming Nintendo Super Famicom According to company engineer Yutaka Isokawa it was produced to compete against the Mega Drive a bit console by Namco s arcade rival Sega With the console industry being crowded by other competing systems publications were unsure how well it would perform in the market While the console was never released it allowed Namco to familiarize itself with designing home video game hardware br Tadashi Manabe replaced Nakamura as president of Namco on May Manabe who had been the company s representative director since was tasked with strengthening relationships and teamwork ethics of management Two months later the company dissolved its remaining connections with Atari Games when Time Warner reacquired Namco America s remaining stake in Atari Games In return Namco America was given Atari s video arcade management division Atari Operations allowing the company to operate video arcades across the United States Namco began distributing games in North America directly from its US office rather than through Atari br Namco Hometek was established as the home console game

release its games in North America In Japan Namco developed two theme park attractions which were demonstrated at the International Garden and Greenery Exposition Expo Galaxian Project Dragoon a D rail shooter that supported players and a dark ride based on The Tower of Druaga br As part of the company s idea of hyperentertainment video games Namco engineers had drafted ideas for a possible

their competitiveness in the industry br Nakamura and Namco s content development division advisors pushed against the idea as they felt Bandai s corporate model would not blend well with Namco s more agricultural work environment Namco s advisors were also critical of Bandai for focusing on promotion and marketing over quality As Namco s financial state continued to deteriorate Ishimura pressured
