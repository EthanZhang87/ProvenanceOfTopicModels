permanently saved into the game In Trap Team villains are captured using the touch screen instead of using real life traps which the DS portal does not support br The first two games were developed with the Nintendo Wii in mind with the HD versions being ports with slightly enhanced graphics In contrast starting with Swap Force the games were developed for the HD consoles with the Wii version having heavily downgraded graphics In addition Superchargers on Wii and DS was a distinct game titled Superchargers Racing which only included the racing portions Imaginators skipped these two consoles entirely br While portals are typically interchangeable between platforms the Xbox and Xbox One versions of the game require their own portal respectively due to restrictions imposed by Microsoft br The Nintendo Switch version of Imaginators does not use the Portal of Power instead the figures are scanned using the NFC on the game controller Similar to the DS versions of the previous
