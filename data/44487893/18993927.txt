id: 18993927
Popular culture also called mass culture or pop culture is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of practices beliefs artistic output also known as popular art or mass art and objects that are dominant or prevalent in a society at a given point in time Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects The primary driving forces behind popular culture especially when speaking of Western popular cultures are the media mass appeal marketing and capitalism and it is produced by what philosopher Theodor Adorno refers to as the culture industry br Heavily influenced in modern times by mass media this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of people in a given society Therefore popular culture has a way of influencing an individual s attitudes towards certain topics However there are various ways to define pop culture Because of this popular culture is something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts It is generally viewed in contrast to other forms of culture such as folk culture working class culture or high culture and also from different academic perspectives such as psychoanalysis structuralism postmodernism and more The common pop culture categories are entertainment such as film music television literature and video games sports news as in people places in the news politics fashion technology and slang br br br History br br In the past folk culture functioned analogously to the popular culture of the masses and of the nations br The phrase popular culture was coined in the th century or earlier Traditionally popular culture was associated with poor education and with the lower classes as opposed to the official culture and higher education of the upper classes br With the rise of the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates and with the rise of capitalism and industrialization people began to spend more money on entertainment such as commercialised pubs and sports Reading also gained traction Labeling penny dreadfuls the Victorian equivalent of video games The Guardian in described penny fiction as Britain s first taste of mass produced popular culture for the young A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the newly invented railway the first public railway Stockton and Darlington Railway opened in north east England in created both a market for cheap popular literature and the ability for its distribution on a large scale The first penny serials were published in the s to meet the growing demand br The stress on the distinction from official culture became more pronounced towards the end of the th century a usage that became established by the interbellum period br From the end of World War II following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with the connotations of mass culture media culture image culture consumer culture and culture for mass consumption br The abbreviated form pop for popular as in pop music dates from the late s Although the terms pop and popular are in some cases used interchangeably and their meaning partially overlap the term pop is narrower Pop is specific to something containing qualities of mass appeal while popular refers to what has gained popularity regardless of its style br br br Definition br According to author John Storey there are various definitions of popular culture The quantitative definition of culture has the problem that too much high culture e g television dramatizations of Jane Austen is also popular Pop culture is also defined as the culture that is leftover when we have decided what high culture is However many works straddle the boundaries e g William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens Leo Tolstoy and George Orwell br A third definition equates pop culture with mass culture and ideas This is seen as a commercial culture mass produced for mass consumption by mass media From a Western European perspective this may be compared to American culture Alternatively pop culture can be defined as an authentic culture of the people but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the people Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture neo Gramscian hegemony theory sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the resistance of subordinate groups in society and the forces of incorporation operating in the interests of dominant groups in society A postmodernist approach to popular culture would no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture br Storey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the Industrial Revolution Studies of Shakespeare by Weimann Barber or Bristol for example locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in Renaissance popular culture while contemporary practitioners like Dario Fo and John McGrath use popular culture in its Gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions the commedia dell arte for example br Popular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time It forms currents and eddies and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways For example certain currents of pop culture may originate from or diverge into a subculture representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public Important contemporary contributions to understanding what popular culture means have been given by the German researcher Ronald Daus who studies the impact of extra European cultures in North America Asia and especially in Latin America br br br Levels br Within the realm of popular culture there exists an organizational culture From its beginning popular culture has revolved around classes in society and the push back between them Within popular culture there are two levels that have emerged high and low High culture can be described as art and works considered of superior value historically aesthetically and socially Low culture is regarded by some as that of the lower classes historically br br br Folklore br br Adaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture br This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today in a form separate from mass produced popular culture propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media e g in the form of jokes or urban legends With the widespread use of the Internet from the s the distinction between mass media and word of mouth has become blurred br Although the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element communities amongst the public have their own tastes and they may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold Moreover certain beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture may spread by word of mouth and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves br br br Criticism br Popular culture in the West has been critiqued for being a system of commercialism that privileges products selected and mass marketed by the upper class capitalist elite such criticisms are most notable in many Marxist theorists such as Herbert Marcuse Theodor Adorno Max Horkheimer bell hooks Antonio Gramsci Guy Debord Fredric Jameson Terry Eagleton as well as certain postmodern philosophers such as Jean Fran ois Lyotard who has written about the commercialisation of information under capitalism and Jean Baudrillard as well as others br br br The culture industry br br The most influential critiques of popular culture came from Marxist theorists of the Frankfurt School during the twentieth century Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer analyzed the dangers of the culture industry in their influential work the Dialectic of Enlightenment by drawing upon the works of Kant Marx Nietzsche and others Capitalist popular culture as Adorno argued was not an authentic culture of the people but a system of homogenous and standardized products manufactured in the service of capitalist domination by the elite The consumer demand for Hollywood films pop tunes and consumable books is influenced by capitalist industries like Hollywood and the elite who decide which commodities are to be promoted in the media including television and print journalism Adorno wrote The industry bows to the vote it has itself rigged It is the elite who commodify products in accordance with their narrow ideological values and criteria and Adorno argues that the audience becomes accustomed to these formulaic conventions making intellectual contemplation impossible Adorno s work has had a considerable influence on culture studies philosophy and the New Left br Writing in the New Yorker in music critic Alex Ross argued that Adorno s work has a renewed importance in the digital age The pop hegemony is all but complete its superstars dominating the media and wielding the economic might of tycoons Culture appears more monolithic than ever with a few gigantic corporations Google Apple Facebook Amazon presiding over unprecedented monopolies There is much scholarship on how Western entertainment industries strengthen transnational capitalism and reinforce Western cultural dominance Hence rather than being a local culture commercial entertainment is artificially reinforced by transnational media corporations Globalized pop culture can contribute to the homogenization of cultural identities erasing or diluting diverse local traditions and practices in favor of standardized marketable forms of entertainment and consumption br Jack Zipes a professor of German and literature critiqued the mass commercialization and corporate hegemony behind the Harry Potter franchise He argued that the commodities of the culture industry are popular because they are homogenous and obey standard conventions the media then influences the tastes of children In his analysis of Harry Potter s global brand Zipes wrote It must conform to the standards of exception set by the mass media and promoted by the culture industry in general To be a phenomenon means that a person or commodity must conform to the hegemonic groups that determine what makes up a phenomenon br br br Imperialism br br According to John M MacKenzie many products of popular culture have been designed to promote imperialist ideologies and to glorify the British upper classes rather than present a democratic view of the world Although there are many films which do not contain such propaganda there have been many films that promote racism and militarist imperialism br br br Feminist critique br bell hooks an influential feminist argues that commercial commodities and celebrities cannot be symbols of progressiveness when they collaborate with imperialist capitalism and promote ideals of beauty hooks uses Beyonc as an example of a commodity reinforced by capitalist corporations complicit in imperialism and patriarchy br br br Propaganda br br Edward S Herman and Noam Chomsky critiqued the mass media in their work Manufacturing Consent The Political Economy of the Mass Media They argue that mass media is controlled by a powerful hegemonic elite who are motivated by their own interests that determine and manipulate what information is present in the mainstream The mass media is therefore a system of propaganda br br In sum a propaganda approach to media coverage suggests a systematic and highly political dichotomization in news coverage based on serviceability to important domestic power interests This should be observable in dichotomized choices of story and in the volume and quality of coverage such dichotomization in the mass media is massive and systematic not only are choices for publicity and suppression comprehensible in terms of system advantage but the modes of handling favored and inconvenient materials placement tone context fullness of treatment differ in ways that serve political ends br br br Consumerism br br According to the postmodern sociologist Jean Baudrillard the individual is trained into the duty of seeking the relentless maximization of pleasure lest he or she become asocial Therefore enjoyment and fun become indistinguishable from the need to consume Whereas the Frankfurt School believed consumers were passive Baudrillard argued that consumers were trained to consume products in the form of active labor in order to achieve upward social mobility Thus consumers under capitalism are trained to purchase products such as pop albums and consumable fiction in order to signal their devotion to social trends fashions and subcultures Although the consumption may arise from an active choice the choice is still the consequence of a social conditioning that the individual is unconscious of Baudrillard says One is permanently governed by a code whose rules and meaning constraints like those of language are for the most part beyond the grasp of individuals br Jean Baudrillard argued that the vague conception Public Opinion is a subjective and inaccurate illusion for it attributes a sovereignty to consumers that they do not really have In Baudrillard s understanding the products of capitalist popular culture can only give the illusion of rebellion since they are still produced by a system controlled by the powerful Baudrillard stated in an interview critiquing the content and production of The Matrix br br The Matrix paints the picture of a monopolistic superpower like we see today and then collaborates in its refraction Basically its dissemination on a world scale is complicit with the film itself On this point it is worth recalling Marshall McLuhan the medium is the message The message of The Matrix is its own diffusion by an uncontrollable and proliferating contamination br br br Sources br br br Print culture br br With the invention of the printing press in the sixteenth century mass produced cheap books pamphlets and periodicals became widely available to the public With this the transmission of common knowledge and ideas was possible br br br Radio culture br br In the s Nikola Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi created the radiotelegraph allowing for the modern radio to be born This led to the radio being able to influence a more listened to culture with individuals being able to feel like they have a more direct impact This radio culture is vital because it was imperative to advertising and it introduced the commercial br br br Films br br Films and cinema are highly influential to popular culture as films as an art form are what people seem to respond to the most With moving pictures being first captured by Eadweard Muybridge in films have evolved into elements that can be cast into different digital formats spreading to different cultures br The impact of films and cinema are most evident when analyzing in the search of what the films aim to portray Films are used to seek acceptance and understanding of many subjects because of the influence the films carry an example of an early representation of this can be seen in Casablanca the film introduced war subjects to the public after the United States entered World War II and it meant to increase pro war sentiment for the allies Films are a known massive influencer to popular culture yet not all films create a movement that contributes enough to be part of the popular culture that starts movements The content must resonate to most of the public so the knowledge in the material connects with the majority Popular culture is a set of beliefs in trends and entail to change a person s set of ideologies and create social transformation The beliefs are still a trend that change more rapidly in the modern age that carries a continuation of outpouring media and more specifically films The trend does not last but it also carries a different effect based on individuals that can be grouped to generalized groups based on age and education The creation of culture by films is seen in fandoms religions ideologies and movements The culture of film is more evident through social media Social media is an instant source of feedback and creates discussion on films A repeating event that has been set in modern culture within the trend setting phase is the creation of movements in social media platforms to defend a featured subject on a film br Popular culture or mass culture is reached easily with films which are easily shared and reached worldwide br br br Television programs br br A television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast other than a commercial trailer or other content not serving as attraction for viewership br Television programs may be fictional as in comedies and dramas or non fictional as in documentary light entertainment news and reality television They may be topical as in the case of a local newscast and some made for television movies or historical as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series They can be primarily instructional or educational or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows br br br Music br br Popular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or folk music Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music although since the beginning of the recording industry it is also disseminated through recordings Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally or to smaller local audiences br br br Sports br br Sports include all forms of competitive physical activity or games which through casual or organised participation aim to use maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and in some cases entertainment for spectators br br br Corporate branding br br Corporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity

in time As celebrities online identities are extremely important in order to create a brand to line up sponsorships jobs and opportunities As influencers micro celebrities and users constantly need to find new ways to be unique or stay updated with trends in order to maintain followers views and likes For example Ellen DeGeneres has created her own personal branding through her talk show The Ellen DeGeneres Show As she developed her brand we can see the branches she created to extend her fan base such as Ellen clothing socks pet beds and more br br br Social media br br Social media is interactive computer mediated technologies that facilitate the creation or sharing of information ideas career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks Social media platforms such as Instagram Facebook Twitter YouTube Pinterest TikTok and Snapchat are the most popular applications used on a daily basis by younger generations Social media tends to be implemented into the daily routine of individuals in our current society Social media is a vital part of our culture as it continues to impact the forms of communication used to connect with those in our communities families or friend groups We often see that terms or slang are used online that is not used in face to face conversations thus adding to a persona users create through the screens of technology For example some individuals respond to situations with a hashtag or emojis br Social media influencers have become trendsetters through their direct engagement with large audiences upending conventional marketing and advertising techniques Consumer purchase choices have been impacted by fashion partnerships sponsored material and outfit ideas offered by influencers Social media has also made fashion more accessible by fostering uniqueness expanding the depiction of trends and facilitating the rise of niche influencers The influencer driven fashion industry nevertheless has also come under fire for encouraging excessive consumerism inflated beauty ideals and labour exploitation br br br Clothing br br The fashion industry has witnessed tremendous rapid and applaudable changes over the years culminating in the production of masterpieces unimaginable in the past decades This dynamic trend has compelled renowned clothing lines such as Christian Dior Louis Vuitton and Balenciaga to intensify research and creative imagination to develop appealing designs that are outstanding and fascinating Fashion has changed from the classical baggy and oversized pieces to trendy and slim fit clothes for both males and females Fashion trends and what has been considered popular have been directly influenced and affected by the environment and the state of the world Dating back to the First and Second World Wars clothing was designed for functionality as well as to be made in the cheapest way possible This was due to collective preparation efforts through the conservation of materials This trend can also be seen throughout the s or the Great Depression era of history Due to the state of the economy clothing yet again faced fundamental changes in shape and function The term utility clothing was coined meaning that fashion had taken a turn to more reserved silhouettes For efficiency handmade clothing became encouraged through government backed campaigns Post war and continuing throughout the s fashion began to take a more individualistic tone Primarily marked by the turbulence of the s and momentous social change younger generations started to develop their own sense of style Catapulting influences of things like different prints or patterns that can still be seen in the present day The future of fashion is promising and is significantly inspired by past trends Despite that influence the fashion industry is moving towards a goal of sustainability This is due to past actions of intense consumerism and fast fashion usage as well as increasing environmental threats The state of the economy continues to have a great effect on fashion as consumers will be looking to make more of an investment in the items that they purchase rather than participating in a constant cycle of buying Sustainability is something that designers are actively pursuing as well Connolly a British menswear brand is just one example of the many who are challenging designers and stylists to revamp and upcycle pieces of clothing from past collections Further the past few decades have seen the reintroduction of old designs which have been revitalized and improvised to fit the current market needs Additionally celebrities and influencers are at the forefront of setting fashion trends through various platforms Clothing will continue to act as an area for personal expression no matter the trends constantly shaped by the world around us br br br Influences br Pop culture has had a lasting influence to the products being released in their time

gramophone both of which allowed for music to be available for purchase to the public rather than access to just the elites Due to the almost nonexistent copyright laws the early s flourished with composers and publishers aiming to make and sell as much music as they could The hub for this activity was a small area of New York known as Tin Pan Alley which quickly became one of the major spots for popular music as the demand grew intensely Technological advances in the s only furthered the success and popularity of the genre The reel to tape recorder was groundbreaking in terms of innovation and served as the baseline for many more transformations this genre and the music industry as a whole will endure Along with the continued innovation of popular music multiple subset genres
