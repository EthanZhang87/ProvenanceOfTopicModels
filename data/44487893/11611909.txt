Pac Man Championship Edition is a maze video game developed and published by Namco Bandai Games for the Xbox It has since appeared on several other platforms including iOS Android and the PlayStation and PlayStation Portable as a PSP mini title available on the PlayStation Store It is an HD reimagining of the original Pac Man arcade game players navigate Pac Man through an enclosed maze eating pellets and avoiding four ghosts that pursue him Clearing an entire side of the maze of dots will cause a fruit item to appear and eating it will cause a new maze to appear on the opposite side br Development of Championship Edition was headed by director Tadashi Iguchi alongside producer Nobutaka Nakajima and designer and the father of Pac Man Toru Iwatani the original creator of Pac Man Championship Edition was the final game he designed Unhappy with earlier attempts to remake Pac Man for removing many of the common elements present in the original the development team focused on taking the original concept and expanding on two core features the game speed and new mazes which they felt would be the best way to modernize it Iguchi was not much of a Pac Man fan spending much of his time thinking about how hardcore Pac Man fans would react to the game s new features and ideas It was chosen to make the game feel like an arcade game due to it being released for the Xbox Live Arcade service br Backed by a large marketing campaign orchestrated by Microsoft and Namco Bandai Pac Man Championship Edition was well received by critics Publications commended the game for successfully translating the classic Pac Man gameplay into a modern format with its gameplay soundtrack and online features also being praised One critic labeled it as the first true sequel to Pac Man since Ms Pac Man However some disliked the lack of a multiplayer mode and for reusing enemy movement patterns in the original It was followed by two sequels Pac Man Championship Edition DX and Pac Man Championship Edition br br br Gameplay br br Like the original Pac Man the basic game play of Pac Man Championship Edition consists entirely of navigating Pac Man through a maze eating dots power pellets and bonus items such as fruits keys and other objects and avoiding the four ghosts that roam the maze as well If Pac Man is caught by a ghost the player loses a life Eating a power pellet causes the ghosts to turn blue allowing Pac Man to eat them and send them back to their home where they re emerge in their original form An extra life is awarded after every points earned br However there are several major differences from its original counterpart making Pac Man C E a faster paced game Each maze is divided into two halves Eating all the dots on one half causes a bonus item to appear on the other side and eating the item causes a new maze to appear on the other half Players can also collect additional power pellets to increase their powered up time and continue earning maximum points for eating ghosts The game speed increases as the player scores points and decreases when they lose a life As opposed to levels the game is played within a certain time limit with players attempting to get the highest score possible br The game features six modes Championship which is the basic five minute mode two ten minute Challenge modes which affect the stage such as increasing power pellet pickups or putting the maze in darkness and three Extra modes one five minute and two ten minute featuring different mazes The game also supports online leader boards br br br Development br The idea for the game that later became Pac Man Championship Edition was conceived following the release of the original Pac Man arcade game for the Xbox Live Arcade online service in Namco Bandai Games producer Nobutaka Nakajima noticed how the classic Pac Man gameplay took place on a tall vertical screen in drastic comparison to the widescreen HD television sets most consumers have alongside its very low resolution old school gameplay With next generation video game consoles posing much more powerful hardware the idea of a modernized remake of Pac Man for HD televisions came into fruition Nakajima became the project s producer assisted by director Tadashi Iguchi and designer Toru Iwatani the original creator of Pac Man Championship Edition was the last game that Iwatani designed When the game was being idealized the development team focused on the question We have all of this new technology and hardware and power What would Pac Man be like taking this technology and putting it to the max br br Nakajima felt that most remakes and sequels to Pac Man stray too far from what he considered the fundamentals of what made Pac Man so great With Championship Edition he went back to the roots of the original to expand on its concept while still keeping the game s core mechanics intact Iwatani wanted the game to keep the simplicity of Pac Man as he felt that is what made the game fun and compelling When the development team was discussing with Iwatani about the idea of the game Namco Bandai was approached by Microsoft about a crossover promotional event centered around Pac Man with this in mind the team focused on making the idea of players playing together a focal point for the game wanting it to be full of excitement and action br Iguchi claimed that the original Pac Man was a success because of its compelling gameplay experience and said that trying to improve on it was a difficult task A total of twenty different ideas were proposed only one of which was approved by Iwatani and became the basis for the game With the original Pac Man having already been done well in terms of its gameplay and design Iguchi and the others stated that the only mechanics that could really be changed were the maze design and the speed of the game itself The staff targeted those ideas specifically during production and experimented with ways to improve them When an idea was proposed it was incorporated into the game and playtested to make sure if it was fun or interesting Thanks to his background in designing arcade games during his time at Namco specifically Pac Man Arrangement for Namco Classic Collection Vol Iguchi was able to polish the concept to what he envisioned players wanted out of the arcade original Microsoft had additional input on the project requesting that the game have an arcade like feel to it due to them wanting to release the game onto the Xbox Live Arcade service The development team also wanted Championship Edition to be appealing towards more modern players those who had never played Pac Man during its heyday Ideas such as the game increasing in speed as it progressed were added to draw in newer players Iguchi was not much of a Pac Man fan and had to look at the game from the perspective of a hardcore fan of the franchise while working on it br br br Release br br The game was originally released on
