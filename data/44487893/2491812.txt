Retrogaming also known as classic gaming and old school gaming is the playing and collection of obsolete personal computers consoles and video games Usually retrogaming is based upon systems that are outmoded or discontinued although ported retrogaming allows games to be played on modern hardware via ports or compilations It is typically for nostalgia preservation or authenticity A new game could be retro styled such as an RPG with turn based combat and pixel art in isometric camera perspective br Retrogaming has existed since the early years of the video game industry and was popularized with the Internet and emulation technology It is argued that the main reasons players are drawn to retrogames are nostalgia for different eras the idea that older games are more innovative and original and the simplicity of the games br Retrogaming and retrocomputing have been described as preservation activity and as aspects of the remix culture br br br Games br The distinction between retro and modern is heavily debated but it usually coincides with either the shift from D to D games making the fourth the last retro generation and the fifth the first modern the turn of the millennium and the increase in online gaming making the fifth the last retro generation and the sixth the first modern or the switch from analog to digital for audiovisual output and from to aspect ratio making the sixth the last retro generation and the seventh the first modern They can be played on original hardware or in modern emulation br br br Retrogaming methods br With increasing nostalgia and success of retro compilations in the fifth sixth and seventh generations of consoles retrogaming has become a motif in modern games Modern retrogames impose limitations on color palette resolution and memory well below the actual limits of the hardware to mimic the look of old hardware These may be based on a general concept of retro as with Cave Story or an attempt to imitate a specific piece of hardware as with MSX color palette of La Mulana br This concept known as deliberate retro and NosCon gained popularity due part to the independent gaming scene where the short development time was attractive and commercial viability was not a concern Major publishers have embraced modern retrogaming with releases such as Mega Man which mimics NES hardware Retro Game Challenge a compilation of new games on faux NES hardware and Sega s Fantasy Zone II remake which uses emulated System hardware running on PlayStation to create a bit reimagining of the bit original br br br Vintage retrogaming br br Vintage retrogaming can involve collecting original cartridge and disc media and arcade and console hardware which can be expensive and rare Most are priced lower than their original retail prices The popularity of vintage retrogaming has led to counterfeit media which generally lack collectible value During the COVID pandemic prices for vintage hardware began spiking to much higher levels than pre pandemic mostly attributed to the millennial generation pursuing the hobby during the lockdown due to boredom and nostalgia br br br Retrogaming emulation br br Retrogaming may involve older game systems being emulated on modern hardware It bypasses the need to collect older consoles and original games Read only memory ROM files are copied by third parties directly from the original media They are then typically put online through file sharing sites They are often sold as re releases typically in compilations containing multiple games running on emulation software The accessibility of emulation popularized and expanded on retrogaming br br br Ported retrogaming br Ported retrogaming involves original games being converted to native on new systems just as emulation but without original ROM files Ported games are available through official collections console based downloads and plug and play systems Ported retrogaming is comparatively rare since emulation is a much easier and more accurate method br br br Remakes br br Modern retrogaming may be more broadly applied to retro style designs and reimaginings with more modern graphics These enhanced remakes include Pac Man Championship Edition Space Invaders Extreme Super Mega Worm and D Dot Game Heroes Some are based directly upon the enhanced emulation of original games as with Nintendo s NES Remix br br When remakes are created by an individual or a group of enthusiasts without commercial motivation such games sometimes are also called fangames These are often motivated by the phenomenon of abandonware which is the discontinuation of sales and support by the original producers Examples of fan made remakes are King s Quest I Quest for the Crown King s Quest II Romancing the Stones and Freeciv br The nostalgia based revival of past game styles has also been accompanied by the development of the modern chiptune genre of game music Chiptunes are characterized by severe limitations of sound imposed by the author s self restriction to using only the original sound chips from bit or bit games These compositions are featured in many retro style modern games and are popular in the demoscene br br br Re releases br With the new possibility of the online distribution in mid the commercial distribution of older games became feasible as deployment and storage costs dropped significantly we can put something up on Steam a digital distributor deliver it to people all around the world make changes We can take more interesting risks Retail doesn t know how to deal with those games On Steam there s no shelf space restriction It s great because they re a bunch of old orphaned games br A digital distributor specialized in bringing older games out of abandonware is GOG com formerly called Good Old Games who started to search for copyright holders of older games to re release them legally and DRM free Other companies have also been established to rerelease retro games including Limited Run Games and iam bit br Online platforms for older video games re releases include Nintendo s Virtual Console and Sony s PlayStation Network br Mobile application developers have been purchasing the rights and licensing to re release older arcade games on iOS and Android operating systems Some publishers are creating spinoffs to their older games keeping the core gameplay while adding new features levels and styles of play br br br Plug and play systems br Plug and play systems have been released or licensed by companies such as Atari Sega and Nintendo These systems include stand alone game libraries and plug directly into the user s television br br br Retrogaming community br br The retrogaming market is active with online and physical spaces where retrogames are discussed collected and played br br br Online br Several websites and online forums are devoted to retrogaming The content on these online platforms typically includes reviews of older games interviews with developers fan made content game walkthroughs and message boards for discussions Many gameplay videos posted online feature attempts at breaking speedrun or high score records br br br Fighting games br The competitive Fighting game community comes from arcades such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat Some fighting games have continued to receive arcade releases after the end of the arcade era Face to face competition of Super Street Fighter II Turbo has been featured in the Evolution Championship Series br br br Exhibitions br Events typically include vendors gameplay tournaments costumes and live music The Classic Tetris World Championship has been streamed online to millions of views and recaps have been broadcast on ESPN br br br Museums br Retrogaming is recognized by museums worldwide For example the RetroGames arcade museum of Karlsruhe Germany was founded in and the Computerspielemuseum Berlin was founded in Some classical art museums bear a video gaming retrospective as with s Smithsonian American Art Museum exhibition titled The Art of Video Games or as part of the Museum of Modern Art Applied Design exhibition in Starting in The Strong National Museum of Play adds games annually to the World Video Game Hall of Fame In the first museum dedicated solely to the history of the videogame industry The National Videogame Museum was opened in Frisco Texas br br br Legal issues br An exemption in the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act allows consumers to modify video games they already own to make them playable However the duration of copyright on creative works in most countries is far longer than the era of home computing leading to criticism that software piracy is the only way to preserve some titles In some cases such as No One Lives Forever the rights remain ambiguous preventing legal distribution br Emulators are typically created by third parties and the software they run is often taken directly from the original games and put online for free download While it is completely legal for anyone to create an emulator for any hardware unauthorized distribution of the code for a retro game is an infringement of the game s copyright Some companies have made public statements such as Nintendo stating that the introduction of emulators created to play illegally copied Nintendo software represents the greatest threat to date in the intellectual property rights of video game developers However video game developers and publishers typically ignore emulation One reason for this is that at any given time most of the games illegally distributed for emulation are not presently being sold by the company which owns the game and so the financial damages in a successful lawsuit would likely be negligible br br br Copyright infringement cases br br br Nintendo of America Inc v Tropic Haze LLC No br Nintendo filed a lawsuit in against Tropic Haze claiming Yuzu Tropic Haze s emulator infringed copyright by reverse engineering Nintendo s hardware The settlement included Tropic Haze paying million and halting their emulator projects br br br Nintendo of America Incorporated v Mathias Designs LLC br Nintendo sued
