Pac Man originally called Puck Man in Japan is a maze video game developed and released by Namco for arcades In North America the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America The player controls Pac Man who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts Eating large flashing dots called Power Pellets causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue allowing Pac Man to eat them for bonus points br Game development began in early directed by Toru Iwatani with a nine man team Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men because most video games of the time had themes of war or sports Although the inspiration for the Pac Man character was the image of a pizza with a slice removed Iwatani has said he rounded out the Japanese character for mouth kuchi Japanese The in game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players The original Japanese title of Puck Man was derived from the Japanese phrase paku paku taberu which refers to gobbling something up the title was changed to Pac Man for the North American release br Pac Man was a widespread critical and commercial success leading to several sequels merchandise and two television series as well as a hit single Pac Man Fever by Buckner Garcia The character of Pac Man has become the official mascot of Bandai Namco Entertainment The game remains one of the highest grossing and best selling games generating more than billion in revenue as of and million units in sales combined and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy commonly listed as one of the greatest video games of all time br br br Gameplay br br Pac Man is an action maze chase video game the player controls the eponymous character through an enclosed maze The objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts Blinky red Pinky pink Inky cyan and Clyde orange who pursue Pac Man When Pac Man eats all of the dots the player advances to the next level Levels are indicated by fruit icons at the bottom of the screen In between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac Man and Blinky in humorous comical situations br If Pac Man is caught by a ghost he loses a life the game ends when all lives are lost Each of the four ghosts has its own unique artificial intelligence A I or personality Blinky gives direct chase to Pac Man Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac Man usually by cornering him and Clyde switches between chasing Pac Man and fleeing from him br Placed near the four corners of the maze are large flashing energizers or power pellets When Pac Man eats one the ghosts turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction Pac Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points when a ghost is eaten its eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze where the ghost regenerates and resumes its normal activity Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value After a certain amount of time blue colored ghosts flash white before turning back into their normal forms Eating a certain number of dots in a level causes a bonus item usually a fruit to appear underneath the center box the item can be eaten for bonus points To the sides of the maze are two warp tunnels which allow Pac Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels br The game increases in difficulty as the player progresses the ghosts become faster and the energizers effect decreases in duration eventually disappearing entirely An integer overflow causes the th level to load improperly rendering it impossible to complete This is known as a kill screen br br br Development br After acquiring the struggling Japanese division of Atari in video game developer Namco began producing its own video games in house as opposed to licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan Company president Masaya Nakamura created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several NEC produced microcomputers to potentially create games with One of the first people assigned to this division was a year old employee named Toru Iwatani He created Namco s first video game Gee Bee in which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly growing video game industry He assisted in the production of two sequels Bomb Bee and Cutie Q both released in br br The Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as Space Invaders and Breakout which led to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments For his next project Iwatani chose to create a non violent cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much more family friendly in tone Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time he decided to center his game around eating basing this on women liking to eat desserts and other sweets His game was initially called Pakkuman based on the Japanese onomatopoeia term paku paku taberu referencing the mouth movement of opening and closing in succession br The game that later became Pac Man began development in early and took a year and five months to complete the longest for a video game up to that point Iwatani enlisted the help of nine other Namco employees to assist in production including composer Toshio Kai programmer Shigeo Funaki and hardware engineer Shigeichi Ishimura Care was taken to make the game appeal to a non violent audience particularly women with its usage of simple gameplay and cute attractive character designs When the game was being developed Namco was underway with designing Galaxian which used a then revolutionary RGB color display allowing sprites to use several colors at once instead of using colored strips of cellophane that was commonplace at the time this technological accomplishment allowed Iwatani to greatly enhance his game with bright pastel colors which he felt would help attract players The idea for energizers was a concept Iwatani borrowed from Popeye the Sailor a cartoon character that temporarily acquires superhuman strength after eating a can of spinach it is believed that Iwatani was partly inspired by a Japanese children s story about a creature that protected children from monsters by devouring them Frank Fogleman the co founder of Gremlin Industries believes that the maze chase gameplay of Pac Man was inspired by Sega s Head On a similar arcade game that was popular in Japan br Iwatani has often claimed that the character of Pac Man was designed after the shape of a pizza with a missing slice while he was at lunch in a interview he said that this was only half truth and that the Pac Man character was also based on him rounding out and simplifying the Japanese character kuchi meaning mouth The four ghosts were made to be cute colorful and appealing using bright pastel colors and expressive blue eyes Iwatani had used this idea before in Cutie Q which features similar ghost like characters and decided to incorporate it into Pac Man He was inspired by the television series Casper the Friendly Ghost and the manga Obake no Q Taro Ghosts were chosen as the game s main antagonists because they were used as villainous characters in animation The idea for the fruit bonuses was based on graphics displayed on slot machines which often use symbols such as cherries and bells br Originally Namco president Masaya Nakamura had requested that all of the ghosts be red and thus indistinguishable from one another Iwatani believed that the ghosts should be different colors and he received unanimous support from his colleagues for this idea The ghosts were programmed to have their own distinct personalities so as to keep the game from becoming too boring or impossibly difficult to play Each ghost s name gives a hint to its strategy for tracking down Pac Man Shadow Blinky always chases Pac Man Speedy Pinky tries to get ahead of him Bashful Inky uses a more complicated strategy to zero in on him and Pokey Clyde alternates between chasing him and running away The ghosts Japanese names are chase ambush fickle and playing dumb respectively To break up the tension of constantly being pursued humorous intermissions between Pac Man and Blinky were added The sound effects were among the last things added to the game created by Toshio Kai In a design session Iwatani noisily ate fruit and made gurgling noises to describe to Kai how he wanted the eating effect to sound Upon completion the game was titled Puck Man based on the working title and the titular character s distinct hockey puck like shape br br br Release br Location testing for Puck Man began on May in Shibuya Tokyo to a relatively positive fanfare from players A private showing for the game was done in June followed by a nationwide release in July Eyeing the game s success in Japan Namco initialized plans to bring the game to the international market particularly the United States Before showing the game to distributors Namco America made a number of changes such as altering the names of the ghosts The biggest of these was the game s title executives at Namco were worried that vandals would change the P in Puck Man to an F forming Fuck Man Masaya Nakamura chose to rename it to Pac Man as he felt it was closer to the game s original Japanese title of Pakkuman In Europe the game was released under both titles Pac Man and Puck Man br When Namco presented Pac Man and Rally X to potential distributors at the AMOA tradeshow in November executives believed that Rally X would be the best selling game of that year According to Play Meter magazine both Pac Man and Rally X received mild attention at the show Namco had initially approached Atari to distribute Pac Man but Atari refused the offer Midway Manufacturing subsequently agreed to distribute both Pac Man and Rally X in North America announcing their acquisition of the manufacturing rights on November and releasing them in December br br br Ports br Pac Man was ported to several home video game
