and Flash s co worker at the DMV br br br Production br br br Writing br Development of the film that would come to be called Zootopia began when Byron Howard pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter of which three involved animal characters an all animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers a s themed story about a mad doctor cat who turned children into animals and a bounty hunter pug in space The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney s Robin Hood which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles According to Howard Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world His concept in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals was well received by Lasseter who responded by embracing and lifting Howard in the air like a baby Simba Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the s theme with the animal characters especially the space pug This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas an international spy film centered on an arctic hare named Jack Savage who was somewhat like James Bond It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency br Howard and Bush continued to develop the film with the assistance of the Disney Story Trust the studio s top creative personnel who meet regularly to review and discuss all projects in development The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act set in a city created by and for animals To focus on the all animal city Howard eventually dropped the s setting along with the espionage and international aspects and changed the film into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick For a while the filmmakers were very committed to that version of the story but then in November the filmmakers realized the film s plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde The change in perspective involved dropping several characters including two characters known as The Gerbil Jerks who were described as trust fund gerbils that had nothing better to do than harass Nick br br br Pre production br br In May The Hollywood Reporter initially reported that Howard was directing the film and that Jason Bateman had been cast but little else about the film was known at the time Zootopia was first officially announced on August at the D Expo with a March release date br Research for the film took place in Disney s Animal Kingdom as well as in Kenya and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park where animators spent eight months studying various animals walk cycles as well as fur color Eight hundred thousand forms of mammals were created for and featured in the film To make the characters fur even more realistic they also went to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to closely observe the appearance of fur with a microscope under a variety of lighting The filmmakers drew inspiration for Zootopia s urban design from major cities including New York City San Francisco Las Vegas Paris Shanghai Hong Kong and Bras lia To develop a city that could actually be inhabited by talking mammals ranging in size from two inches cm to feet m and from drastically different climates the filmmakers consulted Americans with Disabilities Act specialists and HVAC system designers For assistance with designing motor vehicles appropriate for so many different types and sizes of mammals the filmmakers consulted with J Mays former chief creative officer of the Ford Motor Company During the development process Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn suggested that Nick should expressly state his disappointment Just when I thought someone actually believed in me after discovering that Judy still fears him as a predator In March it was revealed that Rich Moore Wreck It Ralph had been added as a director of the film in addition to Jared Bush Penn Zero Part Time Hero as co director br br br Animation br Disney s most recent work on animating fur was for the titular character of the film Bolt but the software they had used at the time was not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia Therefore the studio s IT engineers developed the fur controlling software iGroom which gave character designers precise control over the brushing shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal The software was also able to control an unseen imaginary under layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde who each had around million hairs a giraffe with nine million strands of fur a gerbil with strands and a rodent with more strands of hair than the that were on Elsa s head in Frozen br Zootopia was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer which they had first used on Big Hero A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals dense fur Nitro a real time display application developed since the making of Wreck It Ralph was used to make the fur more consistent intact and subtle much more quickly as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character The tree and plant generator Bonsai first used in Frozen was used to make numerous variations of trees with very detailed foliage br Zootopia was produced in makeshift quarters in a giant warehouse in North Hollywood together with Moana while Disney Animation s headquarters in Burbank was being renovated br br br Casting br On May Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring a funny yet heartfelt side with a wily dry witted sort of voice Bateman described his character as a crafty sarcastic schemer remarking on the role s similarity to many other roles he had done since he was He explained that he had said to the directors What kind of voice do you guys want me to do And they just looked at me like I was an idiot and said Just do what you do Just talk br Commenting on the casting of Goodwin Moore said that she brought very centered sweetness tremendous heart and a great sense of humor he described Judy as a little Pollyanna mixed with Furiosa Goodwin stated about her character People mistake kindness for na vet or stupidity and she is a good girl through and through But she s not a dumb bunny br br br Music br br The film s score is composed by Michael Giacchino in his first feature length project for Walt Disney Animation Studios as he previously worked on several short films and television specials produced by the company as well as multiple Pixar films Recording took place from November with an piece orchestra conducted by Tim Simonec In addition to her voice role of

the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critical consensus reads The brilliantly well rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful inclusive message that s as rich and timely as its sumptuously state of the art animation all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained It was the site s second highest rated film of behind Moonlight On Metacritic the film has a score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times considered the movie funny smart and thought provoking Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Zootopia may be the most subversive movie of giving the film three and a half stars out of four and praising its timely message about the harm of prejudice in the face of the prevailing xenophobic political rhetoric at the time of the film s release and the film s humor Peter Debruge at Variety opined that Zootopia plays directly to the studio s strength IGN reviewer Eric Goldman gave the film a out of Amazing score saying Zootopia is a wonderful example of how Disney at its best can mix its past and present together in a very cool compelling way It takes the classic animation trope of animals walking talking and acting like humans but gives it a modern spin both in terms of its humor and animation style and also in its themes which are meaningful and fascinatingly topical br br Writing in British Sunday newspaper The Observer reviewer Mark Kermode Very funny and very likable holiday treat The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours In fact it s a delightfully well orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance versus panic and prejudice An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty If that all sounds overly on message then fear not the jokes are funny the characters engaging and the animation packed with delicious visual detail this is proper family fun with genuine cross generational appeal Hooray br In the UK daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph Robbie Collin noted The lion doesn t just lie down with the lamb they run for City Hall on a joint ticket It s the diversity dream come true Or is it Think Busytown by way of Chinatown It s almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year Collin added Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in Hrs albeit considerably cuter Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman s tremendous vocal work which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop br br Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert com despite generally liking the film three out of four stars had trouble with the film s central metaphor that conflicted with its message Zootopia is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes and not use species ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true in particular the most basic one carnivores eat herbivores because it s in their nature If Zootopia were a bit vaguer or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself it might have been a classic albeit of a very different less reputable sort As is it s a goodhearted handsomely executed film that doesn t add up in the way it wants to br Also in The Daily Telegraph Rosa Prince singled out the film s lead character Judy Hopps as a welcome change for Disney animated feature film heroines such as the Disney Princess franchise She found that unlike those characters focus on romance or family loyalty Hopps focus is on her dream career as a police officer and serving her city br Some were critically divided of the message about universal prejudices of all sorts interpreted as an allegory of American racism Nico Lang of Consequence of Sound felt that Disney delivered a kids version of Crash Others criticized the use of prey and predator species in the allegory while critics at The Root stated positively that the movie acknowledges culpability of systemic racism and white supremacy br br br

against Disney by Esplanade Productions a company owned by Gary L Goldman the co screenwriter of Total Recall The lawsuit claims that Goldman in and pitched a concept to Disney for a live action film titled Looney which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self inspired TV cartoon called Zootopia Disney twice rejected the pitch but Goldman accused the company of copying the name themes settings and character tropes Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film including Nick Wilde Judy Hopps Flash and Chief Bogo A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being ridden with patently false allegations After months of back and forth deliberation between the two parties U S District Judge Michael W Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November As stated in the final review Goldman s effort to make the plots of Looney and Zootopia seem similar were strained All the purported similarities between the two works were themes not plot points or sequences of events that were too general to be protected by copyright law Esplanade appealed to the Ninth Circuit
