Endless runner or infinite runner is a subgenre of platform game in which the player character runs for an infinite amount of time while avoiding obstacles The player s objective is to reach a high score by surviving for as long as possible The method by which the game level or environment appears to continuously spawn before the player is an example of procedural generation The genre exploded on mobile platforms following the success of Doodle Jump Canabalt and Temple Run being other popular examples Its popularity is attributed to its simple gameplay that works well on touchscreen devices br br br Concepts br Endless runners can be side scrolling as in the genre s early titles top down or D but the player is placed in a neverending level in which the character automatically moves forward The player s only form of control is to have the character dodge obstacles either by moving out of the way or using a specific button Some form of points currency or other rewards are gained over time by maneuvering in the level or simply staying alive longer The game progressively increases in difficulty as time goes on The player has a game over if they are hindered enough by the obstacles that they are caught by whatever is chasing them and die br br br History br br br Precursors br The genre has its origins in the vertically scrolling video games of the s primarily racing

scrolling and jumping gameplay of Moon Patrol br The idea of being chased relentlessly by an indestructible obstacle monster or boss to enforce forward progression was greatly influenced by the boulder scene from the film Raiders of the Lost Ark This theme appeared in games like Draconian in which the player must avoid obstacles while being pursued by an invincible giant dragon This would become a recurring theme of endless running gameplay br br br Early development br Atomic Runner Chelnov while also a shooter has many of the hallmarks of a modern runner with forced scrolling and

genre br Doodle Jump April a vertical scroller was one of the first mobile titles to be endless with game only ending when falling to the bottom of the screen or hitting an obstacle It was to pave the way for even more popular titles br The prototypical endless runner building on Doodle Jump s success was Canabalt August an indie game developed by Adam Saltsman in which the player flees from a city being destroyed by giant robots that is procedurally generated and infinite Cannabalt used distance gained as the main scoring system These were both common elements of subsequent runners The D scroller limited movement to leaping and dodging obstacles simply by touching the screen overcoming control limitation of touchscreen devices Adult Swim Games soon asked Saltsman for permission to adapt Canabalt s design into their own title and released Robot Unicorn Attack It became an internet meme due to Adult Swim s larger audience and its quirky themes br Within just months the App Store
