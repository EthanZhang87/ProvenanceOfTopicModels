Super Pac Man is a maze chase arcade game developed and published by Namco It was distributed in North America by Midway and is Namco s take on a sequel to the original Pac Man Midway had previously released Ms Pac Man which Namco had little involvement with Toru Iwatani returns as designer br br br Gameplay br br Sound and gameplay mechanics were altered radically from the first two entries into the Pac Man series instead of eating dots the player is required to eat keys in order to open doors which open up sections of the maze that contain what in earlier games were known as fruits foods such as apples and bananas or other prizes such as Galaxian flagships which are now the basic items that must be cleared Once all the food is eaten the player advances to the next level in which the food is worth more points In earlier levels keys unlock nearby doors while as the player progresses through the levels it is more common for keys to open faraway doors Pac Man can enter the ghost house at any time without a key br In addition to the original power pellets which allow Pac Man to eat the ghosts two Super pellets are available and will turn Pac Man into Super Pac Man for a short time In this form he becomes much larger can move with increased speed when the Super Speed button is held down and has the ability to eat through doors without unlocking them He is also invulnerable to the ghosts who appear thin and flat in order to give the illusion of Super Pac Man flying over them He still cannot eat them without the help of the original power up When Super Pac Man is about to revert to regular Pac Man he flashes white The Super power can then be prolonged by eating a power pellet or super pellet if available br A point bonus can be scored if Pac Man eats a star that appears between the two center boxes while assorted symbols flash inside them Usually one symbol stops while the other continues until the star is eaten a life is lost or too much time elapses If the star is eaten when two symbols match the bonus is points for any match and points if the matching symbols are the same as the level being played Otherwise the bonus is similar to the award for eating a ghost which is or points depending on the level On some versions higher levels might pay out the or points no matter what the symbols are br Bonus levels appear at intervals Here the player is presented with a maze full of food items and must eat them all in order to collect the points on a countdown timer Pac Man appears in Super Mode throughout the stage and there should be no ghosts br
