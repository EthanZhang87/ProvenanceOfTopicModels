id: 16988558
Windows Phone WP was a discontinued mobile operating system developed by Microsoft for smartphones as the replacement successor to Windows Mobile and Zune Windows Phone featured a new user interface derived from the Metro design language Unlike Windows Mobile it was primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market br It was first launched in October with Windows Phone Windows Phone succeeded it in replacing the Windows CE based kernel of Windows Phone with the Windows NT kernel used by the PC versions of Windows and in particular a large amount of internal components from Windows Due to these changes the OS was incompatible with all existing Windows Phone devices although it still supported apps originally developed for Windows Phone In Microsoft released the Windows Phone update which introduced the Cortana virtual assistant and Windows Runtime platform support to create cross platform apps between Windows PCs and Windows Phone br In Microsoft released Windows Mobile which promoted increased integration and unification with its PC counterpart including the ability to connect devices to an external display or docking station to display a PC like interface Although Microsoft dropped the Windows Phone brand at this time in order to focus more on synergies with Windows for PCs it was still a continuation of the Windows Phone line from a technical standpoint and updates were issued for selected Windows Phone devices br While Microsoft s investments in the platform were headlined by a major partnership with Nokia whose Lumia series of smartphones including the Lumia in particular would represent the majority of Windows Phone devices sold by and Microsoft s eventual acquisition of the company s mobile device business for just over US billion which included Nokia s then CEO Stephen Elop joining Microsoft to lead its in house mobile division the duopoly of Android and iPhone remained the dominant platforms for smartphones and interest in Windows Phone from app developers began to diminish by mid decade Microsoft laid off the Microsoft Mobile staff in after having taken a write off of billion on the acquired Nokia hardware assets while market share sank to that year Microsoft began to prioritize software development and integrations with Android and iOS instead and ceased active development of Windows Mobile in br br br History br br br Development br Work on a major Windows Mobile update may have begun as early as under the codename Photon but work moved slowly and the project was ultimately cancelled In Microsoft reorganized the Windows Mobile group and started work on a new mobile operating system The product was to be released in as Windows Phone but several delays prompted Microsoft to develop Windows Mobile as an interim release br Following this Windows Phone was developed quickly One result was that the new OS would not be compatible with Windows Mobile applications Larry Lieberman senior product manager for Microsoft s Mobile Developer Experience told eWeek If we d had more time and resources we may have been able to do something in terms of backward compatibility Lieberman said that Microsoft was attempting to look at the mobile phone market in a new way with the end user in mind as well as the enterprise network Terry Myerson corporate VP of Windows Phone engineering said With the move to capacitive touch screens away from the stylus and the moves to some of the hardware choices we made for the Windows Phone experience we had to break application compatibility with Windows Mobile br From the beginning of Windows Phone until at least Joe Belfiore was the head of development and the face of the platform s initiatives br br br Partnership with Nokia br br On February at a press event in London Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Nokia CEO Stephen Elop announced a partnership between their companies in which Windows Phone would become the primary smartphone operating system for Nokia replacing Symbian The event focused largely on setting up a new global mobile ecosystem suggesting competition with Android and iOS with the words It is now a three horse race Elop stated the reason for choosing Windows Phone over Android saying the single most important word is differentiation Entering the Android environment late we knew we would have a hard time differentiating While Nokia would have had more long term creative control with Android MeeGo as used by Nokia resembles Android more than it does Windows Phone as both Android and MeeGo are based on the Linux kernel Elop enjoyed familiarity with his past company where he had been a top executive br The pair announced integration of Microsoft services with Nokia s own services specifically br br Bing would power search across Nokia devices br integration of Nokia Maps with Bing Maps br integration of Nokia s Ovi store with the Windows Phone Store br The partnership involves funds changing hands for royalties marketing and ad revenue sharing which Microsoft later announced as measured in billions of dollars Jo Harlow whom Elop tapped to run Nokia s smartphone business rearranged her team to match the structure led by Microsoft s VP of Windows Phone Terry Myerson Myerson was quoted as saying I can trust her with what she tells me She uses that same direct and genuine communication to motivate her team br The first Nokia Lumia Windows Phones the Lumia and Lumia were announced in October at Nokia World br At the Consumer Electronics Show in Nokia announced the Lumia featuring a inch AMOLED ClearBlack display a GHz processor and GB of storage The Lumia was one of the first Windows Phones to support LTE and was released on AT T on April An international version launched in Q with a UK launch on May The Lumia was the first Nokia Windows Phone to run the Tango Variant Windows Phone Refresh and was aimed at emerging markets br On September Microsoft announced a deal to acquire Nokia s mobile phone division outright retaining former CEO Stephen Elop as the head of Microsoft s devices operation The merger was completed after regulatory approval in all major markets in April As a result Nokia s hardware division became a subsidiary of Microsoft operating under the name Microsoft Mobile br In February Nokia released the Nokia X series of smartphones later discontinued using a version of Android forked from the Android Open Source Project The operating system was modified Google s software was not included in favour of competing applications and services from Microsoft and Nokia and with a user interface highly modified to resemble Windows Phone br br br Versions br br br Windows Phone br br Windows Phone was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Catalonia Spain on February and released publicly on November in the United States br In Microsoft released Windows Phone Mango The update included a mobile version of Internet Explorer that supports the same web standards and graphical capability as the desktop version multi tasking of third party apps Twitter integration for the People Hub and Windows Live SkyDrive access A minor update released in known as Tango along with other bug fixes lowered the hardware requirements to allow for devices with MHz CPUs and MB of RAM to run Windows Phone br Windows Phone devices can not be upgraded to Windows Phone due to hardware limitations Windows Phone was released as a stopgap update in to include some of the user interface features from Windows Phone br br br Windows Phone br br On October Microsoft released Windows Phone a new generation of the operating system Windows Phone replaced its previously Windows CE based architecture with one based on the Windows NT kernel with many components shared with Windows br br br Windows Phone br br Windows Phone was announced on April after being released in preview form to developers on April New features added include a notification center support for the Internet Explorer web browser with tab syncing among Windows devices separate volume controls and the option to skin and add a third column of live tiles to the Start Screen Starting with this release Microsoft dropped the requirement that all Windows Phone OEMs include a camera button and physical buttons for back Start and Search br Windows Phone introduced Cortana a voice assistant similar to Siri and Google Now Cortana replaced the previous Bing search feature and was released as a beta in the United States in the first half of before expanding to other countries in early br br br Windows Mobile br br Windows Mobile was announced on January as a mobile operating system for smartphones and tablets running on ARM architecture Its primary focus is unification with Windows its PC counterpart in software and services in accordance with this strategy the Windows Phone name has been phased out in favor of branding the platform as an edition of Windows although it is still a continuation of Windows Phone and most Windows Phone devices can be upgraded to the platform br Windows Mobile emphasized software using the Universal Windows Platform UWP which allowed apps to be designed for use across multiple Windows based product families with nearly identical code functionality and adaptations for available input methods When connected to an external display devices could also render a stripped down desktop interface similar to Windows on PCs with support for keyboard and mouse input Windows Mobile featured Skype message integration updated Office Mobile apps notification syncing with other Windows devices support for the Microsoft Edge web browser and other user interface improvements Microsoft developed a middleware known as Windows Bridge to allow iOS Objective C and Android C or Java software to be ported to run on Windows Mobile with limited changes to code br With the diminishing interest and application development for the platform Microsoft discontinued active development of Windows Mobile in and the platform was declared end of life on January br br br Features br br br User interface br Windows Phone features a user interface based on Microsoft s Metro design language and was inspired by the user interface in the Zune HD The home screen called the Start screen is made up of Live Tiles which have been the inspiration for the Windows live tiles Tiles are links to applications features functions and individual items such as contacts web pages applications or media items Users can add rearrange or remove tiles Tiles are dynamic and update in real time for example the tile for an email account would display the number of unread messages or a tile could display a live update of the weather Since Windows Phone live tiles can also be resized to either a small medium or large appearance br Several features of Windows Phone are organized into hubs which combine local and online content via Windows Phone s integration with popular social networks such as Facebook Windows Live and Twitter For example the Pictures hub shows photos captured with the device s camera and the user s Facebook photo albums and the People hub shows contacts aggregated from multiple sources including Windows Live Facebook and Gmail From the hub users can directly comment and like on social network updates The other built in hubs are Xbox Music and Video Xbox Live Games Windows Phone Store and Microsoft Office br Windows Phone uses multi touch technology The default Windows Phone user interface has a dark theme that prolongs battery life on OLED screens as fully black pixels do not emit light Alternatively users may choose a light theme in their phone s settings menu The user may also choose from several accent colors User interface elements such as links buttons and tiles are shown in the user s chosen accent color Third party applications can be automatically themed with these colors Windows Phone introduces transparent tiles and a customizable background image for the Start screen The image is visible through the transparent area of the tiles and features a parallax effect when scrolling which gives an illusion of depth If the user does not pick a background image the tiles render with the accent color of the theme br br br Text input br Users input text by using an on screen virtual keyboard which has a dedicated key for inserting emoticons and features spell checking and word prediction App developers both inhouse and ISV may specify different versions of the virtual keyboard in order to limit users to certain character sets such as numeric characters alone Users may change a word after it has been typed by tapping the word which will invoke a list of similar words Pressing and holding certain keys will reveal similar characters The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in landscape mode Phones may also be made with a hardware keyboard for text input Users can also add accents to letters by holding on an individual letter Windows Phone introduces a new method of typing by swiping through the keyboard without lifting the finger in a manner similar to Swype and SwiftKey br br br Web browser br br Internet Explorer on Windows Phone allows the user to maintain a list of favorite web pages and tiles linking to web pages on the Start screen The browser supports up to tabs which can all load in parallel Other features include multi touch gestures smooth zoom in out animations the ability to save pictures that are on web pages share web pages via email and support for inline search which allows the user to search for a word or phrase in a web page by typing it Tabs are synced with Windows devices using Internet Explorer br br br Contacts br Contacts are organized via the People hub and can be manually entered into contacts or imported from Facebook Windows Live Contacts Twitter LinkedIn Google and Outlook A What s New section shows a user s Facebook news feed and a Pictures section show pictures from those social networks while a Me section within the People hub shows a user s own social network status and wall and allows them to view social network updates Contacts can also be pinned to the Start Screen The contact s Live Tile displays their social network status and profile picture on the homescreen Clicking on a contact s tile or accessing their card within the People hub will reveal their recent social network activity as well as the rest of their contact information br If a contact has information stored on multiple networks users can link the two separate contact accounts allowing the information to be viewed and accessed from a single card As of Windows Phone contacts can also be sorted into Groups Here information from each of the contacts is combined into a single page which can be accessed directly from the Hub or pinned to the Start screen br br br Email br br Windows Phone supports Outlook com Exchange Yahoo Mail and Gmail natively and supports many other services via the POP and IMAP protocols Updates added support for more services such as iCloud and IBM Notes Traveler Contacts and calendars may be synced from these services as well Users can also search through their email by searching in the subject body senders and receivers Emails are shown with threads and multiple email inboxes can be combined into a single view a feature commonly referred to as combined inbox or can viewed separately br br br Multimedia br br Xbox Music and Xbox Video are built in multimedia hubs providing entertainment and synchronization capabilities between PC Windows Phone and other Microsoft products The two hubs were previously combined until standalone apps were released in late shortly before Windows Phone debuted The hubs allow users to access music videos and podcasts stored on the device and links directly to the Xbox Music Store to buy or rent music and the Xbox Video Store to purchase movies and TV episodes Xbox Music also allows the user to stream music with an Xbox Music Pass When browsing the music by a particular artist users are able to view artist biographies and photos The Xbox Music hub also integrates with many other apps that provide video and music services including but not limited to iHeartRadio YouTube and Vevo This hub also includes Smart DJ which compiles a playlist of songs stored on the phone similar to the song or artist selected br The Pictures hub displays the user s Facebook and OneDrive photo albums as well as photos taken with the phone s built in camera Users can also upload photos to social networks comment on photos uploaded by other people and tag photos posted to social networks Multi touch gestures permit zooming in and out of photos br An official file manager app called Files which is available for download from the Windows Phone Store enables users to move and rearrange documents videos music and other files within their device s hard drive or to an external SD card br br br Media support br Windows Phone supports WAV MP WMA AMR AAC MP M A M B and GP G standards The video file formats supported on WP include WMV AVI MP M V GP G and MOV QuickTime standards These supported audio and video formats would be dependent on the codecs contained inside them It has also been previously reported that the DivX and Xvid codecs within the AVI file format are also playable on WP devices br Windows Phone does not support DRM protected media files that are obtained from services other than Xbox Music Pass br The image file formats that are supported include JPG JPEG PNG GIF TIF and Bitmap BMP br Users can also add custom ringtones which are less than MB in size and less than seconds long DLNA streaming and stereoscopic D are also supported br br br Games br br The Games hub provides access to games on a phone along with Xbox Live functionality including the ability for a user to interact with their avatar view and edit their profile see their achievements and view leaderboards and send messages to friends on Xbox Live The hub also features an area for managing invitations and turn notifications in turn based multiplayer games Games are downloaded from Windows Phone Store br br br Search br br Bing is the default search engine on Windows Phone handsets because its functions are deeply integrated in the OS which also include the utilization of its map service for location based searches and queries However Microsoft has stated that other search engine applications can be used br In the area of location based searches Bing Maps which is powered by Nokia s location services provides turn by turn navigation service to Windows Phone users and Local Scout shows interest points such as attractions and restaurants in the nearby area On Nokia devices Nokia s Here Maps is preinstalled in place of Bing Maps br Furthermore Bing Audio allows the user to match a song with its name and Bing Vision allows the user to scan barcodes QR codes and other types of tags br br br Cortana br br Every Windows Phone has either a dedicated physical Search button or an on screen Search button which was previously reserved for a Bing Search app but has been replaced on Windows Phone devices and later in the United Kingdom and United States by Cortana a digital personal assistant which can also double as an app for basic searches br Cortana allows users to do tasks such as set calendar reminders and alarms and recognizes a user s natural voice and can be used to answer questions like current weather conditions sports scores and biographies The app also keeps a Notebook to learn a user s behavior over time and tailor reminders for them Users can edit the Notebook to keep information from Cortana or reveal more about themselves br br br Office suite br br All Windows Phones come preinstalled with Microsoft Office Mobile which provides interoperability between Windows Phone and the desktop version of Microsoft Office Word Mobile Excel Mobile PowerPoint Mobile and SharePoint Workspace Mobile apps are accessible through a single Office Hub and allow most Microsoft Office file formats to be viewed and edited directly on a Windows Phone device The Office Hub can access files from OneDrive and Office as well as files which are stored locally on the device s hard drive Although they are not preinstalled in Windows Phone s Office Hub OneNote Mobile Lync Mobile and OneDrive for Business can be downloaded separately as standalone applications from the Windows Phone Store br br br Multitasking br Multitasking in Windows Phone is invoked through long pressing the back arrow which is present on all Windows Phones Windows Phone uses a card based task switcher whereas later versions of Windows Phone utilize true background multitasking br br br Sync br br br Windows Phone br br Zune Software manages the contents on Windows Phone devices and Windows Phone can wirelessly sync with Zune Software br br br Later versions br br Syncing content between Windows Phone and and Windows PCs or Macs is provided through the Windows Phone App which is available for both Windows and Mac OS X It is the official successor to Zune software only for Windows Phone and Windows Phone and allows users to transfer content such as music videos and documents br Users also have the ability to use a Tap and Send feature that allows for file transfer between Windows phones and NFC compatible devices through NFC br br br Updates br br Software updates are delivered to Windows Phone users via Microsoft Update as is the case with other Windows operating systems Microsoft initially had the intention to directly update any phone running Windows Phone instead of relying on OEMs or wireless carriers but on January Microsoft changed their policy to let carriers decide if an update will be delivered br While Windows Phone users were required to attach their phones to a PC to install updates starting with Windows Phone all updates are done via over the air downloads Since Windows Phone Microsoft has also begun releasing minor updates that add features to a current OS release throughout the year These updates were first labeled General Distribution releases or GDRs but were later rebranded simply as Updates br All third party applications can be updated automatically from the Windows Phone Store br br br Advertising platform br Microsoft has also launched an advertising platform for the Windows Phone platform Microsoft s General Manager for Strategy and Business Development Kostas Mallios said that Windows Phone will be an ad serving machine pushing advertising and brand related content to the user The platform will feature advertising tiles near applications and toast notifications which will bring updating advertising notifications Mallios said that Windows Phone will be able to preserve the brand experience by going directly from the web site right to the application and that Windows Phone enables advertisers to connect with consumers over time Mallios continued you re now able to push information as an advertiser and stay in touch with your customer It s a dynamic relationship that is created and provides for an ongoing dialog with the consumer br br br Bluetooth br Windows Phone supports the following Bluetooth profiles br br Advanced Audio Distribution Profile A DP br Audio Video Remote Control Profile AVRCP br Hands Free Profile HFP br Headset Profile HSP br Phone Book Access Profile PBAP br Bluetooth File Transfer OBEX from Windows Phone br Windows Phone BTF support is available from Windows Phone but is limited to the transferring of pictures music and videos via a Bluetooth Share app br br br Feature additions br Microsoft keeps a site where people can submit and vote on features they would like to see added to Windows Phone br br br Store br br The Windows Phone Store was used to digitally distribute music video content podcasts and third party applications to Windows Phone handsets The store was accessible using the Zune Software client or the Windows Phone Store hub on devices though videos were not downloadable through the store hub and must be downloaded and synced through the Zune software The Store was managed by Microsoft which included an approval process As of March the Windows Phone Store was available in countries br br br Music and videos br Xbox Music offered approximately million songs up to kbit s in DRM free MP format from the big four music groups EMI Warner Music Group Sony BMG and Universal Music Group as well as smaller music labels Xbox Video offered HD movies from Paramount Universal Warner Brothers and other studios and plus television shows from popular television networks br Microsoft offered the Xbox Music Pass music subscription service which allowed subscribers to download an unlimited number of songs for as long as their subscription was active and play them on current Microsoft devices br br br Applications and games br br br Development br Third party applications and games for Windows Phone can be based on XNA a Windows Phone specific version of Silverlight the GUI based Windows Phone App Studio or the Windows Runtime which allows developers to develop an app for both the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store simultaneously App developers can develop apps using C Visual Basic NET NET C CX or HTML JavaScript br For Windows Phone apps to be designed and tested within Visual Studio or Visual Studio Express Microsoft offers Windows Phone Developer Tools which run only on Windows Vista SP and later as an extension Microsoft also offers Expression Blend for Windows Phone for free On November Microsoft announced the Release to web RTW version of its Visual Basic NET Developer Tool to aid development of Windows Phone apps in Visual Basic br Later versions of Windows Phone support the running of managed code through a Common Language Runtime similar to that of the Windows operating system itself as opposed to the NET Compact Framework This along with support for native C and C libraries allows some traditional Windows desktop programs to be easily ported to Windows Phone br br br Submission br Registered Windows Phone and Xbox Live developers can submit and manage their third party applications for the platforms through the App Hub web applications The App Hub provides development tools and support for third party application developers The submitted applications undergo an approval process for verifications and validations to check if they qualify the applications standardization criteria set by Microsoft The cost of the applications that are approved is up to the developer but Microsoft will take of the revenue the other goes to the developer Microsoft will only pay developers once they reach a set sales figure and will withhold tax from non US developers unless they first register with the United States Government s Internal Revenue Service Microsoft only pays developers from a list of thirty countries A yearly fee is also payable for developers wishing to submit apps br In order to get an application to appear in the Windows Phone Store the application must be submitted to Microsoft for approval Microsoft has outlined the content that it will not allow in the applications which includes content that among other things advocates discrimination or hate promotes usage of drugs alcohol or tobacco or includes sexually suggestive material br br br Hardware br br Windows Phone devices were first produced by HTC LG and Samsung These hardware partners were later joined by Acer Alcatel Fujitsu Toshiba Nokia and Chinese OEM ZTE br Windows Phone devices were being produced by HTC Huawei Nokia and Samsung br At the Mobile World Congress Microsoft announced that upcoming Windows Phone devices would be manufactured by Celkon Gionee HTC Huawei JSR Karbonn LG Lenovo Longcheer Micromax Microsoft Mobile Samsung Xolo and ZTE among others Sony under the Xperia or Vaio brand had also stated its intention to produce Windows Phone devices in the near future Yezz announced two smartphones in May and at Computex BYD Compal Pegatron Quanta and Wistron were also named as new Windows Phone OEMs br In August Huawei said it was dropping support for Windows Phone due to low sales br br br Reception br br br User interface br The Metro UI and overall interface of the OS were highly praised for their style with ZDNet noting their originality and fresh clean look Engadget and ZDNet applauded the integration of Facebook into the People Hub as well as other built in capabilities such as Windows Live etc However in version the once tight Facebook and Twitter integration was removed so updates from those social media sites had to be accessed via their respective apps br br br Market share br br br Windows Phone br For the first months market specialists were optimistic about its adoption with IDC forecasting that Windows Phone would surpass the iPhone by br According to Gartner there were million devices running Microsoft OS sold to customers in Q worldwide million smartphones using a Microsoft mobile OS were sold in Q for a market share In Q Microsoft s worldwide market share dropped slightly to In Q market share increased to and it stayed at for Q Reports for Q Q and Q of year include both Windows Phone and small part of Windows Mobile marketshare under the same Microsoft mobile OS banner and do not make the distinction of separating the marketshare values of the two According to Nielsen Windows Phone had a market share in Q and then dropped back to in Q br br br Windows Phone br After the release of Windows Phone Gartner reported that Windows Phone s market share jumped to in Q a increase over the same time period in br In mid IDC had suggested that Windows Phone might surpass the faltering BlackBerry platform and potentially even Apple iOS because of Nokia s dominance in emerging markets like Asia Latin America and Africa as the iPhone was considered too expensive for most of these regions and BlackBerry OS was possibly going to feature a similar fate as Symbian IDC s projections were partially correct as in Q Windows Phone shipments surpassed BlackBerry shipment volume for the first time IDC had to slash the Windows Phone predictions once again to percent of total market in because of the slow growth br As of the third quarter of Gartner reported that Windows Phone holds a worldwide market share of up from the same period in and outpacing Android s rate of growth According to Kantar s October report Windows Phone accounted for of all smartphone sales in Europe and of all sales in the United States Some analysts have attributed this spike in sales to both Windows Phone and Nokia s successful push to market low and mid range Windows Phones like the Lumia and Lumia to a younger audience Gartner reported that Windows Phone market share finished at which while down from the third quarter of was still a improvement from the same period in br IDC reported that Windows Phone market share having peaked in at had dropped to by the second quarter of br In August the New York Police Department ordered Apple iPhone products to replace its deployment of Lumia and Lumia XL Windows Phone devices partly citing Microsoft s end of support for Windows Phone on July and its minuscule market share br br br Developer interest br Microsoft s developer initiative programs and marketing have gained attention from application developers As of Q an average of of mobile developers used the Windows Phone platform with another stating they are interested in adopting it Some reports have indicated that developers may be less interested in developing for Windows Phone because of the lower ad revenue when compared to competing platforms The main criticism of Windows Phone was the lack of applications when compared to iOS and Android This also affected Microsoft s largest partner in the platform Nokia whose vice president showed his frustration at the lack of apps for the platform br A few developers refused to develop apps while preventing third party alternatives A well known example was Snapchat which announced a crackdown on third party apps for its service and its users in November Microsoft was forced to remove third party Snapchat apps including the popular snap from the Windows Phone Store a month later while Snapchat never developed an official app for those users A petition from users requesting an official Snapchat app reached signatures in In addition Google twice blocked Microsoft s own YouTube app for violating its terms of service objecting to the app s ability to download videos and prevent ads The app returned in October but stripped of many features br By Windows Phone was losing share and relevance between and it was reported that developers were backing out of the platform and retiring apps because of the low market share Many high profile apps were discontinued by such as American Airlines NBC Pinterest and others In addition Microsoft itself retired some of its own first party apps br br br See also br Comparison of mobile operating systems br Surface Duo br Telephones portal br br br Notes br br br br
