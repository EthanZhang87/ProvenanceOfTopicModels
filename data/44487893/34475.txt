The ZX is a home computer that was produced by Sinclair Research and manufactured in Dundee Scotland by Timex Corporation It was launched in the United Kingdom in March as the successor to Sinclair s ZX and designed to be a low cost introduction to home computing for the general public It was hugely successful more than million units were sold In the United States it was initially sold as the ZX under licence by Timex Timex later produced its own versions of the ZX the Timex Sinclair and Timex Sinclair Unauthorized ZX clones were produced in several countries br The ZX was designed to be small simple and above all inexpensive with as few components as possible Video output is to a television set rather than a dedicated monitor Programs and data are loaded and saved onto compact audio cassettes It uses only four silicon chips and KB of memory It has no power switch or moving parts with the exception of a VHF TV channel selector switch present in some models It has a pressure sensitive membrane keyboard The ZX s limitations prompted a market in third party peripherals to improve its capabilities Its distinctive case and keyboard brought designer Rick Dickinson a Design Council award br The ZX could be bought by mail order preassembled or for a lower price in kit form It was the first inexpensive mass market home computer to be sold by high street stores led by W H Smith and soon many other retailers The ZX marked the point when computing in Britain became an activity for the general public rather than the preserve of businessmen and electronics hobbyists It produced a huge community of enthusiasts some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX Many went on to have roles in the British computer industry The ZX s commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain s leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company s founder Sir Clive Sinclair br br br Features br The ZX is more flexible than the Spectrum because you can do much more on the screen using relocation techniques Everyone complained about the screen when it first appeared but in fact it was an advantage br br The ZX has a base configuration of KB of on board memory that can officially be expanded externally to KB Its single circuit board is housed inside a wedge shaped plastic case measuring millimetres in wide by millimetres in high The memory is provided by either a single bit or two bit RAM chips There are only three other onboard chips a MHz Z A bit microprocessor from NEC an uncommitted logic array ULA chip from Ferranti and an KB ROM providing a simple Sinclair BASIC interpreter The entire machine weighs just grams oz Early versions of the external RAM cartridge contain KB of memory using an assortment of memory chips while later versions contain KB chips with the lowest addressed kilobyte disabled br The front part of the case is occupied by an integrated key membrane keyboard The keyboard is mechanically very simple consisting of pressure pad switches and diodes under a plastic overlay connected in a matrix of rows and columns br The ZX uses a standard QWERTY keyboard layout displaying graphic and inverse video characters However ZX BASIC commands are not typed in letter by letter instead each key has up to five key functions This is how the user displays the ZX s BASIC keywords functions mathematical operations and graphics br The ZX key s function is determined by a combination of context in the command and mode selection e g SHIFT and FUNCTION keys to select the red keyboard functions For example the P key combines the letter P the character and the BASIC commands PRINT and TAB br Context mode feedback is displayed by the cursor displaying an inverted letter br br K for Keywords br L for Letters br F for Function keys show in red or br G for Graphics characters br The fact that to effect a RUBOUT or backspace delete operation took key presses encouraged ZX programmers to be brief and type carefully when entering text or code br The ZX s primary input output is delivered via four sockets on the left side of the case The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built in RF modulator It can display lines of characters each and by using the selection of block character graphics from the machine s character set offers an effective pixel graphics mode also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands leaving lines free at the bottom Two mm jacks connect the ZX to the EAR output and MIC input sockets of an audio cassette recorder enabling data to be saved or loaded This stores each data bit as a number of pulses followed by an inter bit silence of s Each pulse is a s high then a s low A bit consists of four pulses while a bit is nine pulses so the baud rate varies between bit s for all s and bit s for all s A file with equal amounts of s and s would be stored at bit s B s This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine which has no built in storage capabilities The ZX requires mA of current at V DC delivered via a custom V Sinclair DC power supply br The ULA chip described by the ZX manual as the dogsbody of the system has a number of key functions that competing computers share between multiple chips and integrated circuits These comprise the following br br Synchronising the screen display br Generating a MHz clock from which a MHz clock is derived for the processor br Outputting an audio signal to a cassette recorder in SAVE mode br Processing the incoming cassette audio signal in LOAD mode br Sensing keystrokes br Using memory addresses provided by the CPU to decide when ROM and RAM should be active br Controlling general system timing br The ZX s built in RF modulator can output a video picture to a UHF line television used in the UK Australia and most western European countries France and Luxembourg required a slightly modified version of the machine to match the positive video modulation of CCIR System L sets while the United States and Canada required a different ULA chip and modulator to cope with their line VHF NTSC television systems Both the ZX and its predecessor the ZX have a significant drawback in the way that they handle visual output Neither machine has enough processing power to run at full speed and simultaneously maintain the screen display On the ZX this means that the screen goes blank every time the machine carries out a computation and causes an irritating flicker whenever a shorter computation such as processing a keystroke takes place br br The ZX s designers adopted an improved approach involving the use of two modes called SLOW and FAST respectively In SLOW mode also called compute and display mode the ZX concentrates on driving the display It runs the current program for only about a quarter of the time in effect slowing the machine down fourfold although in practice the speed difference between FAST and SLOW modes depends on what computation is being done In FAST mode processing occurs continuously but the display is abandoned to its own devices equivalent to the ZX s standard operating mode br Another hardware quirk produced one of the most distinctive aspects of the ZX s screen display during loading or saving moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers The interference produces the zigzag stripes br The unexpanded ZX s tiny memory presents a major challenge to programmers Simply displaying a full screen takes up to bytes the system variables take up another bytes and the program input buffer and stacks need more memory on top of that Nonetheless ingenious programmers are able to achieve a surprising amount with just KB One example is the Super Micro Chess Engine by Stefano Marag which includes all of the rules of chess The ZX conserves its memory to a certain extent by representing entire BASIC commands as one byte tokens stored as individual characters in the upper reaches of the machine s unique non ASCII character set br The edge connector or external interface at the rear of the ZX is an extension of the main printed circuit board This provides a set of address control and data lines that can be used to communicate with external devices Enthusiasts and a variety of third party companies make use of this facility to create a wide range of add ons for the ZX br br br Comparisons with other computing devices br The following table provides a comparison between the capabilities of the ZX and various other competing microcomputers that were available in June about the time that the first ZX orders were delivered The prices given are as of June from Your Computer UK br br br History br br br Background br br Clive Sinclair a former radio kit salesman established his first company Sinclair Radionics in The company made its name producing a wide range of cheap electronics aimed at the hobbyist market Its products include amplifiers radios multimeters and other items which were generally sold in kit form to hi fi enthusiasts and other electronics hobbyists The company entered a new market in when it launched the first slimline pocket calculator the Sinclair Executive Radionics followed up by launching a wide range of pocket calculators The company s subsequent expansion made it Europe s biggest calculator manufacturer by br By the late s however Sinclair Radionics was experiencing serious difficulties It lost its ability to compete effectively in the calculator market following the launch of a new generation of Japanese produced calculators with liquid crystal displays which were much more capable and power efficient than Sinclair s LED calculators Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures The company made losses of more than in bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy In July Radionics was rescued by a state agency the National Enterprise Board NEB which recapitalised it provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a stake br Clive Sinclair s relationship with the NEB was fraught due to conflicting notions about which direction the company should go Radionics had begun a project to develop a home computer but the NEB wanted to concentrate on the instrument side of the business which was virtually the only area where Radionics was profitable Sinclair disagreed vehemently with what he characterised as the view that there was no future in consumer electronics This and other disputes led to Sinclair resigning from Radionics in July br While he was struggling with the NEB Clive Sinclair turned to a corporate lifeboat in the shape of an existing corporate shell under his exclusive control a company called Ablesdeal Ltd which he had established in and later renamed Science of Cambridge It became a vehicle through which he could pursue his own projects free of the interference of the NEB Despite his later success in the field Sinclair saw computers as merely a means to an end As he told the Sunday Times in April We only got involved in computers in order to fund the rest of the business specifically the development of the ultimately unsuccessful TV pocket television and C electric vehicle In an interview with Practical Computing Sinclair explained br br I make computers because they are a good market and they are interesting to design I don t feel bad about making them or selling them for money or anything there is a demand for them and they do no harm but I don t think they are going to save the world br br br Precursors the MK and ZX br br By the late s American companies were producing simple home computer kits such as the MITS Altair and IMSAI This aroused interest among electronics hobbyists in the UK but relatively high prices and lower disposable income reduced the appeal of the American products New Scientist stated in that the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain Off the shelf personal computers were also available for the high end of the market but were extremely expensive Olivetti s offering cost and the Commodore PET launched in sold for There was nothing for the hobbyist at the low end of the market Sinclair realised that this provided a useful commercial opportunity br Sinclair s first home computer was the MK which was launched in kit form in June It was a long way from being a mass market product Its very name MK standing for Microcomputer Kit was indicative of its origins as a product developed by and for hobbyists br It had no screen but instead used an LED segment display though Science of Cambridge did produce an add on module allowing it to be hooked up to a UHF TV it had no case consisting of an exposed circuit board it had no built in storage capabilities and only bytes of memory and input was via a key hexadecimal keyboard br Despite the limitations of the machine it sold a respectable units by comparison the much more expensive Apple II had only sold units in the United States a much bigger market in This success convinced Clive Sinclair that there was an untapped market for low cost computers that could profitably be exploited br Sinclair followed up the MK by producing the ZX at the time the world s smallest and cheapest computer which was launched in January costing equivalent to at prices The company conducted no market research whatsoever prior to the launch of the ZX according to Clive Sinclair he simply had a hunch that the general public was sufficiently interested to make such a project feasible and went ahead with ordering sets of parts so that he could launch at high volume br br The ZX s design introduced many key features that were carried over to the ZX as Sinclair himself later said the ZX was very much a stepping stone to the ZX The design was driven entirely by the desired price the machine had to cost less than but still make a healthy profit Its distinctive wedge shaped white case concealing the circuitry and the touch sensitive membrane keyboard were the brainchild of Rick Dickinson a young British industrial designer who had recently been hired by Sinclair As he later recalled of Sinclair s approach Everything was cost driven The design was the face of the machine The unconventional keyboard was the outcome of Sinclair s cost cutting It made use of a sheet of plastic on which the keys were printed overlaying a metallic circuit that registered when a key was pressed This avoided the expense of providing a typewriter style keyboard though the design had many drawbacks when it came to usability and feel br Inside the case there were many more similarities with the ZX Like its successor it used the Z A microprocessor and had only KB of on board RAM It came with a specially written BASIC interpreter on a dedicated ROM chip and could use a television as a display It relied on an ordinary cassette tape recorder for data storage The main difference between the two machines lay in the internal software when the ZX was released ZX owners were able to upgrade by the relatively simple expedient of plugging a new ROM onto the circuit board br The ZX was an immediate success selling units over the following nine months Science of Cambridge was producing ZX s at the rate of a month by the end of and within months of its launch the company had sold units The commercial success of the ZX made a follow up product inevitable The company was renamed Sinclair Computers in November reflecting its new focus and became Sinclair Research in March br br br BBC Micro bid br The launch of the ZX was catalysed in part by the BBC Computer Literacy Project s plan to produce The Computer Programme TV series to be broadcast in aimed at popularising computing and programming The BBC intended to commission an existing manufacturer to provide it with a BBC branded home computer to tie in with the series When Clive Sinclair heard of the project in December he wrote to the BBC informing them that he would be announcing a new version of the ZX to be called the ZX in early It would remedy some of the ZX s deficiencies and would be both cheaper and more advanced Sinclair wanted the ZX to be a candidate for the BBC contract and lobbied for its adoption He pointed out that there were already users of the ZX and that by the time the series was broadcast there were likely to be upwards of ZX users br A prototype ZX was demonstrated to BBC representatives in January while Sinclair s local rival Acorn Computers put forward their proposed Proton computer a design of which a prototype did not yet exist based on the Acorn Atom To Sinclair s dismay the contract to produce the BBC Micro went to Acorn which launched the machine in January Paul Kriwaczek the producer of The Computer Programme explained his reservations in a March interview with Your Computer br br I would have been very reluctant for the BBC to sell something like the Sinclair ZX because it is so limited The Sinclair cannot be expanded it is fundamentally a throw away consumer product Its usefulness lies in learning about programming but I do not believe that the future of computers lies in everyone learning to program in BASIC br Sinclair was critical of the BBC s decision accusing it of incompetence and arrogance Shortly after Acorn won the BBC contract the Government issued a recommended list of computers including the BBC Micro and Research Machines Z that schools could purchase with the aid of a grant for half price Sinclair s computers were not included on the list Sinclair responded by launching his own half price deal offering schools the chance to buy a ZX and KB RAM pack for plus a ZX Printer at half price for a total cost of As the cheapest Government approved system was this was an attractive offer for some schools and about bought Sinclair s package although adopted the BBC Micro br br br Development and manufacture br br The development of the ZX got under way even before the ZX had been launched Sinclair s chief engineer Jim Westwood was given the task of improving the ZX s hardware to reduce the number of components and thus bring down the cost He also sought to fix some of the more annoying problems with the ZX Westwood and his colleagues found that the component count could be reduced greatly by combining eighteen of the ZX s chips into a single uncommitted logic array ULA a type of general purpose chip full of logic gates that were connected up as the customer required during chip manufacture This short lived technology of the day was cheaper and quicker than the design of a customised logic chip which typically required very high volumes to recoup its development cost Ferranti produced the new chip for Sinclair who hailed Westwood s design as a triumph of innovation The ZX had four chips when our nearest competitor in this respect the TRS had Only of the logic gates on the ULA were supposed to be used but Sinclair decided to use them all to squeeze more functions in This resulted in the machine becoming uncomfortably warm during usage Computing folklore held that the ZX had to be refrigerated by balancing a carton of cold milk on top of the case br The ZX s ROM was doubled to KB from the ZX s KB ROM This enabled a fuller implementation of a version of ANSI Minimal BASIC termed Sinclair BASIC by the company Clive Sinclair re commissioned a company called Nine Tiles which had produced the ZX ROM to develop the new ROM software for the ZX The code was written by John Grant the owner of Nine Tiles and Steve Vickers who had joined the company in January Grant concentrated on the software that drove the ZX s hardware while Vickers developed the new BASIC and the accompanying manual Sinclair s brief to the pair was fairly non specific but primarily concerned remedying a key defect of the ZX so that the new machine could be used for practical programming and calculations Vickers later recalled br br As far as Clive was concerned it wasn t a question of what the machine ought to be able to do but more what could be crammed into the machine given the component budget he d set his mind on The only firm brief for the was that the s math package must be improved br The new ROM incorporated trigonometric and floating point functions which its predecessor had lacked the ZX could only deal with whole numbers Grant came up with one of the ZX s more novel features a syntax checker that indicated errors in BASIC code as soon as it was entered rather than as was standard at the time only disclosing coding errors when a program was run Unfortunately for Vickers he introduced a briefly notorious error the so called square root bug that caused the square root of to be returned erroneously as as a result of problems with integrating the ZX Printer code into the ROM Although it was eventually fixed the bug became the subject of controversy and Sinclair was forced to replace some of the ZX s sold to early customers On a more positive note Vickers work on the manual was received favourably being described in as one of the classic texts on BASIC Max Phillips commented in a What Micro retrospective br br It does a reasonable job and sensibly provides lots for the reader to do It s quite honest about the ZX s shortcomings and provides hints and tips for ways round them Best of all the manual is complete and comprehensive There s some fairly advanced and often undisclosed information in there The beginner won t understand it for a long time but if he or she learns some more advanced ideas the manual is ready for them br The task of designing the ZX s case again fell to Rick Dickinson who produced an updated version of the ZX s wedge shaped case This time round the design team were able to use injection moulding which enabled them to deliver a higher quality case Dickinson originally envisaged the ZX as an expandable range of boxes following a vaguely modular approach with a common width though this approach was eventually dropped From start to finish the design process took about six months br br The ZX was launched on March in two versions though with identical components a pre assembled machine or a cheaper kit version which the user could assemble themself Both versions were manufactured in Dundee Scotland by Timex Corporation at the company s Dryburgh factory Timex had not been an obvious choice of manufacturing subcontractor as the company had little previous experience in assembling electronics It was a well established manufacturer of mechanical watches but was facing a crisis at the beginning of the s Profits had dwindled to virtually zero as the market for mechanical watches stagnated in the face of competition from the digital and quartz watches Recognising the trend Timex s director Fred Olsen determined that the company would diversify into other areas of business br This shift by Timex came at an ideal time for Sinclair The ZX had proved more popular than expected and Sinclair s existing manufacturer a small electronics company in St Ives lacked the resources to deal with the demand Timex took over production of the ZX late in The arrangement worked well for both companies and Timex took on the manufacture of the ZX aided by capital investment in its Dundee plant Sinclair initially planned to produce ZX s a month rising to a month within a year However Timex initially had significant problems in producing enough ZX s to satisfy demand As a consequence it took up to nine weeks for ZX s to be delivered by mail order It was not until September five months after the launch of the ZX that the delivery times finally came down to the promised twenty eight days Those who already owned or had recently ordered the ZX were not excluded anyone who had ordered a ZX in the two weeks before the ZX s launch would receive the newer machine while existing owners were able to upgrade their ZX s by plugging an extra ROM chip into the circuit board br The reliability of the ZX was controversial W H Smith one of the machine s key distributors had a company policy of ordering a third more ZX s than were actually required for sale so that it would have enough replacements for faulty machines Similar problems were reported in the US market where contemporary reports suggested that only a third of the ZX s shipped actually worked However figures released by Sinclair claimed that only per cent of pre assembled machines were returned although per cent of kits were returned Clive Sinclair strongly denied any problem with reliability br br We have a lower rate of failure on our computers than anybody else in the world and the reason for that is that we do everything to keep the quality right The ZX production line is a miracle of efficiency after all one is made every seconds They go through the most amazing quality control Also we have a far lower component count than anyone else We have only four chips where everyone else has br Sinclair attributed the higher failure rate of the kits to customers breaking the components by inserting or soldering them the wrong way though the company admitted that there was a persistent problem with power supplies that affected both kits and pre assembled ZX s The bigger problem was perhaps Sinclair s lack of after sales service which Robin Clarke of New Scientist described as one of the worst after sales performance records of any company ever established The Financial Times observed that Clive Sinclair s offices are filled with returned computers which can take months to be repaired The company s slowness in replacing returns and delivering freshly ordered machines meant that Sinclair Research gained a reputation for poor customer service br br br Marketing br The marketing of the ZX was handled by Sinclair s long standing marketing agency Primary Contact now part of Ogilvy Mather which had provided marketing services for Sinclair since and was to continue doing so until Sinclair s entry into the nascent home computing market gave Primary Contact a major challenge how to market a product simultaneously at hobbyists and at the man on the street who probably had little or no computer literacy The answer was to pursue what the journalist David O Reilly of MicroScope magazine described as a single minded user friendly strategy Chris Fawkes one of Primary Contact s directors explained We brought personal computers to the mass market by showing that you didn t have to be a whizzkid to use one As Clive Sinclair put it in a interview with Your Computer br br There are two big markets There is the hobbyist and the man in the street The hobbyist was a dead certainty We knew we could sell to him because we have so much experience of it and we were offering a better product The much less certain prospect was the man in the street There the view was that if we offered him a computer plus a self training book at a keen enough price he would buy by mail order which of course he has br According to Ben Rosen by pricing the ZX so low Sinclair has opened up a completely new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX on such a large scale It was a surmise that the man in the street would want such a computer He does and our information is that a lot of people are using the machines avidly A New Scientist retrospective published in commented br br Sir Clive s marketing achievement was to downgrade the concept of a computer to the point where he could claim to provide one for less than the magical mark To this end efficient keyboards and monitors useful amounts of memory efficient filing and storage systems and the like were stripped away to leave an affordable facsimile of a computer The market image was more important than what the computer could do but the burgeoning industry in computer games provided an application which adolescents young and old eagerly seized on as the raison d tre for their new gadget In the main it was ignorance of genuine computer technology that fired the success of the ZX range despite the availability of accessories that albeit inefficiently turned the Z processor chip at the heart of these up market toys into the core of a useful machine br br High profile advertising was central to the marketing campaign Although Sinclair Research was a relatively small company it had a long standing policy of using large scale advertisements that stood out in stark contrast to the more muted advertisements of other manufacturers Superlatives exhortations appeals to patriotism testimonials eye catching drawings and photographs on double page spreads varying from month to month were used to drum up mail order business for Sinclair The launch advertising for the ZX illustrates this approach A photograph of the ZX alongside the official Sinclair peripherals dominated the centre of a double page spread The value for money of Sinclair s products was emphasised by the prices being printed in larger type than any other text on the spread The ZX s benefits were promoted with the aspirational slogan Sinclair ZX Personal Computer the heart of a system that grows with you The advertisement highlighted ZX BASIC Programming the manual written by Steve Vickers as a complete course in BASIC programming from first principles to complex programs The educational benefits of the ZX were stressed it s still very simple to teach yourself computing and its technical advantages were explained in relatively non technical terms For instance the ZX s idiosyncratic method of typing commands with a single keystroke the result of the memory saving method of using one byte tokens to represent keywords was presented as eliminat ing a great deal of tiresome typing The ZX s British character was emphasised it was designed by Sinclair and custom built in Britain Sinclair s advertising in the United States provides an illustration of how the company perceived the ZX s purpose br br For less than the Sinclair ZX will get you started in personal computing right now Your children will gain an understanding of computers that will benefit them for the rest of their lives And you will be prepared to make informed decisions about using and buying computers both in your career and in your home br This approach to advertising was driven by Sinclair s reliance on mail order marketing It came with a high up front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it had the advantage of ensuring that all sales were firm and pre paid A big splash on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over the counter sales by getting the story across as Clive Sinclair put it Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order but they see the ads and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops br Sinclair himself became a focal point for the marketing campaign putting a human face on the business while Sinclair Research was portrayed in the media as a plucky British challenger taking on the technical and marketing might of giant American and Japanese corporations As David O Reilly noted by astute use of public relations particularly playing up his image of a Briton taking on the world Sinclair has become the best known name in micros The popular press soon latched onto the image His Uncle Clive persona is said to have been created by the gossip columnist for Personal Computer World while the media praised Sinclair as a visionary genius or even in the words of The Sun the most prodigious inventor since Leonardo As Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy put it Sinclair outgrew the role of microcomputer manufacturer and accepted the mantle of pioneering boffin leading Britain into a technological utopia br Pricing was central to the marketing strategy as it had been through Sinclair s career The ZX had been designed to meet a price point and was launched at a price of built or kit One Sinclair brochure presented a side by side comparison of the ZX with the four machines that Sinclair considered its main rivals the Acorn Atom Apple II Plus Commodore PET and TRS The comparison highlighted the vast differences in cost from in the case of the Apple II Plus to just for the ZX though even by Sinclair s own comparison the Apple was by far the more capable machine br According to Sinclair himself the price was chosen after applying the experience curve developed by the Boston Consulting Group Sinclair s prior experience in the calculator market had highlighted the fact that a product will be more profitable selling at for instance twice the manufactured cost than at three times He could have launched the ZX at a higher price marketing it in a more traditional way as a premium product but chose not to In effect he used the lower price to establish an unassailable lead before the competition moved in br An essential part of Sinclair s marketing strategy was to use regular cost cutting at strategic intervals to maintain market share Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy comment that Sinclair s approach was to secure and extend his market lead and panic the competition While most companies reduce prices when their products are in steep decline Sinclair tends to discount shortly after sales have peaked The advantage of his approach is that vacillating customers are drawn into the fold while the product s promotion retains a commercial urgency and the costings of the competition are thrown into utter disarray br This tactic proved highly successful with Sinclair announcing by March that it had sold ZX s worldwide computers were sold each month outside the UK despite Sinclair and W H Smith being the only distributors When sales fell in the wake of the launch of its successor the ZX Spectrum Sinclair reduced the price of the pre assembled version to in May It was cut by another the following April Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers the ZX was still shipping in excess of units a month even as late as July more than two years after it had been launched By that time according to Sinclair Research over million ZX s had been sold br br br Distribution br br The ZX s distribution arrangements were an essential part of its success and marked a watershed in the way that computers were sold in the UK Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail order retailer the ZX was initially available only through mail order but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores Fortunately for Sinclair an opportunity to do just that was provided by W H Smith a venerable book and magazine seller and stationery chain The company had stagnated in the s and was looking for ways to revitalise its image and expand its product range br Smith s had begun selling audio and photographic equipment and calculators at the end of the s with a modest degree of success In its marketing development manager John Rowland hit upon the idea of creating Computer Know How sections in major branches to sell computer books and magazines Most of the items on display were imports from the United States but their relatively high cost reduced their attractiveness to the casual buyer The commercial success and mass market potential of the ZX caught Rowland s interest he approached Sinclair saw a prototype ZX and agreed to market the machine through Smith s on an exclusive basis for the first six months after launch As Rowland put it what we ve done now is bring the computer orientated publications together with an actual computer to create the Computer Know How section of the store alongside computer software and blank cassette tapes The ZX would be sold in stores around the UK and would serve as the centrepiece of the Computer Know How sections br Selling the ZX over the counter was seen as something of a gamble and Rowland s colleagues were initially unenthusiastic about the scheme Branch buyers thought that the ZX was unlikely to sell more than units per branch at launch Rowland himself thought that the ZX would sell about units during the first five months of the retail agreement equivalent to one month s mail order sales by Sinclair In the event the ZX was a massive success for Smith s it went on sale for making it the first home PC in the UK to retail for under The Computer Know How sections were swamped with eager customers overwhelming the staff who had been trained to demonstrate the machines a Financial Times correspondent wrote of being dazed and bewildered by the crowds of schoolchildren clustered round the ZX in your local branch of W H Smith Within a year Smith s had sold ZX s making an estimated net profit of million Sales of peripherals software books and magazines netted even more profit br br The British chain stores Boots John Menzies and Currys began selling the ZX as soon as Smith s exclusive distribution deal expired and a number of companies secured overseas distribution rights for the ZX which was being sold in countries by March Sinclair launched the ZX in the United States in November at a price of assembled and in kit form initially selling directly to the American market by mail order To be useful the computer needed an extra KB RAM pack which cost Sales reached a month by January while American Express sold thousands more to its own customers In February Timex obtained a licence from Sinclair to sell the ZX directly through thousands of retail outlets in the US paying Sinclair Research a per cent royalty on all Sinclair hardware and software sold by Timex The company was later to produce its own licensed clones and variants of the ZX By August Sinclair had lowered the American mail order price of the assembled ZX to and kit to and its advertisements stated that more than are sold every week In December Mitsui obtained rights to distribute the ZX in Japan selling it by mail order for equivalent to in prices and had sold units by July The Japanese market s favourable reaction to the ZX led Mitsui to begin selling the ZX over the counter in large bookshops from September with annual sales of units predicted In the Netherlands the regular Sinclair ZX was for sale as well as a Bang Olufsen branded version called Beocomp br The ZX was also sold for a while in duty free shops at UK airports However this fell foul of government export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states industries In the government ordered that the ZX s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX kits to a factory in Guangzhou where they would be assembled for the Chinese market br br br Reception br br Reviews of the ZX highlighted the great value for money offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer the ZX is both a delight and a disappointment He applauded the improvements that had been made over the ZX such as a much better manual display and string handling and called the ZX a very good first computer that will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost However the built in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was mandatory for any worthwhile use He also found the ZX to be alarmingly unreliable having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly br New Scientist s Malcolm Peltu commented that it was great technical value for money particularly for computing enthusiasts but thought that others were likely to be bored very quickly by the basic system He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair s accompanying software criticising them for a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should and questioned whether it might be more worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore s offerings Overall he concluded the ZX might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing but the Sinclair systems have a long way to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer based information systems among computer unbelievers br While the editor of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May his colleagues publicised the magazine s review of the ZX with a cover showing a chimpanzee with the machine above the strapline Editor benchtests the ZX The chimp returned in later issues to benchtest all of Sinclair s subsequent computers The review which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented absolutely amazing value for money He described the ZX as a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting to find out more about computers but without it costing them an arm and a leg and concluded If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that Children will love the ZX there can be no question about that and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one just to have a bit of fun br Paul Taylor of the Financial Times found the ZX to be a powerful and flexible little computer ideally suited as a fun introduction to the mysteries of home computing but cautioned readers about its limitations It lacked ready made software the keyboard was not easy to use it did not have sufficiently advanced graphics to be able to replicate arcade style games and its built in memory was inadequate Even so he suggested the ZX is a unique British product part toy part puzzle part learning tool and I think that provided one accepts its limitations and recognises that any computer will only do what it is told to do it is good value as an introduction to the hobby of home computing br The Age described the ZX as not extremely sophisticated and its memory capability is rather limited It also has a rather toy like appearance It concluded that the computer was an ideal toy for youngsters who want to become acquainted with the computer world It is responsive cheap and very easy to use br Billy Garrett of Byte who already owned a ZX complimented the Timex Sinclair s manual although he regretted the removal of the British original s humour the state of the art circuitry and the BASIC for being remarkably powerful despite the small ROM size He concluded that the major use will probably be for learning about BASIC or computers in general It has limited expansion capabilities and the keyboard is too small and cramped for any serious work br David Babsky described the ZX as a wonderfully brainy little micro which won t let you waste your time and make a fool of yourself In a comparison between the ZX and IBM PC published in Which Micro he commended the ZX s user friendliness and its on the fly syntax checking of BASIC programs which he described as the feature that I as a newcomer to computing want to see incorporated into every micro br br br Peripherals and software br br The success of the ZX led almost immediately to enthusiasts producing a huge variety of peripherals and software Clive Sinclair was amused and gratified by the attention the machine received but other than what Clarke described as a few remarkably poor programs on cassette his company made little effort to exploit the demand effectively ceding a very lucrative market to third party suppliers a decision that undoubtedly forfeited a lot of potential earnings W H Smith for instance was able to exploit a peculiarity of the ZX owners found that technically obsolete low fidelity mono tape cassette recorders worked better as storage devices than higher quality music systems Smith s purchased cheap shoebox cassette recorders in the Far East and sold them with the W H Smiths logo as data recorders Over were sold in months br br Sinclair released only two official peripherals for the ZX a KB RAM pack actually the same one previously released for the ZX but rebadged and the ZX Printer both of which plug into the edge connector at the rear of the ZX They retailed at a launch price of each but both have notable flaws The RAM pack is top heavy and supported only by the edge connector It falls out of its socket at crucial points and crashes the ZX losing anything that the user has typed in Users turned to using sticky lumps of chewing gum double sided tape or Blu Tack to cure what became known as the RAM pack wobble problem The ZX Printer is a tiny spark printer that uses two electrically charged styli to burn away the surface of aluminium coated paper to reveal the black underlay It works reasonably well at first but its output deteriorates rapidly after a time br Many non Sinclair peripherals aimed to remedy the ZX s flaws and provide many new capabilities These included RAM packs providing up to KB of extra memory and promising to fit snugly giving a firm connection to the computer typewriter style keyboards more advanced printers and sound generators A wide range of software was also published Within only a year of the ZX s launch around independent companies had been established to manufacture and sell Sinclair compatible hardware The people behind the ZX cottage industry were very often not computer professionals but were as the Financial Times noted school teachers civil servants electrical engineers and technicians who have set up small operations in their own time br The ZX s popularity was publicly demonstrated in January when civil servant Mike Johnstone organised a ZX Microfair at Westminster Central Hall Seventy exhibitors set up stalls with only a few hundred visitors expected in a hall with a capacity of people Tens of thousands mostly youths came from around Britain and the police had to control the crowd They queued for three hours around the hall with a group of entering as another group left About entered the hall Clarke who was only able to enter after identifying himself as a journalist wrote that no one knows how many gave up in despair The exhibitors sold thousands of pounds worth of software and hardware as fast as three pairs of hands on each stall could hand them over and stuff the fivers into improvised overflowing cash boxes he added The fair also showed Sinclair Research s relatively unimportant role in the computer s success with only small crowds at its booth compared to the rugby scrum elsewhere By August seven more ZX Microfairs were held with the th ZX Microfair at Alexandra Palace in November still organised by Johnstone br br Thousands of ZX programs were published either as type in programs or as ready made applications that could be loaded from cassette tape Many computer magazines featured ZX program listings some such as Sinclair Programs were dedicated entirely to listings while many individuals became the archetypal bedroom programmers producing games and applications which they produced marketed recorded and sold from their own homes Some went on to found their own software houses employing teams of programmers some still at school to produce programs for the ZX and other computers Existing companies also sold software Psion produced a series of ZX programs in close association with Sinclair including a flight simulator while ICL s range of ZX programs sold over cassettes in less than three months Psion s success with the ZX had a profound effect on the future of the company Its work on the ZX database program Vu File led to Psion switching its focus to the development of personal digital assistants which resulted in the launch in of the Psion Organiser the world s first handheld personal computer Some of the most popular ZX games Psion s Flight Simulation being an example were rewritten for the Spectrum to take advantage of the newer machine s colour and sound capabilities br Enterprising programmers were able to produce games for the ZX using nothing more than text characters and the machine s limited text semigraphics Some ZX games achieved lasting fame such as D Monster Maze a tense first person perspective game that involved the player escaping a labyrinth with a Tyrannosaurus rex in pursuit Written in a combination of BASIC and machine code its innovative design led it to be hailed as the first home computer D game and a landmark in the history of computer and video games br One of the more bizarre software products for the ZX came about as a result of music companies attempting to capitalise on the popularity of Sinclair s computers In EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX program recorded on the B side Island Records responded with XL by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum br br br Clones and variants br br Sinclair s licensing agreement with Timex enabled the American company to produce three clones or offshoots of Sinclair machines for the US market These were the Timex Sinclair Timex Sinclair both variants of the ZX and the Timex Sinclair a variant of the ZX Spectrum The TS was launched in July and sparked a massive surge of interest at one point the Timex phoneline was receiving over calls an hour a week inquiring about the machine or about microcomputers in general It was virtually identical to the ZX save for re branding and the addition of an extra KB of memory totalling KB In the five months following the TS s launch the company sold machines earning Sinclair over million in royalties br Timex produced a second version of the ZX in the form of the TS essentially an Americanised ZX launched in August It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum incorporating KB of on board memory It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX and Spectrum However it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after effects of Timex s botched marketing of the TS Although the TS had initially been a great success Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS Consumers would take the machine home plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory br In addition consumers attitude in the US was quite different from that in the UK Clive Sinclair told Informatics magazine in June that our competitors thought that consumers didn t want to learn programming We Sinclair Research think they failed because of this and because of price Timex evidently shared this belief but events proved it to be a false assumption The TS ZX s price advantage was erased when its main rivals the TI A and the VIC had their prices cut to below the all important mark Competitors such as Apple Atari Commodore and Texas Instruments promoted their machines as being for business or entertainment rather than education highlighting the value of computers with ready made applications and more advanced features such as graphics colour and sound br By late Wayne Green reported a rising chorus of frustrated Timex users who are telling friends not to waste their money Hard core early adopters he wrote became discouraged with the quality of the product with the poverty of software available and with the almost total lack of information on how to cope with it Consumers deserted the TS once its novelty value had worn off and as publishers of programming guides found to their cost the American public showed little interest in using the machine to learn about computer programming American retailers were left with large stocks of unsold machines Burned by this experience many were unwilling to stock the later Timex Sinclair machines in large numbers and the big chain stores dropped the Timex Sinclair line altogether br Some companies outside the US and UK produced their own pirate versions of the ZX and Timex Sinclair computers aided by weak intellectual property laws in their countries of origin Several Brazilian companies produced ZX clones notably the TK series such as the TK from Microdigital Eletronica of Brazil and Prol gica s CP Czerweny Electr nica of Argentina produced the CZ and CZ clones of the ZX and TS respectively Lambda Electronics of Hong Kong produced the Lambda based on the ZX which was itself widely copied by other Chinese manufacturers br The machines were not all straight copies of the ZX some such as the CP came with extra memory and a larger case often with a chiclet keyboard in place of the original membrane keyboard One clone the TL from TELLAB of Italy could emulate either the ZX or ZX and switch between the two machines via a jumper br br br Impact and legacy br The ZX had an immediate impact on the fortunes of Sinclair Research and Clive Sinclair himself The company s profitability rose enormously from a pretax profit of on a turnover of million in to million on a turnover of million in Clive Sinclair became one of the UK s highest profile businessmen and a millionaire receiving a million bonus on top of a salary of He received a knighthood in the Queen s Birthday Honours and the Young Businessman of the Year award in br The machine also had a widespread and lasting social impact in the United Kingdom according to Clive Sinclair purchasers of the ZX came from a reasonably broad spectrum that ranged from readers of the upmarket Observer and Sunday Times newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous Sun readers The largest age group was around years old The Financial Times reported in March that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes both for adults and children though the children were usually able to learn much more quickly Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that the popularity of the ZX was subtly different from the run of the mill social fad although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties many were older users often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX s that they had bought for their children However the ZX boom was overwhelmingly male dominated br One of the ZX s key legacies was that it spurred large numbers of people to try programming for the first time The ZX plays a significant part in the plot of William Gibson s novel Pattern Recognition One character an artist using old ZX s as a sculptural medium explains the cultural and intellectual impact that the machine had on British society br br Walking on he explains to her that Sinclair the British inventor had a way of getting things right but also exactly wrong Foreseeing the market for affordable personal computers Sinclair decided that what people would want to do with them was to learn programming The ZX marketed in the United States as the Timex cost less than the equivalent of a hundred dollars but required the user to key in programs tapping away on that little motel keyboard sticker This had resulted both in the short market life of the product and in Voytek s opinion twenty years on in the relative preponderance of skilled programmers in the United Kingdom They had their heads turned by these little boxes he believes and by the need to program them br But if Timex sold it in the United States she asks him why didn t we get the programmers br br You have programmers but America is different America wanted Nintendo Nintendo gives you no programmers Also on launch of product in America RAM expansion unit did not ship for three months People buy computer take it home discover it does almost nothing A disaster br Among those whose first experience of home computing was provided by the ZX are Terry Pratchett who used it for very primitive word processing Edward de Bono and perhaps proving William Gibson s point many video game developers including Charles Cecil Raffaele Cecco Pete Cooke David Perry whose first published game a driving game involved a black blob avoiding other black blobs Rhianna Pratchett and Jon Ritman br Even years after launch the ZX has a German user forum and one in English br New hardware and software continue to be developed for the ZX including a ZX based webserver the ZXpand a combined SD card interface K configurable memory expansion and optional joystick port and AY sound interface and new games on cassette tape by Cronosoft such as Tut Tut Virus One Little Ghost and many more as well as releases by Revival Studios such as Avalanche Mayhem Down Stairrunner and more br br br See also br br ZX character set br br br br br br Bibliography br br
