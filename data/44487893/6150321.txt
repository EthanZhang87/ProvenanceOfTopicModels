only recommended the game towards more dedicated platform fans Video Games magazine said that Pac In Time was a significant step up in quality compared to the series previous platform outings writing Pac Man fans will dig the characters and the familiar theme music at the opening of each stage but Pac In Time really has little to do with the maze game that launched a thousand maze games However
