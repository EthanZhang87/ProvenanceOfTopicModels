red shorts large shoes and white gloves He is often depicted alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse his pet dog Pluto his friends Donald Duck and Goofy and his nemesis Pete among others see Mickey Mouse Universe br Mickey was created as a replacement for a prior Disney character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit The character was originally to be named Mortimer Mouse until Walt Disney s wife Lillian suggested Mickey Mickey first appeared in two shorts Plane Crazy and The Gallopin Gaucho which were not picked up for distribution before his public debut in Steamboat Willie The character went on to appear in over films mostly shorts as well as features such as Fantasia Since Mickey has been featured extensively in comic strips including the Mickey Mouse comic strip which ran for years and comic books such as Mickey Mouse The character has also been featured in television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club br Inspired by such silent film personalities as Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges bigger than himself The character s depiction as a small mouse is personified through his diminutive stature and falsetto voice the latter of which was originally provided by Walt Disney Though originally characterized as a cheeky lovable rogue Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy usually seen as a spirited yet impulsive hero br Mickey also appears in media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks He is one of the world s most recognizable and universally acclaimed fictional characters Ten of Mickey s cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film one of which Lend a Paw won the award in In Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame br br br Creation br br Mickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit an earlier cartoon character that was created by the Disney studio but owned at the time by Universal Pictures Charles Mintz served as a middleman producer between Disney and Universal through his company Winkler Pictures for the series of cartoons starring Oswald In a February meeting with Mintz to renew the Oswald contract Disney was met by a disappointing budget cut proposal along with Mintz s revelation that several of the most important Disney animators were coming over to his studio Among the few who stayed at the Disney studio were animator Ub Iwerks apprentice artist Les Clark and Wilfred Jackson br A new character was workshopped out of necessity and in relative secret Various myths exist of Walt Disney s inspiration for Mickey including some which were likely ghostwritten such as that the starving artist drew inspiration from a tame mouse or pair of mice at his desk at Laugh O Gram Studio in Kansas City Missouri or that he undertook a romantic search for inspiration on the train ride home from his disappointing meeting with Mintz At Disney s behest Iwerks sketched new character ideas based on various animals such as dogs and cats but none of these appealed to Disney A female cow and male horse were rejected as was a male frog In Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney reputedly based on Disney s own designs similar to those he included on family birthday cards These inspired Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney br br Mortimer Mouse had been Disney s original name for the character before his wife Lillian convinced him to change it It has been speculated that Disney saw the name on a similarly named Performo toy Additionally actor Mickey Rooney claimed that during his time performing as the title character of the Mickey McGuire film series he met Walt Disney at the Warner Bros studio inspiring Disney to name the character after him however Disney Studios was located on Hyperion Avenue at the time with Disney conducting no business at Warner Bros br br The first feature length movie with dialogue sequences The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson was released on October Several additional talkies followed and movie theaters began installing the necessary equipment Walt Disney reputedly discussed making sound cartoons in late May After composer Carl W Stalling initially voiced Mickey for the talkie shorts The Karnival Kid and Wild Waves Disney himself provided the shy falsetto voice a large part of the character s onscreen persona br br br Design br br Mickey s original design strongly resembled Oswald the Rabbit save for the ears nose and tail Ub Iwerks designed Mickey s body out of circles distinctly the ears to make the character easy to animate br Upon his creation Mickey s features shared similarities to a number of his cartoon predecessors with large eyes and mouth on a black body e g Oswald and Felix the Cat From early Mickey also wore white gloves similar to those appearing on later characters e g Bosko and Bimbo Several sources state that this scheme evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows br Additionally Mickey s original black hands could not be seen if they passed in front of his torso This limitation encouraged animators to base their poses on silhouette much in the manner of Charlie Chaplin films br Minnie Mouse was designed similarly to Mickey with only superficial details being different In the s animator Fred Moore tried giving Mickey s body more of a pear shape to increase his acting range Walt Disney liked this adaptation and declared that s the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on Moore maintained that the character should always be drawn from a pleasing angle ears included as opposed to depicting Mickey as a realistic D character br Mickey s eyes were originally large and white with black outlines with the tops able to deform like eyebrows the pupil was circular with a triangle cut out in poster close ups to simulate reflected light Starting with Steamboat Willie the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed often making the pupil placement look strange The pupils began to be treated as stationary dotlike eyes requiring the entire head to be moved to make Mickey look around During the production of Fantasia in the late s Fred Moore redesigned Mickey with small white pupilled eyes with the redefined facial area being given a light skin color Distinct lined eyebrows were eventually added br Besides Mickey s gloves and shoes he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front Before Mickey was seen regularly in color animation Mickey s shorts were either red or a dull blue green With the advent of Mickey s color films the shorts were always red When Mickey is not wearing his red shorts he is often still wearing red clothing Due to budgetary limits imposed by World War II Mickey temporarily lost his tail e g in The Little Whirlwind br br br Appearances br br br Film br br br Debut br br Mickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short Plane Crazy on May but it failed to impress the audience and Walt could not find a distributor for it Walt went on to produce a second Mickey short The Gallopin Gaucho which was also not released for lack of a distributor br Steamboat Willie was first released on November in New York It was co directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks Iwerks again served as the head animator assisted by Les Clark Johnny Cannon Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy This short was a nod to Buster Keaton s Steamboat Bill Jr released earlier that year Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced it was the first to find a distributor and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey s debut It also featured some design refinements and included the use of a bouncing ball on the film print to allow conductors and musicians to match the tempo of their music with the film br The cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action Fleischer Studios headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid s However these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film For Willie Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat This precise timing is apparent during the Turkey in the Straw sequence when Mickey s actions exactly match the accompanying instruments Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film s original music This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis but identification remains uncertain Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey s voice through for theatrical cartoons Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in but Walt provided Mickey s voice again from to for The Mickey Mouse Club television series on ABC br Audiences at the time of Steamboat Willie s release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes Sound films or talkies were still considered innovative Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney As a result Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both Plane Crazy and The Gallopin Gaucho which had originally been silent releases and their new release added to Mickey s success and popularity A fourth Mickey short The Barn Dance was also put into production however Mickey does not actually speak until The Karnival Kid After Steamboat Willie was released Mickey became a close competitor to Felix the Cat and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons By Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result Audiences did not respond well to Felix s transition to sound and by Felix had faded from the screen br br br Black and white films br In Mickey s early films he was often characterized not as a hero but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse The Barn Dance March is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete The Opry House March was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit The three lines on the back of Mickey s gloves represent darts in the gloves fabric extending from between the digits of the hand typical of glove design of the era br When the Cat s Away April essentially a remake of the Alice Comedy Alice Rattled by Rats was an unusual appearance for Mickey Although Mickey and Minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community of many other mice as pests in a home Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting In appearances with real humans Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high The next Mickey short was also unusual The Barnyard Battle April was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat The Karnival Kid was the first time Mickey spoke Before this he had only whistled laughed and grunted His first words were Hot dogs Hot dogs said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival Mickey s Follies introduced the song Minnie s Yoo Hoo which would become the theme song for Mickey Mouse films for the next several years The same song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of s theater based Mickey Mouse Clubs Mickey s dog Pluto first appeared as Mickey s pet in The Moose Hunt after previously appearing as Minnie s dog Rover in The Picnic br The Cactus Kid April was the last film to be animated by Ub Iwerks at Disney Shortly before the release of the film Iwerks left to start his own studio bankrolled by Disney s then distributor Pat Powers Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney s cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey s career as well as that of Walt Disney Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts released till this point Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as A Walt Disney Comic drawn by Ub Iwerks Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone br Disney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen Mickey s popularity would rise and by The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members At the th Academy Awards in Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination received for Mickey s Orphans Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphony short the Three Little Pigs in Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too until when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey By Mickey merchandise had earned a year In Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs due to administration problems br About this time story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey As he had developed into a role model for children they were limited in the types of gags they could present This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters In Orphan s Benefit Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the Silly Symphony series The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey s cartoons br br br Color films br br Mickey first appeared animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in however the film strip was created for the th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public Mickey s official first color film came in with The Band Concert The Technicolor film process was used in the film production Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture but the band is swept up by a tornado It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that upon first seeing it he asked the projectionist to run it again In The Band Concert was voted the third greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey Walt would put Mickey back on top once again and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal Also in Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey br The second half of the s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular Together Mickey Donald Duck and Goofy would go on several adventures together Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey s most critically acclaimed films including Mickey s Fire Brigade Moose Hunters Clock Cleaners Lonesome Ghosts Boat Builders and Mickey s Trailer Also during this era Mickey would star in Brave Little Tailor an adaptation of The Valiant Little Tailor which was nominated for an Academy Award br In Mickey appeared in his first feature length film Fantasia with a new design including pupils His screen role as The Sorcerer s Apprentice set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey s most iconic roles The apprentice Mickey not willing to do his chores puts on the sorcerer s magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore filling up a deep well using two buckets of water When the well eventually overflows Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom leading to a near flood After the segment ends Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with conductor Leopold Stokowski Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer s hat in merchandising It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic an attraction at the Disney theme parks br After Mickey s popularity would decline until his re emergence as a daily children s television personality Despite this the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until winning his only competitive Academy Award with canine companion Pluto for a short subject Lend a Paw and again from to In these later cartoons Mickey was often just a supporting character in his own shorts where Pluto would be the main character br The last regular installment of the Mickey Mouse film series came in with The Simple Things in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls br br br Television and later films br br In the s Mickey became more known for his appearances on television particularly with The Mickey Mouse Club Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as Ink Paint Club various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series and on home video Mickey returned to theatrical animation in with Mickey s Christmas Carol an adaptation of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit This was followed up in with The Prince and the Pauper br Throughout the decades Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros Bugs Bunny for animated popularity But in the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Disney Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene br Similar to his animated inclusion into a live action film in Roger Rabbit Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the television special The Muppets at Walt Disney World where he met Kermit the Frog The two are established in the story as having been old friends although they have not made any other appearance together outside of this br His most recent theatrical cartoon short was s Get a Horse which was preceded by s Runaway Brain while from to he appeared in direct to video features like Mickey s Once Upon a Christmas Mickey Donald Goofy The Three Musketeers and Mickey s Twice Upon a Christmas br Many television series have centered on Mickey such as the ABC shows Mickey Mouse Works House of Mouse Disney Channel s Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Mickey Mouse Mixed Up Adventures and Mickey Mouse Funhouse present Prior to all these Mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the Bonkers episode You Oughta Be In Toons br In Disney Channel started airing new minute Mickey Mouse shorts with animator Paul Rudish at the helm incorporating elements of Mickey s late twenties early thirties look with a contemporary twist On November the series was revived as The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse and premiered on Disney Furthermore The creative team behind the DuckTales reboot had hoped to have Mickey Mouse in the series but this idea was rejected by Disney executives However a watermelon bearing Mickey s physical likeness appears in one episode as a ventriloquist dummy companion to Donald Duck br In August ABC television announced a two hour prime time special Mickey s th Spectacular in honor of Mickey s th birthday The program featured never before seen short videos and several other celebrities who wanted to share their memories about Mickey Mouse and performed some of the Disney songs to impress Mickey The show took place at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and was produced and directed by Don Mischer on November On November a th anniversary event for the character was celebrated around the world In December both Mickey and Minnie served as special co hosts of Wheel of Fortune for two weeks while Vanna White served as the main host during Pat Sajak s absence br Mickey is the subject of the documentary film Mickey The Story of a Mouse directed by Jeff Malmberg Premiering at the South by Southwest film festival prior to its premiere on the Disney streaming service the documentary examines the history and cultural impact of Mickey Mouse The feature is accompanied by an original hand drawn animated short film starring Mickey titled Mickey in a Minute br Mickey appeared in Walt Disney Animation Studios centennial short film Once Upon a Studio in which he corrals the characters of Disney s animated features to take a group picture br br br Comics br br Mickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip Disney accepted and Mickey Mouse made its first appearance on January The comical plot was credited to Disney himself art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of Plane Crazy Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast The strips first released between January and March have been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title Lost on a Desert Island Animation historian Jim Korkis notes After the eighteenth strip Iwerks left and his inker Win Smith continued drawing the gag a day format br In early after Iwerks departure Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip assigning the art to Win Smith However Disney s focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script draw and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation br Disney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio He selected Floyd Gottfredson a recently hired employee At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this temporary assignment from May to November br Walt Disney s last script for the strip appeared May Gottfredson s first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April The storyline was completed on September and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow Horace Horsecollar and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie s uncle Mortimer Mouse The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr Slicker and the Egg Robbers first printed between September and December which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie s parents br Starting with these two early comic strip stories Mickey s versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the th and into the st century br Floyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion and The Gleam He also created the Phantom Blot Eega Beeva Morty and Ferdie Captain Churchmouse and Butch Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula Rick Hoover Manuel Gonzales Carson Van Osten Jim Engel Bill Wright Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes writers included Ted Osborne Merrill De Maris Bill Walsh Dick Shaw Roy Williams Del Connell and Floyd Norman br The next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics His first Mickey tale appeared in but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry s first serial for Walt Disney s Comics and Stories in The Last Resort In the same period Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine Topolino began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep Bleep While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures This renaissance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson David Gerstein Noel Van Horn Michael T Gilbert and C sar Ferioli br In Europe Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines the most famous being Topolino in Italy from onward Le Journal de Mickey in France from onward Don Miki in Spain and the Greek Miky Maous br Mickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine published in Italy from to br In he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga Wizards of Mickey br In Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called Sameer He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book with his name Mickey s comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since by Dar Al Hilal and they were successful however Dar Al Hilal stopped the publication in because of problems with Disney The comics were re released by Nahdat Masr in and the first issues were sold out in less than hours br br br Portrayal br Mickey is traditionally characterized as a sympathetic underdog who gets by on pluck and ingenuity in the face of challenges much bigger than himself As a mouse an inherently vulnerable creature Mickey is often depicted as having minimal resources and attributes at his disposal Consequently he must rely on sheer wit to overcome obstacles The character is frequently pitted against larger than life villains to accentuate this idea namely the hulking cat Pegleg Pete and numerous one shot antagonists such as the giants of Giantland and Brave Little Tailor the king of cards in Thru the Mirror and Mortimer Mouse in Mickey s Rival These adversaries were decidedly portrayed as overbearing figures of authority thusly painting Mickey as a rebellious hero When not facing an opponent Mickey is oft placed in situations where his pursuits of grandeur or simple accomplishment lead to disastrous results typically at the hands of his own impulsivity as was the case in The Sorcerer s Apprentice among others Mickey is not portrayed as a hero in the traditional sense instead acting as a subversion of the stock archetype He often fumbles his way through adventures his small size and misplaced optimism serving as his dominating flaws His manner of problem solving is generally unorthodox to comedic effect in Ye Olden Days Mickey s jousting horse was an infantile mule In Shanghaied Mickey battled with a broadbill in place of a sword The underdog nature of Mickey s character has been interpreted by historians as a symbolic reflection of Walt Disney s early struggles as a farm boy breaking into the imposing Hollywood industry in the s It has also been perceived as an allegory for the Great Depression in the United States with Mickey s unrelenting optimism symbolizing the American endurance to survive in the face of economic woes br Charlie Chaplin known by audiences of the time for his role as the Little Tramp was identified by Disney as a source of inspiration for the Mickey character Disney himself was a noted admirer of Chaplin s work ascribing his development as a storytelling to the actor In The American Magazine for March Disney explained I think we were rather indebted to Charlie Chaplin for the idea of Mickey Mouse We wanted something appealing and we thought of a tiny bit of a mouse that would have something of the wistfulness of Chaplin a little fellow trying to do the best he could American journalist Alva Johnston noted the similarities between the two figures stating Chaplin was a kind of godfather to Mickey Mouse It is now and always has been the aim of Disney to graft the psychology of Chaplin upon Mickey The two universal characters have something in common in their approach to their problems They have the same blend of hero and coward nitwit and genius mug and gentleman br Besides Chaplin other notable figures of the silent era have been credited to Mickey s characterization Chief among them was Douglas Fairbanks whose swashbuckling screen adventures would inspire Mickey s animated epics Ub Iwerks wrote in He was the super hero of his day always winning gallant and swashbuckling Mickey s action was in that vein He was never intended to be a sissy he was always an adventurous character I thought of him in that respect and I had him do naturally the sort of thing Doug Fairbanks would do Disney was also noted to have been influenced by Fairbanks along with other screen personalities including Harold Lloyd and Fred Astaire br An adaptive character Mickey s personality lends itself to function within a multitude of situations while retaining core elements of its design He is not bound to a particular formula or motif and as such has been portrayed in a variety of settings and occupational roles His film series meanwhile spans numerous genres besides the traditional musical comedy The Mad Doctor and Runaway Brain parody the horror genre whereas stories such as Mickey s Good Deed and The Prince and the Pauper are largely dramatic works This versatility is said to have attributed to Mickey s popularity with audiences As expressed by writer Chelsea Tatham From his beginnings Mickey was able to appeal to a wide audience He catered to neither the highbrow nor the hick but the ordinary intelligent picturegoer br There are a number of catchphrases and colloquialisms associated with the character Mickey s first spoken words Hot dog from The Karnival Kid has endured as a recurring phrase for the character made especially recognizable to modern audiences for its extensive use in the preschool television program Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Mickey s signature closing line See ya real soon is derived from the Mickey Mouse March reprise from the original run of The Mickey Mouse Club M I C see you real soon br br br Other voice actors br Composer Carl W Stalling was the first person to provide lines for Mickey in the shorts The Karnival Kid and Wild Waves From this point on Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself being a job in which he appeared to take great personal pride br J Donald Wilson and Joe Twerp provided the voice in some broadcasts of The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air although Disney remained Mickey s official voice during this period However by Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey s voice on a regular basis anymore It is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years After recording the Mickey and the Beanstalk section of Fun and Fancy Free Mickey s voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald Walt would reprise Mickey s voice occasionally until his passing in such as in the introductions to the original run of The Mickey Mouse Club TV series the Fourth Anniversary Show episode of the Walt Disney s Disneyland TV series that aired on September and the Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall show from br MacDonald voiced Mickey in most of the remaining theatrical shorts and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in However other actors would occasionally play the role during this era Clarence Nash

Birthday Party br Alan Young voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record album An Adaptation of Dickens Christmas Carol Performed by The Walt Disney Players in br The short film Mickey s Christmas Carol marked the theatrical debut of Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse who was the official voice of Mickey from until his death in although MacDonald returned to voice Mickey for an appearance at the th Academy Awards in Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective He said Just

first season of Mickey Mouse Works whenever Allwine was unavailable to record br Bret Iwan a former Hallmark greeting card artist is the current official voice of Mickey Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine due to the latter s declining health but Allwine died before Iwan could get a chance to meet him and Iwan became the new official voice of the character at the time Iwan s early recordings in included work for the Disney Cruise Line Mickey toys the Disney theme parks and the Disney on Ice Celebrations ice show He directly replaced Allwine as Mickey for the Kingdom Hearts

Illusion An openly gay man Iwan is the character s first LGBT performer br In addition to Iwan Chris Diamantopoulos was cast as Mickey for the Mickey Mouse animated series developed by Paul Rudish as the producers were looking for a voice closer to Walt Disney s portrayal of the character in order to match the vintage look of that series Diamantopoulos is the first voice of Mickey to be nominated for two Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards for his work in the series He has reprised the role in the DuckTales reboot in the form of a watermelon that Donald uses as a ventriloquist dummy the Walt

Vanpelt a law student at Arizona State University wrote a paper making a similar argument Vanpelt points out that copyright law at the time required a copyright notice specify the year of the copyright and the copyright owner s name The title cards to early Mickey Mouse films Steamboat Willie Plane Crazy and Gallopin Gaucho do not clearly identify the copyright owner and also misidentify

films br A article by Douglas A Hedenkamp in the Virginia Sports and Entertainment Law Journal analyzed Vanpelt s arguments and concluded that she is likely correct Hedenkamp provided additional arguments and identified some errors in Vanpelt s paper but still found that due to imperfections in the copyright notice on the title cards Walt Disney forfeited his copyright in Mickey Mouse He concluded The forfeiture occurred at the moment of publication and the law of that time was clear publication without proper notice irrevocably forfeited copyright protection br Disney threatened to sue Hedenkamp for slander of title but did not follow through The claims in Vanpelt and Hedenkamp s articles have not been tested in court br In a episode of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver John Oliver suggested that without copyright protection to stop the unauthorized use of Mickey Mouse the Walt Disney Company would likely use trademark law to achieve the same results potentially arguing

image from Steamboat Willie since the start of the season and that he would begin to use his own version of Mickey Mouse as a mascot of the show He stated br br We are staking our claim to Mickey
