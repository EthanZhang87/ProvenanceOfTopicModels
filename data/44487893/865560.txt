obstacles by pressing the jump button br In each stage Pac Man will encounter the four ghosts from the original game Blinky Pinky Inky and Clyde alongside a purple ghost named Sue originally a replacement for Clyde in Ms Pac Man Eating large flashing Power Pellets will cause the ghosts to turn blue for a short time allowing Pac Man to eat them for bonus points The ghosts are often seen driving vehicles such as airplanes buses cars pogo sticks and flying saucers and will sometimes drop miniature ghost enemies from the air to try and hit Pac Man Other types of obstacles are also present in stages such as water spewing fire hydrants springboards falling logs quicksand and geysers br Trips consist of cities forests deserts and abandoned castles Most trip sections end with a large sign saying BREAK TIME with a church on a hill in the background and bonus points are awarded for jumping at certain points at the end of each section The final section of a trip gives Pac Man a special pair of boots that will allow him to jump infinitely into the air and tasks the player with returning home to Pac Man s family The player can find hidden items by pushing against specific objects in certain stages including a helmet that protects Pac Man from falling mini ghosts an item that makes Pac Man temporarily invincible and a Galaxian flagship that awards the player a large sum of points Jumping in certain spots will reveal fruit items that can be consumed for points br The game features the theme song from the Pac Man cartoon series which plays in a constant loop throughout

modeled after Pac Man marketing material and cabinet artwork It s currently unknown what version the European version looks like br br br Development and release br Pac Land was programmed by Yoshihiro Kishimoto of Namco Development Division who would later work on the Family Stadium franchise After seeing the success of the American Pac Man cartoon series Namco requested Kishimoto that he create an arcade game based on the show Kishimoto stated that the hardest part of development were Pac Man s animations Most arcade games in Japan at the time simply used two or three frames to convey movement which he found unconvincing The team wanted the game s backgrounds to be vibrant and colorful and to have the characters move smoothly to replicate the show s animation style Pac Man himself was given different frame patterns alongside several facial expressions and clothing swaps br Kishimoto cited Konami s sports video game Track Field as the number one influence on Pac Land The game s controls were heavily influenced by Track Field a game that allowed the player to become faster by constantly tapping the button in succession Kishimoto thought the idea was interesting and that it would make it stand out among other games To allow for two layer scrolling backgrounds more sprites and more colors the team created the Namco Pac Land arcade board which was used for several later Namco games including Baraduke and Metro Cross The game was tested in Yokohama where Kishimoto recalls the springboards being difficult for new players br The arcade game was released in Japan in but
