characters br br Note A dark grey cell indicates that the character did not appear in that medium br br br Production br br br Production for the first film br The Incredibles as a concept dates back to when Bird sketched the family during a period in which he tried to break into film Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life During this time Bird had inked a production deal with Warner Bros Animation and was in the process of directing his first feature The Iron Giant Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life He stated Consciously this was just a funny movie about superheroes But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie After the box office failure of The Iron Giant Bird gravitated toward his superhero story br He imagined it as a homage to the s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a D cel animation When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March and pitched his story idea to him Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the s Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar where the film would be done in computer animation The studio announced a multi film contract with Bird on May breaking Pixar s mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters In addition it would be the company s first film in which all characters are human br br br Production for the second film br Following the first film Brad Bird directed his next film for Pixar Ratatouille which was released in June Near its premiere Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to The Incredibles but only if it could be even better than the original He stated I have pieces that I think are good but I don t have them all together br In a May interview Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel I have been thinking about it People think that I have not been but I have because I love those characters and love that world He added I am stroking my chin and scratching my head I have many many elements that I think would work really well in another Incredibles film and if I can get em to click all together I would probably wanna do that While publicizing the first film Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles and Jack Jack would develop multiple powers yet known by the family br Pixar announced in November that both Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson would return to reprise their roles and at the July D Expo that both Craig T Nelson and Sarah Vowell would also return with them Spencer Fox the original voice of Dashiell Dash Parr was replaced in the sequel by younger newcomer Huck Milner Also that July Brad Bird and John Ratzenberger were confirmed as reprising their characters from the first film br In November Pixar announced that Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener had been signed to the cast but did not disclose their roles as new characters Winston and Evelyn Deavor until a later date In January it was announced that Sophia Bush and Isabella Rossellini would voice new characters Voyd and The Ambassador while Jonathan Banks would voice Rick Dicker after the character s original voice actor Bud Luckey retired in after his death in the film was dedicated to Luckey s memory br br br Health concerns br Many disability advocates including the Epilepsy Foundation have raised
