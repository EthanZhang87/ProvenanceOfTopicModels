Dota is a multiplayer online battle arena MOBA video game by Valve The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients DotA a community created mod for Blizzard Entertainment s Warcraft III Reign of Chaos Dota is played in matches between two teams of five players with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character known as a hero that all have unique abilities and differing styles of play During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to defeat the opposing team s heroes in player versus player combat A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team s Ancient a large structure located within their base br Development of Dota began in when IceFrog lead designer of Defense of the Ancients was hired by Valve to design a modernized remake in the Source game engine It was released for Windows OS X and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July following a Windows only open beta phase that began two years prior The game is fully free to play with no heroes or any other gameplay element needing to be bought or otherwise unlocked To maintain it Valve supports the game as a service selling loot boxes and a battle pass subscription system called Dota Plus that offer non gameplay altering virtual goods in return such as hero cosmetics and audio replacement packs The game was ported to the Source engine in making it the first game to use it br Dota has a large esports scene with teams from around the world playing in various professional leagues and tournaments Valve organizes the Dota Pro Circuit which are a series of tournaments that award qualification points for earning direct invitations to The International the game s premier tournament held annually Internationals feature a crowdfunded prize money system that has seen amounts in upwards of US million making Dota the most lucrative esport Media coverage of most tournaments is done by a selection of on site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches similar to traditional sporting events In addition to playing live to audiences in arenas and stadiums broadcasts of them are also streamed over the internet and sometimes simulcast on television with several million in viewership numbers br Despite criticism going towards its steep learning curve and overall complexity Dota was praised for its rewarding gameplay production quality and faithfulness to its predecessor with many considering it to be one of the greatest video games of all time It has been one of the most played games on Steam since its release with over a million concurrent players at its peak The popularity of the game has led to merchandise and media adaptations including comic books and an anime series as well as promotional tie ins to other games and media The game allows for the community to create their own gamemodes maps and cosmetics which are uploaded to the Steam Workshop Two spinoff games Artifact and Dota Underlords were released by Valve Dota has been used in machine learning experiments with a team of bots known as the OpenAI Five showing the capability to defeat professional players br br br Gameplay br br Dota is a multiplayer online battle arena MOBA video game in which two teams of five players compete to destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the Ancient whilst defending their own As in Defense of the Ancients the game is controlled using standard real time strategy controls and is presented on a single map in a three dimensional isometric perspective Ten players each control one of the game s playable characters known as heroes with each having their own design strengths and weaknesses Heroes are divided into two primary roles known as the core and support br br Cores which are also called carries begin each match as weak and vulnerable but are able to become more powerful later in the game thus becoming able to carry their team to victory Supports generally lack abilities that deal heavy damage instead having ones with more functionality and utility that provide assistance for their cores such as providing healing and other buffs Players select their hero during a pre game drafting phase where they can discuss potential strategies and hero matchups with their teammates Heroes are removed from the drafting pool and become unavailable for all other players once one is selected and can not be changed once the drafting phase is over All heroes have a basic attack in addition to powerful abilities which are the primary method of fighting Each hero has at least four of them all of which are unique Heroes begin each game with an experience level of one only having access to one of their abilities but are able to level up and become more powerful during the course of the game up to a maximum level of Whenever a hero gains an experience level the player is able to unlock another of their abilities or improve one already learned The most powerful ability for each hero is known as their ultimate which requires them to have an experience level of six in order to use br In order to prevent abilities from being overused a magic system is featured in the game Activating an ability costs a hero some of their mana points which slowly regenerates over time Using an ability will also cause it to enter a cooldown period in which the ability can not be used again until a timer resets All heroes have three attributes strength intelligence and agility which affect health points mana points and attack speed respectively Each hero has a primary attribute which adds to their basic non ability damage output and other minor buffs with four attributes including Universal which rewards extra damage for attribute points Heroes have an ability augmentation system known as the Talent Tree which allow players more choices on how to develop their hero If a hero runs out of health points and dies they are removed from active play until a timer counts down to zero where they are respawned in their base with only some gold lost br The two teams known as the Radiant and Dire occupy fortified bases in opposite corners of the map which is divided in half by a crossable river and connected by three paths which are referred to as lanes The lanes are guarded by defensive towers that attack any opposing unit who gets within its line of sight A small group of weak computer controlled creatures called creeps travel predefined paths along the lanes and attempt to attack any opposing heroes creeps and buildings in their way Creeps periodically spawn throughout the game in groups from two buildings called the barracks that exist in each lane and are located within the team s bases The map is permanently covered for both teams in fog of war which prevents a team from seeing the opposing team s heroes and creeps if they are not directly in sight of themselves or an allied unit The map features a day night cycle with some hero abilities and other game mechanics being altered depending on the time of the cycle Present on the map are neutral creeps that are hostile to both teams and reside in marked locations on the map known as camps Camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the jungle which both sides of the map have br Neutral creeps do not attack unless provoked and respawn over time if killed The most powerful neutral creep is named Roshan who is a unique boss that may be defeated by either team to obtain special items such as one that allows a one time resurrection if the hero that holds it is killed Roshan will respawn around ten minutes after being killed and becomes progressively harder to kill as the match progresses over time Runes which are special items that spawn in set positions on the map every few minutes offer heroes temporary but powerful power ups when collected such as double damage and invisibility br In addition to having abilities becoming stronger during the game players are able to buy items from set locations on the map called shops that provide their own special abilities Items are not limited to specific heroes and can be bought by anyone In order to obtain an item players must be able to afford it with gold at shops located on the map which is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes destroying enemy structures and killing creeps with the latter being an act called farming Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a creep obtains gold from it an act called last hitting but all allies receive a share of gold when an enemy hero dies close to them Players are able to deny allied units and structures by last hitting them which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience from them Gold can not be shared between teammates with each player having their own independent stash Players receive a continuous but small stream of gold over the course of a match br Dota features multiple game types which mainly alter the way hero selection is handled examples include All Pick which offer no restrictions on hero selection All Random which randomly assigns a hero for each player Captain s Mode where a single player on each team selects heroes for their entire team and is primarily used for professional play and Turbo an expedited version of All Pick featuring increased gold and experience gain weaker towers and faster respawn times Matches usually last around minutes to an hour although they can last forever as long as both Ancients remain standing In Captain s Mode games an additional GG forfeit feature is available to end games early Dota occasionally features limited time events that present players with alternative game modes that do not follow the game s standard rules Some of these included the Halloween themed Diretide event the Christmas themed Frostivus event and the New Bloom Festival which celebrated the coming of spring Other special game modes have been created by Valve including a ten versus ten mode a Halloween themed capture point mode Colosseum a combat arena mode Overthrow Siltbreaker a story driven cooperative campaign mode and The Underhollow a battle royale mode br The move to the Source engine in added the Arcade feature which allows for community created game modes with the more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by Valve One popular example known as Dota Auto Chess had over seven million in game subscribers by April Owing to its popularity Valve met with the mod s developers the Chinese based Drodo Studio to discuss directly collaborating on a standalone version However the two companies were unable to come to an agreement with them both stating that it was in their best interest to develop their own separate games Valve s version Dota Underlords was released in February and continued to use the Dota setting while Drodo s game Auto Chess was developed using no Dota assets br br br Development br br The Dota series began in with Defense of the Ancients DotA a mod for Blizzard Entertainment s Warcraft III Reign of Chaos created by the pseudonymous designer Eul An expansion pack for Warcraft III The Frozen Throne was released later that year a series of Defense of the Ancients clone mods for the new game competed for popularity DotA Allstars by Steve Feak was the most successful and Feak with his friend Steve Mescon created the official Defense of the Ancients community website and the holding company DotA Allstars LLC When Feak retired from DotA Allstars in a fellow website user under the pseudonym IceFrog became its lead designer By the late s Defense of the Ancients became one of the most popular mods worldwide as well as a prominent esports game IceFrog and Mescon later had a falling out in May which prompted the former to establish a new community website at playdota com Valve s interest in the Dota intellectual property began when several veteran employees including Team Fortress designer Robin Walker and executive Erik Johnson became fans of the mod and wanted to build a modern sequel The company corresponded with IceFrog by email about his long term plans for the project and he was subsequently hired to design a sequel IceFrog announced his new position through his blog in October with Dota being announced a year later br Valve adopted the word Dota derived from the original mod s acronym as the name for its newly acquired franchise Johnson argued that the word referred to a concept and was not an acronym Shortly after the announcement of Dota Valve filed a trademark claim to the Dota name At Gamescom company president Gabe Newell explained that the trademark was needed to develop a sequel with the already identifiable brand Holding the Dota name to be a community asset Feak and Mescon filed an opposing trademark for Dota on behalf of DotA Allstars LLC then a subsidiary of Riot Games in August Rob Pardo the executive vice president of Blizzard Entertainment at the time similarly stated that the Dota name belonged to the mod s community Blizzard acquired DotA Allstars LLC from Riot Games and filed an opposition against Valve in November citing Blizzard s ownership of both the Warcraft III World Editor and DotA Allstars LLC as proper claims to the franchise name The dispute was settled in May with Valve retaining commercial rights to the Dota trademark while allowing non commercial use of the name by third parties In Valve s ownership of the franchise was again challenged after a internet forum post from Eul was brought to light by a Chinese company known as uCool who had released a mobile game in that used characters from the Dota universe uCool who was previously involved in a lawsuit with Blizzard in for similar reasons along with another Chinese company Lilith Games argued that the forum post invalidated any ownership claims of the intellectual property stating that the Dota property was an open source collective work that could not be copyrighted by anyone in particular Judge Charles R Breyer denied uCool s motion for summary dismissal with Blizzard filing motions to dismiss all claims against uCool and Lilith with prejudice br An early goal of the Dota team was the adaptation of Defense of the Ancients aesthetic style for the Source engine The Radiant and Dire factions replaced the Sentinel and Scourge from the mod respectively Character names abilities items and map design from the mod were largely retained with some changes due to trademarks owned by Blizzard In the first Q A session regarding Dota IceFrog explained that the game would build upon the mod without making significant changes to its core Valve hired Eul and contracted major contributors from the Defense of the Ancients community including artist Kendrick Lim to assist with the sequel Additional contributions from sources outside of Valve were also sought regularly for Dota as to continue Defense of the Ancients tradition of community sourced development One of the composers of Warcraft III Reign of Chaos Jason Hayes was hired to collaborate with Tim Larkin to write the original score for the game which was conducted by Timothy Williams and performed and recorded by the Northwest Sinfonia at Bastyr University Valve had Half Life series writer Marc Laidlaw science fiction author Ted Kosmatka and other employees contributed hero dialog and lore Notable voice actors for heroes include Nolan North Dave Fennoy Jon St John Ellen McLain Fred Tatasciore Merle Dandridge Jen Taylor and John Patrick Lowrie among others br The Source engine was updated with new features to accommodate Dota such as high end cloth modeling and improved global lighting The game features Steam integration which provides its social component and cloud storage for personal settings In November Valve introduced a coaching system that allows experienced players to tutor newer players with in game tools As with previous Valve multiplayer games players are able to spectate live matches of Dota played by others and local area network LAN multiplayer support allows for local competitions Some of these events may be spectated via the purchase of tickets from the Dota Store which give players in game access to matches Ticket fees are apportioned in part to tournament organizers The game features an in game fantasy sports system which is modeled after traditional fantasy sports and feature professional Dota players and teams Players are able to spectate games in virtual reality VR with up to others which was added in an update in July The update added a hero showcase mode which allows players to see all of the heroes and their cosmetics full size in virtual reality br As part of a plan to develop Dota into a social network Newell announced in April that the game would be free to play and that community contributions would be a cornerstone feature Instead revenue is generated through the Dota Store which offers for purchase cosmetic virtual goods such as custom armor and weapons for their heroes It was announced that the full roster of heroes would be available at launch for free Until the game s release in players were able to purchase an early access bundle which included a digital copy of Dota and several cosmetic items Included as optional downloadable content DLC the Dota Workshop Tools are a set of Source software development kit SDK tools that allow content creators to create new hero cosmetics as well as custom game modes maps and bot scripts Highly rated cosmetics through the Steam Workshop are available in the in game store if they are accepted by Valve This model was fashioned after Valve s Team Fortress which had earned Workshop designers of cosmetic items of that game over million by June Newell revealed that the average Steam Workshop contributor for Dota and Team Fortress made approximately from their creations in By sales of Dota virtual goods had earned Valve over million in revenue according to the digital game market research group SuperData In Valve introduced the Custom Game Pass option for creators of custom game modes which allows them to be funded by way of microtransactions by adding exclusive features content and other changes to their game mode for players who buy it br Dota includes a seasonal Elo rating based matchmaking system which is measured by a numerical value known as matchmaking rating MMR that is tracked separately for core and support roles and ranked into different tiers MMR is updated based on if a player won or lost which will then increase or decrease respectively The game s servers known as the Game Coordinator attempts to balance both teams based on each player s MMR with each team having roughly a chance to win in any given game Ranked game modes with a separately tracked MMR are also available which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible as well as requiring the registration of a phone number to their accounts which help foster a more competitive environment To ensure that each player s ranking is up to date and accurate MMR is recalibrated around every six months Players with the highest possible medal rank are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard separated into North American European Southeast Asian and Chinese regions The game includes a report system which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience Players who get reported enough or leave several games before they conclude a practice known as abandoning are placed into low priority matchmaking which remains on a player s account until they win a specific number of games and only groups them with other players who have the same punishment Other features include an improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients in which a completed game can be downloaded in client and viewed by anyone at a later time and the hero builds feature which provide integrated guides created by the community that highlight to the player on how to play their hero br br br Dota Reborn br In June Valve announced that Dota would be ported over to their Source game engine in an update called Dota Reborn Reborn was released as an opt in beta update that same month and replaced the original client in September making it the first game to use the engine Reborn included a new user interface framework design ability for custom game modes created by the community and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source Largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following its release However after various updates and patches over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of with that number being the largest in nearly a year The move to Source allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API released as an optional feature in May making Dota one of the first games to use it br br br Release br br Dota was made available to the public at Gamescom in coinciding with the inaugural International championship the game s premier esport tournament event At the event Valve began sending out closed beta invitations to DotA players and attendees Although the game was originally meant to publicly release in Valve later scrapped that plan as it would have kept the game in its closed beta state for over a year Owing to that Valve lifted the non disclosure agreement and transitioned the game into open beta in September allowing players to discuss the game and their experiences publicly br Following nearly two years of beta testing Dota was released on Steam for Windows on July and for OS X and Linux on July The game did not launch with every hero from Defense of the Ancients Instead the missing ones were added in various post release updates with the final one as well as the first Dota original hero being added in Two months following the game s release Newell claimed that updates to Dota generated up to three percent of global internet traffic In December the final restrictions against unlimited global access to Dota were lifted after the game s infrastructure and servers were substantially bolstered In order to abide by the standards set by the economic legislation of specific countries Valve opted to contract with nationally based developers for publishing In October Chinese game publisher Perfect World announced they had received distribution rights for the game in the country The Chinese client has a region specific Low Violence mode which removes most depictions of blood gore and skulls in order for the game to follow censorship policies of the country In November a similar publishing deal was made with the South Korea based game company Nexon to distribute and market the game in the country as well as in Japan Three years later Nexon announced they would no longer be operating servers for Dota with Valve taking over direct distribution and marketing of the game in those regions br In December Dota was updated to gameplay version also known as The New Journey update Prior to the update the Dota series had been in version xx for over a decade marking the first major revision since IceFrog originally took over development of the original mod in the mid s The New Journey update added and changed numerous features and mechanics of the game including adding the first original hero not ported over from Defense of the Ancients a reworked map a redesigned HUD a pre game phase that allows for players to discuss their team strategy and a Talent Tree ability augmentation system In April Valve announced changes to the game s ranked matchmaking system with the main one requiring the registration of a unique phone number to a player s account in order to play them an anti griefing and smurfing practice they had previously implemented in their first person shooter game Counter Strike Global Offensive Further changes to the game s matchmaking were brought in an update in November where the old numerical MMR system was replaced by a seasonal one based on eight ranked tiers that are recalibrated around every six months a move that brought the game s ranked system closer to ones used in other competitive games such as Global Offensive StarCraft and League of Legends br For most of Valve decided to handle gameplay balance updates for the game in a different way Instead of releasing larger updates irregularly throughout the year smaller ones would be released on a set schedule of every two weeks Around the same time the game introduced the Dota Plus monthly subscription system that replaced the seasonal battle passes that were released to coincide with a Major tournament In addition to offering everything battle passes previously did Dota Plus added features such as a hero specific achievement system that reward players who complete them with exclusive cosmetics as well as providing hero and game analytics and statistics gathered from thousands of recent games br br br Esports br br To ensure that enough Defense of the Ancients players would take up Dota and to promote the game to a new audience Valve invited sixteen accomplished Defense of the Ancients esports teams to compete at a Dota specific tournament at Gamescom in August which later became an annually held event known as The International From The International onward its prize pool began to be crowdfunded through a type of in game battle pass called the Compendium which raises money from players buying them and connected lootboxes to get exclusive in game cosmetics and other bonuses offered through them of all the revenue made from Compendiums go directly to the prize pool with sales from the battle pass raising over US million which made it the largest prize pool in esports history at the time From until each iteration of the International surpassed the previous one s prize pool with The International peaking at million br During its beta phase in the early s several other esport events would begin hosting Dota events including the Electronic Sports World Cup DreamHack World Cyber Games and ESL By the end of Dota was already one of the highest paying esport games second to StarCraft II At E South Korean company Nexon announced the investment of billion approximately US million into local leagues in the country which coincided with their distribution partnership with Valve for the game In February Valve sponsored and held the Dota Asia Championships in Shanghai with a prize pool of over million raised through compendium sales In total professional Dota tournaments had earned teams and players over million by June with over half of that being awarded at Internationals making it the highest earning esport game by a margin of nearly million at the time br br From late until early Valve sponsored a series of smaller scale seasonally held tournaments known as the Dota Major Championships which all had fixed prize pools of US million Their format was based on the tournament series of the same name that Valve also sponsored for their first person shooter game Counter Strike Global Offensive Including The International and which were considered to be the cumulative Major of their respective seasons the series had five other events which were the Frankfurt Major Shanghai Major Manila Major Boston Major and Kiev Major Following the International the Majors were replaced with the Dota Pro Circuit DPC format due to criticism by teams and fans for Valve s non transparent and unpredictable nature for handing out International invitations In the DPC teams are awarded qualification points for their performance in sponsored tournaments with the top twelve earning direct invites to that season s International To avoid conflicting dates with other tournaments Valve directly manages the scheduling of them br The primary medium for professional Dota coverage is the live streaming platform Twitch For most major events tournament coverage is done by a selection of dedicated esports organizations and personnel who provide on site commentary analysis and player interviews similar to traditional sporting events Coverage of Dota tournaments have been simulcast on television networks such as ESPN in the United States BBC Three in the United Kingdom Sport in Germany TV Zulu in Denmark Xinwen Lianbo in China Astro in Malaysia and TV in the Philippines br br br Reception br br Dota received universal acclaim according to review aggregator Metacritic and has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time In a preview of the game in Rich McCormick of PC Gamer thought that Dota was an unbelievably deep and complex game that offers the purest sequel to the original Defense of the Ancients Rewarding like few others but tough Adam Biessener the editor who authored the announcement article for Dota for Game Informer in praised Valve for maintaining the same mechanics and game balance that made Defense of the Ancients successful nearly a decade prior and Quintin Smith of Eurogamer described Dota as the supreme form of the MOBA which everyone else working in the genre is trying to capture like lightning in a bottle The most frequently praised aspects of the game were its depth delivery and overall balance Chris Thursten of PC Gamer described the gameplay as being deep and rewarding br Martin Gaston of GameSpot complimented Valve for the artistic design and delivery of Dota citing the execution of the user interface design voice acting and characterization as exceeding those of the game s competitors Phill Cameron of IGN and James Kozanitis of Hardcore Gamer both praised Dota for its free to play business model including only cosmetic items in contrast to other games such as League of Legends which charges to unlock better heroes to play as with Kozanitis stating that Dota was the only game to do free to play right Nick Kolan of IGN agreed comparing the game s business model to Valve s Team Fortress which uses a nearly identical system Post release additions to the game were praised such as the addition of virtual reality VR support in Ben Kuchera of Polygon thought that spectating games in VR was amazing comparing it to being able to watch an American football game on television with the ability to jump onto the field at any time to see the quarterback s point of view Chris Thursten of PC Gamer agreed calling the experience incredible and unlike any other esports spectating system that existed prior to it Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica also praised the addition believing that the functionality could attract serious attention from gamers and non gamers alike br While the majority of reviewers gave Dota highly positive reviews a common criticism was that the game maintains a steep learning curve that requires exceptional commitment to overcome While providing a moderately positive review that praised Valve s product stability Fredrik slund from the Swedish division of Gamereactor described his first match of Dota as one of the most humiliating and inhospitable experiences of his gaming career citing the learning curve and players attitudes as unwelcoming Benjamin Danneberg of GameStar alluded to the learning curve as a learning cliff calling the newcomer s experience painful with the tutorial feature new to the Dota franchise only being partially successful In a review for Metro Dota was criticized for not compensating for the flaws with the learning curve from Defense of the Ancients as well as the often hostile community Peter Bright of Ars Technica also directed criticism at the ability for third party websites to allow skin gambling and betting on match results similar to controversies that also existed with Valve s Counter Strike Global Offensive Using Dota as an example Bright thought that Valve had built gambling elements directly into their games and had issues with the unregulated practice which he said was often used by underage players and regions where gambling is illegal Australian senator Nick Xenophon had similar sentiment stating that he wanted to introduce legislation in his country to minimize underage access to gambling within video games including Dota In response to the controversy Valve and Dota project manager Erik Johnson stated that they would be taking action against the third party sites as the practice was not allowed by their user agreements or API br Comparisons of Dota to other MOBA games are commonplace with the mechanics and business model compared to League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm Contrasting it with League of Legends T J Hafer of PC Gamer called Dota the superior experience stating that he thought the game was all about counterplay with most of the heroes being designed to directly counter another Hafer also preferred the way the game handled its hero selection pool with all of them being unlocked right from the start unlike in League of Legends Comparing Dota to Heroes of the Storm Jason Parker of CNET said that while Heroes of the Storm was easier to get into the complexities and depth of Dota would be appreciated more by those who put in the time to master it Further comparing it to Heroes of Newerth players from the professional Dota team OG said that most Heroes of Newerth players were able to transition over easily to the game due to the strong similarities that both games share Similar to other highly competitive online games Dota is often considered to have a hostile and toxic community In a report by the Anti Defamation League found that up to of the game s playerbase had reported being harassed in some way while playing it which topped their list br br br Awards br Following its reveal in Dota won IGN s People s Choice Award In December PC Gamer listed Dota as a nominee for their Game of the Year award as well as the best esports game of the year In Dota won the esport game of the year award from PC Gamer and onGamers GameTrailers also awarded the game the award for Best PC Game of with IGN also awarding it the Best PC Strategy Tactics Game Best PC Multiplayer Game and People s Choice Award

Theft Auto V and was nominated for Esports Game of the Year at The Game Awards at its events from to while winning the award for best MOBA at the Global Game Awards The game was also nominated for the community created Love Hate Relationship award at the inaugural Steam Awards in In the late s the game was nominated for Choice Video Game at the Teen Choice Awards for Esports Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards and as IGN s best spectator game br br br Legacy br br A month prior to its launch Dota was already the most played game on Steam with a concurrent player count of nearly which outweighed the number of players for the rest of platform s top ten most played games combined It remained as the most played game by concurrent players on the platform for four years having a peak of over one million and never dropping below first place for any extended period of time until being surpassed by PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds in Viewership and followings of professional Dota leagues and tournaments are popular with peak viewership numbers of the International in the millions Some Asian schools and universities such as the Asia Pacific University of Technology Innovation in Malaysia have held courses teaching students the fundamentals and core skills to use for the game Dota has been a part of multi sport events in Asia such as the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and Southeast Asian Games br br The popularity of Dota led Valve to produce apparel accessories figurines and several other products featuring the heroes and other elements from the game In addition Valve secured licensing contracts with third party producers the first of these deals concerned a Dota themed SteelSeries mousepad which was announced alongside the game at Gamescom In September W t Workshop the prop studio that creates the Aegis of Champions trophy for winners of The International announced a product line that would include statues weapons and armor based on characters and items from the game In February the National Entertainment Collectibles Association announced a new toy line featuring hero themed action figures at the American International Toy Fair At Gamescom an HTC Vive virtual reality VR tech demo based around the shopkeeper of the game s item shop was showcased allowing participants to interact with various items and objects from the game in VR The demo known as Secret Shop was later included the following year on The Lab Valve s virtual reality compilation game After the conclusion of The International Valve awarded the Collector s Aegis of Champions a brass replica of the Aegis of Champions award trophy to those with compendiums of levels or more Valve awarded the Collector s Aegis again the following year for The International as well as selling a limited edition Dota themed HTC Vive virtual reality headset during the event In July an track music soundtrack was released by Ipecac Recordings including a version on vinyl A digital collectible card game based on the universe of Dota and designed by Magic The Gathering creator Richard Garfield and Valve Artifact was released in November br Promotional tie ins to other video games and media have been added to Dota including custom Half Life Bastion Portal The Stanley Parable Rick and Morty Fallout Deus Ex Mankind Divided and Darkest Dungeon announcer packs which replace the game s default announcer with ones based on those franchises In addition to announcer packs musical artists have written music packs that can replace the game s default soundtrack such as electronic music artist deadmau and Singaporean songwriter JJ Lin To coincide with the Windows release of Square Enix s Final Fantasy Type HD in August a bundle containing a custom loading screen a Moogle ward and a Chocobo courier were added the same month In April Valve announced a cross promotional workshop contest for Sega s Total War Warhammer with the winning entries being included in the game later that year In a cosmetic set based on the Companion Cube from the Portal series was released as part of that year s International battle pass for the hero known as Io In December of the same year the character Amaterasu from Capcom s kami was included as a courier for those who had pre ordered the PC release of the game br br A documentary on the game and its professional scene was produced by Valve and released in March Known as Free to Play the film follows three players during their time at the first International in American basketball player Jeremy Lin who was a media sensation at the time had a guest appearance in the film and called the game a way of life Lin later compared the game and the esports scene in general to basketball and other traditional sporting events saying that there was not much of a difference between the two while comparing various NBA all stars such as Stephen Curry Kobe Bryant and LeBron James to different heroes in the game Starting in Valve began producing an episodic documentary series titled True Sight a spiritual successor to Free to Play The first three episodes followed the professional teams Evil Geniuses and Fnatic during the Boston Major tournament in late Several more episodes have since been produced Valve have also endorsed cosplay competitions featuring the game s heroes which take place during downtime at some Dota tournaments and feature prize pools of their own Creation of Dota themed animations and CGI videos mostly created by the community with Source Filmmaker also take place Similar to the cosplay competitions Valve holds short film contests every year at The International with winners of the competition also being awarded prize money In addition Valve have created free webcomics featuring some of the heroes further detailing their background lore A physical collection of the comics was released as Dota The Comic Collection by Dark Horse Comics in August An anime streaming television series based on the game Dota Dragon s Blood premiered on Netflix in March The series was produced by Studio Mir and Kaiju Boulevard br Dota has been used in machine learning experiments with the American artificial intelligence research company OpenAI curating a system known as the OpenAI Five that allows bots to learn how to play the game at a high skill level entirely through trial and error algorithms The bots learn over time by playing against itself hundreds a times a day for months in a system that OpenAI calls reinforcement learning in which they are rewarded for actions such as killing an enemy and destroying towers Demonstrations of the bots playing against professional players have occurred at some events such as Dendi a professional Ukrainian player of the game losing to one of them in a live v matchup at The International A year later the ability of the bots had increased to work together as a full team of five known as the OpenAI Five who then played and won against a team of semi professional players in a demonstration game in August Shortly after OpenAI Five then played two live games against more skilled players at The International Although the bots lost both games OpenAI considered it successful as playing the bots against some of the best players in Dota allowed them to analyze and adjust their algorithms for future games In OpenAI Five was able to defeat the reigning International champion OG br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website
