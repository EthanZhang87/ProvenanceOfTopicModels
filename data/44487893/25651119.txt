Season take place after the war between Simba s pride Zira s outsiders br br br Cast and characters br br A total of thirteen supervising animators from Walt Disney Animation Studios and Disney s Hollywood Studios were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the first film s main characters The animation team studied real life animals for reference as was done for the earlier film Bambi The animation of the characters was created with supervision by wildlife experts such as Jim Fowler who visited the studio on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other jungle inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads and show affection by placing one s head under the other s chin mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala s encounter during the song Can You Feel the Love Tonight Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs Screenwriter Irene Mecchi joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character s personality Story head Brenda Chapman gave insight to the challenge of the characters and the story by stating that it was our job to make the main character likeable and sympathetic It was also challenging to make the environment and characters interesting In real life lions basically sleep eat and have no props br Two spin off

Little Toaster as work for hire Disch received no credit or royalties Production took place at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in Glendale California Also nearly minutes of the film were animated at the Disney MGM Studios Ultimately more than artists animators and technicians contributed to The Lion King over its lengthy production schedule More than one million drawings were created for the film including hand painted backgrounds and individually colored frames of film br In October after finishing work on Beauty and the Beast as Head of Story Roger Allers joined The Lion King as the initial director Allers worked for months on story development and was then joined by co director Rob Minkoff A day story session was held to revamp the story with the two directors Allers and Minkoff joined by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise directors of Beauty and the Beast and Producer Don Hahn who presided over the discussion The creative think tank produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film Irene Mecchi joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities Several months later she was joined by Jonathan Roberts in the rewriting process Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations Some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film The trip gave production designer Chris Sanders a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film The filmmakers also made use of computers to better present their vision in new ways The most notable use of computer animation is in the wildebeest stampede sequence Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a D computer program multiplied into hundreds cel shaded to look like drawn animation and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real unpredictable movement of a herd Similar multiplication occurs in the Be Prepared musical number with identical marching hyenas Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the minute stampede sequence br At one time the Disney Feature Animation staff felt The Lion King was less important than Pocahontas Both projects were in production at the same time and most of the staff preferred to work on Pocahontas believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two As it turned out while both films were commercial successes The Lion King received more positive feedback and larger grosses than Pocahontas br The sequel The Lion King II Simba s Pride was directed by Darrell Rooney and produced by Jeannine Roussel with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay Disney believed that Simba s Pride would be so popular that it shipped

supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by Lebo M Elton John thought his career had hit a new low when he was writing the music to the song Hakuna Matata However the strongly enthusiastic audience reception to an early film trailer which consisted solely of the opening sequence with the song Circle of Life suggested that the film would be very successful Out of
