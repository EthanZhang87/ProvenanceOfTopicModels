Ms Pac Man is a maze arcade video game developed by General Computer Corporation and published by Midway It is a spin off sequel to Pac Man and the first entry in the series to not be made by Namco Controlling the title character Pac Man s wife the player is tasked with eating all of the pellets in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts Eating the larger power pellets lets the player eat the ghosts who turn blue and flee br General Computer made the game as a modification kit for the original Pac Man titled Crazy Otto However due to previous legal action with Atari GCC was forced to present the project to Midway the North American distributor of Pac Man Midway purchased the project and enlisted GCC to use the game as a basis for the sequel to Pac Man Multiple names were considered for the game including Miss Pac Man and Mrs Pac Man before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce While development had started without Namco s consent company president Masaya Nakamura was brought in and provided feedback on the player character s design The company ultimately collected the same royalties on each cabinet as they had with Pac Man br Ms Pac Man was acclaimed by critics for its improvements to the original gameplay and for having a female protagonist some have described it as superior to Pac Man It has been listed among the greatest video games of all time and as one of the most successful American arcade games ever made The game s success inspired a variety of successful merchandise several ports for numerous home consoles and handheld systems a television cartoon that included Pac Man and numerous video game sequels and remakes that spawned a Ms Pac Man video game spin off series The rights to the game are owned by Namco s successor company Bandai Namco Entertainment However the game and its title character have suffered various legal ownership issues between Namco and General Computer Corporation br br br Gameplay br br The gameplay is very similar to that of Pac Man The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts contact with one causes Ms Pac Man to lose a life Eating an energizer or power pellet causes the ghosts to turn blue allowing them to be eaten for extra points Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values twice per round As the rounds increase the speed increases and energizers generally lessen the duration of the ghosts vulnerability eventually stopping altogether br br br Differences from Pac Man br The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game s intermissions are seen The pink maze appears in levels one and two the light blue maze appears in levels three four and five the brown maze appears in levels six to nine and the dark blue maze appears in levels to After level the maze configurations alternate every fourth level br The first second and fourth mazes have two sets of warp tunnels as opposed to only one in the original maze br The walls have a solid color rather than an outline which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are br The orange ghost is called Sue rather than Clyde her color was later changed to purple in Pac Land to differentiate her br The ghosts behavioral patterns are different and include semi random movement which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round Blinky red and Pinky pink move randomly in the first several seconds of each level until the first reversal Inky cyan and Sue orange still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners again until the first reversal br Instead of appearing in the center of the maze the fruits bounce around the maze entering and if not eaten leaving through the warp tunnels Once all fruit has been encountered they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game starting on the eighth round a point banana can be followed by a point pair of cherries br When Ms Pac Man makes contact with a ghost and dies she spins around or as the back of the flier says she dramatically swoons and falls rather than folding in on herself as the original Pac Man did br The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac Man and Ms Pac Man from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby The latter served as the basis for Baby Pac Man and is referenced in Jr Pac Man br The slowdown applied to the ghosts in the warp tunnels only applies for the first three rounds in this game br The sound effects and music are all new br br br Development br Ms Pac Man was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for Pac Man called Crazy Otto created by programmers employed at the General Computer Corporation GCC While Crazy Otto was under development GCC settled a lawsuit with Atari Inc over their Missile Command conversion kit Super Missile Attack Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling future conversion kits without consent from the original game manufacturer br Rather than scrapping Crazy Otto entirely the programmers chose to present the completed game to Midway Namco s American distributor of Pac Man Midway was enthusiastic that such a game had come to their attention as they were hoping to capitalize on the success of Pac Man with a sequel They bought the rights to Crazy Otto and worked with GCC and Namco to prepare the game for release In final development the game s name and characters experienced multiple changes Sprites text and minor game elements were altered to better reflect the Pac Man series br The game was initially titled Super Pac Man containing Pac Man as the lead character Inspired by the cutscenes of Crazy Otto featuring Crazy Otto s female counterpart the lead character was made female and the game was renamed Pac Woman That name was dropped in favor of Miss Pac Man but the developers then realized that given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby to Pac Man and the player s character confusion could arise about their relationship In light of this the name was changed to Mrs Pac Man and then finally to Ms Pac Man which rolled off the tongue more easily Programmer Steve Golson said In the span of just two weeks it went from Crazy Otto to Super Pac Man to Miss Pac Man These later changes Miss Mrs and Ms all occurred within hours of actual production br Shortly before release Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that Ms Pac Man was conceived in part as a response to the original Pac Man being the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players and that it was our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed Pac Man According to one estimate a majority of Pac Man players were women This is corroborated by marketing chief Michael Leone of the Castle Park Entertainment Center who noted that his company noticed a recent trend in our game pavilions that indicates a tremendous female acceptance of the Pac Man game further noting that it was only natural for Midway to introduce a Ms Pac Man br GCC co founder Doug Macrae noted that Masaya Nakamura Namco s president at the time gave him direct feedback on the Ms Pac Man character In an interview Macrae said We sent out ROMs to Midway and they sent them over to Japan for the President of Namco Masaya Nakamura to look at He said Love the concept get rid of the hair He added There was a little bit of embarrassment at Namco of the fact that the sequel was being done somewhere other than in their own laboratories The arrangement that Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on Ms Pac Man and Midway could choose to do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco br Toru Iwatani the creator of Pac Man is not known to have publicly commented on Ms Pac Man despite questions from reporters br br br Ownership br The GCC group agreed on October to give the rights to Ms Pac Man to Midway in exchange for royalty payments for the game s sale At the time Midway held the license from Namco for distribution of Pac Man games advertising and merchandise in North America After the game became wildly successful Midway and GCC undertook a legal battle concerning merchandise royalties before ultimately reaching a settlement in This settlement stated that GCC members would be paid royalties by Midway for usage of Ms Pac Man in commercial contexts br Namco now Bandai Namco made an additional agreement with the GCC stakeholders in While Bandai Namco does control the Ms Pac Man copyright and intellectual property some royalty rights and obligations are unresolved br br br AtGames dispute br In August AtGames a company that specializes in microconsoles featuring older arcade games acquired the royalties owed to GCC AtGames had initially approached the GCC group members about licensing Ms Pac Man for potential products Bandai Namco on learning that AtGames had been seeking these rights for a possible mini arcade game filed a lawsuit against AtGames alleging that AtGames misrepresented itself as licensed to make Ms Pac Man products and created Ms Pac Man mini cabinets under those claims It also alleged false advertising unfair competition and copyright infringement br The case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice on October following a request by Bandai Namco Presiding Judge Vince Chhabria stated that all involved parties had resolved the case of their own accord The details of the settlement were kept confidential and the current status of the Ms Pac Man royalties is undisclosed br Beginning with the Arcade Archives release of Pac Land in the Ms Pac Man character has been removed from games which previously featured her In her place is a new character known as Pac Mom who also replaces her in the Pac Man Museum versions of Pac Land Pac In Time and Pac Attack and in Pac Man World Re Pac a remake of Pac Man World Bandai Namco
