total App Store games in to in Some analysts argue that this is a contributing factor to the development and founding of Apple Arcade with the economic perspective that consumers will be more incentivized to pay a subscription fee to access a range of premium apps rather than purchasing individual premium games Others have argued that Apple Arcade is another source of revenue for Apple and enables them to compete with other video game subscription services like Google Play Pass and Xbox Game Pass br Apple spent million to launch Apple Arcade Apple pays app developers an upfront fee to
