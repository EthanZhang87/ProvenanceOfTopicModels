points Additionally there are Pac Man th Anniversary Statues in each level which each grant the player points and award a bonus if all statues are collected The Butt Bounce move is now modified so that it can only be done three times at once but the third bounce creates a small shockwave that slightly extends the radius of the attack The Rev Roll is mostly the same but can now be stopped before launching Pac Man by pressing the jump button Rev Rolling can also activate machines and allow Pac Man to call Pinky and Clyde through a Summon Point New moves include punching as well as acrobatic moves with poles such as swinging and climbing B Doings also reappear but now only serve to launch Pac Man into a single predetermined direction and Pac Dot Chains are now generated by machines that are activated using crystals with the same color The game also features more elements of story with a plot that is fleshed out by cutscenes and voiced character dialogue br The power pellet is now reserved only for special sequences where Pac Man must eat them to defeat Spectral Monsters a special type of creature from the Spectral Realm that appears from portals and try to attack Pac Man this method works exactly like in previous games In addition new types of pellets can be eaten to try to give Pac Man an advantage over the enemies such as Electro Shock Pellet which replaces Pac Man s punch attack with the ability to generate electricity from his hands and the Ribbon Loop Pellet which has Pac Man leave a trail that can be enclosed to greatly damage enemies within br Two sequences
