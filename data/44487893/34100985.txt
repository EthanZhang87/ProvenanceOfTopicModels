Hunters as a match three video game Temple Run also received activity books and a board game with Warner Bros Pictures talking with Imangi Studios of a possible film adaptation The success of the game also inspired multiple games that copy Temple Run s gameplay and branding br br br Gameplay br br In Temple Run the player controls either Guy Dangerous an average explorer Scarlett Fox an escape artist Barry Bones a city cop Karma Lee the fastest runner in the Far East Montana Smith the second greatest explorer ever referring to Indiana Jones being the greatest explorer Francisco Montoya a Spanish conquistador or Zack Wonder a football star The character chosen will embark on an adventure to seek an ancient and valuable golden idol from an Aztec temple They will not realize that the temple is inhabited by a family of demonic monkeys who wants to devour them As the game is an endless running game there is no end to the temple the player plays until the character collides into a large obstacle falls into the water or is overtaken by the demon monkeys all resulting in a game over br While the character is running the player can tilt their device left or right to move the character to either side of the screen to collect coins and or avoid obstacles There are three types of coins to be found while the character is running gold red and blue A gold coin will only add one coin to the player s total number of coins Red coins are worth two coins while blue coins are worth three The coins can be used to buy and then upgrade power ups and or other characters Coins can also be bought by the player through in app purchases with payments of actual money If the player wishes to turn left or right the touchscreen can be swiped in the corresponding direction If the player wishes to jump over an object the screen can be swiped upwards and if they wish to slide under an object the screen can be swiped downwards br br br Development br Temple Run was designed programmed and produced by husband and wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova with art by Kiril Tchangov The game took a total of four months to develop Development began after the financial failure of Imangi Studios previous game Max Adventure and used that game to prototype Temple Run s controls Imangi Studios wanted to make a quick game with simpler controls in contrast to Max Adventure s dual analog controls br Keith started the prototype by making a game where the character is always running and can be controlled by rotating the environment from a top down perspective This idea was scrapped due to causing extreme dizziness during testing To fix the problem constraints were added so that players can only make turns and perspective be fixed behind the character When it came to the game s aesthetics multiple ideas were conceptualized but ultimately settled for the character to running on a pathway resembling the Great Wall of China or Aztec temple br After the temple design was solidified Imangi Studios questioned the player character s motivation for constantly running without any breaks and came up with the idea of having something chasing him Imangi Studios originally had the aliens from Max Adventure as placeholders Kiril created the design of evil demon monkeys and gave them skull masks due to his desire of adding skulls in games he s involved in Natalia initially did not like having evil demon monkeys chasing the player character and found them terrifying Keith and Kiril however liked the evil demon monkeys and convinced Natalia to remain in the final product Natalia later admitted that they were right and that it added immediacy and adrenaline br The coin and gem mechanic was originally intended to be a variety of colored gems where the player would receive different bonuses depending on what combination of gems was obtained similar to Poker hand rankings but was proven too difficult to achieve and was scrapped Natalia mentioned coins and Gems were particularly frustrating to add into the game that at one point were removed during development but were added back due to the team missing them br br br Release br The game was released on the App Store on August The game was originally for cents to download but was switched to freemium prior to December br After the release of its sequel Temple Run the game renamed to Temple Run Classic br On January Imangi Studios announced on the Temple Run Facebook page that the game would be released for the Android platform in February The game was released on Google Play on March a month later than expected As Temple Run was originally released with a custom flexible engine on iOS there were some difficulties when it was ported to Android primarily related to the use of the Unity game engine The game frequently crashed occasionally caused devices to overheat and drained battery life extremely quickly This led to generally unfavourable reviews br On March the game was released for Windows Phone br An arcade version was developed by Coastal Amusements and released on The arcade version was discontinued some time after br br br Related media br In November The Hollywood Reporter reported that Warner Bros Pictures and producer David Heyman were in talks with Imangi Studios to make a movie version of Temple Run br In July a Temple Run fiction series and an activity book was

app The Android version was downloaded one million times within three days of its release As of June Temple Run and its sequel have been downloaded over billion times br The Arcade version won the BOSA Awards bronze medal for Videmption Arcade Games br br br Critical response br br Temple Run has been generally well received amongst critics The iOS version holds an aggregate score of out of on Metacritic based on reviews Phillip Levin of Apps praised the gameplay but criticizing the backgrounds my big qualm with Temple Run lies in the fact that the majority of the game s scenery looks the same Yeah the scenery does change here and there but most of the time gamers are running through ruined temple pathways that look consistently the same It all starts to blur together after a while AppSpy s Andrew Nesvadba was more impressed writing Temple Run tightens up and polishes the endless runner for the rd dimension giving players a unique and fun challenge that controls like a dream TouchArcade s Nissa Campbell praising its move away from the one button jumping control system of most endless runners as well as the game s milieu Any endless runner worth the name will give you high tension situations and that one more time compulsion But Temple Run is probably the only one that also makes you feel like a daring archaeologist with a penchant for deadly situations br Gamezebo s Art Green called it an instant iPhone classic and writing addictive doesn t even accurately describe the game Enthralling gameplay as the game speeds up Objectives add goals that keep you playing Slide to Play s Andrew Webster praised the upgrade system D graphics and controls concluding Even if you think you re sick of automatic runners Temple Run proves there s still much life left in the genre It matches the sheer thrill and intensity of Canabalt but with a completely new theme and perspective We ve all wanted to be Indiana Jones at some point and now s your chance br IGN s Justin Davis praised the game s depth and upgrade system which he felt distinguished it from other endless runners such as Canabalt and Robot Unicorn Attack He concluded that Temple Run is a fast and frenzied iPhone experience The combination of swiping and tilt controls give each session a frantic feeling Gamers craving a new iOS time waster should give Temple Run a long look br PC Magazine s Laarni Almendrala Ragaza called the initial Android version crisp with snappy navigation They also included it in their Mobile Apps to keep Kids Happy list br br br Legacy br br br Imitators br In the wake of Temple Run s success other developers created games of a similar style such as Temple Guns Temple Jump Piggy Run Zombie Run and Pyramid Run Imangi Studios co founder Keith Shepherd found it flattering that developers were inspired by the game to create interesting games that make them unique However Shepard also found it frustrating when developers took exact gameplay branding and assets from their original game This led to many of those games including one from indie developer Anton Sinelnikov being removed from the App Store br br br Sequels and spin offs br br Temple Run was followed by several sequels and spin offs becoming the first game in the Temple Run series The second entry in the series is Temple Run Brave and is a spin off based on the film Brave It was released
