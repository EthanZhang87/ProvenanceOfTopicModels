Invader Zim is an American animated science fiction dark comedy television series created by comic book writer and cartoonist Jhonen Vasquez for Nickelodeon The series centers on an extraterrestrial named Zim voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz from the planet Irk and his mission is to conquer Earth and enslave the human race along with his malfunctioning robot servant GIR Rosearik Rikki Simons He is antagonized by Dib Andy Berman a young paranormal investigator who is determined to stop Zim from succeeding br Nickelodeon contacted Jhonen Vasquez about pitching ideas for an animated series for their older demographic and Invader Zim was the first thing he pitched In Vasquez s words it went from pitch to series without hardly any waiting As the series went on ratings declined and budgetary issues became more frequent Before the second season was completed Nickelodeon cancelled the series leaving several episodes unfinished The show originally aired on Nickelodeon from to with six of the completed second season episodes initially going unreleased These episodes were first made available on DVD in and later made their television debut on the Nicktoons Network in br Invader Zim received positive reviews from critics and audiences with praise primarily directed at its humor writing animation art style and the way it pushed the boundaries of what was considered acceptable on children s television In the years following its cancellation Invader Zim has often been listed as one of Nickelodeon s best shows The series won an Annie Award an Emmy Award and a World Animation Celebration Award and received nominations for seven additional Annie Awards and two Golden Reel Awards Invader Zim has spawned its own fan convention called InvaderCON and a plethora of official merchandise including video games toys clothing and accessories among many other products Despite its early cancellation and short run due to increasing popularity and above average merchandise sales it has been widely regarded as a cult classic br A monthly comic book series of the same name was released on July as a continuation of the television series and published by Oni Press until August A film based on the television and comic series titled Invader Zim Enter the Florpus premiered on Netflix on August marking Invader Zim s first new animated production since its Nickelodeon airing br br br Plot br br The series centers on Zim voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz a member of the extraterrestrial Irken species and the Irken Empire from the planet Irk The empire s goal is universal conquest and has a social hierarchy based solely on physical height The empire s leader is called The Almighty Tallest at the beginning of the series the position is jointly held by two equally tall individuals Wally Wingert and Kevin McDonald Zim is an outcast he is delusional very short overzealous narcissistic and megalomaniacal br An absentminded Zim nearly destroyed Irk and the Irkens during the empire s first invasion Operation Impending Doom I He was punished by exile to the Irken food court planet Foodcourtia although he failed to recognize the reason for his banishment After learning that Operation Impending Doom II was being planned Zim unilaterally quits being banished to attend the Great Assigning on the convention center planet Conventia At the Great Assigning The Tallest appoints Irkens as Invaders advance scouts tasked with infiltrating and preparing target planets for conquest by the Irken Armada Zim successfully pleads to be made an Invader and receives a secret mission intended to prevent interference with the invasion the target mystery planet is on the outskirts of the known universe and is not confirmed to exist He is issued GIR Rosearik Rikki Simons an ineffective and erratic Standard Issue Information Retrieval SIR unit hastily made from spare parts found in a trash can br After a six month journey across the universe Zim arrives at the mystery planet which turns out to be a dark dystopian and satirical version of Earth centuries into the future with rampant mindless consumerism although it appears that humans have abolished all wars A delighted Zim quickly goes to work and sets up his base in a random suburb The Tallest are dismayed by his success A short statured Zim disguises himself as a human child with a green complexion which he claims is caused by a skin condition The show follows his attempts to conduct espionage by attending a local school spelled Skool and planning to conquer and enslave the world at his base Opposing Zim is his classmate Dib Andy Berman a paranoid young boy who is obsessed with the paranormal and supernatural and the only human besides his sister who sees through Zim s disguise Dib is determined to expose and thwart Zim despite the hostility and mockery he receives from his oblivious peers for doing so br Supporting characters include Dib s cynical and apathetic sister Gaz Melissa Fahn Zim and Dib s demonic teacher Ms Bitters Lucille Bliss and Dib and Gaz s famous but neglectful father Professor Membrane Rodger Bumpass Later in the series other alien characters begin to appear including Tak Olivia d Abo a fellow Irken seeking revenge against Zim Lard Nar Fred Tatasciore the leader of a resistance group called The Resisty who wants to overthrow the Irken Empire and Sizz Lorr Jim Wise Zim s former employer from Foodcourtia who attempts to recapture him br br br Episodes br br br Production br br br Conception and early development br br Prior to the creation of Invader Zim Nickelodeon desired a series to suit its year old demographic Nickelodeon producer Mary Harrington was searching for something that had a similar edge to The Ren Stimpy Show when she came across a comic book called Johnny the Homicidal Maniac and was impressed with the art style and character designs in the series Harrington contacted the creator of JtHM then year old Jhonen Vasquez who had zero experience in animation at the time and asked him if he would like to pitch an animated series to Nickelodeon Vasquez accepted the offer br Vasquez knew from the start that his previous works were definitely not suitable for Nickelodeon so instead of adapting something he had already done he decided to make something new Since he was creating a show for a children s network Vasquez compiled together many things he loved during his own childhood including robots monsters horror films science fiction films paranormal investigators Monty Python the works of Douglas Adams and aliens Before settling on the darker concept of an alien invader Vasquez briefly considered doing a more light hearted show along the lines of Mork Mindy with a zany alien misunderstanding Earth customs and ultimately learning a lesson at the end Vasquez said that while this idea probably would have found more success on Nickelodeon he quickly dropped the idea believing it would not fit his style of writing Vasquez came up with the entire premise for Invader Zim in about an hour while sitting in bed when he could not sleep He was inspired by the idea of an alien who came from an incredibly advanced race and has access to such powerful and advanced technology that he could easily take over or destroy the Earth single handedly but instead he decides to stay in school all day never even thinking to sneak out br A pilot for Invader Zim was pitched to Nickelodeon in which led to the series being green lit Vasquez indicated that very little of his writing style was changed over the course of Invader Zim other than restricting certain language and visuals that may not be suitable for children Vasquez cited that the biggest change for himself was going from working alone on a comic to working with thousands of people at Nickelodeon saying it s an absolute misery However he said the experience of working on Invader Zim was incredibly gratifying but also fiendishly frustrating br br br Animation br Invader Zim was produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studios in Burbank California with Nick Digital providing the CGI animation services and Sunwoo Entertainment in South Korea providing the D animation services Salami Studios provided the post production and sound services for most episodes of the series and Encore and Hollywood Digital provided the post production services for a few episodes in season one In season two the animation style became slightly more stylized and pronounced in motion than in season one Invader Zim s art style is stylized with sharp edges thick black outlines big heads small or elongated bodies and big eyes for the characters Invader Zim s art style was initially difficult for the animators to learn Director Steve Ressel even admitted that it was the hardest style he had ever worked on citing the characters heads as the most complicated aspect of their designs br Invader Zim was one of the first animated television shows to merge D animation with CGI animation When the development on Invader Zim was first getting started Steve Ressel consulted with the crew of Futurama to figure out how to integrate D animation with CGI animation since they were one of the first animated television shows that merged the two mediums When the Futurama crew saw the show they were very impressed by how seamlessly the Invader Zim crew integrated both mediums specifically in the episode The Wettening br While the average episode of an eleven minute animated television show usually has around pages of storyboards per episode Invader Zim s storyboards were around pages per episode This is because Invader Zim has a very dedicated attention to detail outlining every ounce of a character s movements and method of acting which is something Nickelodeon was very impressed by br The episode Zim Eats Waffles was originally supposed to be one long shot panning between Dib s reaction and his computer screen This was because the animators wanted to try to have the longest single shot in animation history br However this idea was scrapped due to it limiting the episode s storytelling capabilities and it being too difficult to animate Despite this decision the majority of Zim Eats Waffles still ended up being one continual scene br br br Voice acting br br When casting voice actors for Invader Zim Vasquez did not want actors who were just capable of doing zany voices because it sounded less natural to him He made a point to cast people with speaking voices that were naturally distinct and out of the ordinary so that the cast did not have to do unnatural voices but could instead just speak naturally br Mark Hamill was originally hired to do the voice of Zim for the pilot episode but was replaced before the pilot was shown to Nickelodeon executives because Vasquez felt his voice did not feel right for the character Hamill was replaced by voice acting professional Billy West who remained the voice of Zim for the pilot After the show was picked up for a full series Vasquez decided to replace West with Richard Steven Horvitz who was already voicing the character of Daggett on fellow Nickelodeon series The Angry Beavers saying that West was too well known and that he wanted all of the voices for the main characters to be unique and not voices people had heard before Also due to Futurama still being on the air at the time Vasquez did not want the same voice actor to be the lead in two contemporaneous sci fi comedies br Vasquez wanted someone with no experience in voice acting to play the part of GIR as a reflection of how broken and messed up GIR really is Vasquez wanted someone who sounded unprofessional but all of the actors who auditioned for GIR were good actors who just did a stock crazy robot voice which he found dissatisfying Vasquez then asked his friend Rosearik Rikki Simons who was working with him on his comic called I Feel Sick at the time to try to audition for GIR saying he couldn t screw it up anymore than anyone else Simons did a few different voices for his audition for GIR including one where he was trying to imitate his mother in law but decided it was too shrieky He then remembered when he used to play with hand puppets with his father as a kid and tried to do one of those voices Simons was also a colorist on Invader Zim and in November the same month he auditioned for GIR he also helped color the pilot episode Vasquez said he gave Simons the part of GIR because he was bad at it and that fit the character When voicing GIR Simons voice was edited to make it sound higher pitched and metallic While Simons eventually learned to perform the voice without the high pitch editing the metallic quality still had to be added Unedited versions of Simons voice overs can be heard in voice recordings for the unfinished episodes br br br Music br br Vasquez asked his friend Mark Tortorici to come up with the theme music for Invader Zim Vasquez said all he really wanted for the theme music was military music to represent Zim mixed with futuristic electric orchestral music Once the direction for the music was settled on Tortorici produced the theme music on an Alesis QS very quickly and it did not go through many changes but they did reorchestrate it for the TV series and stuck with it from that point on br Vasquez s team selected Michael Tavera who is known for composing the music for The Land Before Time An American Tail and Stitch The Movie to compose the music for the pilot episode of Invader Zim Vasquez said that he asked for several of the tracks that Tavera produced to be discarded and that ultimately the team had less than half of the number of tracks that they planned to submit According to Vasquez he and Tavera were not a great fit for one another creatively Vasquez described the pilot music as having a more children s television sound with a much more traditional and not as surprising theme as he wanted but added that the music worked for the pilot Tavera s cover version of Tortorici s theme music did not appear in the pilot as there was no opening credits sequence Vasquez said that members of the Invader Zim crew laughed at Tavera s version of the theme because it was cheesy adding that the reaction was not mean spirited and that Tavera had received little information about the series before submitting the music br Tavera did not become a part of the regular Invader Zim crew and was replaced with Kevin Manthei who is also known for composing the music for Generator Rex The Sims PSP and Robot Chicken to compose the series music Manthei s music for the series is industrial and techno in nature br The anime internet radio station Anime Stuff R produced a radio broadcast special titled The Kevin Manthei Invader Zim phony Special which featured a majority of the music Kevin Manthei composed for Invader Zim The broadcast special was hosted by Kevin Manthei DJ Richard Rae and Tom Mitchell DJ Tomzer and was broadcast from September to October The entire broadcast is hours minutes and seconds long and includes music from every episode of Invader Zim except for The Most Horrible X mas Ever The broadcast was extremely popular so Anime Stuff R temporarily renamed Anime Stuff Z for the special decided to release a CD of the broadcast However due to financial reasons they only made copies of this CD There are tracks on the CD and the interior of the CD cover features messages from both Kevin Manthei and Richard Rae br Kevin Manthei s message says br br When I was approached by Richard E Rae about the possibility of an internet radio show featuring hours and hours of my Invader Zim music I was thrilled What a great opportunity to let the fans of Invader Zim hear the music br Richard went way beyond what I thought the show was going to be and he poured his heart and soul into producing the Zim phony br Richard is not just a fan he s a professional who uses his passion for music and his willingness to work hard at it to produce great shows I am honored that he and Tom took the time to put the Zim phony and this Special Edition together br br Happy listening br Richard Rae s message says br br We took chances with the Zim phony Special br I took a chance by approaching Kevin Manthei with the idea Kevin took a chance in trusting his music to someone he only knew from e mail My friend Tom took a chance too okaying a show with music from an American cartoon series instead of a Japanese Anime br These chances definitely paid off The Zim phony Special broke every Anime Stuff R ratings record thanks to the overwhelming response to this show from you the Invader Zim fans br Of course the Zim phony is all about the excellent music of the remarkable Kevin Manthei I certainly owe Kevin more thanks than I can ever hope to articulate for his terrific support during this once in a lifetime experience br br This Mini CD you re holding is proof that some chances are definitely worth taking Thank you for listening br br br Challenges and censorship br Invader Zim would frequently find itself at odds with network censorship In The Medium Sized Book of Zim Scrips Vol series writer Eric Trueheart would characterize the relationship between the Zim staff and the executives at Nickelodeon as a little dysfunctional and that the executive assigned by Nickelodeon to oversee our show who was and still is a decent guy by the way probably felt like he had to keep a lid on an inexperienced show creator and as a result clamped down harder than he should have Trueheart also speculated that the channel s other programming also had an effect on how the executives treated the show stating that Nickelodeon probably looked to Rugrats as the model of what a cartoon should be Invader Zim was none of these things Ultimately There was a just a conflict in personalities intentions and modus operandi The reality was just not a great fit and yes it was a problem br In some episodes it was originally intended for certain characters such as Keef and Iggins to be killed off at the end of an episode but Nickelodeon would not allow any characters to be killed off and demanded the crew add certain details suggesting that they survived or in some cases rewrite the episodes to where they would not die They complied but did so in an intentionally forced and sarcastic way to purposely convey their disagreement and reluctance toward the decision such as the sarcastic No animated characters were harmed in the filming of this production end card message at the end of the episode Hamstergeddon where many background characters died onscreen br In the DVD commentary for the episode Bad Bad Rubber Piggy Jhonen Vasquez reveals that the original idea for the episode was for Zim to kill Dib off permanently and for Dib to be replaced with a new kid named Louie But once again Nickelodeon would not allow any characters to be killed off permanently and so this did not end up happening However the episode s writer Eric Trueheart has stated that this was only meant to be taken as a joke and that Jhonen at no point thought he would actually kill off one of the lead characters in the series br In Door to Door the virtual reality world that Zim shows people was originally going to involve a demolished city that resembled New York but Nickelodeon demanded that this be changed due to its similarities to On reflection Vasquez said that he prefers the new virtual reality world to the old one since he does not like the idea of a real life city existing in Invader Zim The original version of this scene can be found online Additionally the episode Hamstergeddon had only aired once prior to the attacks on the World Trade Center and would shortly thereafter be temporarily withheld from rotation as executives thought the sight of falling buildings would not go over well with sensitive viewers br One of the biggest problems Nickelodeon had with the show before it premiered was with Dib s design Vasquez wanted Dib to wear a trench coat but Nickelodeon opted against this because they feared Dib s clothing would remind people of the Columbine High School massacre in which the two teenagers responsible for the shootings both wore trench coats during the attack Nickelodeon ultimately lost this fight and Dib ended up wearing a trench coat in the show br Later Nickelodeon wanted to cut Dib from the show outright because they did not think he was funny or interesting enough Vasquez fought back with a project called God Save the Dib which involved making slight changes to Dib s character to make him more funny and interesting in order to avoid Nickelodeon cutting him from the show One notable change that came out of God Save the Dib was making Dib s head bigger than his body which became a reoccurring joke throughout the series br The original name for Gaz s handheld game console was going to be Game Slave Advanced a spoof of Nintendo s handheld game console the Game Boy Advance However the people at Nintendo did not like this parody and threatened to sue Nickelodeon if the name was used So the name was changed to Game Slave instead br Vasquez wanted to add some red blood splatters to certain violent scenes in the episode Bestest Friend but Nickelodeon forbade this Also at end of Bestest Friend Keef was originally going to fall off of a building and onto a power line which would have electrocuted him but Nickelodeon was worried that kids might try to imitate this behavior and demanded that it be changed The next idea was that Keef gets run over by a car and spins around on the tire as it drives away but Nickelodeon denied this scene too this time for being too violent In the final version Keef gets attacked by a squirrel and falls off of a building which Nickelodeon was fine with br In the episode Hobo Skoodge was going to be shown eating his own skin to survive but Nickelodeon denied this scene and even the Invader Zim crew admitted that they thought it was too much br In the original ending of the episode Walk of Doom Zim and GIR were dropped off in a ghetto with Mexican music playing in the background and a banner reading Welcome to Mexico Feeling that it would come off as racist Nickelodeon denied this and the scenery was changed to a vaguely Mexican looking but still filthy town the music was changed to disco music and the banner was changed to say CARNE which translates into MEAT br Originally the episodes Dark Harvest and Bestest Friend were supposed to air together but Nickelodeon would not allow this saying that those two episodes are too twisted to air together So instead Dark Harvest aired with Germs and Bestest Friend aired with NanoZIM Additionally Dark Harvest was originally supposed to be called The Hearts and Lungs of Zim s Darkness but Nickelodeon denied this title br In response to these censorships and restrictions the writers of Invader Zim slipped in ways to poke fun at Nickelodeon or to simply go against their wishes This includes the character Nick who is a boy that is always happy and a not so subtle reference to Nickelodeon s frequent demands that Vasquez make the show happier and more appealing to certain viewers which Vasquez always detested br br br Bloody GIR br Bloody GIR which depicts an image of GIR covered in blood was created when series creator Jhonen Vasquez illustrated GIR covered in blood and wanted to put this drawing into an episode of Invader Zim Nickelodeon however prohibited it Director Steve Ressel and illustrator Chris Graham then snuck the forbidden drawing into a single frame of the episode Bad Bad Rubber Piggy Post production supervisor Jason Stiff has confirmed that the image does indeed appear in that episode and Ressel also confirmed its existence in interviews The image of Bloody GIR was reportedly scattered throughout the last fourteen episodes of the series by Ressel and Graham Bloody GIR can be seen the most clearly during the intro to the episode Mortos der Soulstealer Although the idea for Bloody GIR was confirmed by Ressel not to have surfaced until the episode Bad Bad Rubber Piggy some claim to have found it in earlier episodes of the series such as Dark Harvest and Attack of the Saucer Morons Additionally some people have claimed that Bloody GIR was meant to debut in the episode GIR Goes Crazy and Stuff in which GIR was supposed to be covered in blood while floating with the data canister and draining humans but this directly contradicts Ressel s statements on the matter br Many people believe that Bloody GIR was the reason behind the cancellation of Invader Zim However Vasquez has revealed that Nickelodeon did not find out about the image s inclusion until after the show s cancellation Vasquez also stated that when it was discovered by Nickelodeon they were not particularly bothered by it since kids would not notice it anyway br Certain images of Bloody GIR can only be seen in a frame by frame viewing Otherwise it will be a flash or in some cases blended into the movements of the animation Bloody GIR is never animated and will always appear as a still image However the opacity and size of the Bloody GIR is varied br br br Cancellation br br On January Nickelodeon issued a statement announcing the show s cancellation after completing episodes instead of fulfilling the original episodes order On this subject creator of the show Jhonen Vasquez said I could go on and on with variations of the most fantastic reasons for why the show was cancelled but in the end even I couldn t give you the whole and accurate truth for why the show got pulled he wrote in a lengthy post on his website in nearly eight years after the show wrapped The most likely culprits are simply ratings and the sheer expense of the show which was monstrously expensive at the time especially when compared to more modern flash based savings fests br Nearly nine years later in Vasquez was interviewed by Syfy and said br br I never point to any one particular thing as the reason for why Invader Zim was cancelled The show could ve come out at any point in history and I don t think it would ever really be appropriate I think there s always horrible things happening in the world and genuine comedy comes from horrible things At the time it just happened to be things like Columbine and and then people freak out because they don t want to offend anyone s sensibilities It s a justified response to a certain extent there s people who have been affected and they don t want to be reminded of this awful stuff I just think that it did not live well with Nickelodeon s image br In an interview with Syfy in Richard Horvitz the voice of Zim was questioned about why the show got cancelled he responded br br There s been a lot of rumors that have abounded for years about why Invader Zim was canceled People think it s the Bloody GIR episode because there s a quick subliminal shot of GIR all bloodied but that s not it at all Nickelodeon knew about that shot and they didn t seem to mind But what the cancellation really was is this plain simple fact We had horrible ratings There were two things that were going on in Our ratings were not doing well our demographic at the time was not The Fairly OddParents demographic which is what we premiered with and we premiered to really really good critical acclaim But ratings wise the only real barometer was the target audience to year olds and I think that it was a little too much for that demographic and the parents also might have thought it was a little graphic for them Our ratings never really got off the ground One other thing that people often forget is that the show premiered in March of By September of we had the horrible downing of the twin towers Given the mood of the country at the time I don t think people wanted to see shows that were about any kind of destruction or anything that had to do with someone trying to conquer the Earth br br br Broadcast history br br When Invader Zim was green lit Nickelodeon had desired a block of mature action oriented programming for an older demographic to compete with what Cartoon Network was doing at the time But for unknown reasons Invader Zim was the only series green lit as a part of this experiment and so the block of mature action oriented shows never materialized By the time the show was made Nickelodeon had decided that they were no longer interested in trying to reach an older audience which left Invader Zim hard to place in an appropriate time slot suitable for its originally intended demographic Invader Zim ultimately ended up being sandwiched between The Fairly OddParents and Rocket Power which did not feel like a suitable time slot for the show according to the creator Invader Zim was originally intended for year olds but due to its poor time slot placement it ended up being viewed primarily by year olds many of whom were turned off by the show s dark and disturbing nature resulting in the show receiving poor ratings and viewership br Even though Invader Zim usually aired later at night the show never found a time slot that the creators of the program thought was suitable for it and the show continuously suffered in ratings amongst year olds Nickelodeon s core demographic br In an interview with IGN in Jhonen Vasquez said that when it became apparent that Nickelodeon was the place for kids but not kids who want their eyes ripped out they had asked for Invader Zim to be transferred to MTV or a more adult network similar to what Nickelodeon had previously done with The Ren Stimpy Show as the series did not feel right on Nickelodeon and would have likely found greater success elsewhere This never ended up happening and instead Nickelodeon buried the show with ever changing time slots which further hurt the show s ratings br Invader Zim premiered on March and contains episodes in its first season At the beginning of the series new episodes of Invader Zim were aired on Friday nights usually at PM ET PT In August Nickelodeon officially renewed the series for a second season which was originally planned to consist of episodes br Invader Zim s Friday night time slot ceased with the episode Door to Door which was originally scheduled to premiere on September But after the attacks of three days prior Door to Door and its paired episode FBI Warning of Doom ended up getting abruptly pulled from Nickelodeon s schedule and pushed back over six months to March This was partly because Door to Door contained a violent scene which resembled the attacks of that now needed to be cut and re done but also due to the blanket fears that anything remotely violent would be received as being in poor taste given the atmosphere and condition of the country at the time Invader Zim suffered creatively after and Nickelodeon began frequently and inconveniently changing the shows time slots with little promotion for new episodes which led to an even further drop in ratings and viewership br The uncut version of Door to Door was accidentally aired on Nickelodeon on March which was the first time the episode premiered All subsequent airings of Door to Door were of the cut version br br In January Nickelodeon announced that they had plans to cancel the series Upon hearing this announcement many fans became outraged at Nickelodeon for scheduling Invader Zim for poor and frequently changing time slots towards the end of its run and for not providing the show with a good amount of promotional attention compared to some of their other shows at the time Almost immediately after the announcement was made fans launched an online petition to try to change Nickelodeon s mind or get the show picked up by a different network and even though the petition collected over signatures by April it was not enough to prevent Nickelodeon from canceling the show br The episode The Most Horrible X Mas Ever was broadcast out of order as evident by the presence of the new character Minimoose who did not get a proper introduction Minimoose s introductory episode is called Nubs of Doom and was originally intended to air before The Most Horrible X Mas Ever but because Nickelodeon was planning on canceling the series the show s staff had to pick and choose their final episodes very carefully and Jhonen Vasquez said he was more excited for The Most Horrible X Mas Ever so that episode was made instead leaving Nubs of Doom unfinished br The final episode of the series The Most Horrible X Mas Ever premiered on Nickelodeon on December The show finished with a total of of its initially contracted episodes leaving at least episode segments unfinished Concept art scripts voice recordings storyboards and animatics for some of these unfinished episodes can be found in the special features of some of the DVDs or online Six of the completed second season episodes initially went unreleased These episodes would first appear on DVD in and later made their television debut on Nicktoons from June to August br On December the series pilot made its television debut on both Nickelodeon and Nicktoons it had previously only been seen on DVD after an eight hour marathon and followed by the result of Nicktoons Girreatest Zim Moments online poll br Reruns of Invader Zim have been airing on Nicktoons since the channel s launch on May The series premiered on NickSplat for the first time on January with a seven hour marathon before returning nightly as of January br Both seasons of Invader Zim are available for download on the Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Store In addition the entire series is available for purchase on Vudu Google Play YouTube and iTunes The entire series is also available for streaming on Amazon Video and Paramount br br br Reception and legacy br br br Critical reception br br Screen Rant s Spencer Coriaty wrote Backed by some of the most cutting edge animation at the time and still breathtaking by today s standards Invader Zim is like a Mystery Science Theater fan s dream come true It seamlessly blends sci fi action and comedy into one twisted and hilarious cartoon with superb voice acting and visionary direction Kristy Punchko from Nerdist praised the series satirical themes and how it relished in weird pushed boundaries and dared to be unapologetically stupid Punchko also offered praise for the humor in Invader Zim saying Colliding the sublimely silly with the cerebral Invader Zim played as seminal precursor to subversive sci fi shows like Rick and Morty Becca James writing for The A V Club said Invader Zim was destined for a cult following From its seemingly bizarre nature to its too early demise Invader Zim brought a darker form of entertainment to Nickelodeon and welcomed critical acclaim for straddling the line between child and adult entertainment and the constant depiction of Earth as a complete shitcan only adds to this dingy but delightful program br br Allegra Frank from Polygon said The series is laid out in a story focused half hour unlike anything ever aired on Nickelodeon previously Invader Zim had a villain at its center years before Breaking Bad and Mad Men popularized that dramatic convention for adult audiences As a character Zim was mostly unlikable the show s color palette was narrow and unfriendly and the entire design of the series interiors covered in grime streets covered in garbage on screen televisions full of screaming ads dared viewers to be turned off While jokes could easily revolve around the high pitched screams of Zim s useless robot companion GIR the comedy was also often derived from much darker places like harvesting organs from living children and lice outbreaks and characters slowly turning into a sentient bologna Dib wanted to kill Zim after all that s not usually the subject of children s TV Sam Thielman from The Guardian said Invader Zim s sense of humor is somehow dark without being bleak even when the show takes its cues from horror movies it s often quite scary but it s somehow never too much Invader Zim didn t last nearly long enough but it did spawn a cult following almost immediately and became a password for alienated millennials and teenagers everywhere Alex Bedder from NYU Local said Essentially the black sheep of the animated Nickelodeon family Invader Zim never quite stuck its landing but it became a beloved and off kilter fan favorite There are random twitchy characters the word doom is overused and there are countless other illogical outbursts But the common thread weaving all of the madness together is its original sick and sometimes oddly intelligent sense of humor In an article he wrote for Cartoon Brew animation historian Jerry Beck said I always thought highly of Invader Zim but watching it again this weekend reminded me how good it truly was I laugh long and hard at incidents situations and visuals on Invader Zim and if there is any justice it should be ranked alongside the likes of South Park and The Simpsons br Mary Grace Garis from Bustle praised Invader Zim for how it does not sugarcoat reality saying You can t deny that Invader Zim really put in some heavy soul crushing messages between The Doom Song and all those rubber piggies And I d say that a la The Powerpuff Girls they did a really good job of hiding adult lessons in a children s cartoon but well I m pretty sure they were a bit more blatant in delivering the news that we were all doomed Kayla Cobb of Decider said If you prefer your humor to be equal parts dark and random then it s time to re watch this short lived Nicktoon Invader Zim can best be characterized by its sarcasm cruelty and violence This is a show that creates a disturbing giant monster baby fusion in one episode and labels the ultimate face of horror as a room with a moose the next So yeah It s kind of all over the place which is why we love it Lana Berkowitz from The Houston Chronicle praised Invader Zim s art style and color palette saying The series has an appropriately gloomy look of impending doom colored with dark reds and black and a dash of alien green The animation s angular look and the characters big expressive eyes give Invader Zim a distinctive look br Variety s Steven Oxman wrote Invader Zim captures a nice blend of the innocent and the satirical Further stating that The artwork in the show isn t especially original but still manages to create a nicely off center vision of Earth and its inhabitants Vasquez and co writer Rob Hummel throw in some clever quips at life on this planet taking aim particularly at the doomsaying schoolteacher Ms Bitters and Kevin Manthei s music provides strong accompaniment to the escapades Sean Fitz Gerald from Thrillist wrote Though Invader Zim came from Jhonen Vasquez the same beautifully twisted mind behind Johnny the Homicidal Maniac the show manages to hold off on graphic violence and obscenities without losing all its bite The spastic Zim along with the world around him capitalizes on cheeky masochistic and random humor in ways viewers of all ages can appreciate Joe Matar writing for Den of Geek wrote Invader Zim is a brilliant piece of unsettling grotesque horror with a heart of goofiness which is a big part of its appeal The incorporation of cel shaded CGI and lots of sharp geometric shapes actually enhanced the look of the show rather than came off as a cheap shortcut Andy Patrizio of IGN praised the colors and the CGI imagery in Invader Zim but criticized how Zim is always shrieking and yelling at the top of his lungs and the inconsistencies between episodes but added When the show hits it hits big br George Dvorsky from io specifically praised the character GIR saying Science fiction has portrayed its fair share of glitchy and bumbling robots over the years but none hold a candle to Invader Zim s GIR Quite possibly the most erratic and unhelpful robot to ever hit the screen GIR has become one of the most loved and often quoted characters to appear in a sci fi cartoon in years Lynne Heffley writing for Los Angeles Times said The deliriously original Invader Zim rocks offering praise for the show s humor and art style calling it a visual feast of geometric lines strange angles vaulting curves fantastic transforming machines and odd shadowed places Sean Aitchison from CBR said Invader Zim not only holds up incredibly well it also feels like it was rather ahead of its time and maybe it would have lasted longer today The weird humor the eccentric characters and even the premise all feel like a show that would have easily gotten green lit in the modern cartoon renaissance that began with Adventure Time The show only ran for two seasons which makes it such a shame when you realize how much it would have thrived in modern times On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes Invader Zim currently holds a approval rating based on reviews The website s critical consensus for season one reads The right balance of dark humor and spastic earnestness make Invader Zim a creepy kid s cartoon worthy of its cult following br The now defunct magazine Christian Parenting Today negatively criticized Invader Zim in their May issue written by Jennifer Mangan calling the show non Christian immoral offensive blasphemous unsuitable for Christian children and insulting towards Christian values and beliefs due to the show s dark nature and negative characters like Gaz and Ms Bitters among other complaints Common Sense Media s Andrea Graham wrote more negatively of Invader Zim praising the show s laugh out loud humor but criticizing the way that Zim has a complete lack of concern for all life how humans are depicted as less than intelligent life forms how human society is depicted as a terrible disgusting place the very frequent use of verbal insults and that there is no good messages or good role models in the show Some parents have criticized Invader Zim for its pessimistic portrayal of humanity the near constant level of screaming among the characters as well as the large amounts of verbal insults and threats and the disturbing and disgusting content calling it unnecessary misanthropic too scary for children and inappropriate for children According to director Steve Ressel Nickelodeon held a test screening for the episode Dark Harvest during which one kid ran out of the room crying before the episode was over and others were visibly shaken and clearly terrified at what they saw br In IGN ranked Invader Zim at number on their list of the Top Primetime Animated Series of All Time and in IGN

Ever on their list titled of the Best Holiday TV Episodes Ever br br br Ratings br Invader Zim garnered decent ratings for its premiere episode with a rating share about million views among kids ages As the show went on ratings and viewership began to decline amongst Nickelodeon s target audience of year olds br While Invader Zim was popular during its original run Nickelodeon did not think the show was doing well because they were only focusing on a certain age group of viewers year olds Even though Invader Zim was praised by critics and popular with viewers ages the ratings amongst Nickelodeon s core demographic were just not high enough for the network to justify the expenses being put into the show as Invader Zim was the most expensive show they were producing at the time When Nickelodeon saw that some of their other shows with half the budget of Invader Zim were getting double the desired ratings amongst the year old demographic canceling the show just seemed to be the logical thing to do from a business perspective br Despite the poor ratings the show received during its original run reruns of Invader Zim tend to receive average to above average views and ratings In March through July reruns of Invader Zim were aired on Nicktoons These reruns became the second highest rated show on the network behind Avatar The Last Airbender br br br Awards and nominations br br br InvaderCON br Invader Zim has its own fan convention known as InvaderCON run by Wasabi Anime also known as Green Mustard Entertainment The initial event was created to celebrate the ten year anniversary of Invader Zim and took place in Atlanta Georgia on March The convention s date was set exactly ten years to the weekend from when the show first premiered March Special guests included cast members Richard Steven Horvitz Melissa Fahn Rosearik Rikki Simons Andy Berman and writer Eric Trueheart The convention had over a thousand in attendance and featured many Invader Zim related panels and activities including a panel where the voice cast read the scripts for the unfinished episodes Mopiness of Doom and Day of da Spookies One dollar of each ticket purchased for InvaderCON was donated to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation JDRF The choice of charity was selected by Richard Horvitz who was one of the first guests to be booked In the end InvaderCON raised almost for JDRF InvaderCON was not endorsed sanctioned or in any other way supported directly or indirectly by Viacom International Inc or Nickelodeon But it was confirmed that a few representatives of Nickelodeon attended to observe the turnout and were quoted as being overwhelmed br InvaderCON was originally intended to be a one time event but due to the success of the first InvaderCON and demand from fans an encore presentation of the convention InvaderCON II DOOMCON took place on July in Los Angeles California featuring all of the previous year s guests except for Andy Berman with the addition of series creator Jhonen Vasquez character designer Aaron Alexovich voice of Professor Membrane Rodger Bumpass post production supervisor Jason Stiff storyboard artist Ian Graham and a surprise appearance from voice of Almighty Tallest Red Wally Wingert During this convention there was a panel where the voice cast read the script for the unfinished episode The Trial br According to InvaderCON s official website br br Since the first InvaderCON was on the East Coast Atlanta and due to travel requests on Jhonen s part we opted to host InvaderCON II DOOMCON in California This was a MASSIVE undertaking on our part since our production team is based in Florida and Georgia We made it happen though Over fans from different states and countries showed up near Los Angeles for two days of Invader ZIM fandom goodness The show was an expensive risk and a major stress on the Green Mustard Entertainment team but it was worth it for us to see the fans and families that all appeared to share in the experience Autographs panels breakfast dinner puppets surprise guests and more added up to a once in a lifetime weekend for the cast crew and attendees br With over fans on Facebook asking for another InvaderCON Wasabi Anime decided to do InvaderCON one last time The third InvaderCON was funded via Kickstarter on June July The Kickstarter was a success and exceeded its initial goal of Wasabi Anime said they wanted the third InvaderCON to be located in the middle of where the previous InvaderCONs were located Thus Austin Texas was chosen as its location since it is approximately miles from Atlanta InvaderCON and miles from Los Angeles InvaderCON InvaderCON III FINAL DOOM took place on July in Austin Texas Special guests included cast members Richard Steven Horvitz Melissa Fahn Rosearik Rikki Simons Rodger Bumpass and writer Eric Trueheart At this convention there was a panel where the voice cast read the script for the unfinished episode Ten Minutes to Doom br Even though InvaderCON III FINAL DOOM was originally intended to be the last InvaderCON fans as well as Wasabi Anime continued to express interest in doing another InvaderCON In the years following InvaderCON III FINAL DOOM the founder of Wasabi Anime Tom Croom repeatedly teased fans on Twitter with the possibilities of another InvaderCON on multiple different occasions br On August Wasabi Anime launched a Kickstarter to test the waters for a potential fourth InvaderCON event The Kickstarter reached its goal in just four days In February it was officially announced that there would be a fourth InvaderCON event which was originally scheduled to take place in Boston Massachusetts on August as part of Fan Expo Boston Due to the COVID pandemic it was postponed to August along with Fan Expo Boston The fourth InvaderCon event was later postponed again indefinitely On March InvaderCON hosted a Twitch livestream celebrating the twentieth anniversary of Invader Zim It featured Richard Horvitz Rikki Simons Rodger Bumpass Melissa Fahn Olivia d Abo Wally Wingert Aaron Alexovich Eric Trueheart and Kevin Manthei On November Wasabi Anime revealed that they no longer have any plans for another InvaderCON event in the near future but remain open to the possibilities of another convention br InvaderCON unlike some other projects done by Wasabi Anime such as Florida Anime Experience is not an annual show done in a city near where Wasabi Anime is located InvaderCON s attendees at all three conventions were only about locals Over of InvaderCON attendees came from outside the convention s host state This made predicting attendance and budgeting for InvaderCON very tricky and extremely risky according to Wasabi Anime br br br Influence br Bryan Konietzko the co creator of the Nickelodeon animated series Avatar The Last Airbender was a storyboard artist and art director on Invader Zim Konietzko has said that the character of Aang was inspired by a drawing of an adult character he had originally designed while working on Invader Zim When Konietzko first redesigned the character as Aang for Avatar The Last Airbender he left visible traces of Jhonen Vasquez s idiosyncratic style in the character s poses br Rebecca Sugar the creator of the Cartoon Network animated series Steven Universe is a fan of Invader Zim and has admitted to reading and writing fan fiction and drawing fan art for Invader Zim when she was a teenager Sugar has said I owe a whole lot to Jhonen Vasquez His show Invader Zim was my gateway drug to the independent comic world Someday I hope to meet Jhonen Vasquez and thank him for changing my life Additionally Sugar provided the foreword for The Art of Invader Zim in which she further discussed the positive impact the show has had on her life and career br Vivienne VivziePop Medrano the creator of Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss is a fan of Invader Zim and has gone on to say that Invader Zim had a huge influence on her and her work br In Wally Wingert the voice of Almighty Tallest Red noted during an interview with Den of Geek that T he reason other shows like Adventure Time are able to do some pretty intense stuff is because the trail was blazed by Jhonen Vasquez When Invader Zim came out the intense stuff we did on the show was the new barometer by which you could get away with something Up until then all the other cartoons were relatively tame but now you re seeing way darker stuff in cartoons than we ever did on Zim br In Screen Rant s Maddy Cohen observed that A rguably Invader Zim is one of the most influential animated shows to come out of the early s with echoes of its humor and tone present in Adventure Time Regular Show Gravity Falls and Steven Universe That same year Eric Vilas Boas from Thrillist wrote Invader Zim remained an influential cult classic informing future cartoons like Avatar The Last Airbender all the way up to Steven Universe Gravity Falls Rick and Morty and beyond br br br Controversy br Invader Zim became a controversial series when the show was mentioned at Scott Dyleski s murder trial in Dyleski who was at the time of the trial was convicted of murdering his neighbor and cited the Invader Zim episode Dark Harvest as his motivation for committing the murder Dyleski said that after watching Dark Harvest he became fascinated with collecting body parts and curious as to how the human body would function without certain organs which inspired the murder although the people who defended Dyleski said these comments were made in jest br br br Related media br br br Netflix film br br On November Harvey Beaks and Chowder creator C H Greenblatt was asked by a fan on Tumblr if he would work with Jhonen Vasquez on an hypothetical Invader Zim movie and Greenblatt responded Jhonen IS making an Invader Zim movie for Nick I m not a part of it but I m excited However Vasquez initially denied this on his Twitter most likely because he was under contract to not say anything at the time and was forced to dismiss it as a rumor br On April over sixteen years since the series debut and eleven years since the last unaired episode premiered in the United States Nickelodeon officially announced that they had green lit a minute television film based on the series with three teaser trailers being released in a span of the following four days Vasquez

Gaz Wally Wingert as Almighty Tallest Red Kevin McDonald as Almighty Tallest Purple Rodger Bumpass as Professor Membrane Olivia d Abo as Tak and Paul Greenberg as Poonchy br At San Diego Comic Con Jhonen Vasquez explained that Nickelodeon had been asking him about doing more Invader Zim for years but he had to decline their offers either because he was busy working on something else or unable to come to an agreement with Nickelodeon on a budget for an Invader Zim revival But being completely miserable with the other things he was working on at the time Vasquez accepted Nickelodeon s latest offer to do more Invader Zim Nickelodeon initially wanted a new Invader Zim television series but Vasquez suggested a six episode miniseries instead He soon changed his mind to a television movie since doing a movie would be infinitely less stressful br Invader Zim Enter the Florpus had a panel at San Diego Comic Con on July During the panel some never before seen production art such as backgrounds and turn around charts for the movie were revealed A trailer put together out of unedited first take animation for the movie was also shown at the panel accompanied by some original music
