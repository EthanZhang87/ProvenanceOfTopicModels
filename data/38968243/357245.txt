and created by producer D J MacHale an American television producer The show is a co production between Montreal based CINAR Films and the U S Nickelodeon network It had its American debut on Nickelodeon in the United States during August while Canada s Family Channel had the series premiere in September By the series had moved from Family Channel to YTV br Nominated for awards several times the series was widely praised by critics for its handling of cultural issues such as rape pornography addiction and abortion br Both series of Are You Afraid of the Dark revolved around a group of teenagers who referred to themselves as The Midnight Society Every episode at a secret location in the woods at night one member would tell a scary story to the group The actual story rather than the telling was displayed to the television viewer The story was shown between the group s arrival at the site and their departure br Each storyteller would begin their story by saying Submitted for the approval of The Midnight Society I call this story story name at which point they would toss a handful of midnight dust actually Coffee Mate from a leather pouch into a campfire to heighten the flames and produce an eerie white smoke br MacHale wrote the line submitted for the approval of as a nod to The Twilight Zone in which creator Rod Serling would after introducing the episode say submitted for your approval The storyteller would continue by announcing its title The Tale of The themes of the stories usually revolve around a variety of paranormal phenomena such as demons ghosts magic haunted houses magical curses aliens witches vampires werewolves and the like coming into contact with average youths Usually the episodes were either filmed in the woods in abandoned houses or in public places like schools or libraries Sources of these tales vary in different ways many were adaptations of public domain fairy tales and short stories or urban legends For example the episode The Tale of the Twisted Claw is an adaptation of W W Jacobs short story The Monkey s Paw br Sometimes the stories were inspired by a certain event in the life of the storyteller In the episode The Tale of the Crimson Clown for instance Tucker blackmailed his brother Gary with a poem he had found which Gary had written for Samantha Gary then told a story in which a naughty younger brother was punished cruelly for his evil deeds At the end of the episode Tucker gave the poem back to his brother The majority of the horror stories on Are You Afraid of the Dark had happy endings or at least endings in which their characters were in decent places but some of them albeit a very small number of them had either bad endings or twist endings like The Tale of the Lonely Ghost The Tale of the Dark Music The Tale of the Chameleons The Tale of Vampire Town and The Tale of the Pinball Wizard br At the end of most episodes one character usually Gary in the first run and Tucker in the second run of the show would throw a red bucket of water onto the fire stating I declare this meeting of The Midnight Society closed and the group would leave the campsite thus ending the storytelling Sometimes the story would be related to an event e g in The Tale of Laughing in the Dark Kristen who was afraid of clowns ran off when Eric put on a clown mask Then everyone chased after her This would cause either Gary or Tucker to hurriedly dump the water on the fire and The Midnight Society would run off to wherever they go after meetings br br br Episodes br br br Characters and cast br br Each member of The Midnight Society from to has a distinct personality and a notable trend in their storytelling Though not all of their stories have similar styles and plots in many of the stories each character carries a unique aspect that reflects the nature of the storyteller and what they find to be the most important to themselves In the second generation the characters derive their stories more from events that happen during the days leading up to the society meetings instead of from their personal interests and views Many of the later episodes were simply given to a random society member to tell br br br Original br Gary An unassuming bookish looking boy and the founder of this generation of The Midnight Society Gary has a distinct fascination with magic especially where the magician Houdini is concerned His stories tend to revolve around cursed or enchanted objects with supernatural properties and how in the wrong hands they can cause disaster for both the holder and those around them His stories have the recurring character Sardo in them most of his stories have the main character buying an enchanted item from Sardo s shop In the part episode The Tale of the Silver Sight Gary reveals that his grandfather was the founder of The Midnight Society and that it was his grandfather s stories that inspired him to recreate the group br Betty Ann A vibrant girl who has an open and eager passion for the bizarre and twisted Her stories often include themes where an alien or supernatural force is either trying to break into the world of the characters or else trying to drag them into their own unnatural realms Her stories tend to have twists reminiscent of Twilight Zone episodes hinting that even after the protagonists of her stories manage to defeat the antagonists they still have yet to fully escape danger by the end br Kiki A spunky tomboyish girl who often makes fun of others Many of her stories involve plots where the danger of carelessness or deceitfulness as well as the danger of the past repeats itself Also notable is that a large number of the characters in her stories are also of African descent likely due to Kiki herself being African Canadian though the trend dies off later on in the series One story she came up with had to be read by Gary due to her suffering from laryngitis at the time br Frank A punkish teenager with an in your face attitude Though his stories do not often have a running theme they do often have the recurring character Dr Vink appear as the villain or at least the creator of the story s antagonist The first episode of the series has Frank attempting to impress the Midnight Society with a story to be allowed membership which he does with The Tale of the Phantom Cab In season five he and his family moved away and he was replaced in the group by Stig br Tucker Gary s younger brother and the youngest member of The Midnight Society Due to his age he is often portrayed as youthfully obnoxious His stories tend to involve family relationships that are at first sour but grow in strength in the face of adversity possibly reflecting his relationship with his brother Gary There is also a running theme of the characters accidentally unleashing evil upon their world After Gary left he took over his place as the president of The Midnight Society Once Tucker is in charge he is less of a brat and more of a serious leader like his older brother He is the only character to appear in both generations of The Midnight Society br Sam A shy girl with an obvious mutual crush on Gary which becomes one of the highlighted arcs of both their developments in the series Reflecting this affection for Gary Sam s stories tend to have more of a strong theme of love and its endurance even beyond death br Kristen A girl who though squeamish about much else has a fondness for ghost stories and fairy tales She has a growing crush on David and their affection for each other is a developing arc in the first few seasons She loves to dress up for her stories or bring something for effect sometimes to scare the others with and her stories almost always deal with ghosts from the past who have unfinished business that they cannot complete without the aid of the living In season she left The Midnight Society due to her and her family moving and she was replaced in the group by Sam br David A quiet boy with a mysterious expression Reflecting his introverted nature and need to deal with his crush on Kristen David s stories tend to be less about malignant outside forces and more to do with the evil of past events left unresolved or the darkness inside normal people and the consequences of not dealing with their actions In season he and his family moved away and he was replaced in the group by Tucker br Stig His nickname may come from the term stigma as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene Stig is the last member to be initiated into this generation of The Midnight Society As such he has only two stories in the series before the cast is changed The Tale of the Dead Man s Float and The Tale of Station Due to the aversion people seem to have against him for his looks both of his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and or tastes br Eric Eric is portrayed as a diminutive teenager with visible Irish ancestry that influences his first story As he has only had two stories in the first season before his character was cut there is no visible theme in his storytelling but they seem to be about incredibly powerful evil forces ones never proven innocent or misunderstood like some others In his short run on the show Eric was shown to be rather snide and negative spending most of the time making sarcastic remarks and antagonizing the other members especially Frank He is the only character to leave the show without any explanation for his departure br br br First revival br Several years after the last meeting of The Midnight Society Tucker returns to reinitialize the meetings inviting his own circle of friends to reform The Midnight Society br br Quinn Quinn is usually getting in trouble at school and at home but he is a smart kid that likes to make fun of Andy teamed up with Vange Quinn s stories have little in common though usually involve the protagonists actions unleashing or bringing them face to face with the villain br Vange Vange short for Evangeline is the youngest of the New Midnight Society She is a tomboy and does not have a problem with speaking her mind Teamed up with Quinn she makes fun of Andy a lot Vange s stories have little in common though most seem to be about how wanting something too badly can cause the main character to play into the villain s hands br Andy Andy is very sweet and kind He is always being made fun of by Quinn and Vange for having more muscle than brains He lives on a farm with his family He often works there before and after school Andy is the closest to Megan Andy s stories have little in common but are often about how characters dark sides can unleash evil Usually the inspiration for his stories are based on his own real life personal experiences br Megan Megan is a rich kid who is not very comfortable in the woods She would rather hold the New Midnight Society Meetings in her own well managed backyard Tucker not being the stickler his brother was lets Megan refurnish the campfire with some comfortable old couches She seems to have a soft spot for Andy Megan s stories have little in common though most seem to somehow involve romance Sometimes she brings a prop or starts a brief game relating to her story br br br Second revival br In a second revival of the show began The first season is known as Carnival of Doom the second season is known as Curse of the Shadows and the third season is known as Ghost Island br br br Carnival of Doom br The Midnight Society br br Rachel Carpenter A shy girl who recently moved to the town of Argento She quickly resigns herself to life as a social outsider but when some classmates notice her interest in the horror genre she earns an invite to the mysterious Midnight Society She suffers from recurring nightmares and uses that to form her first story to submit to the group The Carnival of Doom She s named after John Carpenter br Gavin Coscarelli An outgoing member who lives next door to Rachel and quickly takes an interest in her He s good friends with Louise and is shown to be fairly popular at school He s also a vegetarian He s named after Don Coscarelli br Akiko Yamato A blunt and pragmatic member of the Midnight Society who enjoys filmmaking and is seen directing her own scary movie throughout the series Her older brother Hideo is a rookie police officer br Graham Raimi A horror film fanatic who loves gushing about his favorite movies although he often comes off awkward to his peers He is also a talented artist and a germaphobe He sits behind Rachel in class and is the first to pick up on Rachel s horror obsession eventually inviting her to the group He s named after Sam Raimi br Louise Fulci A cheerleader and one of the popular girls at school who holds her reputation dearly Although she s friends with Gavin she avoids speaking to the other members of the Midnight Society outside of meetings particularly Graham in fear that it will affect her social status She s named after Lucio Fulci br br br Curse of the Shadows br The Midnight Society br br Luke McCoy br Hanna Romero br Gabby Lewis br Jai Malya br Seth Romero br Connor Stevens br br br Ghost Island br The Midnight Society br br Kayla King br Max Matheson br Leo B Stoker br Summer DaCosta br Ferris Poe br br br Recurring characters br One of the more significant recurring characters was Sardo Richard Dumont owner of Sardo s Magic Mansion a magic shop He would often attempt to sell a character a prized item succeeding almost every single time He often had items in his shop that contained real properties of magic yet did not know until it was revealed in the story One of the most memorable recurring jokes in the series occurred when someone would address him as Mr Sardo He would then get irritated and exclaim That s SarDO Sard h No mister accent on the doh br Another recurring gag is Sardo attempting to sell a series of cheap novelty items before revealing the magical artifact culminating with fake vomit asking the protagonists Have you seen our vomit Additionally when selling someone an item he would often ask a rather high price The main character would mention how much money they had and Sardo would grab the money saying But I m losing on the deal Although he rarely got what he wanted he would often end up helping the characters often unintentionally He appeared in Gary s stories although in the later seasons he appeared in two of Tucker s and one of David s in the episode The Tale of The Dark Dragon br Sardo s character is revived in the second season of the second revival Curse of the Shadows Sardo s son Ryan Beil is the owner of Sardo s Magic Shop Richard Dumont appears in the finale as Sardo br Another recurring character was Dr Vink Aron Tager He was a physically imposing man who would often appear as a mad scientist sorcerer and the like When he enters he introduces himself by saying Vink s the name Dr Vink He would also get his name mispronounced usually something like Dr Fink When this happened he would respond Vink With a va va va Often the protagonist would call him a nutbag behind his back assuming he could not hear him only to have him reply later and I am not a nutbag br Unlike Sardo whose character was set in a magic shop Dr Vink had many unique endeavors as he called them for his stories These ranged from living deep in the woods conducting strange nature experiments being a retired filmmaker owning his own restaurant as head chef and lastly a barbershop His activities were usually villainous designed to put the characters in peril and allow him the last laugh However in his last appearance The Tale of Cutter s Treasure which was told by both Frank and Gary he allied himself with Sardo and the main characters without his usual maliciousness He appeared in Frank s stories Aron Tager also played the carnival worker who stands in front of the Funhouse and invites people to go inside in the episode The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark br The character of Zeebo the Clown also played by Tager who appeared in The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark is referenced in several other stories for example in the episode The Tale of the Whispering Walls two children mention seeing him at a fun park in the episode The Tale of the Mystical Mirror a girl says she will look like Zeebo if she wears too much lipstick and in the episode The Tale of the Crimson Clown in the boys room a video game called Zeebo s Big House can be seen on the desk with a picture of Zeebo on it as the title character The video game was also mentioned in the episode The Tale of Train Magic Finally in the episode The Tale of the Night Shift the teenage janitor is called Zeebo by his supervisor a few times at the beginning of the episode br The villain the Ghastly Grinner star of The Tale of the Ghastly Grinner like Zeebo the Clown appears in a comic book that Dark characters read In Tale of the Ghastly Grinner The Grinner is shown as being the star of a comic book br br br Legacy br The show became a weekly staple for children and tweens in the s Kids were old enough to stay up but not old enough to stay out so they spent nearly every Saturday night huddled around television sets with friends or siblings pretending not to be terrified by that week s tale As written by Matt Melis But there s also a lot to admire in the care that went into trying to frighten us We saw the protagonists encountering the creepy and supernatural in the same suburban settings we hailed from They were remarkably vulnerable and insecure kids too ones with problems we could relate to they were new kids outcasts rival siblings and children experiencing rough patches like deaths in the family or parents filing for divorce Said series co creator D J MacHale I wanted stories about real kids who were facing challenges that had nothing to do with the supernatural situation they ended up in He added But I d like to believe that by depicting kids taking charge of difficult situations it opened up kid viewers to the idea that they aren t powerless in their own lives The show has also been hailed for its diversity in characters and stories I write about kids who find themselves in challenging situations and ultimately solve the problems themselves no matter their sex race or age We wanted to depict a wide variety of stories characters and situations It was all about diversity says MacHale We didn t play to stereotypes The series was nominated for an NAACP Image Award in The show has also been seen as helping to create a generation of feminist horror fans as it showed kids a world where girls got to be the imperfect heroes as often as the boys did According to MacHale in the first season alone half of the scripts focused on female characters and were written by female writers br br br Home media br br br VHS releases br Three VHS tapes were released by Sony Wonder Ghostly Tales which included the episodes The Tale of the Shiny
