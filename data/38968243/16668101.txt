D Alcatraz as Captain Stonewall br br br Production and development br Several years before The Mighty B premiered co creator Amy Poehler and a number of people at Nickelodeon were speaking and thinking about making a female driven animated television series Poehler stated that the series would be pitched as where this girl is at that great age where you re not boy crazy and you re not rude to other girls She found that enthusiasm fascinating and wanted to bottle it and take it like a pill br The Mighty B was picked up for a pilot in early under the name of Super Scout It was co created by Poehler Cynthia True and Erik Wiese Brown Johnson president of animation at Nickelodeon was absolutely thrilled to have a comedy team of the caliber of Amy Erik and Cynthia create this iconic character for a new generation Poehler said that she was thrilled that the world will finally meet the funny and sweet girl tornado that is Bessie Higgenbottom Erik Cynthia and I are so pleased to be working with the wonderful people at Nickelodeon In the words of Bessie it s been awesome br Bessie is loosely based on a character Poehler had played during her time at improvisational comedy troupes Second City and Upright Citizens Brigade as well as girls she looked up to when she was younger She described Bessie as a feisty plucky bossy Honey Bee scout and called her our hero who goes on all these adventures in hopes of collecting all these badges Poehler referred to the show as double the action triple the adventures and quadruple the awesomeness During an interview with TV Guide when asked if Poehler was trying to appeal adults with the show she wrote br br Yeah What I love about SpongeBob SquarePants is that it s very watchable for an adult But kids like it because they don t feel like they re being pandered to That was what we were looking to do with The Mighty B We wanted to do a show that had a strong female character who didn t have too many rainbows and unicorns br br br Home media br A DVD of selected episodes from the series entitled We Got the Bee was released on February It contained episodes behind the scenes footage an animatic version of the episode Bat Mitzvah Crashers and a karaoke music video for Running with the Rainbow Unicorn Another DVD named BEEing Bessie Higgenbottom was released on December exclusively at Amazon com This release contains episodes as well as the karaoke music video for Buzz Off from the Dragonflies special It is published on demand onto DVD Rs On December the entire series was added to Paramount formerly CBS All Access br br br Reception br br br Critical reception br One review from Brian Lowry of Variety explained it contains a kind of crazed energy and inventiveness that isn t associated often enough with girl oriented children s fare and opts for a more elevated approach like that aforementioned roller coaster jaunt taking a free spirited jump off the tracks and trusting its audience to hang on for the ride David Hinckley of Daily News gave the show four stars while writing that The Mighty B has a decent shot at becoming a pre tween fave Aaron H Bynum of Animation Insider called the series a good brainless cartoon Because viewers shouldn t ever be bored with Bessie but criticized part of its humor for not try ing to do too much which may ultimately work against it when the story calls for the characters to do too little br Denver Post contributor Joanne Ostrow declared the protagonist of the series a female answer to SpongeBob SquarePants Ed Liu of Toon Zone called The Mighty B a show that he admires more than what he truly love s stating There is prodigious talent behind it and its wonderfully energetic boisterous comedy It s clearly trying very very hard to be entertaining and largely succeeds I almost feel bad for not liking The Mighty B more than I do and I m still not sure why I don t enjoy it more He noted it was worth pointing out that more recent episodes of the show seem more assured and funnier than the eight episodes on the We Got the Bee DVD br Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the series out of stars saying that Bessie is fairly one dimensional her single minded devotion to badge acquisition which she often pursues by pestering both adults and her peers to get her way means that her social skills suffer Plus the show maintains a chaotic pace and there are no real attempts to teach strong positive lessons While Bessie s dedication to her goal could theoretically be considered admirable the show makes light of her disregard for her adoring younger brother s feelings and her lack of real friends in favor of an imaginary pal she draws on her finger and her reluctant dog sidekick You have to wonder are those the makings of a truly mighty hero But Ashby added that young tweens will likely enjoy Bessie s outlandish fantasy fueled adventures which are fast paced and on the surface entertaining Marilyn Moss from The Hollywood Reporter said Nickelodeon s new animated series The Mighty B has what every kid needs in order to grow up strong and self sufficient in today s adult world violence nonsensical verbiage and most importantly a built in idea that you rule the universe It used to be called narcissism something that kids are thought to need in order to negotiate childhood Then it s supposed to disappear But with the violent clanging banging kids and action we see in Mighty B it could last forever if young minds get overloaded on programming with this kind of senselessness br br br Ratings br The Mighty B premiered at AM on April and scored above average for Nickelodeon programming in the Nielsen ratings It ranked in the top ten of all programming for combined broadcast and basic cable shows with million viewers in the demographic and a rating of The Mighty B had double the viewership as Bakugan Battle Brawlers a show that aired simultaneously on Cartoon Network br In September the show had an average of million viewers and in the second quarter of the show ranked among the top five animated programs on television During the third quarter of it averaged million viewers and was number one in its timeslot in the children s and children s demographics br br br Awards br The Mighty B and its crew have been nominated for six Annie Awards The show has also been nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards winning one It has also been nominated for one Artios Award and one Golden Reel Award br br br br br br External links br br Official website archived br The Mighty B at IMDb
