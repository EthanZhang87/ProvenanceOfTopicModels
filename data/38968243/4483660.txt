Ming Duckling who use teamwork to help animals in need Most of the characters dialogue is sung in the style of operetta Each episode is set to original music by a member live orchestra br Josh Selig and Jennifer Oxley developed the idea for Wonder Pets while working on their previous show Oobi The series started out with two animated shorts called Linny the Guinea Pig which acted as pilot episodes To animate them Oxley created a style of animation called photo puppetry that uses photos of real objects and moves them using Adobe After Effects The shorts featured Linny going on adventures set to classical music In Little Airplane screened the shorts at the wrap party for Oobi s second season The shorts caught the attention of Nickelodeon who picked up the shorts to air in between shows on the Nick Jr block br The two original shorts were aired throughout and For the full length series the characters of Tuck and Ming Ming were added to form a team of hero pets Tuck was created using photos of Jennifer Oxley s own pet turtle a red eared slider The first long form episode debuted on March as part of the Nick Jr block on Nickelodeon On that same day the series started airing on Noggin as well It ran for three seasons and episodes The final episode aired on October The first two seasons and majority of season aired on Nickelodeon while the last episodes only aired on the separate Nick Jr Channel br br br Overview br Each episode two separate eleven minute segments or a single twenty two minute episode follows a similar structure with many hallmarks and repeated elements As each episode begins children are heard from off screen leaving school at the end of the day They say goodbye to the classroom pets The classroom is always decorated with student artwork and other items related to a given episode s particular storyline featured animal or geographic location Once the classroom is empty a pencil holder rattles to create the ringing of a phone br One by one the classroom pets notice the ringing phone As the phone rings they put on their accessories a hat for Linny shoes and a sailor s cap for Tuck and aviator goggles for Ming Ming and make their way towards the phone while singing their opening verses The Wonder Pets answer the phone and find that an animal is in trouble somewhere Linny the Guinea Pig explains the situation to the other two Tuck Turtle and Ming Ming Duckling They all jump into a box filled with fabric scraps and jump back out wearing different outfits often alluding to the area of the world they will be visiting They make a quick joke and jump back into the box emerging again in superhero capes br Once dressed they assemble a flying vehicle called the Flyboat In some episodes the Wonder Pets opt for a different mode of transportation by adjusting the Flyboat Usually the pets encounter an obstacle before leaving the classroom The solution is invariably similar to the action they will need to take to save the animal in trouble br When saving the animal the Wonder Pets always fail on the first few attempts The danger escalates prompting Ming Ming to sing This is sewious Suddenly the Wonder Pets remember how they solved the problem in the classroom and realize that the rescue has a similar solution They have to work together to achieve the rescue Once the animal is saved its parent or other relative appears to give grateful thanks to the Wonder Pets The pets celebrate with a celery snack The rescued animal s parent sometimes adds a bit of regional food or insists on a regional preparation The pets fly back to the classroom and wordlessly return to their cages as their hats and capes come off The Flyboat automatically disassembles upon landing Ming Ming is always the first one to get back in her cage Tuck is the second and Linny is the last A musical riff relating to the episode s rescue is played as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks at the camera Other pets have winked at the camera including Tuck in Save the Rhino Ming Ming in Back to Kalamazoo and In The Land of Oz and Ollie in Ollie to the Rescue and The Amazing Ollie Another episode or the end credits then begin br

history br Wonder Pets was produced by Little Airplane Productions Before Wonder Pets started Little Airplane had only produced live action works like Oobi and a short film titled The Time Out Chair After Oobi became a breakout success for the studio its co founder Josh Selig expressed interest in producing another television show Little Airplane produced two animated shorts called Linny the Guinea Pig The shorts focused on a silent guinea pig who left her classroom to go on fantastic adventures each set to classical music Jennifer Oxley who had joined Little Airplane as an animator signed on as the director of the two shorts br Josh Selig and Jennifer Oxley first screened the shorts at the wrap party for Oobi s second season The shorts eventually caught the attention of Nickelodeon who picked up the shorts to air in between shows and eventually commissioned a full season of long form episodes Tuck and Ming Ming were added to the cast to form a team of superhero pets and the characters were given voices the dialogue free nature of the original shorts did not translate well to half hour episodes At first the show was called The Super Singing Power Pets but it was renamed Wonder Pets because the former name was too long Many former crew members of Oobi moved onto the show including writers Christine Nee and Sascha Paladino and composers Larry Hochman and Jeffrey Lesser br The animation style used to create Wonder Pets is called photo puppetry and was created for the series to allow animators to manipulate photographs of real animals It also uses drawn objects not characters so the total presentation could be considered animated mixed media Jennifer Oxley considers this technique her own invention and first used it to create lifelike transitions for Little Airplane s previous works br A good deal of the dialog is sung so the show has been likened to operetta or singspiel A member live orchestra performs each episode sometimes including other instrumentalists skilled in music from the region to which the pets are traveling during the episode Completing each episode took thirty three weeks from script to final delivery br br br Broadcast and release br Wonder Pets premiered on Nickelodeon airing on March as well as Noggin on the same day br br br DVD compilations br br br Mobile streaming br On July the first episodes were made
