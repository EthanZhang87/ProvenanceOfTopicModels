houses In each episode they meet in the backyard and imagine themselves on a fantastical adventure Their adventures span a variety of different genres and settings many episodes involve visiting different parts of the world traveling back or forward in time and using magic or supernatural powers The characters give themselves different jobs or roles depending on the episode s imaginary setting such as detectives knights or scientists From the second season onward many episodes are parodies of action adventure films such as James Bond Star Trek Indiana Jones and Ghostbusters br The openings and endings of the episodes follow a similar pattern The stories begin with the characters in the backyard introducing themselves and explaining the scenario they are about to imagine which causes the backyard to transform into an environment fitting their scenario they are imagining When the Backyardigans finish their adventure their stomachs begin to growl leading to them deciding to have a snack at one of their houses As they return home the fantasy sequence fades restoring the original backyard setting The characters sing a closing song say their goodbyes to the audience then walk inside the house that belongs to the snack inviter and close the door As the episode ends at least one character reopens the door and shouts a phrase related to the adventure br The show follows the format of a stage musical Each episode is set to a different genre of music and features four songs The characters sing and dance to the songs with original choreography The song and dance routines are often used to introduce a character s imaginary role further the plot or explain a problem In addition to singing songs in a new genre each episode the show s background music changes to match scoring all of the Backyardigans actions br br br Characters br Each of the five characters on the show has two voice actors one for speaking and the other for singing while in the UK dub the

described the process What we do is we film the live footage in the studio send that off and they do a Leica and then they send it to the animators The animators watch and were pretty precise What we
