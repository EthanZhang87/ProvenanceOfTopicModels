and Tucker Foley Danny decides to explore the Ghost Portal created by his parents in their attempt to bridge the human world and the Ghost Zone the parallel universe in which ghosts reside that when plugged in failed to work Once inside he inadvertently presses the On button which his parents naively failed to do thus activating the Portal and infusing his DNA with ectoplasm transforming him into a half ghost br Danny who calls himself Danny Phantom in ghost form develops the ability to fly to become invisible to become intangible and to overshadow possess and control people after first learning how to switch back and forth at will between his ghost and human forms Over time he develops much stronger abilities such as his Ghost Ray a concentrated blast of energy he fires from his hand his Ghostly Wail an intensely powerful scream with sonic capabilities that knocks back anything caught in its path and even cryokinesis Danny is initially frightened by his new abilities and has little control over them but he soon learns to use them to protect his town from evil spirits Danny turns to the life of a superhero using his powers to rid his hometown of the various ghosts and mutant animals which begin to plague it and are almost always brought into the world thanks to the sporadic activation of the Fentons Ghost Portal Sam Tucker and Jazz are Danny s primary allies in his ghost fighting activities and help him keep his ghost half a secret br Danny s ghost form is a polarization of what he looked like when he first entered the Ghost Portal When he goes ghost his jet black hair turns snow white his sky blue eyes turn neon green and the black and white jumpsuit he had put on before the accident appears in negative color with the originally white areas of the suit appearing black and vice versa In the premiere episode of season two a ghost grants Sam s inadvertent wish that she and Danny had never met in consequence Danny loses not only memories but his ghost powers as well as Sam had primarily been the one to persuade Danny to investigate the portal in the first place which led to the accident Luckily however Sam had been protected from the wish by the ghost hunting technology of Danny s parents allowing her to persuade the now fully human Danny to regain his powers by re enacting the accident This time before Danny enters the portal Sam replaces the logo of his father s face on the jumpsuit which she also had removed the first time if she hadn t it would have been part of Danny s ghost form with her recently designed DP fused letter logo on the chest so that it appears when he goes ghost from then on br Danny faces threats of many kinds including vengeful ghost hunter Valerie Gray voiced by Cree Summer who for a short period of time becomes his love interest an enemy half ghost Vlad Masters an old college friend of his father s and considered to be Danny s true arch rival and even his own parents who as ghost hunters view Danny

design still feel fresh and fun in modern day The show was full of action and humor and the characters felt real and layered If you re looking for an old Nickelodeon cartoon to rewatch Danny Phantom should be on your list Eric McInnis writing for Study Breaks Magazine said The show offered fun comedy memorable characters and fantastic character designs for the enemies Danny had to fight in each episode Joly Herman of Common Sense Media criticized the mature themes of Danny Phantom saying that This cartoon can be funny and the characters are unique But as is the case with so many contemporary cartoons the rush to violence overshadows the good aspects of the series Death threats torture knives and violence against women are commonplace There s no opportunity to work things out Danny is either a coward or a hero there s no in between He either fights or perishes which is a heavy choice for a sensitive guy br br br Awards and nominations br br br br br br External links br br Danny
