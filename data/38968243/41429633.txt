Reception br br br Critical br After a few episodes Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the show stars saying that Every Witch Way devotes too much time and energy to Maddie s superficiality and spite to be considered a likable choice for this impressionable age group And since none of Maddie s actions ever land her in hot water she can t work a spell to escape kids never see her learn a lesson She also notes it suffers from some subpar acting and a low budget look and feel and the absence of even a laugh track leaving it unusually flat for a tween sitcom And without the bells and whistles kids tend to like in their entertainment there s nothing to distract them from the excessive superficiality and pettiness that plague many of the central characters br br br Ratings br The
