S syndication rights were passed over to Debmar Mercury when its parent company Lionsgate owned home video rights Shout Factory assumed distribution rights to the series in February br Due to the inherent nature of producing a show featuring hand operated puppets la Jim Henson s The Muppet Show ALF was technically difficult and extremely demanding on series creator Fusco as well as its four lead actors All confirmed during a People magazine interview that there were constant high levels of tension on the set Max Wright stated that he despised supporting a technically demanding inanimate object that received most of the good lines of dialogue He admitted to being hugely eager to have ALF over with Artie Lange who later worked with Wright on The Norm Show told of a time when Wright had become crazed and physically attacked ALF causing producers to have to pull Wright off the puppet Anne Schedeen said that on the last night of taping the final episode there was one take and Max walked off the set went to his dressing room got his bags went to his car and disappeared There were no goodbyes Schedeen herself said there was no joy on the set it was a technical nightmare extremely slow hot and tedious A minute show took hours to shoot While fond of her on screen children Schedeen said some adults had difficult personalities The whole thing was a big dysfunctional family Schedeen added It s astonishing that ALF really was wonderful and that word never got out what a mess our set really was Andrea Elson who suffered from bulimia during the second season of shooting stated If ALF had gone one more year everybody would have lost it Wright later admitted that as the years passed he looked back at ALF with less animosity and conceded that It doesn t matter what I felt or what the days were like ALF brought people a lot of joy In reference to the tension Fusco commented in that It was just the nature of the beast There was no way we could have made it go any further or any faster he insisted I think it was frustrating that it would take so long but people got paid for what they did Despite what people thought that there was a lot of tension on set there really wasn t br Fusco was notoriously secretive about his character up until the series premiere During the show s production Fusco refused to acknowledge that the puppet ALF was anything other than an alien All involved with the production were cautioned not to reveal any of ALF s production secrets br The set was built on a platform raised four feet above the ground with trap doors constructed at many points so that ALF could appear almost anywhere Fusco operated him from underneath so the unoccupied holes all over the floor were deep and treacherous The trap doors had to be reset multiple times sometimes during a single scene Principal puppeteer Paul Fusco who was mainly left handed when puppeteering used his left hand to control ALF s mouth while his right hand controlled ALF s right arm Another puppeteer Lisa Buckley who would go on to perform on Sesame Street assisted Fusco beneath the stage operating ALF s left arm At times when ALF s full body was shown in the sitting position Lisa controlled ALF s left hand by cable allowing slight finger movements There was additionally a third puppeteer Bob Fappiano who controlled ALF s facial and ear movements via a radio control offscreen During tapings Fusco would wear a head mounted microphone to record ALF s voice The process resulted in numerous mistakes and retakes making it impossible to record ALF in front of a live audience A laugh track was added during post production br To avoid wear and tear on the principal ALF puppet the performers rehearsed with a crude early version of ALF nicknamed RALF For Rehearsal Alien Life Form Fusco did not like to rehearse and would often substitute his hand or RALF for the real ALF puppet during rehearsals br In an interview on Late Night with Conan O Brien Tina Fey said that her biggest frustration as producer of NBC s th anniversary special was dealing with ALF s people Fey said Fusco would only allow ALF to appear on the show if the puppeteers were hidden from everyone else After ALF s cameo alongside former Family Ties star Michael Gross ALF disappeared through a hole in the riser was stuffed into a case and immediately removed from the building br While a puppet was usually used for ALF there were some shots of the tiny alien running or walking around This was accomplished by the feet inches cm actor Michu Meszaros wearing an ALF costume This can be seen in one of the series intros which concludes with the Tanner family getting their picture taken ALF played by Meszaros walks over to be part of the photo However Meszaros services became too costly as well as time consuming and the full ALF costume was abandoned after the first season br ALF scored its highest ratings during Season reaching tenth place in the Nielsen ratings Ratings remained at a steady fifteenth place during Season but plummeted to th place during Season NBC moved the show from its traditional Monday night slot to Saturday in March and eventually moved to Sunday but ratings continued to fall br The season ending cliffhanger Consider Me Gone became an unintentional series finale when NBC gave Alien Productions a verbal commitment for a fifth season but ultimately withdrew its support ABC resolved the cliffhanger on February with the TV movie Project ALF NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff later told Fusco that the network regretted cancelling ALF prematurely saying It was a big mistake that we cancelled your show because you guys had at least one or two more seasons left br br br Censorship br br Fusco commented in that his most enjoyable experience on ALF was sitting in the Writers Room and pitching jokes while pushing the limit as to what NBC censors would allow Fusco commented that the greatest things were the jokes we couldn t put in the show Specifically puns dealing with ALF eating cats and other pets were problematic after NBC reported that a child placed a cat in a microwave after watching the show In the pilot episode A L F ALF is seen consuming a beer with Brian Fusco defended the premise saying that ALF is years old he can drink beer he s old enough However as ALF became more popular with children NBC told Fusco you can t have him drinking the kids are watching it s a bad role model Even though Fusco believed that ALF was an adult he can do it the alcohol consumption concept was discarded by the end of the first season with the exception of the episode Tequila where he inspires an alcoholic to check into rehab after a night of drinking with her and making her think he was a hallucination The cat eating concept carried sporadically into the second season with references including the wedding cat in the episode Wedding Bell Blues the Melmacian equivalent of a wedding cake br For the hour long season episode Try to Remember originally broadcast on February ALF tries to simulate a jacuzzi by bringing Kate s electric mixer into the bathtub thus receiving an electrical shock that caused amnesia Fusco ended the original episode with a public service announcement from ALF himself warning of the dangers of mixing water and electricity Despite this NBC reported that a child attempted to recreate the scenario and nearly electrocuted himself in the process Fusco confirmed that the child was unharmed Fusco was forced to refilm the opening sequence replacing the electric mixer with a manual egg beater ALF s amnesia is instead caused by a cranial concussion received after slipping in the shower a thud is heard rather than a zap with all mentions of being shocked either overdubbed with new dialogue or deleted entirely including ALF s public service announcement This edited version was used for a Fall rebroadcast as well as all future U S and Canadian syndicated airings br In blooper
