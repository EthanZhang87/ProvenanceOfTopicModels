by editing and polishing br br br Development br Rugrats was formed by the then husband and wife duo of G bor Csup and Arlene Klasky along with Paul Germain in the summer of Klasky Csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos Klasky Csup and Germain were also animating The Simpsons for Matt Groening at the time which they would continue to do until when the series producer James L Brooks and his company Gracie Films switched domestic production to Film Roman The trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children s cable network Nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated series which would be later called Nicktoons The network s Vice President of Animation Vanessa Coffey approached them to create a pilot for their new series With the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of Klasky and Csup s infant children the minute pilot episode Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing which never aired was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment in br Peter Chung along with Klasky and Csup co designed the characters and directed the series pilot as well as the opening sequence In a Decider article Chung said He G bor wanted the babies to be strange instead of cute The production was completed in and they submitted it to Nickelodeon who tested it with an audience of children The feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive With that Coffey and then network president Geraldine Laybourne approved of and bought the series and sent it into production Chuckie and Angelica were added as characters Following the success of its first season Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in November br Germain who felt that the series needed a bully based Angelica on a girl bully from his childhood and decided the character would be a spoiled brat Klasky initially disliked Angelica and also protested her actions in episodes like Barbecue Story where she throws Tommy s ball over the fence In a New Yorker article Klasky said I think she s a bully I never liked Angelica Klasky disdained Angelica and never fully approved of her character development Angelica became problematic for some Rugrats staff When her voice actress Cheryl Chase had problems portraying a mean Angelica Steve Viksten one of the writers would mention that Angelica was the series J R Ewing After seeing Angelica in The Rugrats Movie Klasky commented I think she s great for the show I love Angelica br br br Writing br According to Germain when the series was first conceived the rule was that babies can really talk but keep it a secret from adults However the rules quickly began to evolve and the babies became a metaphor for children of all ages During production of the first season in June Germain and his fellow writers would argue among themselves over whether the adults could not understand the babies talking or whether the babies only spoke to each other when adults were not around During the first season they tried a little of both although later in the season the writers would have the babies talk to each other while adults were in the same room as long as there was a lot of space between them By the end of the season the writers allowed the babies to talk to each other while in their strollers as long as adults were not in the same shot br br br Voice actors br Through its full run Rugrats had a steady array of main voice actors E G Daily voices Tommy Pickles except in the unaired pilot where Tami Holbrook provides the

and his brother Bob Mothersbaugh br br br Themes br Rugrats visualizes ordinary everyday activities through the eyes of a group of toddlers Using their imaginations the babies transform routine tasks into surprising adventures The babies having a limited understanding of the world constantly mispronounce words and use improper grammar Challenges often emerge because the babies misinterpret the adults usually caused by Angelica s deceptive translations The grown ups of Rugrats are simultaneously quirky over cautious and oblivious The series portrays adults as mysterious eccentrics Episodes
