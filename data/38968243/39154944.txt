unsuccessfully pitched twice to Nickelodeon before Trolf Dirschberger and Howell sought advice from Loren Bouchard whom Howell had designed characters for while creating Bob s Burgers for Fox Broadcasting Company Dirschberger said of the meeting that Bouchard showed us the Bob s Burgers pitch packet which was like four pages of beautifully executed writing and art and that was it So we combined what we had learned from the first two pitches put it in this really simple presentation The series usage of gross out humor is based on the fact both Howell and Dirschberger have mothers who are nurses and they ve told us a lot of gross stories over the years which also served as the basis for the character of Darlene Over the course of development Dirschberger changed Sanjay to a twelve year old boy without a weird quirk or affectation and the premise during the second pitch was four kids who lived in a garbage dump providing the basis for Sanjay and Craig s friends Megan and Hector br Since none of the three creators had produced a series before Nickelodeon chose McRobb and Viscardi as executive producers Howell said that their experience on Pete Pete helped them add surreal kids stuff to Sanjay and Craig Unlike most animated series Sanjay and Craig does not rely on scripting instead the writers make an outline which is then converted to a storyboard Thurop Van Orman known for creating The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack for Cartoon Network served as the supervising producer for the first season br The series is notable for featuring celebrity guest stars as
