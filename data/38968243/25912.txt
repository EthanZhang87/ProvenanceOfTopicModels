aired of the original three Nickelodeon animated series known as Nicktoons alongside Doug and Rugrats and is considered to be one of the progenitor series of the brand br The Ren Stimpy Show has received widespread critical acclaim from critics and audiences with praise going to its visuals animation and surreal nature However it has also generated significant controversy for its dark humor sexual innuendos adult humor violence and shock value This controversy contributed to the production staff s altercations with Nickelodeon s Standards and Practices department in addition to Sp mc s failure to deliver episodes on time all of which led to Kricfalusi s termination from the show in Games Animation would produce the remaining three seasons of the series One episode was initially left unaired in America until it was broadcast on MTV on October br The Ren Stimpy Show received highly positive reviews during its original run and has since developed a cult following It is considered by many to have had a long lasting influence on television animation br A revival for adult audiences Ren Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon was produced by Kricfalusi and Sp mc and aired in on Spike TV Only three episodes were aired before the series was canceled due to both production delays and negative critical reception from both critics and fans of the original series with three additional episodes all incomplete at the time of the cancellation being released straight to DVD in br On August Comedy Central announced that they had ordered a second revival of the series to be produced without the involvement of Kricfalusi br br br Premise br br The series centers on Ren H ek voiced by John Kricfalusi in seasons Billy West in seasons a hot tempered psychotic asthma hound Chihuahua and Stimpson J Stimpy Cat also voiced by Billy West a dimwitted and happy go lucky cat The duo fill various roles from episode to episode including outer space explorers Old West horse thieves and nature show hosts and are usually at odds with each other in these situations While the show was sometimes set in the present day the show s crew tended to avoid contemporary jokes about current events The show extensively features off color and absurdist humor as well as slapstick br The show features a host of supporting characters Due to the nature of the show most are seldom seen Some appear only in one episode while others recur and occasionally appear in different roles They may either be part of the storyline or make cameo appearances with little bearing on the plot Some such as Mr Horse are exclusively cameo based spontaneously appearing as a running gag br br br Development and history br br br Conception br According to animator William Wray John Kricfalusi created the characters Ren and Stimpy in for personal amusement while studying at Sheridan College in Ontario Canada He was inspired to create Ren by an Elliott Erwitt photograph printed on a postcard called New York City showing a sweatered chihuahua at a woman s feet Stimpy s design was inspired by a Tweety cartoon called A Gruesome Twosome where the cats in the animation had big noses br When Nickelodeon approached Kricfalusi he presented three shows among them a variety show titled Your Gang or Our Gang with a live action host presenting different cartoons each cartoon parodying a different genre Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the children in Your Gang serving as a parody of the cat and dog genre The network s vice president of animation production Vanessa Coffey was dissatisfied with the other projects but liked Ren and Stimpy singling them out for their own series Production of the series pilot episode began in the summer of after Kricfalusi pitched and sold The Ren Stimpy Show to Nickelodeon The pilot was produced by Kricfalusi s Los Angeles based animation company Sp mc and screened at film festivals for several months before the show was announced in Nickelodeon s cartoons line up br br br Sp mc br The series premiered on August alongside Doug and Rugrats as the original Nicktoons Sp mc continued to produce the show for the next two years while encountering issues with Nickelodeon s Standards and Practices department The show was known for its lack of early merchandising according to Wray the initial lack of merchandise was the unique and radical thing about The Ren Stimpy Show as no toy company planned for any merchandise for the show and Nickelodeon did not want to use over exploitive merchandising br Kricfalusi described his early period with Nickelodeon as being simple as he got along with Coffey the sole executive of the program When another executive was added they wanted to alter or discard some of the Ren Stimpy episodes but Kricfalusi says the episodes stayed intact since he did a trade with Coffey he would have some really crazy episodes in exchange for some heart warming episodes Kricfalusi also said that the program was the safest project he ever worked on while explaining the meaning of safe as spend a third of what they spend now per picture hire proven creative talent and let them entertain He estimated Sp mc s run of The Ren Stimpy Show cost around million to produce br The relationship between Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon deteriorated to the point where Kricfalusi would communicate with Nickelodeon only through his lawyer News outlets and several of the series staff ascribe the tension to episodes not being delivered promptly Author Andy Mangels writing for Wizard magazine commented that Kricfalusi s lax treatment of deadlines angered not only the networks but his loyal viewers as well However some of the delays were attributed to Nickelodeon s prolonged approval process and withdrawal of approval from scenes and episodes that had been previously approved Another point of contention was the direction of the series Kricfalusi cites the episode Man s Best Friend as the primary reason for his dismissal the character George Liquor is depicted in the episode as an abusive father figure and Nickelodeon did not want the show to be so frightening and dramatic br br br Games Animation br Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi s contract in late September and offered him the position of consultant for Ren Stimpy but he refused to sell out The network moved production from Sp mc to its newly founded animation studio Games Animation which later became Nickelodeon Animation Studio Bob Camp replaced Kricfalusi as director while West having refused Kricfalusi s request to leave along with him voiced Ren in addition to Stimpy br Fans and critics felt this was a turning point in the show with the new episodes being a considerable step down from the standard of those that preceded them Ted Drozdowski resident critic of The Boston Phoenix stated that the bloom faded on Ren Stimpy Animation historian Michael Barrier writes that while the creators of the Games episodes used crude jokes that were similar to those used by Kricfalusi they did not find the material particularly funny they were merely doing what was expected br The series ended its original run on Nickelodeon on December with A Scooter for Yaksmas and had a total of five seasons and episodes although one episode from the final season Sammy and Me The Last Temptation remained unaired Almost a year later the episode aired on Nickelodeon s sister network MTV on October br br br Production br br br Process br The animation production methods used in The Ren Stimpy Show were similar to those found in Golden Age cartoons of the early th century where a director supervised the entire process These methods are in contrast with animation production methods in the s where there was one director for animation and a different director for voice actors and the cartoons were created with a top down approach to tie in with toy production br Animator Vincent Waller compared working on Ren Stimpy and SpongeBob SquarePants in an interview Working on Ren and Stimpy and SpongeBob was very similar They re both storyboard driven shows which means they give us an outline from a premise after the premise has been approved We take the outline and expand on it writing the dialogue and gags That was very familiar br br br Animation br The show s aesthetics draw on Golden Age cartoons particularly those of animator Bob Clampett from the s in the way the characters emotions powerfully distort their bodies The show s style emphasizes unique expressions intense and specific acting and strong character poses One of the show s most notable visual trademarks is the detailed paintings of gruesome close ups along with the blotchy ink stains that on occasion replace the standard backgrounds reminiscent of holes in reality or the vision of a person in a deep state of dementia This style was developed from Clampett s Baby Bottleneck which features several scenes with color cards for backgrounds The show incorporated norms from the old system in TV and radio where the animation would feature sponsored products to tie in with the cartoon but in lieu of real advertisements it featured fake commercial breaks advertising nonexistent products most notably Log br Kricfalusi cited Carbunkle Cartoons an animation studio headed by Bob Jaques and Kelly Armstrong for beautifully animating the show s best episodes improving the acting with subtle nuances and wild animation that could not be done with overseas animation studios Some of the show s earlier episodes were rough to the point Kricfalusi felt the need to patch up the animation with sound effects and music bandaids helping the segments play better even though much of the animation and timing weren t working on their own KJ Dell Antonia of Common Sense Media describes the show s style as changing from intentionally rough to much more polished and plushie toy ready br br br Voice acting br Kricfalusi originally voiced Ren styled after a demented Peter Lorre from the film The Maltese Falcon When Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi s contract Billy West already the voice of Stimpy took the role using a combination of Burl Ives Kirk Douglas and a slight south of the border accent for the rest of the Nickelodeon run West voiced Stimpy for the Sp mc and Games Animation episodes basing the voice on an amped up Larry Fine Some notable artists and performers who voiced incidental characters on the show were Frank Zappa in his final public performance before his death Jack Carter Stan Freberg Tommy Davidson Randy Quaid Gilbert Gottfried Rosie O Donnell Dom DeLuise Phil Hartman Mark Hamill and Soleil Moon Frye br br br Music br The Ren Stimpy Show features a wide variety of music spanning rockabilly folk pop jazz classical music jingles and more The opening theme Dog Pound Hop was performed by a group of Sp mc employees under the name Die Screaming Leiderh sens Three Ren Stimpy albums have been released In a compilation album You Eediot was released as a soundtrack album The album s front cover is a parody of The Beatles th studio album Abbey Road br Stimpy s rousing anthem titled Happy Happy Joy Joy was composed by Christopher Reccardi and written by Charlie Brissette and John Kricfalusi A cover of this song performed by Wax is included on the tribute album Saturday Morning Cartoons Greatest Hits produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records br br br Controversy and censorship br The program s staff did not want to create an educational series a stance that bothered Nickelodeon leading to the series being criticized by parent groups Some segments of the show were altered to exclude references to religion politics alcohol violence and tobacco The episode Powdered Toast Man had a cross removed from the Pope s hat and the credit was changed to the man with the pointy hat The same episode had a segment featuring the burning of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that was removed while in Dog Show the last name of the character George Liquor was removed being changed to George American Many other episodes included someone smoking a cigar pipe or a cigarette br Several episodes had violent gruesome or suggestive scenes shortened or removed including a sequence involving a severed head a close up of Ren s face being grated against a man s stubble and a scene that was shortened where Ren receives multiple punches to the stomach from a baby In the second season episode Sven H ek during the scene where Ren fantasizes Stimpy and his cousin Sven s deaths after they break all of his prized possessions his line Then I m going to gouge your eyes out yeah was cut One infamous episode Man s Best Friend was banned by Nickelodeon for its violent content Neither Nickelodeon nor MTV would air the episode Years later on Spike TV the show s revival Ren Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon debuted with this banned episode as their unofficial pilot even receiving a TV MA rating br br br Episodes br br The series ran for five seasons spanning episodes The show was produced by Kricfalusi s animation studio Sp mc for the first two seasons Beginning with season three the show was produced by Nickelodeon s Games Animation The episode Man s Best Friend was produced for season two but the episode was shelved and debuted with the show s reboot Another episode Sammy and Me The Last Temptation aired on MTV on October almost a year after the original Nickelodeon run ended br br br Reception br The Ren Stimpy Show received widespread critical acclaim Matt Groening creator of The Simpsons praised the show for its outrageousness and called it the only good cartoon on TV other than The Simpsons Terry Thoren former CEO and president of Klasky Csupo said that Kricfalusi tapped into an audience that was a lot hipper than anybody thought He went where no man wanted to go before the caca booger humor Jonathan Valania of The Morning Call called it high voltage yuks and industrial strength weirdness John Lyttle of The Independent described it as a gooey media meltdown absolutely grotesque and instantly recognisable and did not consider it a children s cartoon br As of the first season of the show holds a rare approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews from critics though the remaining seasons have not been rated br The show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon having double the viewership of the other Nickelodeon cartoons for its first season and later averaging three times their viewership Due to the first season s high ratings Nickelodeon renewed the series for twenty additional episodes in November alongside the second season of Rugrats and the second and third season of Doug The show for a time was the most popular cable TV show with several airings being the most watched scripted cable TV show in in the United States The show quickly developed a cult following in college campuses and was included in the launch of Nickelodeon s Snick a late night block for shows that appeal to both children and adults br br br Legacy and influence br The immediate influence of the show was the spawning of two clones Hanna Barbera s Stupid Dogs in which Sp mc employees including Kricfalusi had some limited involvement after their departure from Ren Stimpy and Disney s The Shnookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show However The Ren Stimpy Show had a wider influence on the future of animation br Mike Judge credits MTV s willingness to commission Beavis and Butt Head to the success of Ren Stimpy on the network Writer Larry Brody credits Ren Stimpy for leading a new golden age of animation as other networks followed Nickelodeon and invested in new cartoons opening the way for more adult oriented satirical shows like Beavis and Butt Head br David Feiss an animation director of the show went on to create Cartoon Network s Cow and Chicken John Kricfalusi became a teacher of sorts for Fred Seibert and was the first person Seibert called while looking for new talent for the project What A Cartoon Writer animator Allan Neuwirth writes that Ren Stimpy broke the mold and started several trends in TV animation chiefly the revival of credits at the beginning of each episode the use of grotesque close ups and a shift in cartoon color palettes to richer more harmonious colors br A direct influence can be seen in the series SpongeBob SquarePants with the physically extreme drawings that contrast with the characters usual appearance the grotesque close ups br The characters became a cultural touchstone in the mid s and were featured in works such as the films Clueless The Cable Guy and Jack both Ren Stimpy placed st in TV Guide s list of Top Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time in The cover story of the October issue of Wizard a magazine for comic book fans listed the Greatest Toons ever as selected by their readers with Ren Stimpy ranked at number Other entertainment journals similarly hold Ren Stimpy as one of the best cartoons of the s and cartoons for adults br br br Revivals br br br Ren Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon br br In a reboot of the series helmed by John Kricfalusi titled Ren Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon was launched on a late night programming block on Spike TV and was rated TV MA The new series is more adult oriented than the original and features an explicitly homosexual relationship between the main characters strong profanity graphic violence and female nudity br Billy West declined to participate in Adult Party Cartoon saying that it wasn t funny and joining it would have damaged his career Eric Bauza subsequently replaced West as the voice of Stimpy in the series while Kricfalusi reprised his roles as both Ren and Mr Horse The series premiered with the banned Nickelodeon episode Man s Best Friend before debuting new episodes thereafter From the first episode fans and critics alike were put off by this revival which featured the consumption of bodily fluids such as nasal mucus saliva and vomit Much like the original series Kricfalusi showed apparent disregard for meeting production deadlines with only three out of the ordered nine episodes being completed on time After the first three episodes aired Spike s entire animation block was removed from its programming schedule and three more episodes already in production and completed by the time Adult Party Cartoon was canceled were subsequently released three years later in on the Ren Stimpy The Lost Episodes DVD br br br Appearances in Nicktoons crossover film and cancelled short br In February Deadline Hollywood

about another revival of the characters Bob Camp and William Wray revealed in an April panel discussion that Kricfalusi was developing a new Ren Stimpy short that would be shown in theaters with the third SpongeBob SquarePants film and later said that they were not invited to that party and would not be involved with the short s production However Kricfalusi later denied making such a cartoon on
