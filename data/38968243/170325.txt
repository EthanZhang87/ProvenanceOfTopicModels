br Pilot br br The Cosby Show pilot episode uses the same title sequence as the rest of the first season and is widely regarded as the first episode However it contains a number of differences from the remainder of the series br In the pilot the Huxtables have only four children Following the pilot the Huxtables have five children with the addition of their eldest daughter Sondra Sabrina Le Beauf who is mentioned in episode four and appears first in episode The character was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child who had graduated from college br Bill Cosby originally wanted Vanessa Williams to play the part of Sondra due to her college education and background in theater arts However Williams had recently been crowned the first black Miss America and pageant officials would not permit her to play the role while she was representing the Miss America pageant Whitney Houston was also considered for the role of Denise Huxtable but was unable to commit to the full time television production schedule in the NBC contract as she intended to become a full time music recording artist br Most of the story in the pilot presentation is taken from Bill Cosby s comedy film Bill Cosby Himself Cosby s character is called Clifford in the early episodes of the first season but his name was later switched to Heathcliff br Additionally Vanessa refers to Theo as Teddy twice in the dining room scene The interior of the Huxtables home features an entirely different living room from subsequent episodes and

br Conception and development br br In the early s Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner two former executives at ABC left the network to start their own production company Carsey Werner At ABC they had overseen sitcoms such as Mork Mindy Three s Company and Welcome Back Kotter The two partners decided that to get a sitcom to sell for their fledgling company they needed a big name behind it Bill Cosby had had performed stand up comedy with award winning albums and starred in several genres in TV and film in the s and s but his career had become more static by the early s According to a Chicago Tribune article from July despite Carsey and Werner s connection to the network Lewis Erlicht president of ABC Entertainment passed on the show prompting a pitch to rival network NBC br Outside of his work on his cartoon series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids Cosby was doing little in film or television but Carsey and Werner were fans of Cosby s stand up comedy and thought it would be the perfect material for a family sitcom br Cosby originally proposed that the couple should both have blue collar jobs with the father a limousine driver who owned his own car and the mother an electrician With advice from his wife Camille Cosby though the concept was changed so that the family was well off financially with the mother a lawyer and the father a physician br Cosby wanted the program to be educational reflecting his own background in education He also insisted that the program be taped in New York City instead of Los Angeles where most television programs were taped The

Lawrence Miles Davis James Brown B B King Stevie Wonder Sammy Davis Jr Lena Horne Duke Ellington Dizzy Gillespie and Miriam Makeba br The spin off A Different World dealt with racial issues more often The Cosby Show s series finale taped March aired during the Los Angeles riots with Cosby quoted in media at the time pleading for peace br During the third season Rashad was pregnant with her daughter Condola Rather than write this pregnancy in the producers simply greatly reduced Rashad s scenes or filmed in such a way that her pregnancy was not noticeable br Another main cast member pregnancy that of Bonet almost caused the actress to be fired especially coming in the wake of appearing in the film Angel Heart which contained explicit sexual scenes with actor Mickey Rourke Cosby strongly disapproved of Bonet s role but allowed her to continue on World until returning to Cosby after her pregnancy Tensions remained however and Bonet was eventually fired in April br br br Theme song and
