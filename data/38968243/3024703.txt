the episodes Secret Agent Manual Wealth vs Stealth and Train Rex br br br Characters br br br SUPERIOR br Mr X voiced by Patrick Warburton is the family patriarch team leader of the X s and the main protagonist of the series Tucker is the expert at hand to hand combat and is similar to James Bond and Maxwell Smart Although a competent spy he struggles with everyday issues such as remembering his civilian name which is Tucker He is also an excellent cook and very strict and stern In one episode his shoe phone self destructed as a parody of both Get Smart and Mission Impossible Mr X is years old and was born in br Mrs X voiced by Wendie Malick is the second in command and combat specialist of the X s Mrs X is fully trained in hand to hand combat and martial arts but is a horrible cook She is a tennis expert Mrs X is known for administering savage beatings to Glowface She s a very caring and protective mother to Tuesday and Truman Mrs X is years old and was born in Her first name is Trudy br Tuesday X voiced by Lynsey Bartilson is Mr and Mrs X s teenage daughter and missions investigator Tuesday is the most normal of the team despite her rather extreme punk rock garb and frequently changing hair color She is also the most knowledgeable of real world behavior which the other family members either misunderstand or ignore outright She definitely takes after her mother in savagery and fighting skills but at heart Tuesday is a genuine teenager who wants to do other things besides spy missions with her family She easily gets annoyed with Truman for making fun of the size of her huge butt despite that she behaves like a caring sister like in the episode You Only Sneeze Twice when Truman s look alike robot was about to explode she became worried and in another episode From Crusha with Love she guided Truman with his date by advising him In the episode X Takes a Holiday it s revealed that Tuesday is years old and was born in br Truman X voiced by Jansen Panettiere is Mr and Mrs X s year old son and technology expert He was born on November Truman is the smartest of all the X s His radiation experiments cause so many meltdowns that the local Decontamination Squad is on a first name basis with the X s The enfant terrible of the X s Truman can sometimes be a nuisance and make trouble br Rex X vocal effects provided by Dee Bradley Baker is Truman s dog he got on his th birthday from Sasquatch Rex was meant to kill Truman with Sasquatch controlling Rex with his mind controlling roar but after Truman wouldn t fight him because he thought he would finally have the perfect birthday with him and Truman told about all the good times they had After those words Rex broke free from the mind control and also all the other animals Later Rex became an honorary member for SUPERIOR His first appearance was in Boy s Best Fiend and has since appeared in other episodes such as To Err is Truman Missing Home Train Rex and The Haunting of Homebase br Home Base voiced by Stephen Root describes itself in the title sequence of The X s as the house they live in but Home Base is most likely the name for the computerized brain that runs the functions of their house neither Mr X nor Mrs X appear to be competent about household chores though Mr X can mow the grass Home Base serves as advisor SUPERIOR contact and mission alert for the X s and can be contacted from the X Jet It also serves as the somewhat beleaguered voice of reason in the family Seen from above Home Base is shaped like an X He is visually similar to HAL from Stanley Kubrick s A Space Odyssey br br br Villains br S N A F U is an evil organization that the X s fight It s acronym is short for Society of Nefarious and Felonious Undertakings br Glowface voiced by Chris Hardwick is the X s archenemy the leader of S N A F U and the main villain of the series Glowface s head is encased in a glass globe with electrical discharges He wears a rubber suit and gloves to contain his vast energies His schemes to get rid of the X s include having Mrs X break her leg on a coffee table and sending them coupons for family portraits Like traditional evil villains Glowface is megalomaniacal arrogant psychotic loudmouthed and delusional but he possesses little sophistication or maturity and believes himself to be much more of a threat than he actually is Similar to Dr Evil from Austin Powers Doctor Claw from Inspector Gadget Satan from South Park Dr Drakken from Kim Possible Vito Corleone from The Godfather and Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the James Bond series he also tends to think up idiotic evil schemes like building a giant ray gun in order to bring the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben to life in order for them to wrestle so he can sell tickets He has very poor teeth and once had to get braces Glowface is disdainful of the crush his nephew Brandon has on Tuesday Glowface is also allergic to zucchini and has an unseen way of eating food The only thing that Glowface and Tucker have in common are building model train sets br Lorenzo Suave voiced by Tom Kane is Glowface s assistant and butler Lorenzo seems to be an amalgam of all the villainous second in command spy clich s He is stylishly and impeccably dressed with a mustache goatee a scar along one cheek and both an eyepatch and a monocle Lorenzo is much more intelligent than Glowface and sometimes has to maneuver him into completing his plans when Glowface begins one of his rants Though he is human Lorenzo is most likely S N A F U s mirror to Home Base He becomes miffed when Glowface claims after he took off his horrid disguise and introduced himself that no one cares He along with the S N A F U minions are the most commonly appeared S N A F U workers of Glowface One time when Glowface was sick alongside the other S N A F U agents Lorenzo proved to be a better villain than Glowface or any of the others members of S N A F U Just as Glowface is similar to Dr Evil Suave resembles Dr Evil s Number who actually makes his evil organization work As Tuesday X is the most normal of the X s Suave is the most normal of the S N A F U members br Sasquatch voiced by Randy Savage appears to be an unspecified and scary man beast that has a roar that can hypnotize or brainwash animals to do his bidding He is probably the strongest member of S N A F U Sasquatch s goal is to return the animals to their rightful place as masters of the planet He continuously refers to himself in the third person with the catchphrase Sasquatch is the mightiest of all before making another comment br Brandon voiced by Jason Schwartzman in The Spy Who Liked Me David Hornsby in later appearances is Glowface s nephew Brandon is a very nice handsome and even somewhat gallant teenage boy but unfortunately he s working with his uncle as an intern for S N A F U He has a crush on Tuesday and the two date even planning dates in the midst of a battle much to the dismay of both the X s who don t much like the idea of Tuesday dating in general and Glowface who doesn t like the idea of Brandon dating the daughter of his nemesis at all Mr and Mrs X are fairly open minded about the relationship on the other hand Glowface teases Brandon about his new girlfriend whenever possible He tends to treat his uncle s plans with either disdain or apathy and never really acts as a villain br The Scream Queens are a duo of Banshee esqe

like a chimpanzee human hybrid He only appears in Photo Ops br Some Old Guy voiced by Tom Kane is an old man He isn t actually a real member of S N A F U he just thought that the photo shop where Glowface tricked the X s was the nickel store Some Old Guy frequently appears as a joke with the rest of the S N A F U agents when Glowface introduces all the S N A F U agents present in a battle His voice volume and dramatic tone increase with each name coming to conclusion with the most dramatic introduction being that of Some Old Guy br The S N A F U Minions all voiced by Carlos Ramos are Glowface s Minions and foot soldiers of S N A F U They wear uniforms with their heads encased in globes Their faces are never seen but the silhouettes of their heads are seen in those globes They have their birthdays celebrated each month on a day called Cake Day for any foot soldiers who have their birthday in that month br Copperhead voiced by Tom Kenny Half man half machine Unlike Glowface he never stays in one place for long It was never actually revealed that he is part of S N A F U or operating on his own but he is the most evil of all evil spies He has power over magnetism but he runs on a large battery in his back br br br Minor br Kimla Meeks voiced by Ashley Johnson is Tuesday s st friend appeared in A Truman Scorned License to Slumber and Theater of War She is a huge fan of science fiction and is also very knowledgeable about sci fi movies comics etc Kimla also seems to be somewhat naive as she didn t notice Truman s crush on her and that the X s are spies despite her

the series involves Kimla s intergalactic chanting br Skipper Swenson voiced by Lindsay Sloane is Tuesday s nd friend appeared in License to Slumber Skipper is generally stuck up and is rude to
