Gameplay br br The set design of Legends of the Hidden Temple was based on the Indiana Jones movies and Marianne Arneberg of the Orlando Sentinel described the program as a combination of Jeopardy and Raiders of the Lost Ark The set design has been described as Mayan It included areas for different types of physical challenges a broad but shallow pool of water the moat a set of steps the Steps of Knowledge and a large two and a half floor vertical labyrinth the hidden temple At the temple s gate was a talking Olmec head simply named Olmec voiced by Dee Baker Olmec narrated the stories told in the steps of knowledge and temple game challenges although in the first season Fogg narrated the temple game challenges Each episode centered on a particular legend regarding an artifact real or fictional from around the world that found its way to the temple Some artifacts included Lawrence of Arabia s Headdress The Electrified Key of Benjamin Franklin The Jewel Encrusted Egg of Catherine the Great and The Broken Wing of Icarus Olmec also serves as the basis for the logo In addition to providing an artifact the legend also was important to other aspects of the show the Steps of Knowledge used questions based on the historical legend and the theme of the temple games was also loosely based on the legend br In each episode six teams of two contestants began a three round competition to determine which team earned the right to enter the temple Each team was identified with a color and an animal indicated on their uniform shirts the Red Jaguars Blue Barracudas Green Monkeys Orange Iguanas Purple Parrots and Silver Snakes br br br Round The Moat br In the first round of the show the six teams attempted to cross a narrow swimming pool known as the moat in a prescribed manner For example in one episode teams were required to swing out to a rope net in the middle of the moat climb it and then swim to the other side All six teams attempted to get both members across according to the rules and push a button on a pedestal to ring a gong The first four teams to cross the moat and ring their gongs advanced to the second round br br br Round The Steps of Knowledge br The four remaining teams stood on the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode s legend of the featured artifact which became the theme for the remainder of the episode The legend centered on an artifact that the winning team searched for in the final round At the end of the legend Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found After finishing he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory Each multiple choice question had three possible answers A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a buzzer on their step causing the front of the step to illuminate if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question he stopped talking immediately A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time three seconds after being called upon the other teams were given a chance to answer The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round br br br Round The Temple Games br The temple games featured the two remaining teams competing in three physical challenges to earn Pendants of Life which the winning team used in the final round Several types of temple games were featured with the episode s legend serving as a theme for each Most temple games lasted for a maximum of seconds but some were untimed After each challenge the winning team received some portion of a protective Pendant of Life The first two challenges pitting single members from each team against one another were worth one half of a pendant while the final challenge involving both contestants on both teams was worth a full pendant If a temple game ended in a tie both teams received the pendant value of that game br The team that earned the most pendants by the end of three temple games won the right to enter the temple If the two teams earned the same number of pendants after the three temple games the teams played a tiebreaker to determine who advanced to the temple The teams stood behind a tiebreaker pedestal and Fogg since Season Olmec asked a tiebreaker question to determine the winner The first team to hit the buzzer on top of their gong was given the chance to answer the question A correct answer allowed the team to go to the temple Originally a team that buzzed in and gave an incorrect answer or ran out of time automatically lost allowing the other team to advance to the temple by default However in Seasons and the other team was required to answer the question correctly to go to the temple br br br Final Round The Temple Run br br In the final round the winning team took the Pendants of Life the contestants earned into the temple and attempted to retrieve the episode s artifact and bring it back out of the temple within a three minute time limit The team designated one member to enter the temple first that team member carried one of the team s full pendants The other team member held the remaining pendant half pendant or no pendant at all and stood by to enter if the first team member was taken out of the temple by a temple guard Before starting Olmec would explain the rooms in the temple and the necessary tasks in each room During season Fogg asked who would go first and explained about the temple guards and if necessary the extra half pendant Beginning in season Olmec himself explained these things br br The temple consisted of twelve rooms each with a specific theme e g the Throne Room the King s Storeroom the Observatory the Shrine of the Silver Monkey the Heart Room etc The rooms were connected to adjacent rooms by doorways although some doors were locked blocking a contestant s progress into the adjacent room the pattern of locked and unlocked doors changed from episode to episode depending both on the temple layout and the artifact s location The unlocked doors were closed at the start of the round but they could be opened by completing a specific task or puzzle within each room One room in the temple contained the themed artifact as stated by Olmec before the Steps of Knowledge round Three other designated rooms held temple guards spotters in Lavish Mayan sentinel costumes If the winning team had exactly pendants the remaining half pendant was also placed in a room for the contestant with the half pendant to collect to make a full pendant The extra half pendant if needed would either be hanging on the wall near a door or placed inside an object in a room e g hidden inside a pot in the King s Storeroom If the first player dropped their pendant the second player could pick it up and either throw it back to their partner or use it if needed br A contestant who encountered a temple guard was forced to give up a full pendant to continue However if the first contestant was caught without a pendant in his or her possession he or she was taken out of the temple and the second contestant entered In either case the temple guard who captured the contestant was out of play and did not appear again in the room where the first contestant was captured When the second contestant entered any doors that the first contestant opened remained open If the second contestant was caught without a full pendant the run ended immediately A player could enter a room with an unencountered temple guard on their way to the artifact and not get caught usually if the room design makes it so that the guard can only capture the player if within reach e g the Dark Forest is where one of the trees could be inhabited by the spirit of a temple guard which was signaled if the tree grabbed the player but the player had to be within reach to trigger the tree br The team had three minutes to retrieve the artifact and leave the temple with it If either contestant grabbed the artifact all remaining temple guards vanished and all locked doors in the temple instantly opened allowing the contestant to escape unhindered For entering the temple the team automatically won a prize If a team member picked up the artifact the team won a more expensive prize as well A team that retrieved the artifact and exited the temple with it before time ran out earned the grand prize and the other two prizes Starting with season the temple had an actual gate that Olmec would lower before the round started br br br revival br The basic format remained the same as the Nickelodeon show with the following changes br br Each episode lasts a full hour rather than a half hour br Each episode features four teams of adults with same gender teams allowed br Confessionals occur during the first three rounds br The first three teams to cross the moat advance to the Steps of Knowledge br The episode s featured legend is now told more extensively in separate parts before each round instead of just before the Steps of Knowledge br There are two temple games each played for a full pendant and with both teammates playing The two teams compete head to head in one game while the other is a timed challenge with the winner of the Steps of Knowledge having the choice of which team goes first If the teams split the first two games Olmec asks a single tiebreaker question for the final pendant br Olmec reveals the location of the artifact before the Temple Run instead of the Steps of Knowledge br The temple consists of rooms instead of and the rooms are much larger than the original br Temple guards often appear after the contestant finishes the room s objective instead of right when the player enters the room br Teams have four minutes rather than three minutes to complete the Temple Run in a redesigned temple The winning team receives just for entering the temple which is increased to if they reach the artifact and to if they exit the temple before time expires br br br Reception br Writing for Entertainment Weekly A J Jacobs listed Legends of the Hidden
