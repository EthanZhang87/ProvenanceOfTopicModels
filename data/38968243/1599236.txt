games for the opportunity to guess a hidden picture on a giant screen made up of smaller screens The show was recorded at Nickelodeon Studios in Universal Studios Orlando Florida The program s theme music and game music was composed by Dan Vitco and Mark Schultz and produced by Schultz Its tagline is The Great Frame Game br There were episodes taped for season one in the spring of and episodes taped for season two in the summer of that same year Season two began airing on August br br br Gameplay br Two teams of two players one wearing orange jumpsuits and one wearing yellow jumpsuits competed br The object of the game was to correctly guess hidden pictures on a square video wall and to answer general knowledge trivia questions to earn opportunities to guess This was done in two separate rounds br br br Round Connect The Dots br The gameplay described here is from the first season Changes are detailed in another subsection br In this round an outline of dots representing something in a set category was revealed on the square video wall A series of general knowledge trivia questions would be asked to the teams with a correct answer earning that team and a choice of a square Once a square was chosen the dots in it were connected to the rest of the puzzle and the team had five seconds to guess the picture Guessing correctly earned while an incorrect guess lost There was no penalty for not guessing br The round continued until time ran out If a picture was being played when time was called it would be revealed one square at a time until someone guessed correctly and earned the Multiple guesses were allowed with no penalties for incorrect guesses br br br Power Surges br At various points in the game the teams would reveal Power Surges randomly hidden on the board In round one a square that hid one allowed the team to play a bonus game for a chance at and see an actual piece of the puzzle instead of the connected dots There were two of these hidden in each picture and every Power Surge in the round involved some sort of knowledge based activity Failing to complete the Power Surge within the time limit awarded the money and the square to the opposing team br br br Round Dots br The second round featured an actual image hidden behind the video wall Each of the squares four corners were marked with numbers and each question had two three or four possible answers As in Round if a team failed to answer correctly in this case come up with the allotment of correct answers the opposing team would be able to steal control by completing the allotment themselves Giving the required amount of correct answers won a team and the team was able to complete as many lines as there were correct answers in the question Once the four dots on the outside of the square were connected the part of the image hidden behind the square was revealed br Pictures in round two were worth with incorrect guesses still triggering a penalty and one Power Surge was on the board This time the Power Surges were played at center stage and involved the players doing some sort of physical activity in order to reveal pieces of a picture puzzle br Again if time was running short the puzzle in play would be revealed one square at a time until someone guessed correctly for Whoever was ahead when time was called won the game and advanced to the bonus round dubbed Mega Memory Both teams kept whatever they had won with a house minimum of The runner up team also received consolation prizes in addition to their money br In the event of a tie one final puzzle was played with the speed up rules whichever team guessed it correctly won the game br br br Physical activities Season only br br All physical Power Surges except one involved players performing tasks in order to reveal pieces to a picture After the team completed the Power Surge they were given one chance to guess what the picture was for failure to do so redirected to the opposing team The games continued until all nine numbers were revealed time ran out or a team ran out of objects br br Toss Across Played similar to the Tyco game of the same name The team playing had seconds to toss computer chips in an attempt to flip over the nine game pieces The pieces were three sided and had numbers punctuation marks and the Get the Picture logo on them with the object being to reveal the numbers The first few times this was played two of the sides had numbers Presumably to avoid having all the numbers being revealed early this was quickly changed to only one side having numbers and the other having punctuation marks The Get the Picture logo side remained intact br Ring Toss for Pieces Same idea as Toss Across with the exception of the team having to throw rings over spots on a computer motherboard The spots were not all in order however br Putting for Pieces Similar to mini golf with nine holes to putt into br Shuffling for Pieces Similar to shuffleboard with the exception of the team shuffling large floppy disks trying to get the center of the disk onto designated spots in numerical order from top to bottom This game and the ring toss game used a larger grid than the Toss Across and mini golf games br Jigsaw Puzzle The team had seconds to put a jigsaw puzzle together retrieving the pieces from a podium and placing them on a giant jigsaw puzzle board When time ran out or if the puzzle had been completed the contestants had to guess what the picture formed by the puzzle was br br br Mega Memory br The winning team faced a nine square board that hid nine pictures all in relation to a theme revealed before the round The pictures were shown to the players for ten seconds with the object being to remember where they were placed A nine numbered keypad was used by the players with each picture hidden behind a corresponding number For seconds O Malley would read clues one at a time and the team would hit the number on the keypad that they thought would reveal the correct picture A team was encouraged to take turns but this rule was not enforced br For each correct answer up to six the team split The seventh and eighth matches won merchandise prizes and if a team matched all nine pictures before time ran out they won a grand prize br br br Season Two changes br In season two the rules were changed to the following br br The game was played for points instead of money br A toss up picture was played at the beginning of the game for points br All Power Surges were knowledge based and an additional Power Surge was added in Round Every Power Surge took place at center stage br The time limit in Mega Memory was reduced to seconds with the team splitting for each of the first six matches br Instead of computer keyboard buzzers the teams used blue plunger buzzers and wore nametags on their jumpsuits br The podium the contestants stood at was redesigned Season One just had a small Get the Picture logo at the center of the screen The redesigned version for Season Two had a massive logo that took up the entire board br The connect the dots intro to Season One was removed in lieu of a glance at the initial toss up puzzle br It was more common in Season Two to show a screenshot of a completed puzzle following its completion even if the audience had already seen it completed br br br Reruns br Although the series ended first run
