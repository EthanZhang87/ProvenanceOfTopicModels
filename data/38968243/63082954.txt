Rated K For Kids by Kids is an American movie review television program that ran on the cable network Nickelodeon from br br br Format br Each week the show would feature a rotating blend of three young teenagers giving their opinions on the latest feature films and sometimes what was new on home video Each review was capped by an otherwise inconsistent letter grade system for example A for Amazing C for Classic Confusing or Crazy G for Go S for See It or So So and T for Terrific with Letter K being that show s equivalent to an ultimate perfect or star scale br The three hosts would sit together on at a small blue table on a curved pink couch with white printed stars While the introductions that summarized the films were scripted the on air reviews themselves were completely improvised This usually resulted in a lot of playful teasing and ribbing between the hosts The original hosts were Matt Nespole Lakmini Besbroda Mark Shanahan and Rebecca Schwager Other first wave hosts included Jennifer Rosa Kimani Bethea and Eben David br Because of the show s target demographic by nature of it airing on Nickelodeon and the ages and young perspective of the hosts themselves very rarely did Rated K For Kids by Kids feature R rated movies The show would usually only feature an R rated movie if it was in some way deemed relevant to the young audience such as s Stand by Me which was about four young boys who go on a days long hike to find a dead body Other times the show would review movies that while weren t R rated would nonetheless not immediately be considered desirable or appealing to the show s young demographic For example the Jack Lemmon Julie Andrews middle aged drama That s Life was reviewed on Rated K For Kids by Kids br At times if there were not enough age appropriate movies to review for the week the hosts would resort to discussing older features that were already out on VHS One episode featured a segment discussing the works of Alfred Hitchcock Another featured an on set interview with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel br br br The Big Ballot br For the next four weeks beginning on March the Rated K cast presented the results of a nationwide poll conducted by Nickelodeon that asked kids what their favorites in film television popular music and sports from the past year were Thus came The Big Ballot which was a pre produced program where ballots for the show s awards were cast via mail and then the winners would tape a thank you video that was shown during the program These videos were introduced and broken up by link segments featuring the Rated K cast The Big Ballot was sponsored by Bonkers fruit chews and Post Cereal br One year later Nickelodeon would take the basic concept of The Big Ballot and reconfigure it into what is now known as the Kids Choice Awards Unlike The Big Ballot which was a pre produced program produced at the Rated K studio in New York City the Kids Choice Awards was a televised live event Also unlike winners receiving an Orange Blimp Award at the Kids Choice Awards which technically wasn t introduced until the trophy that winners received for The Big Ballot was a golden teleidoscope br Nickelodeon has never officially considered The Big Ballot to be the first ever Kids Choice Awards event As previously mentioned unlike Kids Choice Awards which was a live prime time singular event The Big Ballot took place over the course of four weeks from March April During this time span Rated K For Kids by Kids still reviewed movies like the Bruce Willis Kim Basinger comedy Blind Date at the start of the episodes before going into a segment on The Big Ballot br br br Later episodes br Going into the respective cancellations of Nickelodeon s celebrity and music interview talk show Livewire and the Leonard Nimoy hosted movie behind the scenes program Standby Lights Camera Action from the past two years consequently resulted in a dramatic shift regarding Rated K s role on the channel With Rated K now left as Nickelodeon s sole modern multi media program the channel decided that now would be the perfect time to broaden the show s focus and revamp its overall look and presentation br For starters Nickelodeon decided to replace Matt Nespole Lakmini Besbroda Mark Shanahan and Rebecca Schwager who were admittedly by this point aging out of their roles on the show with Stefanie Marco Jeremy Ryan Kirk Gibbons Robyn Griggs Joel Savani Alek Lev and Brad Kane br The new hosts were each given a designated role For example movie reviews were now handled by only two critics Robyn Griggs and Joel Savani Brad Kane meanwhile hosted the Rated K Update In these short segments that usually ran during commercial breaks or during longer shows Kane interviewed famous young people and discussed topics in entertainment and politics in a fun way that was designed to appeal to children Among the people that Kane interviewed were Alyssa Milano Chad Allen and Carrie Fisher br The sets were also completely overhauled to resembling a movie concession stand with a pastel color palette And unlike the more unpolished and improvised presentation of the first year and a half of Rated K the show by took on a more scripted form br Besides movie reviews Rated K now also did more extensive behind the scenes features and started spotlighting other children s media such as video games and theme park attractions Rated K also got age appropriate celebrities to do on scene reporting like Wil Wheaton going to Universal Studios Hollywood to talk about the Star Trek Adventure attraction br In an effect the revamped version of Rated K For Kids by Kids bore a closer resemblance to a television newsmagazine like Entertainment Tonight than At the Movies This iteration of Rated K would last through its final broadcast on December br br br Aftermath br On April Nickelodeon premiered a three hour long variety series called Total Panic Total Panic reconfigured Rated K For Kids by Kids into a segment for its show The Rated K segment on Total Panic was hosted by Molly Scott br Among the films spotlighted in this time frame were Eddie and the Cruisers II Eddie Lives including an interview with its star Michael Par and the Tom Hanks vehicle Turner Hooch Scott would invite at least two members of the studio audience to share their own thoughts on the films The film review segments on Total Panic actually used the second generation set from Rated K which was a movie concession stand with a pastel color palette br br br See also br List of programs broadcast by
