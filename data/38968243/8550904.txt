Ronald Aaron Wasserman born September also known as Aaron Waters and The Mighty Raw is an American musician who composed the original theme songs for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and X Men The Animated Series He was also a member of the band Fisher br br br History br br br Early career br Wasserman has been fascinated with music since he was three years old when he started playing the piano Bands that influenced him as a teenager include Black Sabbath Genesis and Pink Floyd Wasserman said my musical taste my entire life was so diverse so I d be listening to Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin one day and learning to play it on the piano and then I d switch over to War Pigs from Black Sabbath His early music bands include Hollywood Headliners Betty Boop the Beat formed by SAG actress Lucrecia Sarita Russo In with Wasserman on keyboards the group opened for Felony Scotti Brothers records at the Florentine Gardens Felony was fronted by Lucrecia s then husband Jeff Spry who was receiving chart action with the KROQ FM hit single The Fanatic In the mid s Ron started a rock band with present day actress E G Daily In shortly after the band disbanded he started working for Saban Entertainment Wasserman filled in at Saban Entertainment one afternoon and eventually stayed there for six and a half years Wasserman and Ron Kenan once V P of Saban Entertainment Music Production met in the early s and played together in the popular new wave pop band Betty Boop the Beat br br br Saban career and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers br During his early days at Saban Wasserman worked as a music engineer sometimes contributing background music and co writing themes for several of their smaller series Shows Wasserman worked on during this period include King Arthur and the Knights of Justice which he composed the theme for Little Shop Saban s Around the World in Eighty Dreams Saban s Gulliver s Travels and Video Power Early on he received creative notes from Saban that his music was too fast and heavy for children and they would sometimes not accept the music he submitted because of this Wasserman said you could hear probably throughout the whole office building when I drove in blasting Black Sabbath or Nirvana or some death metal out of my car I had that energy and that angst back then I got it out in my music In Wasserman wrote the theme song for the animated X Men series and co composed background music for it with this being the first hit show he worked on Wasserman did not know anything about X Men when he was asked to compose the theme In a retrospective article Wasserman remembered it was two weeks of hell putting that song together adding that I kept getting notes saying they wanted more baseline then more high hats It was a real pain in the ass to do all that back then too It came out really great though the theme was really catchy and interesting and it was especially interesting when they animated to it For the early episodes the show s closing credits featured an instrumental heavy rock song but for later episodes it was replaced by a shortened version of Wasserman s opening theme br The following year he composed some of his most recognizable work which was for the show Mighty Morphin Power Rangers One day he was presented with the first footage of the show was told to use the word Go and to have it finished by the next day The people from Saban Entertainment wanted him to use the word Go since Haim Saban had success using that lyric in the Inspector Gadget theme song which was the first hit theme he and writing partner Shuki Levy were credited with After two and a half hours the song that resulted was the show s theme song Go Go Power Rangers In he had previously composed an instrumental heavy metal theme song for a similar Saban project called Metalman The project never got off the ground and Wasserman decided to give Mighty Morphin Power Rangers a rock metal sound since it reminded him of Metalman In addition to composing the theme song Wasserman also handled the background music and in several of his most popular songs and scores from the series were eventually released on a successful concept album entitled Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Album A Rock Adventure br His compositions for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series and various other Saban productions were credited to Shuki Levy and Kussa Mahchi an alias Haim Saban started using during the s with Wasserman only ever being listed in TV credits as a music producer or music engineer This was allegedly so the pair could collect music royalties for Wasserman s work According to Wasserman he very rarely composed alongside Shuki Levy or Haim Saban on any Saban Entertainment shows Saban s practice of not crediting musicians in order to gain royalties was revealed in a article by The Hollywood Reporter Several past and present composers from Saban were interviewed although Wasserman was the only one that was willing to be identified by name Wasserman told The Hollywood Reporter they put their names on my work and most of the time they had absolutely nothing to do with it as far as creating the work was concerned Most of the time I would deliver the score it would go to mix and air without the credited writers seeing it or hearing it That s how it works It s really that simple Regarding Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Wasserman said for that I got producer and or engineer credit No music by credit No cue sheet credit The credit went to Haim Saban and Shuki Levy founders of the production company I worked on the theme alone they contributed nothing On the background music they acted as producers and guided me extensively on the direction In this article a representative from Saban still maintained that the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers theme had been co composed by Haim Saban and that Wasserman was incorrect in saying that he was the sole composer Wasserman and all other composers at Saban signed a contract agreeing to give up the rights to their compositions prior to joining the company In the late s ten of these composers launched an unsuccessful multi million dollar lawsuit against Haim Saban Wasserman was not among the ten composers br Another reason Saban did not credit musicians was so that they would be hidden enough as to not get offers to work for higher paying companies Wasserman was originally going to do the music for the Power Rangers film but Saban scrapped this plan at the last minute since it was a union film co produced by th Century Fox which would mean that Wasserman would have to be listed as the composer and thus would be more well known in the industry Saban instead hired The Crow composer Graeme Revell who while credited on the film didn t actually compose the score instead getting one of his assistants to do it Wasserman was informed that he would not be doing the film s music via a representative from th Century Fox and the only explanation given was because Haim Saban said so The next time Wasserman ran into Haim Saban he asked Saban why he wasn t doing the film s music and Saban replied by telling him you re no John Williams with Wasserman s response to Saban being that he was no Walt Disney He eventually found out that he couldn t do the music because it was a union film and Saban was planning to credit himself for Wasserman s work Not getting hired for the film upset Wasserman so much that he wrote a song about it shortly afterwards called Cross My Line Regarding Cross My Line Wasserman said in Haim and I always got along and I have nothing against him in the world but that song was basically a fuck you I m out of here soon and somewhere down the line you re going to read all of the projects I m involved in br For Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Album A Rock Adventure the music was not credited to Shuki Levy and Kussa Mahchi even though Levy and Saban are listed as writers or co writers of the songs on legal cue sheets Saban instead credited it to a fictitious artist named Aaron Waters Wasserman came up with the name Aaron Waters because his middle name was Aaron and his surname Wasserman means water carrier in German Saban later attached the additional alias The Mighty RAW While the reason behind it is unknown it is assumed RAW is for his initials and The Mighty comes from the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers On Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the Album A Rock Adventure Waters is listed as the performer of the songs while Wasserman is simultaneously listed as being a music producer and music engineer Wasserman was also credited as Aaron Waters on the soundtrack album for the Power Rangers film which used Cross My Line as a bonus track on some editions br br br Later Saban projects br His success with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers soundtrack led to work on numerous other Saban productions Projects from the studio he worked on following the release of Power Rangers include BattleTech The Animated Series Blindfold Acts of Obsession Creepy Crawlers Jin Jin and the Panda Patrol Space Strikers Sweet Valley High Teknoman and VR Troopers He composed the theme songs for Sweet Valley High Teknoman and VR Troopers with the Sweet Valley High theme being sung by his future wife Kathy Fisher Despite having a rock sound he was never approached by Saban to do the theme for Spider Man The Animated Series which would eventually end up being done by Joe Perry of Aerosmith Wasserman left Saban in September since he was exhausted and was refused a pay rise br Shortly after leaving Saban he got hired to do background music for Funimation s English dub of Dragon Ball Z which was co handled by Saban and Ocean Productions during the first two seasons It was Saban who hired him for Dragon Ball Z and according to Wasserman they let him compose the music from his home as they didn t care about the show Wasserman was allowed to give it a darker and heavier sound than previous shows he had worked on since he would never receive creative notes when he sent the music to Saban Prior to hiring Wasserman on Dragon Ball Z Saban had already created their own theme song for the show called Rock the Dragon which had Power Rangers Zeo composer Jeremy Sweet on vocals Between and Wasserman composed for the first two seasons and in Rock the Dragon and music from the background score were released on an album titled Dragon Ball Z Original USA Television Soundtrack The album s music was attributed to Shuki Levy and Kussa Mahchi with these two also being listed as the composers on the dub s closing credits In Wasserman was replaced for the third season and beyond by Dallas based composer Bruce Faulconer Like Levy and Haim Saban Faulconer also allegedly did not write many of the compositions he was credited for instead getting a small group of musicians to do it for him Wasserman was interested in composing for the third season of Dragon Ball Z which was the first done without Saban s involvement but Funimation did not like the music from the first two seasons and Wasserman received no response from the company when he reached out to them in He subsequently said that he wasn t even aware that the Dragon Ball franchise had a large following until the early s when a fan emailed him about the show Wasserman has also said that he didn t know how popular X Men The Animated Series was until around that time The master tapes for his music on shows such as Dragon Ball Z Sweet Valley High and X Men The Animated Series are believed to be permanently lost since they got misplaced when Disney purchased Saban in br In Wasserman performed the Power Rangers in Space theme and music This was the last Power Rangers season he was involved with before Saban got sold to Disney in He had still been contributing some music to the franchise during the Power Rangers Zeo and Power Rangers Turbo seasons which occurred during and after he had already left Saban He also contributed music to Turbo A Power Rangers Movie the sequel to the original Power Rangers film br br br Post Saban music career br After leaving Saban Wasserman started a band with then girlfriend Kathy Fisher Wasserman also began working on various video game titles with Pink Floyd producer Bob Ezrin and contributed to DIC Entertainment The first show he composed for which had no connection to Saban was DIC Entertainment s Mummies Alive which aired for episodes during It was produced by Eric and Julia Lewald who had previously worked on X Men The Animated Series In Fisher contributed the song Breakable for the movie Great Expectations The popularity of this song and others on file sharing site MP com helped them briefly get signed to Interscope Records at the turn of the millennium The unorthodox way they got signed to a major record label attracted attention from various media outlets including Time magazine in br br br Return to Power Rangers br Wasserman returned to solo work in and even returned to the Power Rangers franchise in composing the theme song for the thirteenth Power Rangers season Power Rangers S P D News of his involvement reached the fanbase and demo versions of the theme were leaked upsetting Disney executives According to Linkara in his History of Power Rangers show after contacting Wasserman he also submitted demos for Power Rangers Mystic Force a rock theme and a rap theme he had first submitted the rock theme and originally the producers at Disney approved of it but later contacted him saying they were seeking something more of a rap genre thus leading him to creating and submitting a rap theme to them which they in turn rejected although Wasserman admits that his rap theme wasn t very good Since Disney were not going to be using the themes for the series he posted the demos online for the fans br br br Post Power Rangers br Wasserman remains active with other television and commercial projects including work for America s Next Top Model br In Wasserman released two original songs with Ozone Entertainment as downloadable content on the Rock Band Network br br br Power Rangers Redux br br On
