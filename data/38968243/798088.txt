Nick at Nite stylized as nick nite is a nighttime programming block on the American basic cable channel Nickelodeon The programming broadcasts from prime time to late night airtime varies depending on the night The block initially consisted of syndicated sitcoms and films from the s to the s Nick at Nite gradually shifted its programming to primarily airing sitcoms as recent as the mid s to the s br Paramount Media Networks a division of Paramount Global generally regards Nick at Nite as a separate channel that shares space with Nickelodeon on the channel due to the block targeting adult audiences Nielsen has reported Nick at Nite ratings separately from Nickelodeon since br br br History br br br Early years br In after the Hearst Corporation NBC and ABC announced their plans to spin off A E into a separate hour cable channel Nickelodeon s general manager Geraldine Laybourne was asked by MTV Networks President Bob Pittman to develop programming for the vacated timeslot This was to take advantage of valuable satellite time as A E was moving to its own channel Laybourne sought the help of programming and branding consultants Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert of Fred Alan Inc who were previously successful in MTV and Nickelodeon s extensive rebranding to come up with new programming ideas The transition to a hour broadcast for Nickelodeon took place in June with some cable providers substituting the primetime schedule of other niche interest networks onto the channel space br After being presented with over episodes of The Donna Reed Show a s sitcom which Laybourne despised Goodman and Seibert conceived the idea of the first oldies TV network They modeled the new evening and overnight programming block on the successful oldies radio format The Greatest Hits of All Time and branded the block with their next evolution of MTV and Nickelodeon style imagery and bumpers Head programmer Debby Beece led the team to the name Nick at Nite for the new block a logo originally conceived for the block was based on Nickelodeon s pinball logo introduced in which was discontinued with that network s rebrand Fred Alan developed the original logo with Tom Corey and Scott Nash of Boston advertising agency Corey McPherson Nash creators of the well recognized Nickelodeon orange splat logo Nick at Nite s logo design would maintain a separate yet similar visual appearance and design from its parent network br br Nick at Nite debuted at p m Eastern Time on July as a block on Nickelodeon Its initial programming running from p m to a m seven nights a week was a mixture of sitcoms movies and one drama series The block was led by Dennis the Menace and accompanied by The Donna Reed Show the offbeat comedy Turkey Television which like Dennis also aired on Nickelodeon and Route A nightly film presentation branded as the Nick at Nite Movie aired at p m ET through the end of the decade and included such classic films as the film The Red House and the film A Star Is Born The same five hour block of programs originally repeated from a m and ran until Nickelodeon began its broadcast day at a m ET As Nick at Nite grew it would add to its library of shows expanding out to rerun sketch comedy such as episodes from the early seasons of SNL as well as the Canadian series SCTV It also briefly reran the s mock local talk show Fernwood Night As the years went by the channel s sitcom library expanded to over a hundred shows For the channel s th anniversary celebration in June TV Land aired an episode from almost every series that had appeared on Nick at Nite br By the early s Nick at Nite began running a full schedule of programming with overnight hours filled with a mixture of secondary runs of shows airing on its evening schedule and series that were no longer shown on the evening lineup In Nick at Nite celebrated its tenth anniversary with a week long event in which the channel aired hand picked episodes of almost every series that had aired on Nick at Nite since its July debut Each episode was introduced with its milestone history episode number and pop culture references to the individual program s original run on Nick at Nite A special tenth Anniversary on screen bug was shown at the bottom left corner of the screen for seconds once per half hour show and was used for the entire year much in the same vein as the th Anniversary logo in in contrast Nick at Nite did not make any acknowledgment of its th anniversary in br br br present br br In March Nielsen began splitting up Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon in its primetime and total daytime ratings reports due to the different programming advertisers and target audiences between the two services this caused controversy among executives of some cable channels who believed that this move manipulated the ratings given that Nick at Nite s broadcast day takes up only a fraction of Nickelodeon s programming schedule Nickelodeon s and Nick at Nite s respective ratings periods encompass only the hours they each operate under the total day rankings though Nick at Nite is rated only for the primetime ratings this is due to a ruling by Nielsen in July that networks have to program for or more of a particular daypart to qualify for ratings for that daypart br br On January the coloring of Nick at Nite s logo was changed from blue to orange in order to match the coloring of Nickelodeon s logo On September the network introduced a new logo based on Nickelodeon s longtime splat logo with the orange splat formed in the shape of a waning gibbous moon this effectively integrated the Nickelodeon branding onto Nick at Nite for the first time as the varied logos that were used from its launch utilized variants of the Futura Condensed font the to Nickelodeon logo designed by Seibert and Goodman used the Balloon typeface with various shape backgrounds and a small circle with the word at replaced by an symbol overlaid on a circle background on July for visual symmetry owing to the character s building ubiquity from the Internet and eventually into general pop culture lodged between and staggering the I s The updated logo debuted in promos on July However the Up Next bumpers station idents and on screen bug did not begin using the updated logo until August br br On July Nick at Nite s programming hours expanded to begin at p m Eastern and Pacific Time on Sunday through Thursday nights while the Friday lineup continued to start at p m Eastern and Pacific Time sometimes on Friday nights it actually began at p m Eastern and Pacific Time or still at p m Eastern and Pacific Time but outside of that the Friday lineup still had a p m Eastern and Pacific Time start time until October when the Friday start time became p m the Saturday lineup also continues to have a p m Eastern and Pacific Time start time due to the presence of the long running Saturday primetime comedy lineup on Nickelodeon Nick at Nite s times of operation have changed several times over the years to at one point between and beginning as late as p m Eastern and Pacific Time on Sunday through Thursdays and ending as early as a m Eastern and Pacific Time br br Nick at Nite overhauled its on air appearance on September as part of Nickelodeon s rebranding effort the new logo also based on Nickelodeon s logo stylized the network s name as nick nite rendered as one word in lower case letters within the new network logo The network also ceased airing the production closing credits for most of its programs except for those that have tag scenes during the end credits and originally some series that aired on the network prior to the rebrand that rejoined the network afterward such as Full House and began employing network even closing credits which Nickelodeon had been utilizing since at least both Nick at Nite and Nickelodeon often remove end tag scenes or blooper reels of some shows using this format br br br Programming br br Nick at Nite s lineup presently includes reruns of syndicated comedy series from the early s to mid s and movie broadcasts The block previously had its own exclusively produced original programs such as See Dad Run and Instant Mom br Due to its dependence on sitcom reruns whose cable syndication rights are limited to a daypart a certain part of the day owing to contracts with studios and or distributors for instance Paramount holds the exclusive cable nighttime rights to run Friends airing it on both Nick at Nite and Comedy Central while TBS holds exclusive daytime rights to said series Nick at Nite has no video on demand service or Paramount presence formerly its past original series were usually combined within Nickelodeon s video on demand section and its website features no video content br br br Programming history br Nick at Nite was known as the first classic TV network having originally aired older classic television programs from the s through the early s throughout its nighttime schedule The time range of Nick at Nite s programming has shifted over the years to the point whereby the early s its classic series consisted primarily of shows from the late s to the late s and also included series from the early and mid s by the end of that decade and into the early s The early success with classic television series as well as the eventual shift away from series made prior to eventually led to the creation of digital broadcast networks similar to Nick at Nite s original format such as the Retro Television Network Antenna TV and MeTV which have featured many shows formerly seen on Nick at Nite br Nick at Nite airs approximately all of its programming in hour long and sometimes two hour blocks which were branded under the Double Takes banner from to typically series that air back to back are scheduled in two blocks one in primetime and one in late night Also typically series that have been airing on Nick at Nite for at least three years are often moved exclusively to the overnight schedule in order to make room for newly acquired series though in the past entire broadcast runs of a few series such as Perfect Strangers and Charles in Charge have aired in an overnight graveyard slot for a short period of time following their debut on the network For about a year and a half prior to the September rebrand Nick at Nite aired marathons of programming from midnight to a m Eastern Time br Nick at Nite was previously one of the few basic cable channels in the United States that continued to sign off for scheduled satellite maintenance occurring on a Wednesday morning from to a m Eastern Time on a bi monthly basis with color bars being displayed during the sign off period Paramount Global owned sister channels Nick Jr Nicktoons MTV and its spin off channels VH and VH Classic also sign off for a half hour on a bi monthly basis at the same time as Nick at Nite for the same reason it is also one of only a handful of cable channels to have discontinued airing infomercials Nickelodeon through Nick at Nite ran infomercials in some overnight time slots from to making Nickelodeon one of the few currently operating kids targeted channels to discontinue airing paid programming others include Universal Kids and it is also only one of two Paramount owned networks to have removed paid programming from its schedule sister channel BET had discontinued infomercials in replacing them with religious programming in overnight early morning time slots br On May Nick at Nite began scheduling programs airing from p m to a m Eastern Time in an off the clock format in which the network runs extended commercial breaks of as much as seven minutes in length to allow additional advertising spots a method that has tense viewer criticism due to the length between the start of each commercial break and the start of the next segment of a program allowing the programs to be broadcast in a longer time slot each half hour until a m Eastern Time when start times return to a half hourly format This format was originated by sister network TV Land beginning in and has since been taken by other Paramount Global networks including MTV BET and Paramount Network around the same time as Nick at Nite The side effect that results from this scheduling and expanded advertising is that one full half hour of programming is lost therefore the overnight schedule features only a single episode of one series whereas most other Nick at Nite programs air in double episode blocks br On June Nick at Nite began airing Nickelodeon programs for the first time airing reruns of All That and Kenan Kel from to p m Eastern Time weeknights Two weeks later the two series were replaced with reruns of Victorious before being replaced by the teen drama telenovela series Hollywood Heights which would move to TeenNick halfway through its first and only season due to low ratings Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite currently share the to p m Eastern Time time slot on weeknights br br br Movies br In addition to running sitcom reruns Nick at Nite has also broadcast movies in early primetime after the to run of the Nick at Nite Movie showcase the channel did not air movies on its schedule again until the summer of when it aired films each week on Tuesday nights The channel has aired films occasionally since then and have begun to air them periodically since February on Sunday nights beginning that month with telecasts of the Nickelodeon Movies produced Good Burger Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging The Rugrats Movie and The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Additionally many family oriented films from other distributors air on the block br Some movies and special presentations that Nick at Nite aired during and had occasionally aired over what is normally Nickelodeon s broadcast time for example the February premiere broadcast of the special School Gyrls aired at p m Eastern Time though Nickelodeon typically does not turn over its channel space to Nick at Nite until p m Eastern Time on Sunday nights which is unusual as some of these special presentations are aimed at Nickelodeon s preteen target audience however until May when the network began promoting its film broadcasts as airing on Nick at Nite promos for these films did not acknowledge whether they were to be broadcast on Nick at Nite or Nickelodeon an issue as promos for scheduled primetime films were cross promoted with Nickelodeon with the only reference as to the film s airing on Nick at Nite coming from the screen bug that is shown during the film br Some of the movies Nick at Nite has broadcast in recent years have included the Back to the Future trilogy Ferris Bueller s Day Off Baby s Day Out Pretty in Pink National Lampoon s Vacation Ghostbusters and its sequel Ghostbusters II Jurassic Park The Nutty Professor Legally Blonde The Princess Diaries and The Parent Trap Film broadcasts have become more common on Nick at Nite since fall often airing on a near weekly basis typically on Sunday evenings br br br Original programming br Nick at Nite has also occasionally broadcast its own programs sometimes with bizarre and surrealistic results On December the channel ran a contest called the Do It Yourself Sitcom Special which was billed as the first time that real people ever had their own television shows Viewers submitted their own sitcom ideas and the winner would supposedly get their own show In the channel aired a half hour animated Christmas special from Ralph Bakshi which served as the pilot for a proposed animated series titled Tattertown The program was never picked up to series but the special later renamed Christmas in Tattertown aired on Nick at Nite every Christmas for several years In the channel briefly aired a satirical comedy series called On the Television a mock critic show hosted by Siskel and Ebert type characters that featured bizarre sometimes disturbing clips from spoofed television shows supposedly beginning that week br In the early s the channel ran a one time special featuring old television commercials this idea would be rehashed by the network on several other shows and eventually become a project of a spin off channel TV Land as part of the Retromercials segment that aired during commercial breaks until the mid s Another special aired by Nick at Nite was promoted as a TV dad quiz in which the host walked through a typical TV Home and quizzed viewers at home with trivia about classic TV dad clich s At one point the host told viewers to connect pictures of TV dads with their appropriate TV wives displayed on the screen with a magic marker At the end of this segment he mentions that he forgot to tell the viewers to place a piece of plastic over their screen while doing this and made jokes about the viewers br uselessly trying to clean the magic marker off their screens for the rest of the show br In Nick at Nite debuted its own sitcom based around the rerun genre it had developed The short lived Hi Honey I m Home titled after the catchphrase that male lead characters in some classic sitcoms said to their wives when returning home from work focused on a s sitcom family called the Nielsens whose show has been removed from syndication forcing the family to leave TV Land and move into a real s suburban neighborhood repeatedly confronting the family with a culture shock The series aired on Fridays as part of ABC s TGIF lineup with the episode being rerun on Nick at Nite in primetime on the following Sunday br In the channel announced that it was developing a family oriented revival of the s game show GUTS titled My Family s Got GUTS as well as a dog competition show My Family s Got GUTS eventually premiered on Nickelodeon in September On August Nick at Nite debuted a new animated stop motion series called Glenn Martin DDS which ran for two seasons Scripted programming returned to Nick at Nite in with the June debut of the telenovela based teen drama Hollywood Heights followed on October with the premiere of See Dad Run though the former relocated to TeenNick midway through its run due to low ratings and branding confusion br In the network also began to carry episodes of Nashville on an hour delay from CMT on nights when new episodes aired in order to further augment that series ratings br br br Marathons and blocks br Programming marathons were an innovation that began with Nick at Nite in eventually leading to the phenomenon of binge watching Working together at college radio station WKCR FM while attending New York City s prestigious Columbia University Fred Alan Inc founders Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert saw the ratings success of radio marathons featuring music from Ludwig van Beethoven John Coltrane and Charles Mingus As the Nick at Nite oldies format was adapted from radio they suggested the multi hour sometimes multi day marathon might also work with television programming The marathon format proved successful and became a ratings boosting in demand with cable television networks for over two decades br During the week of Halloween in late October the network held a special contest hosted by game show host Wink Martindale during a marathon of Alfred Hitchcock Presents Viewers at home were supposed to keep a running total of total number of deaths on the show At the end of the marathon the persons who had gotten the correct total were entered into a drawing to win a prize As Martindale said it s kind of like guessing the number of jelly beans in a jelly bean jar but instead of jelly beans you re using cadavers br When new shows are added to the lineup they are usually accompanied by some kind of marathon that is sometimes hosted by a star from the show For instance when Newhart joined Nick at Nite in the early s the channel also acquired Bob Newhart s short lived third sitcom Bob and ran a block branded Bob s Bob Bob Newhart Newhart Marathon featuring the two shows along with The Bob Newhart Show which it already had the rights to broadcast in an event hosted by Bob Newhart Nick at Nite s debut of The Mary Tyler Moore Show was called the Marython When I Love Lucy joined Nick at Nite in a week long marathon called Nick at Nite Loves Lucy aired showcasing every one of Lucille Ball s sitcoms that aired between and I Love Lucy The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour The Lucy Show Here s Lucy and Life with Lucy When some older shows were retired Nick at Nite would also frequently have a marathon send off For instance when Mister Ed was finally retired from the network in January after a seven year run Nick at Nite ran a weekend long marathon of the show called Au Revoir Mister Ed a similar send off for The Donna Reed Show which ran on the channel for nine years beginning with Nick at Nite s July debut also ran that year My Three Sons was sent off the night Daylight Saving Time ended in October with a marathon called Nite of the Setting Sons permitting two extra episodes in the marathon due to the one hour time shift br During the summer months from the mid to late s the channel for a while ran a program block called Vertivision later known as Block Party Summer during which a different series was shown in a three hour block each night of the week In its first year network promos referred to the nights featured in the special lineup as Mary Mondays for The Mary Tyler Moore Show Lucy Tuesdays for I Love Lucy Bewitched Be Wednesdays for Bewitched Jeannie Thursdays for I Dream of Jeannie and Sgt Joe Fridays for Dragnet With the passing years the summer blocks shifted to include series recently added to Nick at Nite s program library br Other seasonal scheduling blocks were also not uncommon such as Christmas themed blocks during late December Thanksgiving themed blocks in November and Valentine s Day themed episodes in February Each New Year s Eve from to the channel would host Nick at Nite s year Rerun Classic TV TV Hits Countdown hosted by longtime countdown radio DJ Casey Kasem Kasem would spend the period from noon a m in until New Year s Day at a m Eastern Time counting down the most classic episodes of the series airing on Nick at Nite at that time as determined by viewers at home with the episode being aired at midnight br Another well known lineup was A Whole Lotta Lucy block which ran on Saturday nights from June to May which consisted of I Love Lucy The Lucy Show and The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour which were all airing on the network at that time a similar block aired on Saturday nights from to featuring only I Love Lucy and The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour In the mid s another Saturday night programming block titled Very Very Nick at Nite centered around a different theme each week such as Very Very Mary with four classic Mary Tyler Moore Show episodes In summer of Nick at Nite aired a marathon called Battle of the Sexes which featured episodes of their regular programs that engaged conflict between men and women br Nick at Nite generally broadcasts a marathon of their programming on holidays such as the Luck of the Lopez marathon of George Lopez that aired on Saint Patrick s Day in March For two years in a row in October and Nick at Nite broadcast the Shocktober marathon branded as Shocktober for the event featuring Halloween themed episodes of the regularly scheduled program Other holidays that the network often features themed marathons include Mother s Day Father s Day and Christmas br On June Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the MTV Movie TV Awards for the first time along with many of its sister networks On August it also aired a simulcast of the MTV Video Music Awards for the first time In December Nick at Nite began airing a marathon of Friends to celebrate the show s th anniversary since its finale throughout half of Nick at Nite s regular programming time br On April Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of One World Together at Home which was simulcast on multiple networks and platforms br br br Television specials br Occasionally episodes of Rugrats and SpongeBob SquarePants have aired regularly or as marathons during Nick at Nite special events in the s and s This has also occurred during crossovers with Nickelodeon special programming where the Nickelodeon programming runs into the regular Nick at Nite timeslot A year reunion special of Double Dare aired on November Regular marathons occur on Nick at Nite Usually when a show debuts it receives an all night or a week long marathon Seasonal marathons also occur for holidays such as Valentine s Day St Patrick s Day Mother s Day Father s Day Halloween Thanksgiving and Christmas br On June Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the MTV Movie TV Awards for the first time along with many of its sister networks On August it also aired a simulcast of the MTV Video Music Awards for the first time In December Nick at Nite began airing a marathon of Friends to celebrate the show s year anniversary since its finale throughout half of Nick at Nite s regular programming time Nick at Nite aired a simulcast of the widely distributed One World Together at Home on April br br br Branding and commercials br Nick at Nite has used numerous unusual and offbeat commercials logos and promotions Alan Goodman and Fred Seibert assembled a team of highly imaginative writers producers modeled on their original creative team that had launched sister channel MTV The group which included Scott Webb Jim Levi Dave Potorti Jay Newell Will McRobb and Tom Hill was guided towards creating a series of internal campaigns to emphasize the seeming paradox of a contemporary network setting that programmed reruns from the s and earlier A series of five promises were organized into four second spots each hour each emphasizing an attribute of the innovative programming format br In the channel began running a few different animated second channel identifications produced by Noyes and Laybourne and the Fred Alan agency that were repetitive in creation but all had vastly different endings similar to the watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat gag from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show In one such ID the first chord of The Beatles A Hard Day s Night would be heard strummed as a man began to hang up a Nick at Nite logo and common living room objects such as a chair and a television set Once the man sat down in front of the TV set and clicked the remote control a bizarre incident would happen such as a gorilla coming out of the set Later IDs started with either a woman setting up her backyard behind a city background which was made of cardboard or a couple setting up their living room In May Nick at Nite started running a wide variety of IDs created in association with Pomposello Productions These were made with almost every imaginable technique from cel animation to stop motion to original live action and stock footage Almost every commercial had a different jingle professing Nick at Nite as being A TV Viewer s Dream for the TV generation and as coming from a place called TV Land Hello out there from TV Land and promoting Better Living Through Television although these claims were always somewhat tongue in cheek br There were also sarcastic promotions created for shows airing on the network an announcer s voiceover would discuss the series accompanied by clips and music and sometimes the show s theme song The commercials would use an actor s line or expression and take it out of context to create a new subversive meaning The channel still uses this technique today although often in a more partial way A popular take off of the Michelob Light commercial The Nite Belongs to Nick ran for a short period of time before being discontinued due to copyright issues One series of promos had Dick Van Dyke whose eponymous s sitcom was a mainstay of the channel in the s depicted as Chairman of Nick at Nite this idea was later recycled by one of Nick at Nite s sister networks TeenNick which depicted actor and television personality Nick Cannon as the Chairman of TeenNick in a series of promos that began airing on September In in honor of the network s tenth anniversary Nick at Nite aired a tribute to the commercials throughout the network s existence and hosted by former network president Rich Cronin br The channel also had a unique way of informing viewers about the show that was about to air next Beginning as only some of the night s shows and their airtimes being listed as music played over an on screen graphic this simple concept would be revised and re revised many times over At one point a television with objects and people from the show scrolling by for instance for Get Smart a shoe phone gun and Max and would appear on the screen while the announcer describes the program title and time the time that the show was scheduled to air would be popped up in another box Some shows were preceded by a bumper showing the following episode s number and title Nick at Nite s original continuity announcer was Nickelodeon announcer Wendell Craig Bill St James alternated with Wendell before replacing him as the channel s primary continuity announcer in and serving in that capacity until except for a short period from March until September in which he was replaced with a different Soul Train esque announcer Bill has also served as an announcer for the premium channels Showtime The Movie Channel both former Viacom sister channels to Nick at Nite and HBO among other television clients as well as serving as the host of the radio shows Flashback and Time Warp which focus on classic rock and oldies music br A few of Nick at Nite s promos in the early s involved Dixie the TV Land Pixie promoting Nick at Nite Brand Reruns During this time the network would also play an interstitial series called Milkman about a milkman who would distribute good advice to customers on his milk delivery route By Nick at Nite introduced a new mascot named Phil Phil was seen doing several stunts such as dressing up as a crab during Block Party Summer bumpers In an ID usually seen when Nick at Nite signed on Phil was seen working as technician to try to get Nick at Nite up and running In December Nick at Nite introduced twelve network IDs directed by Mo Willems which introduced the block s CGI mascot Logobelly Logobelly was seen doing various activities and appeared on colorful backgrounds on TV sets interacting with past TV stars watching television sets Curious Pictures created six more IDs for Nick at Nite featuring Logobelly in April with Toonz and D Studio Max software br Nick at Nite received a rebrand in January which was used until March produced by Scott Stowell and Chip Wass who previously designed a set of CGI IDs for the network in The rebrand prominently used the color yellow and shades of blue which became darker overnight Nick at Nite s IDs at the time typically featured a moving illustration by Chip Wass and either a female voiceover singing a jingle about the network which ended with Nick at Nite the place for TV hits or narration by Bill St James for overnight IDs br In March in an effort to cash in on the reality TV boom Nick at Nite underwent an extensive rebrand with the new theme of Unreality with IDs and bumpers featuring clips from actual events then going to clips from TV shows inspiring the events and then ending with the Nick at Nite logo and slogan Sitcoms Unreality One bumper used during this era had the slogan All Sitcoms All Night Long br br br TV Land br br On April Viacom spun off a separate network from Nick at Nite TV Land originally branded as Nick at Nite s TV Land until which features a variety of rerun programming the channel is usually carried on the basic tiers of cable IPTV and satellite providers On December TV Land ceased operating under the control of Nick at Nite as Nickelodeon began overseeing that service under the MTV Networks Kids Family Group though TV Land continued to be operated as part of Viacom s MTV Networks division During its early years the channel ran classic television series from the early s to the s In TV Land began to incorporate sitcoms from the s and s reality shows and weekly movie presentations were added as the decade progressed However much of TV Land s programming continues to include series from the s and s While in its original programming efforts were made up of multi camera sitcoms such as Younger and Teachers targeted towards a female Generation X audience in late the former moved to Paramount Network and the latter was canceled That decision was eventually reversed with season premiering in June and season rolling out in after being released in bulk on Paramount several weeks earlier br br br International br br Compared to Nickelodeon the international versions of Nick at Nite are limited despite the block s success in the United States Most international versions of Nickelodeon either run as a hour channel such as Asia or share space with a non Nick at Nite channel such as Germany which had a version of Nick at Nite called Nicknight but replaced it with MTV Plus in later a timeshift of Comedy Central in As of Australia is the only country outside the United States to have a Nick at Nite block br br br See also br Antenna TV an American digital broadcast network owned by
