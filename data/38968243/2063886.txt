out of stars saying that Catscratch is a generic cartoon show that involves oddly drawn characters who don t really look like anything very loud voices very bright colors and many instances of people and creatures and things being bashed broken and bonked The show is a by the book program but that doesn t mean it s not sometimes funny or even touching Many kids will get a kick out of it although you may not be as tolerant There s nothing terribly wrong with it but nothing terribly right either br br br Awards and nominations br br br Comics br Confirmed by an e mail from Doug TenNapel there
