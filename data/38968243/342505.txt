episode I Am Not An Animal I m Scientist he once accidentally transformed himself into a beaver and built a futuristic society br br br Production br br br Conception and development br The Angry Beavers was the brainchild of Mitch Schauer and was co developed by Keith Kaczorek Prior to the series Schauer was originally an assistant storyboard artist for other Nickelodeon shows such as The Ren Stimpy Show Rocko s Modern Life and Hey Arnold Schauer also storyboarded episodes of the Addams Family television series During his time as producer of the Warner Bros animated series Freakazoid in Gunther Wahl Productions Inc Schauer s employer at the time requested three ideas for animated series as the studio had the opportunity to pitch a show to Nickelodeon One of the three ideas that Schauer presented was an early concept for The Angry Beavers Schauer wasn t even present for the pitch meeting his ideas being pitched for him by the production company instead Of the three ideas network producer Mary Harrington was intrigued by the Beavers The Angry Beavers was inspired from Schauer s early years in Oklahoma when he was homeless and often spotted beavers in a nearby river The initial concept of the show centered on two bad tempered politically incorrect beavers that hated anything that was a fad cause or just popular in the media I tend to develop things that are counterculture stated Schauer I like to buck whatever is popular at the time or considered society s way of doing things because you get more interest when you stand outside the box Schauer was against making the beavers cute as a response to many of the soft safe character designs at the time He also cited cartoons such as The Pink Panther The Flintstones and Rocky and Bullwinkle as primary influences for the show br During production of the series Schauer and the crew began to learn more about real world beavers and implemented their traits into the show s storylines considering himself to have become a beaver expert by the end of its run Traits adapted into the show include their endlessly growing incisors tail slapping and scent glands During his time at Nickelodeon Schauer gifted Harrington a personally signed log that was bitten by a beaver though he later admitted in that he bit it himself br Richard Steven Horvitz and Nick Bakay were chosen as voice actors for main beavers Daggett and Norbert respectively Gunther Wahl held auditions for over different actors but Schauer settled on the two because they embodied the two beavers characters perfectly also being impressed by their chemistry upon being introduced to one another He recalled the two frequently going off script while recording which he encouraged considering their improvisation leading to some of the series best moments Schauer was influenced by classic Hollywood director Howard Hawks for the show s ad libbing and overlapping of dialogue br br br Challenges censorship and Bye Bye Beavers br There was often tension between the show s staff and Nickelodeon with the channel imposing seemingly arbitrary restrictions on the show s content An example includes season one s Go Beavers where they rejected a scene that would have featured a blimp crashing into an audience of people while a scene in the same segment featuring out of control zambonis that wipe into and supposedly kill a crowd of people didn t meet any objections nor did the instances of Norbert savagely beating Daggett with a stick and ignoring his many injuries Most infamously the words Shut up were initially censored in the segment Alley Oops Writer Micah Wright attributed this to then Nickelodeon president Herb Scannell quoting him as saying I don t like it when children say Shut up so if we never say it on our show children will never say it in the real world Wright further claimed that Scannell would make these sweeping pronouncements about the way the world worked and the way that kids thought and what he wanted the world to look like also imposing a no drag policy which forbade characters dressing in non gender conforming clothing in order to prevent sexual confusion amongst the show s younger viewers Nick Bakay voice of Norbert also expressed displeasure with the network dubbing them not very artist friendly br While the show was popular and was renewed for four seasons staff continued to push against the network s Standards and Practices division We were significantly over budget behind schedule and had generally worn out our welcome with the network recalled series co developer Keith Kaczorek As the series faced cancellation the crew devised a finale segment Bye Bye Beavers where the Beavers are informed by mail that their show is cancelled During the segment they openly criticize the network for cancelling shows and syndication wrestle with their existence as cartoon characters and even referencing the infamous censoring of the words shut up The segment was set to end with both beavers being killed off and sent to cartoon heaven The segment was expected to be fully produced as Nickelodeon initially approved the premise of the segment but as production went on they reversed their decision Production was halted as the segment went against the network s policies of forbidding any reference to a show ending or characters dying As a result the segment only exists in the form of leaked storyboards and audio the latter being released by Richard Steven Horvitz voice of Daggett in Margie Cohn then executive vice president of the network s original programming admitted that the segment s script was beautifully crafted funny and clever but ultimately the network was against the idea of killing off characters that its audience had grown to love br Schauer would sometimes poke fun at the network s demands The segment The Legend of Kid Friendly where the Beavers face off against a cyborg cowboy literally named Kid Friendly was created as a response to broadcast standards notes received from the network One of the most repeated notes was make sure it s kid friendly so it seemed natural to write a story around the comment said Schauer Weapons featured in the show typically received feedback requesting them be redesigned to be larger and more colorful to which the crew would happily oblige Despite the crew typically being at odds with network censorship Schauer considers the experience working with Nickelodeon a positive one br The Angry Beavers was the final and most notable animated series produced by Gunther Wahl Productions Inc which was later shut down in two years before the series ended its run br br br Episodes br br br Reception br The Angry Beavers received positive reviews from critics In a positive review Harlene Ellin of the Chicago Tribune praised the show for its humor visuals cultural references and nonsensical plots writing Although the story lines can be pure silliness the characters are well developed and likable whether they re fighting each other or working together But most of all this show is downright funny And dam it The Angry Beavers is definitely that Hollywood com considered the show to be truly the most clever and mature cartoon to air on Nickelodeon praising its whip smart dialogue and cultural references considering it underappreciated when compared to Nickelodeon s other classic cartoons Spencer Coriarty of Screen Rant wrote Together the two seem to get involved in every odd occurrence conceivable the animation here is rather stunning as is the offbeat writing which includes throwbacks to s sci fi Creative as it is sporadic The Angry Beavers is chaotic nutty whacky and fun in the best possible way Olivia Armstrong of Decider praised the show for appealing to older audiences saying Not only did you love to watch the adventures of Norbert and Daggett Beaver but so did your parents and older siblings without pestering you to hand over the remote Perhaps it was the pure slapstick comedy or their bizarre sometimes inappropriate friends and neighbors but those beavers will go down in history as the funniest dam dwellers to ever exist and the oddest way to bring your family together Andrea Graham of Common Sense Media spoke positively of the series writing While the series humor may seem sophomoric it s actually quite funny br br br Awards and nominations br
