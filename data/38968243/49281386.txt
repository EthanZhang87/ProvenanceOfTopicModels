TVLine gave the series a B saying that it turned out to be an artfully crafted instantly engaging teen soap with loads of potential br br br Legacy br Over the course of its run Riverdale received widespread attention from critics and on social media for its increasingly campy and outlandish storylines as well as for subverting teen drama conventions and the expectations of the source material Rebecca Atler of Vulture deemed the series one of the weirdest teen soaps ever made adding that it took tropes from gothic horror fantasy telenovelas soap operas comic books gay art house films dark high school comedies musicals and mafia movies and smushed them together into a pop culture polycule while the ensemble held it all together putting it on like some sort of weekly vaudeville act Sam Bramesco of The Guardian called it a sprawling soap opera with a liberated relationship to reality the finest specimen of its genre in its era and an unending parade of camp that never once committed the cardinal sin of being boring Emma Stefansky of The Ringer opined that while some fans and journalists criticized subsequent seasons for relying less and less on coherent plotting to craft its mazelike narrative such storylines only enhanced an already heightened experience Critics have attributed the escalation to more absurd storytelling to the series standard length seasons of approximately episodes no longer the norm especially for teen dramas in the wake of the streaming boom Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly opined that the world where a network allows a lavish sexy teen genre drama to run off the rails for seven gloriously outlandish seasons no longer exists and also noted that Riverdale amid the CW s programming shift toward unscripted sports and acquired content under its new ownership by Nexstar Media Group Stefansky praised the CW for allowing a show such as Riverdale to run for seven seasons while a majority of shows are canceled prematurely in the current television landscape while Monteil opined that it feels like a miracle that a show as strange and eager for reinvention as Riverdale has existed for so long in a reboot and IP driven market Ahead of the series finale Mary Kate Carr of The A V Club stated that Riverdale is the dying gasp of the teen drama of its era as streaming services have saturated the market so much that it s hard to imagine a new teen soap cultivating enough hype or strong enough fandom to command an entire hall at Comic Con br Many critics highlighted the show s deviation from its initial premise as a teen drama In ranking the show s wildest storylines Abby Monteil of Rolling Stone noted that the series initial high school based plot soon mutated beyond its teen drama trappings transforming from a Twin Peaks esque reimagining of the comics squeaky clean source material into a campy Frankensteinian mash up of genres pop culture references and pie in the sky melodrama that s frankly unlike anything that came before it Stefansky noted that the series never played by conventional teen television s rules it poked fun at certain clich s while embracing others and mixed the strange with the familiar and took more inspiration from Stephen King and Twin Peaks than from John Hughes or Gossip Girl Bramesco compared the series to Ryan Murphy s similarly excessive queer inflected American Horror Story stating that while Murphy aims for prestige Roberto Aguirre Sacasa staunchly refuses to take his work seriously venturing deeper into his insular funhouse with the express purpose of getting lost br The series has received widespread derision on social media According to The Hollywood Reporter this trend started with fans posting clips or video compilations of moments from the show on social media which drew a lot of harsh comments and reactions from people Bramesco opined that the show s signature dialog made the program a perennial laughingstock on social media its juiciest soundbites posted without context for the gawking masses Stefansky observed that while fans embraced the show s cringey tendencies those who weren t watching could still feel the bewildered delight of reading word salad headlines about what was going on Monteil referred to the series as a popular internet punching bag with sneering detractors taking to social media to mock the latest out of context viral clip while also noting that plenty of the criticism aimed at the storylines is valid Lili Reinhart responded to the criticism expressing that it had been difficult for the cast to be the butt of the joke online adding We all want to be actors we re passionate about what we do So when the absurdity of our show became a talking point it was difficult Cole Sprouse noted that such criticism was contained to the United States and that viewers in Europe were more receptive to the show s absurdity Camila Mendes stated that since the series is based on comic books the storylines are no more absurd than those in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and both she and Reinhart concurred that Aguirre Sacasa s intention had always been to make the show absurd campy and outlandish br br br Popularity on Netflix br Riverdale has also been noted as being one of the most popular shows worldwide on the popular streaming platform Netflix The large number of fans watching the series on the platform also gave the show a large bump in the ratings for its season two premiere This was later referenced on multiple occasions by The CW s president Mark Pedowitz who noted that they would watch Netflix numbers more closely for new series after seeing how Riverdale did on the platform Season four was posted onto the website in the US on May and remained in the top ten titles on the entire platform
