originally credited made her debut on Nickelodeon in the premiere of Season of All That Midway through Season in late Schneider had a meeting with another executive at the network who wanted to know

they love interest Chase Matthews Rounding out the cast were Kristin Herrera as Dana Cruz Christopher Massey as Michael Barret and Matthew Underwood as Logan Reese br br br Filming br Pepperdine University in Malibu California was used for the first and second seasons causing the series to be Nickelodeon s most expensive show to ever produce br The series began filming in the summer of According to Sally McIlwain who oversaw filming and reservations in the Special Programs office of Pepperdine the school made to let the production film there Two student lounges in the Rockwell Towers Building at Pepperdine were converted into the show s dormitories a room larger than the average dorm room had to be used in order to fit all the production equipment Joslyn Plaza and the exterior of Elkins Auditorium were both heavily utilized additionally the Howard A White Center HAWC was also used for filming Beyond the outside locations some of the Lovernich apartments at the University were turned into makeshift production offices for Schneider s Bakery br Once the summer semester began production was limited to where they could film only being permitted to use one lounge in Tower of Rockwell in addition to Alumni Park and the Hahn Fireside Room The usage of the campus by production did draw some minor complaints from some students and staff of the University Specifically they were upset about the number of parking spaces being taken up by production and the occasional reroute around campus they had to take to avoid filming McIlwain revealed steps had been taken to ensure filming would be scheduled around the needs of the real students Filming was limited around residential areas and had to begin at a m as opposed to the normal a m to accommodate any sleeping students Each day they had to finish filming by p m To address the parking issue production vehicles were moved away to other locations on campus so the students indisposed to the filming Filming at Pepperdine for season one ended on September with production moving off campus September br The second season began filming at Pepperdine in early May During the summer production had a harder time because Battle of the Network Reality Stars began filming there Pepperdine was integral for Zoey so they had to put up with sharing the space with Battle of the Network Reality Stars which returned to the University because the original series Battle of the Network Stars had been filmed there in the s and s The competition show filmed on campus from June through June causing a relatively short disruption McIlwain estimated the University was paid for the second season The second season also included more involvement from Pepperdine students some were able to join production as interns and receive college credit while others were hired as background actors and extras The success of the show s first season meant paparazzi would sneak onto campus trying to photograph Britney Spears when she visited set Filming on campus for the second season finished on August br Following the network renewing the series for a episode third season production had to look for a new filming location since it was not feasible to film at Pepperdine outside of the summer months and it wasn t possible to film twenty six episodes in the time they had After searching up and down the coast and not finding anything that could work as a stand in for Pacific Coast Academy the production team began to look inland When Karen Fisher the senior director of production for Nickelodeon couldn t find anything that would work she called on David Diamond who pointed her towards the Mann Biomedical Park in the Santa Clarita Valley which was built by Lockheed to resemble a college campus When we drove onto the property it was beautiful We were surrounded by tall trees and because the structure was built around the same time as Pepperdine there were enough similarities to make it work said Fisher The Mann Biomedical Park also featured the same type of exterior walkway lighting as Pepperdine which meant less work for production The location had extensive warehouses which could be converted into makeshift soundstages giving production ample space to recreate the interiors of Pepperdine with sets The last obstacle came when it was time to recreate the beach but the business park featured a parking lot on top of a hill It s really a beautiful space and what s interesting is that the parking lot is on an elevated spot looking into the skyline said Fisher You buy that there is ocean out there Mann Biomedical Park also featured a basketball court and several tree lined walkways for production to use br br br Departures br Kristin Herrera exited after the first season and was
