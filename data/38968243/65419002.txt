Season br br br Season br br br Season br br br Production br br br Development br Then Nickelodeon executive Paula Kaplan contacted Cosgrove with a pitch for a new iCarly series revolving around Carly and Spencer running a Hype House like content house with a new generation of influencers taking influence from the iCarly web show The demographic for the show was planned to be aimed towards kids following in the same footsteps as other revivals and spin offs like Disney Channel s Raven s Home and Girl Meets World I don t think that any of us would have been up for that idea she says What excited me about doing iCarly again was getting to put the characters in situations that we couldn t show before Cosgrove contacted Jerry Trainor Nathan Kress and Jennette McCurdy about the project Kress and Trainor were on board with the project however McCurdy declined After multiple conversations with the returning cast Cosgrove requested that the revival series be aimed towards the adults who grew up with it which ViacomCBS and AwesomenessTV immediately agreed to unlike the shelved Lizzie McGuire series being developed at Disney As the executive producer of the series Cosgrove wanted to incorporate more mature topics and diversity into the series as well as nostalgia br The series was announced in December with Jay Kogen and Ali Schouten serving as co showrunners and executive producers Cosgrove Kress and Trainor would reprise their roles from the original series In February it was reported that Kogen left the project due to creative differences with Cosgrove Later that month McCurdy confirmed that she would not reprise her role of Sam Puckett for the revival as a result of quitting acting and feeling embarrassed by her past career It was also revealed that the revival had been picked up for episodes with the pilot being directed by Phill Lewis and written by Kogen and Schouten In May the premiere date was revealed to be June with a teaser image also being

Triplett had been cast as Millicent Freddie s snarky and social media obsessed step daughter Since the announcement of her casting Mosley has been the target of attacks from fans who saw her as a replacement for McCurdy s character from the original In response Franchesca Ramsey one of the writers of the show tweeted Laci s character Harper isn t replacing Sam No one could replace Jennette McCurdy or her incredible talent But it s both racist as hell completely unfair to decide that Laci hasn t earned her role especially since the show isn t even out yet br br br Filming br In March
