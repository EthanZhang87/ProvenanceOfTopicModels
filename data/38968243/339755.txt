id: 339755
Rocko s Modern Life is an American animated television series created by Joe Murray for Nickelodeon The series centers on the surreal life of an anthropomorphic Australian immigrant wallaby named Rocko and his friends the eccentric steer Heffer Wolfe the neurotic turtle Filburt and Rocko s faithful dog Spunky It is set in the fictional town of O Town Throughout its run to present day this show has been controversial for its adult humor including double entendre innuendo and satirical social commentary similar to The Ren Stimpy Show The series has gained a cult following br Murray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late s and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon which was looking for edgier cartoonists for its then new Nicktoons The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom with the writers targeting both children and adults The show premiered on September and ended on November totaling four seasons and episodes A special Rocko s Modern Life Static Cling was digitally released on Netflix on August br The show launched the careers of voice actors Carlos Alazraqui Tom Kenny and Mr Lawrence After the show ended its run much of the staff regrouped to work on SpongeBob SquarePants created by Rocko s creative director Stephen Hillenburg br br br Premise br br br Characters br br Rocko s Modern Life follows the life of an easily frightened immigrant wallaby named Rocko who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life His best friends are Heffer Wolfe a fat and enthusiastic steer Filburt a neurotic turtle who often feels awkward or disturbed and his faithful dog Spunky Living next door to Rocko is a middle aged couple Ed Bighead a cynical and cantankerous toad who despises Rocko and his compassionate and more friendly wife Bev Bighead br All of the characters in Rocko s Modern Life are anthropomorphic animals of varying species the vast majority of whom are mentally unstable Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social caricature br br br Setting br The show is set in a fictional town called O Town located near the Great Lakes and most likely based on Chicago Illinois as the city is located close to the Illinois Wisconsin border Places in the town include Chokey Chicken later renamed Chewy Chicken a parody of KFC and a favorite place hang out for Rocko Heffer and Filburt Conglom O Corporation a megacorporation with the slogan We own you that owns everything in town Heck a place of eternal torment run by Peaches where bad people go when they die Holl o Wood a town that resembles Hollywood and Kind of a Lot O Comics a comic book store owned by a cruel toad named Mr Smitty where Rocko works br Many of the locations in Rocko s Modern Life have the letter O in them for example O Town and Conglom O Corporation When asked about the use of O in his show Murray said br br I always got a big kick out of the businesses that were House O Paint or Ton O Noodles because their names seemed to homogenize what they sold and strip the products of true individuality and stress volume and we all know the American dream is volume So what better company to create volume than Conglom O and since a majority of the town worked at Conglom O it should be called O Town I also wanted the town to be anytown USA and I used to love sports players with a big ZERO on their back It was funny to me br br br Episodes br br br Production br br br Development br br Originally the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled Travis Murray tried selling the comic book in the late s between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks He described the early s animation atmosphere as ripe for this kind of project We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times the s Murray wanted funding for his independent film My Dog Zero so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre buy television rights for the series He presented a pencil test to Nickelodeon which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show Murray had never worked in television before The industry was coming out of a rough period and Murray wanted to shake things up a bit br Linda Simensky then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon described the Nicktoons lineup and concept to Murray He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons He then told her that he believed that My Dog Zero would not work as a cartoon He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon s attitude was different than regular TV The cable network providers were making their own rules for example Murray stated that he didn t write for children which the executives were fine with br Murray was unsure at first but was inspired by independent animation around him such as Animation Celebration and MTV s Liquid Television and gave the network a shot At the time Nickelodeon was selling itself as a network based as much around the edge as around kids entertainment It aimed to appeal to college students and parents as much as children br Murray developed the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the Bay Area and coming across a wallaby that seemed to be oblivious to the chaos around him Murray combed through his sketchbooks developed the Rocko s Modern Life concept and submitted it to Nickelodeon believing that the concept would likely be rejected Murray felt they would not like the pilot and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film According to Murray around three or four months later he had forgotten about the concept and was working on My Dog Zero when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for My Dog Zero On his website he describes My Dog Zero as that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to Rocko Sucker for the Suck O Matic was originally written as the pilot the executives decided that Heffer Wolfe one of the characters would be a little too weird for test audiences Murray instead of removing Heffer from Sucker for the Suck O Matic decided to write Trash O Madness as the pilot episode br In the original series pilot Rocko was colored yellow His color was changed when a toy merchandising company informed Nick they were interested in marketing toys but did not want to market Rocko because the color was too close to another major cartoon character that they were making a lot of money off of Murray changed Rocko s color to beige but after the pilot aired the company opted out of producing toys for the series so the color change was pointless When the series was in development prior to the release of the first episode the series had the title The Rocko Show br In November two months prior to the production of season of Rocko s Modern Life Murray s first wife committed suicide Murray had often blamed his wife s suicide on the show being picked up He said It was always an awful connection because I look at Rocko as such a positive in my life Murray felt that he had emotional and physical unresolved issues when he moved to Los Angeles He describes the experience as like participating in a marathon with my pants around my ankles Murray initially believed that he would create one season move back to the San Francisco Bay Area and clean up the loose ends I had left hanging Murray said that he felt surprised when Nickelodeon approved new seasons Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in December br After season he decided to hand the project to Stephen Hillenburg who performed most of the work for season Murray continued to manage the cartoon He said that he would completely leave the production after season He said also that he encouraged the network to continue production but Nickelodeon eventually decided to cancel the series He described all episodes as top notch and in his view the quality of a television show may decline as production continues when you are dealing with volume On his website he said that In some ways it succeeded and in some ways failed All I know it developed its own flavor and an equally original legion of fans In a interview Murray said that he at times wondered if he could restart the series he feels the task would be difficult br br The show was jointly produced between Games Animation and Joe Murray Productions Since Nickelodeon did not have an animation studio it had to contract out to other studios After incidents with The Ren Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi Nickelodeon began not to trust its creators as much and began to form its own studio Games Animation Murray recalls that they were still able to get a lot done independently Murray has likened the independence to that of Termite Terrace Warner Bros Cartoons from the s As Nickelodeon began to have more success with its animation cartoons Murray said the Termite Terrace mentality was not working as much Producer Mary Harrington made the move from New York City to Los Angeles to set up Games Animation in order to produce Rocko s Modern Life The crew first began production on the show in January Rocko s Modern Life was Nickelodeon s first in house animated production br Murray s Joe Murray Productions and Games Animation rented office space on Ventura Boulevard in the Studio City neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles California The production moved to a different office building on Vineland Avenue in Studio City Executives did not share space with the creative team Murray rented a floor in the Writers Guild of America West building although the team of Rocko was not a part of the union which the staff found ironic Sunwoo Entertainment and later Rough Draft Studios assembled the animation br According to Murray as Rocko s Modern Life was his first television series he did not know about the atmosphere of typical animation studios Murray said that he opted to operate his studio in a similar manner to the operation of his Saratoga California studio which he describes as very relaxed His cadre included many veterans who according to him described the experience as the most fun they had ever had He saying that the atmosphere was not my doing credited his team members for collectively contributing Murray described the daily atmosphere at the studio as very loose adding that the rules permitted all staff members to use the paging system to make announcements He stated that one visitor compared the environment of the production studio to preschool without supervision Murray stated that people in the United States and over people in South Korea and Japan animated the series br Rick Bentley of the Ventura County Star said that it was unusual for a cartoon creator to select a wallaby as a main character Bentley also stated that the Rocko universe was influenced by everything from Looney Tunes to underground comics The staff of the show consists of fans of outrageous comedy both animated and not animated Tom Kenny cited Looney Tunes and SCTV as influences for the show and also stated I m sure if you asked Joe Murray or Mr Lawrence or any of those guys especially in terms of animation the weirdest cartoons would of course be our favorites those weird s Fleischer brothers Betty Boop cartoons and stuff like that br Murray produced the pilot episode Trash O Madness at his studio in Saratoga he animated half of the episode and the production occurred entirely in the United States with animation in Saratoga and processing in San Francisco While directing during recording sessions Murray preferred to be on the stage with the actors instead of behind glass in a control room which he describes as the norm while making animated series He believes that due to his lack of experience with children Rocko s Modern Life skewed kind of older Murray noted There s a lot of big kids out there People went to see Roger Rabbit and saw all these characters they d grown up with and said Yeah why don t they have something like that anymore br When he began producing Rocko he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production He said that the approach when used for production of television shows was driving me crazy This led him to allow other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko s Modern Life production Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series making Hillenburg s first job in the animation business as a director br Murray designed the logo of the series He said that after his design drifted from the original design Nickelodeon informed Murray of how it intended the logo to look like Murray also designed the covers of the comic book the VHS releases and the DVD releases br br br Writing br The writers aimed to create stories that they describe as strong and funny The writers including George Maestri and Martin Olson often presented ideas to Murray while eating hamburgers at Rocky s a restaurant formerly located on Lankershim in the North Hollywood section of the San Fernando Valley He took his team members on writing trips to places such as Rocky s the La Brea Tar Pits and the wilderness If he liked the story premises the writers produced full outlines from the premises Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became Rocko s Modern Life episodes Maestri describes some stories as originating from real life and some originating from thin air br Murray stated that each episode of Rocko s Modern Life stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and or one or more of the directors or writers He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons He desired content that broke new ground and did things that rode the edge and that could be described as unexpected He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons instead hiring writers who worked outside of animation including improv actors and comic artists He said that story concept that ever smacked close to some formula idea that we had all seen before received the immediate rejection br Jeff Swampy Marsh a storyboard writer who went on to create Phineas and Ferb says that writers of Rocko s Modern Life targeted children and adults He cites Rocky and Bullwinkle as an example of another series that contains references indecipherable by children and understood by adults Aiming for a similar goal Marsh described the process as a hard job According to him when censors questioned proposed material sometimes the team disagreed with the opinions of the censors and sometimes the team agreed with the rationale of the censors He says that many people told him that the team succeeded in this endeavor and that many parents I know really enjoyed watching the show with their kids for just this reason br John Pacenti said the series seems very much aimed at adults for a children s cartoon Marsh believes that the material written by Doug Lawrence stands as an example of a unique sense of humor For instance Marsh credits Lawrence with the pineapple references adding that Lawrence believed that pineapples seemed humorous The staff drew upon Looney Tunes and the Fleischer cartoons to appeal to a wide demographic having a certain adult sensibility but also enjoyed by kids br br br Animation br Rocko s Modern Life has been described as similar to that of the output of Warner Bros cartoons in the Golden Age a visually driven show heavy on humor sight gags and good animation Instead of a finished script the animators usually received a three page outline requiring them to come up with a majority of the gags and dialogue The animation team appreciated this approach with storyboard artist Jeff Myers formerly of The Simpsons quoted as saying The script at The Simpsons was carved in stone Here it s more of a challenge and a lot more fun when we re given a rough outline Murray s animation lacked parallel lines and featured crooked architecture similar to various Chuck Jones cartoons In an interview he stated that his design style contributed to the show s wonky bent feel br Jean Prescott of the Sun Herald described the series as squash and stretch A Houston Chronicle article described the series setting as having a reality that is squashed and stretched into a twisted version of real life The background staff hand painted backgrounds with Dr Martin Dyes while each episode title card consisted of an original painting Linda Simensky said that she asked the creators of Rocko s Modern Life about why the women in the series were drawn to be top heavy the creators told her that they believed that drawing women the traditional way was easier Simensky described the creators as talented guys who formed a boy s club and added that we pushed them to be funny but a lot of their women are stereotypical br br br Music br There are three versions of the Rocko s Modern Life theme song The first and original version can be heard playing throughout every episode in Season except for episode The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was used for episode Version had high pitched distorted voices in the chorus The third version of the theme song was performed by Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider from the B s They performed the Rocko s Modern Life theme song for the rest of the series br At first Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in My Dog Zero Murray wanted the same style in My Dog Zero exhibited in Rocko s Modern Life Nickelodeon wanted a person with more experience According to Sumares believing for the request to be a long shot Murray asked for Danny Elfman and felt stunned when Nickelodeon decided to honor his request by asking Elfman to perform According to Murray Elfman his first choice was booked Therefore he chose the B s his second choice br According to Sumares Murray decided to use the B s instead of Elfman Murray states that the difference between the stories could just be a recollection conflict because Paul is a brilliant amazing guy Murray also sought Alan Silvestri According to Sumares Viacom did not want to use Silvestri as the organization wanted a band slightly older kids could identify with br Pat Irwin a veteran of many bands including the New York based instrumental group the Raybeats and a side gig the B s spent five years as a music director on the series Leading a six piece combo on keyboard and guitar Irwin brought together musicians such as trombonist Art Baron drummer Kevin Norton wind player Rob DeBellis and bassist David Hofstra br Like SpongeBob SquarePants and Ren Stimpy Irwin also uses selections from the APM Music into his score br On April a soundtrack album featuring tracks from the first and second seasons was released on streaming and digital media br br br Soundtrack br br br Censorship br Rocko s Modern Life has been noted for its racy humor Adults made up more than one fifth of the audience for the show during its run The series contained numerous adult innuendos such as Rocko s brief stint as a telephone operator at what is implied to be a sex hotline in the season one episode Canned the instructions on the wall behind him helpfully remind all employees to Be Hot Be Naughty and Be Courteous while he flatly repeats Oh baby into the receiver who turned out to be Mrs Bighead br Joe Murray noted that the season one episode Leap Frogs received some complaints from some parents due to its sexual humor leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air for the remainder of the show s run although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix formerly and Paramount In a deleted scene from the season one episode The Good the Bad and the Wallaby Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure although only his reactions are shown onscreen br According to writer director Jeff Swampy Marsh the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer s eyes at the climactic moment Although it clearly wasn t going to be included they described the scene to the Nickelodeon censors anyway We described the scene and then waited for the axe to fall but all they said was can you change the hearts to stars we said sure and it went in The scene as well as another scene with Heffer saying Goodbye to the milking machine were later removed They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode however In addition the uncut version can still be found on the VHS tape Rocko s Modern Life With Friends Like These br There were at least two occurrences of immediate censorship of the series The original broadcast of the season two episode Road Rash featured a scene in which Rocko and Heffer stop at what is suggested to be a love hotel the No Tell Motel advertising hourly rates and ask the horse desk clerk for a room who infers the two will be engaging in intercourse All night whistles Wheeeooo Okay The scene was never shown again after its first airing but a low quality clip was made available online as early as late December and two higher quality clips have been available as late as The first airing of the season two episode Hut Sut Raw included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries upon picking one lower on the bush a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping his crotch br This scene is left intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD released in On the season three DVD the Wacky Delly segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a telephone receiver The restaurant named Chokey Chicken a term for masturbation was renamed Chewy Chicken for the series fourth season br In the special Rocko s Modern Life Static Cling they go back to using the original Chokey Chicken name As the series entered reruns after it ended more scenes were cut The entire episode Leap Frogs in which Bev Bighead attempts to seduce Rocko was skipped The entire episode Heff in a Handbasket in which Heffer Wolfe attempts to sell his soul was also skipped br When Shout Factory and Paramount announced a DVD retail release for the series there were concerns on whether Nickelodeon would allow them to release the series complete with some of the racier humor that the network eventually cut out for reruns In the end Shout Factory and Paramount only received materials from sources that were edited for broadcast so the episodes still remained censored on the DVDs br The only uncut release of the show on DVD so far was published in Germany in October although this release is still missing the uncut version of Road Rash br Back when the show was rerun on Nicktoons Leap Frogs and Heff in a Handbasket the two episodes banned for content were

Critical reception br Initial reviews of Rocko s Modern Life were positive The Miami Herald ran an article about series that were rais ing the standards for children s programming singling out Rocko s

The show has seen renewed acclaim Brahna Siegelberg of Slate said that the aspect that was most compelling was that the show had a really poignant critique of the materialist demands of American life She added that she realized that Rocko was really a show about how to navigate the adult world one that could be appreciated by kids for its slapstick humor and absurdity but had even more to say to young adults like me IGN called the show a prime example of the sophisticated intelligent brand of children s programming during Nickelodeon s golden age The A V Club called the show one of the best
