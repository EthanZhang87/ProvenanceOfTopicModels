show s second season br br Following the success of Head of the Class Robbins and Schneider were asked to co host the second annual Kids Choice Awards in alongside Tony Danza and Debbie Gibson Although they were unaware of the fledgling Nickelodeon cable channel the two agreed to participate The award ceremony that year was produced by Albie Hecht with whom Robbins and Schneider quickly struck up a friendship Their friendship continued after the awards and Hecht suggested they develop something for Nickelodeon Robbins and Schneider declined his offer as they were still under contract with ABC br By Head of the Class ended its run and Robbins started a production company with producer friend Mike Tollin aptly named Tollin Robbins Productions The company originally produced several small budget sport documentaries Hecht now Head of Development for Nickelodeon contacted them and asked them to tape a project for the network The half hour documentary they made featured the network s game show hosts Phil Moore Nick Arcade and Mike O Malley Get the Picture and Nickelodeon GUTS as co hosts of a comedy tour as they drove around to different cities to perform Since their schedule only permitted for two days of taping Tollin Robbins had to make the entire show appear as if they had toured around the country br Impressed with the final product Hecht later met with Robbins to discuss developing something asking Robbins if there was any type of show that he would be interested in making Robbins pitched an idea of creating a kid friendly version of Saturday Night Live which cast member Kenan Thompson would later join in He brought Tollin and Schneider as head writer along to help develop the show The three were influenced by classic sketch shows such as The Carol Burnett Show You Can t Do That on Television and Laugh In and began to flesh out a rough idea of the show s format Schneider decided against writing the pilot episode and instead chose to compile the cast first Usually in television the pilot is written first and the cast is assembled later However the three believed it was crucial to find the right actors first and then tailor to their strengths A nationwide talent search for child and teen actors was launched that would last for several months Eventually Angelique Bates Lori Beth Denberg Katrina Johnson Kel Mitchell Alisa Reyes Josh Server and

highly regarded for its large diverse cast both in terms of ethnicity and gender The show was praised in The Atlantic for breaking the classical norms set in children s TV with its cast irreverent and unapologetic humor and kid characters played by actual kids br When All That debuted in television was still primarily segregated by race as shown by popular sitcoms like Seinfeld where the cast is completely white or Martin where the cast is entirely black even Saturday Night Live was dominated by white male comedians Robbins Schneider and Tollin wanted the show to reflect its audience and also sought out varying musical acts alternative hip hop and R B among others to embrace the diversity br br I was the first black female they had on that show there weren t that many black shows on or black actors When I left it opened it up more for black female comedians I ve had people come back and tell me it felt like I passed the torch because they were all on TV watching like I want to do that I want to do that but then when they saw me they thought Oh I can actually do that Black girls were coming up to me parents are just like Thank you so much for what you ve done I was like wow It feels surreal br I thought it was awesome because none of us look like each other We were like a total melting pot of diversity You have African American you have me Hispanic you have Caucasian So there are kids that were able to sit home and go I look like her I look like him I can relate That was really important for me to be a part of a cast that was filled of diversity cause there s nothing more boring than a Brady Bunch concept So at the end of the day I was able to have the fans verbally tell me how they felt that All That impacted their lives and it made them come home and look forward to coming home and watching the show after school when they work on their homework and how they loved to be able to have a little bit of music maybe their mom didn t let them necessarily listen to some of the music or whatever the case may be br br br Awards and nominations br br br Reunion events br In Lisa Foiles joined forces with Comikaze Expo planning the first ever All That
