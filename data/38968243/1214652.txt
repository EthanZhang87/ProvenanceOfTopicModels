across Asia br br br Plot br The show takes place in a quaint old fashioned neighborhood where hand puppets live and act like people The main character is a curious year old named Oobi who likes to explore the outside world He lives in a single story house with his younger sister Uma and his grandfather Grampu Uma is very overdramatic and depending on the day she can be either excited or fully stressed out Grampu is laid back and encourages the kids to learn new things but he is also rather unlucky and always has to clean up the kids messes Oobi has a best friend Kako who lives across the street and likes to visit br Most episodes are about Oobi learning about something for the first time like a new place a new game or a holiday According to Noggin the show was meant to mirror the stage of early childhood when everything in the world is new and incredible and when each revelation helps build a sense of mastery and self confidence The characters use basic vocabulary and they use simple sentences based on the speech structure of a child just starting to talk For example Uma school first day is said in place of It s my first day of school The show was meant to help develop social skills early literacy and logical thinking br In season the episodes are simple shorts about Oobi making new discoveries In season the episodes were extended and followed a format made up of three parts The first part is a story like the earlier shorts The second part is a set of interviews between the puppets and human families centering on the main story s topic The last part is an interactive game usually rhyming guessing or memory When Oobi started a third season in the game segments were dropped and replaced with longer stories Interviews were still an important part of the show but instead of being shown after the story these segments were shortened and played as transitions between scenes br br br Characters br br br Main br br Oobi Tim Lagasse is a year old who is

br Bella Lisa Buckley is a grocery store owner and one of Grampu s close friends She talks with an Italian accent and brings fruit wherever she goes br br br Production br br br Concept and creation br Oobi was made by Little Airplane Productions a studio co founded by Josh Selig and Lori Shaer Both co founders started their careers working on Sesame Street Selig was inspired to create Oobi after watching puppeteers perform with their bare hands on the set of Sesame Street Each puppeteer used their hand and a pair of ping pong balls instead of a full puppet This is a common technique among puppeteers in training as it helps them learn the basics of lip syncing and focusing the eyes of a puppet Selig noted that the more skilled actors could convey lots of emotions with their hands and it gave him the idea for a series that showcased the raw emotion of bare handed puppetry br In Viacom s Nickelodeon and CTW now Sesame Workshop created a cable channel called Noggin At first the Noggin channel mainly showed reruns from CTW s library so both companies begin to look for pitches for new shows Josh Selig pitched Oobi to them under the working title Pipo which he wanted to name the main character He decided to rename the show Oobi after he found out that Pipo was already trademarked by an Italian brand of jeans The new name was meant to mirror the characters eyeballs with two O s br The pitch was successful and Oobi entered production For the first season Noggin ordered a collection of shorts which lasted to minutes each and would play during commercial breaks Josh Selig said I set up a shop to produce that series So we just signed a one year lease it was really an experiment for us and after the first year we found that we loved having a company The first season of shorts was filmed in and began airing in on Noggin br br br Assembling the crew br Tim Lagasse was chosen to play Oobi because of his previous bare handed puppetry in A Show of Hands a series of short films he made in the early s The show s main cast and crew members were all Sesame Workshop alumni Kevin Clash best known for being the original performer of Elmo was an ensemble puppeteer on Oobi and guest starred as Randy in the Babysitter episode Matt Vogel the current puppeteer for Kermit the Frog and Big Bird played Oobi s friend Angus Martin Robinson who plays Telly Monster on Sesame Street built the puppets glass eyes and accessories on Oobi Lisa Simon who won Daytime Emmys for her work as a director of Sesame Street was the producer for Oobi br The show s background music was created by Sacred Noise a music production company in New York Additional music was composed by pianist Marianna Rosett and Christopher North Renquist A few other composers were brought onto the crew for special songs Jared Faber wrote the theme song Broadway orchestrator Larry Hochman wrote songs for the Theater episode which was a ten minute musical br br br Filming br Oobi was filmed at Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York The show s set pieces were built on tall wooden poles positioned to be level with the puppeteers hands when they raised their arms This kept the actors heads out of the camera frame and allowed them to walk normally while performing making their puppets movements as smooth as possible Television monitors were placed below the sets so that the puppeteers could watch their motions and position their characters according to each scene The actors wore hands free headsets that recorded their dialogue making them able to perform and voice their characters at the same time They sometimes dubbed over their lines in post production specifically for the song sequences in episodes like Theater which required them to record different takes to match their voices to the music tracks br Many of the show s sets were made to evoke the look of old fashioned home environments To simulate natural window light in the studio the crew of Oobi placed shades with foliage patterns over their studio lights this gave the appearance of sunlight passing through trees Green screens were used for the sky of the outdoor sets and for the windows of Oobi s house br Every week during production the puppeteers visited a local manicurist to get their fingernails touched up Most of the male puppeteers such as Tim Lagasse also had to shave their arms regularly if they played younger characters Josh Selig said in a interview that Lagasse had to shave often so that Oobi would not look like a hairy kid Tyler Bunch was told specifically not to shave because his natural arm hair gave Grampu the appearance of an elderly hairy grandfather br When Cheryl Blaylock was offered the role of Frieda the Foot she had to revisit puppeteer training techniques to learn to use her foot as a puppet She recounted in a interview I had to actually go back to Puppetry to train my foot to lip sync Oh yes I was determined to do some kind of toe wiggle that could be convincing For episodes with Frieda the crew had to construct a new set that allowed Blaylock to raise her foot alongside the hand puppets To do this they assembled a ramp like stage with a chair connected to it resting on its side Blaylock was able to lie down in the chair and rest her leg on the ramp making her foot appear to be standing at the same height as Oobi br br br Iranian adaptation br br In May the Iranian cable channel IRIB TV produced its own adaptation of the show called Oobi Dasdasi None of the original crew members were involved Amir Soltan Ahmadi and Negar Estakhr two of Iran s foremost puppeteers
