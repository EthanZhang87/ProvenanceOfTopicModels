A flat twin engine is a two cylinder internal combustion engine with the cylinders on opposite sides of the crankshaft The most common type of flat twin engine is the boxer twin engine where both pistons move inwards and outwards at the same time br The flat twin design was patented by Karl Benz in and the first production flat twin engine was used in the Lanchester hp Phaeton car released in The flat twin engine was used in several other cars since however a more common usage is in motorcycles early models oriented the cylinders in line with the frame however later models switched to the cylinders being perpendicular to the frame to provide even cooling across both cylinders br Flat twin engines were also used in several aircraft up until the s and in various stationary applications from the s to the s br The Australian lawnmower manufacturer Victa also produced a flat twin engine push mower from August to dubbed the Twin and later the Supreme These engines were manufactured in Canada They are very sought after as only small numbers were produced most likely due to ignition and fuel related problems in early models In the Supreme the later model all these problems were fixed with a rear domed piston crankcase mixers and refined ignition system br br br Typical design br br Most flat twin engines use a boxer configuration for the crankshaft and are therefore called boxer twin engines In a boxer twin engine the crankshaft moves the pistons in phase with each other therefore the forces generated by one piston are cancelled out by the other resulting in excellent primary balance The evenly spaced firing order also assists in reducing vibration The equal and opposite forces in a boxer twin engine do however generate a rocking couple due to the offset distance between the pistons along the crankshaft br br A commonly used ignition system is wasted spark which is a simple ignition system using a double ended coil firing both spark plugs on each revolution i e during both the compression and exhaust strokes This system is distributorless and requires only a single contact breaker and coil for the engine br br br Crankcase pressure br The boxer twin configuration can cause pressuring of the crankcase during each inward piston stroke and de pressurisation during each outward piston stroke since both pistons are moving inwards or outwards at the same time This crankcase pumping effect also found on single cylinder engines and parallel twin engines is usually addressed by means of a crankcase breather br The Citro n CV boxer twin engine took advantage of this pumping effect to maintain a partial vacuum inside the crankcase in order to reduce oil leaks when an oil seal malfunctions This was achieved by using a one way valve a leather or rubber flap over a hole in the crankcase to let air escape the crankcase but not enter it br br br Applications br br br Automobiles br br The beginnings of the flat twin engine were in when Karl Benz obtained a patent for the design A year later his company Benz Cie unveiled the first flat twin engine a boxer design called the contra engine br In The Lanchester Engine Company began production of the Lanchester hp Phaeton which used a flat twin engine This engine had an unusual design of two counter rotating crankshafts with each piston attached to its crankshaft by a thick connecting rod Each piston was also connected to the other crankshaft by two thinner connecting rods causing the two pistons to move on the same axis It also had the torque reaction of one crankshaft cancel the torque reaction of the other cancelling torque reaction in the engine Lanchester used this engine design until br Other early uses of flat twin engines were Ford Model A the Ford Model C the Ford Model F and several Jowett Cars models from to br The Citro n CV produced from to was one of the first front wheel drive cars to use a flat engine The CV was powered by an air cooled boxer twin engine Also in the Panhard Dyna X was released with front wheel drive and an air cooled boxer twin engine Other cars following World War II using boxer twin engines were the Jowett Bradford van the DAF Daffodil the Toyota Publica the Toyota Sports sportscar and several front wheel drive models from Citro n and Panhard Several rear engined cars were also produced with boxer twin engines originally designed for motorcycles such as the Puch the BMW and the BMW The Brazilian manufacturer Gurgel Motores used an in house developed water cooled boxer twin engine Enertron engine and the Volkswagen air cooled boxer four in several models from to br The Toyota U engine was an air cooled flat twin engine produced from to Introduced in the Toyota Publica subcompact car the U engine was also used in the Toyota MiniAce small commercial vehicle and the Toyota Sports sports car br br br Motorcycles br br br Transverse mounting br br The benefits of using a flat twin engine mounted with the crankshaft running perpendicular to the frame therefore the cylinders being in line with the frame are a low centre of gravity and that a belt drive or chain drive system can be used to transmit drive to the rear wheel However the downsides are uneven heat distribution the front cylinder is more heavily cooled than the rear cylinder and a longer wheelbase is often required due to the length of the engine br The first flat twin motorcycle engine was built in by the Light Motors Company in the United Kingdom Originally named the F e renamed Fairy soon after its introduction it was designed as a bicycle engine system which transmitted power to a pulley on the rear wheel via a chain Manufacture of the Fairy was taken over by the Douglas Engineering Company one of Light Motors suppliers when the Light Motors Company folded in Later in Douglas changed the drivetrain from the chain and pulley design to a belt drive system driven directly from the engine Later developments of the Douglas motorcycle were made with the cylinders in line with the frame until the Second World War br Other early flat twin motorcycles used a similar layout with their cylinders aligned along the frame and therefore with the crankshaft running transverse to the frame br In the main supplier of rear hub gearboxes Sturmey Archer introduced a speed countershaft gearbox with integral kick starter which posed a design problem for motorcycles with transversely mounted flat twin engines This gearbox could be relatively easily located behind a single cylinder or V twin engine however this arrangement would result in an excessively long wheelbase for flat twin engines Solutions to this problem included using a countershaft below the engine as used by the Douglas Fairy or a gearbox located above the engine although in some cases the cylinders were short enough to use the gearbox in the traditional location behind the engine br In most flat twin motorcycles still used a transversely mounted engine The European models at this time included the Bradbury hp kW the Brough HB the Douglas hp kW and hp kW models the Humber hp and hp kW models the Matchless hp the Montgomery hp Williamson Flat Twin hp kW and the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Helios the predecessor to BMW s first motorcycle Models produced in the United States included the Indian Model O and the Harley Davidson Model W br br br Longitudinal mounting br br The main benefit of mounting a flat twin engine with the crankshaft in line with the frame therefore the cylinders sitting sideways in the frame is that an air cooled engine receives the same amount of cooling for each cylinder The Harley Davidson XA which used a flat twin engine with the cylinders across the frame maintained an oil temperature F C cooler than a Harley Davidson WLA with a V twin with the cylinders in line with the frame A side benefit is that the cylinders provide protection to the rider in the event of a collision or fall and keeps their feet warm in cold weather The downsides are that the engine cannot be mounted as close to the ground otherwise the cylinders can scrape the ground during cornering and that it exposes the cylinders and valve covers to the danger of collision damage br Longitudinal mounting also means that the torque reaction will twist the motorcycle to one side such as on sharp acceleration deceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral instead of shifting the weight balance between the front and rear wheels However many modern motorcycles reduce this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft br One of the first motorcycles with a longitudinally mounted flat twin engine was the ABC which was built in the United Kingdom To accommodate chain drive the ABC used a bevel drive at the gearbox to change the direction of the drive through ninety degrees BMW s first motorcycle the BMW R was another early example of a longitudinally mounted flat twin engine although it this case the power was transmitted to the rear wheel via a shaft drive br Over time longitudinal mounting became more common for flat twin engines BMW has a long history of flat twin engine motorcycles as do Ural Russia and Dnepr Ukraine br br br Aviation br br In the Pearse monoplane which would later become one of the first aircraft to achieve flight was powered by a flat twin engine built on a farm by a hobbyist inventor This engine used the unusual design of a single shared crank pin and double acting pistons In the French company Dutheil Chalmers began production of flat twin aircraft engines which used two counter rotating crankshafts The Dutheil Chlamers engine was used by the Santos Dumont Demoiselle No experimental airplane with later versions of this airplane being produced with flat twin engines from Darracq and Cl ment Bayard br Most piston engined aircraft used more than two cylinders however other flat twin aircraft engines from the s and s include the American Aeronca E and Aeronca E the British Bristol Cherub and the Czechoslovakian Praga B The HKS E is an oil cooled flat twin for ultralight aircraft that is currently in production br In larger aircraft flat twin engines have been used in auxiliary power units APUs A notable example was made by ABC Motors in the s and s During World War II the Riedel firm in Germany designed and manufactured a two stroke flat twin engine as jet engine starter motors for the Junkers Jumo BMW and Heinkel HeS jet engines br br br Other uses br The Maytag Model flat twin engines produced from until some time between and were used in various applications including clothes washing machines br Electrical generators using flat twin engines were built by Norman Engineering Company from to and by Douglas during World War II Enfield Industrial Engines part of Royal Enfield produced flat twin two stroke petrol engines during World War II which were used for generators and other military uses After Enfield produced flat twin diesel engines with applications including farm and marine use Coventry Victor introduced a diesel version of its existing cc petrol flat twin in and went on to produce flat twin diesel and petrol engines for a variety of industrial and marine uses into the s br Two stroke flat twins were often used as outboard motors for boats as they were smoother than single cylinder engines In the s they were largely replaced by straight twin two stroke engines which were easier to start and no longer had excessive amounts of vibration br br br
