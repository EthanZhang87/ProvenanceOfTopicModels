title: H engine
id: 209311
An H engine is a piston engine comprising two separate flat engines complete with separate crankshafts most often geared to a common output shaft The name H engine is due to the engine blocks resembling a letter H when viewed from the front The most successful H engine in this form was the Napier Dagger and its derivatives The name was also applied to engines of the same basic layout but rotated through degrees most famously the Napier Sabre series A variation on the H theme were the Fairey Prince H Fairey P Monarch where the two engines retained separate drives driving Contra rotating propellers through separate concentric shafts Although successful they only existed in prototype form br The H engine is a relatively rare layout with its main use being in aircraft engines during the s and s The Lotus Formula One car used a BRM cylinder H engine and an cylinder H engine was used for powerboat racing in the s br br br Design br br The benefits of an H engine are the ability to share common parts with the flat engine upon which it is based and the good engine balance which results in less vibration which is difficult to achieve in many other types of four cylinder engines br However H engines are relatively heavy and have a high centre of gravity The latter is not only due to the second crankshaft being located near the top of the engine but also the engine must be high enough off the ground to allow clearance underneath for the exhaust pipes br The U engine layout uses a similar concept placing two straight engines side by side br br br History br br br Aircraft engines br br Lycoming US br Lycoming H H hyper engine s hp kW br Fairey Aviation UK br Fairey Prince H hp kW br Fairey Monarch H hp kW br Kl ckner Humboldt Deutz DZ H litres diesel br D Napier Son UK br Napier Rapier H air cooled vertical litres hp kW br Napier Dagger H air cooled vertical litres hp kW a development of the Rapier br Napier Sabre H water cooled horizontal sleeve valves litres hp kW br Pratt Whitney US br XH H liquid cooled br XH H liquid cooled br XH H liquid cooled br XH H liquid cooled br Rolls Royce Eagle H litres hp kW br br br Formula One racing engines br The British Racing Motors BRM H Formula One engine won the US Grand Prix in a Lotus driven by Jim Clark It was also used by the unsuccessful BRM P car driven by Graham Hill and Jackie Stewart As a racing car engine it was hampered by a high center of gravity and it was heavy and complex with gear driven twin overhead cams for each of four cylinder heads two gear coupled crankshafts and mechanical fuel injection br br br br br br br br Motorcycle engines br br The Brough Superior Golden Dream motorcycle first shown in A cc H design and a few units were produced in early Any development planned was interrupted by World War II and subsequent years of austerity br Wooler built a motorcycle prototype with a similar configuration to the Brough Superior Golden Dream and exhibited it at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in and again in This was replaced by a flat four engined prototype at the show br br br Powerboat racing engines br br German firm Konig who specialised in racing outboard motors built a few cc H s in the s which were basically two of their VC flat fours mounted one above the other with the direction of rotation reversed on one of them Each half of the engine was a water cooled stroke with rotating disc valve driven by a toothed belt via two degree pulleys plus two siamesed expansion chamber exhausts fed by two single choke carbs Both cylinders at each end of each engine fired at the same time hence the siamesed exhausts for each pair br br br Other engines named H br Subaru has marketed its flat four and flat six engines as H and H respectively The letter H in this case refers to horizontally opposed an alternative term for flat engines these engines can also be said to look like a H or conjoined H s albeit from the top and in schematic form br The Saab H engine is a straight four engine produced from to The letter H represents high compression br br br
