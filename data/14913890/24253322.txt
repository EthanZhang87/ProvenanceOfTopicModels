An oscillating cylinder steam engine also known as a wobbler in the US is a simple steam engine design proposed by William Murdoch at the end of th century that requires no valve gear Instead the cylinder rocks or oscillates as the crank moves the piston pivoting in the mounting trunnion so that ports in the cylinder line up with ports in a fixed port face alternately to direct steam into or out of the cylinder br Oscillating cylinder steam engines are now mainly used in toys and models but in the past have been used in full size working engines mainly on ships and small stationary engines They have the advantage of simplicity and therefore low manufacturing costs They also tend to be more compact than other types of cylinder of the same capacity which makes them advantageous for use in ships br br br Operation br br The steam needs to be fed into the end of the cylinder at just the right time in the cycle to push the piston in the correct direction In the other direction the steam needs to be allowed to escape from the cylinder As the crankshaft rotates the piston rod moves up and down or side to side in the case of a vertical cylinder as well as in and out Because the piston rod is rigid and the piston itself is long relative to its diameter this causes the cylinder to rock or oscillate on its special mounting trunnion In the design usually found in a toy or model engine a hole in the side of the cylinder one at each end for a double acting cylinder and a pair of holes in the port block are arranged so that this rocking motion lines up the holes at the correct times allowing steam to enter the cylinder in one direction and to escape into the atmosphere or condenser in the other direction br In full size engines the steam and exhaust ports are usually built into the pivot trunnion mounting However separate valves may be provided controlled by the oscillating motion This allows the cutoff timing to be varied to enable expansive working as in for example the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen Alternatively expansive working can also be provided by means of Woolf compounding just as compactly if the two expansion stages are provided on either side of a single piston within a single cylinder all arranged as a trunk engine however an oscillating cylinder engine does not benefit from the advantage of compactness that a trunk engine would otherwise provide as it has that already from its own design features Each approach to expansive working compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness br br br Reversing br An oscillating cylinder engine cannot be reversed by means of the valve linkage as in a normal fixed cylinder because there is none Reversing of the engine can be achieved by reversing the steam connections between inlet and exhaust or in the case of small engines by shifting the trunnion pivot point so that the port in the cylinder lines up with a different pair of ports in the port face In the latter case the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports the central one being the steam feed and the outer two being exhausts only one of which being in use at any time depending on the required direction of running br br br Marine br Early proposals for marine use of oscillating steam engine were made already in the late th century In the first iron built steam ship Aaron Manby was completed using hp oscillating engines In Joseph Maudslay patented an independently developed marine oscillating engine with an improved valve gear More improvements were made by English engineer John Penn followed by introduction of cylinder version by Scottish John Scott Russell in br Early on shipbuilders considered the moving parts of the oscillating engine a hazard inside the small spaces of a ship However later the popularity of the engine type grew and paddle steamers with engine of this type were built well into the s with some reaching power over hp br br br Examples br br br See also br br Elbow engine another cylinder ported engine not requiring additional valvegear br Carpet railway the Birmingham Dribbler toy locomotives used this type of engine br br br
