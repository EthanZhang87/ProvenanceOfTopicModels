title: Overhead camshaft engine
id: 879392
An overhead camshaft OHC engine is a piston engine in which the camshaft is located in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber This contrasts with earlier overhead valve engines OHV where the camshaft is located below the combustion chamber in the engine block br Single overhead camshaft SOHC engines have one camshaft per bank of cylinders Dual overhead camshaft DOHC also known as twin cam engines have two camshafts per bank The first production car to use a DOHC engine was built in Use of DOHC engines slowly increased from the s leading to many automobiles by the early s using DOHC engines br br br Design br In an OHC engine the camshaft is located at the top of the engine above the combustion chamber This contrasts the earlier overhead valve engine OHV and flathead engine configurations where the camshaft is located down in the engine block The valves in both OHC and OHV engines are located above the combustion chamber however an OHV engine requires pushrods and rocker arms to transfer the motion from the camshaft up to the valves whereas an OHC engine has the valves directly actuated by the camshaft br Compared with OHV engines with the same number of valves there are fewer reciprocating components and less valvetrain inertia in an OHC engine This reduced inertia in OHC engines results in less valve float at higher engine speeds RPM A downside is that the system used to drive the camshaft usually a timing chain in modern engines is more complex in an OHC engine such as the chain valvetrain of the Audi or the meter chain on Ford cammers Another disadvantage of OHC engines is that during engine repairs where the removal of the cylinder head is required the camshaft engine timing needs to be reset In addition an OHC engine has a large cylinder head to accommodate the camshaft or an extra set of valves to increase the Volumetric efficiency so that with the same displacement as an OHV engine the OHC engine will end up being the physically larger of the two mostly due to the enlarged cylinder head br br The other main advantage of OHC engines is that there is greater flexibility to optimise the size location and shape of the intake and exhaust ports since there are no pushrods that need to be avoided This improves the gas flow through the engine increasing power output and fuel efficiency br br br Single overhead camshaft SOHC br br The oldest configuration of overhead camshaft engine is the single overhead camshaft SOHC design A SOHC engine has one camshaft per bank of cylinders therefore a straight engine has a total of one camshaft and a V engine or flat engine has a total of two camshafts one for each cylinder bank br Most SOHC engines have two valves per cylinder one intake valve and one exhaust valve Motion of the camshaft is usually transferred to the valves either directly using a tappet or indirectly via a rocker arm br br br Dual overhead camshaft DOHC br br A dual overhead cam double overhead cam or twin cam engine has two camshafts over each bank of the cylinder head one for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves Therefore there are two camshafts for a straight engine and a total of four camshafts for a V engine or a flat engine br A V engine or flat engine requires four camshafts to function as a DOHC engine since having two camshafts in total would result in only a single camshaft per cylinder bank for these engine layouts Some V engines with four camshafts have been marketed as quad cam engines however technically quad cam would require four camshafts per cylinder bank i e eight camshafts in total therefore these engines are merely dual overhead camshaft engines br Many DOHC engines have four valves per cylinder The camshaft usually operates the valves directly via a bucket tappet A DOHC design permits a wider angle between intake and exhaust valves than in SOHC engines which improves the air fuel mixture s flow through the engine A further benefit is that the spark plug can be placed at the optimum location which in turn improves combustion efficiency Another newer benefit of DOHC engine design is the ability to independently change phase the timing between each camshaft and the crankshaft This affords better fuel economy by allowing a broader torque curve Although each major manufacturer has their own trade name for their specific system of variable cam phasing systems overall they are all classified as variable valve timing br br br Components br br br Timing belt timing chain br br The rotation of a camshaft is driven by a crankshaft Many st century engines use a toothed timing belt made from rubber and kevlar to drive the camshaft Timing belts are inexpensive produce minimal noise and have no need for lubrication A disadvantage of timing belts is the need for regular replacement of the belt recommended belt life typically varies between approximately km mi If the timing belt is not replaced in time and fails and the engine is an interference engine major engine damage is possible br The first known automotive application of timing belts to drive overhead camshafts was the Devin Panhard racing specials built for the SCCA H modified racing series in the United States These engines were based on Panhard OHV flat twin engines which were converted to SOHC engines using components from Norton motorcycle engines The first production car to use a timing belt was the Glas compact coupe br Another camshaft drive method commonly used on modern engines is a timing chain constructed from one or two rows of metal roller chains By the early s most production automobile overhead camshaft designs used chains to drive the camshaft s Timing chains do not usually require replacement at regular intervals however the disadvantage is that they are noisier than timing belts br br br Gear train br A gear train system between the crankshaft and the camshaft is commonly used in diesel overhead camshaft engines used in heavy trucks Gear trains are not commonly used in engines for light trucks or automobiles br br br Other camshaft drive systems br br Several OHC engines up until the s used a shaft with bevel gears to drive the camshaft Examples include the Maudslay the Bentley Litre the Liberty L the MG Midget the Velocette K series the Norton International and the Norton Manx In more recent times the Ducati Single Ducati L twin engine Kawasaki W and Kawasaki W motorcycle engines have used bevel shafts The Crosley four cylinder was the last automotive engine to use the shaft tower design to drive the camshaft from to the rights to the Crosley engine format were bought by a few different companies including General Tire in followed by Fageol in Crofton in Homelite in and Fisher Pierce in after Crosley closed the automotive factory doors and they continued to produce the same engine for several more years br A camshaft drive using three sets of cranks and rods in parallel was used in the Leyland Eight luxury car built in the United Kingdom A similar system was used in the Bentley Speed Six and the Bentley Litre A two rod system with counterweights at both ends was used by many models of the NSU Prinz br br br History br br br br Among the first overhead camshaft engines were the Maudslay SOHC engine built in the United Kingdom and the Marr Auto Car SOHC engine built in the United States The first DOHC engine was a Peugeot inline four racing engine which powered the car that won the French Grand Prix Another Peugeot with a DOHC engine won the French Grand Prix followed by the Mercedes Benz GP with an SOHC engine winning the French Grand Prix br The Isotta Fraschini Tipo KM built in Italy from was one of the first production cars to use an SOHC engine br br br World War I br br During World War I both the Allied and Central Powers specifically those of the German Empire s Luftstreitkr fte air forces sought to quickly apply the overhead camshaft technology of motor racing engines to military aircraft engines The SOHC engine from the Mercedes GP car which won the French Grand Prix became the starting point for both Mercedes and Rolls Royce s aircraft engines Mercedes created a series of six cylinder engines which culminated in the Mercedes D III Rolls Royce reversed engineered the Mercedes cylinder head design based on a racing car left in England at the beginning of the war leading to the Rolls Royce Eagle V engine Other SOHC designs included the Spanish Hispano Suiza V engine with a fully enclosed drivetrain the American Liberty L V engine which closely followed the later Mercedes D IIIa design s partly exposed SOHC valvetrain design and the Max Friz designed German BMW IIIa straight six engine The DOHC Napier Lion W engine was built in Great Britain beginning in br Most of these engines used a shaft to transfer drive from the crankshaft up to the camshaft at the top of the engine Large aircraft engines particularly air cooled engines experienced considerable thermal expansion causing the height of the cylinder block to vary during operating conditions This expansion caused difficulties for pushrod engines so an overhead camshaft engine using a shaft drive with sliding spline was the easiest way to allow for this expansion These bevel shafts were usually in an external tube outside the block and were known as tower shafts br

the Sunbeam litre Super Sports became the first production car to use a DOHC engine br In the United States Duesenberg added DOHC engines alongside their existing SOHC engines with the release of the Duesenberg Model J which was powered by a DOHC straight eight engine The Stutz DV was another early American luxury car to use a DOHC engine Also in the United States the DOHC Offenhauser racing engine was introduced in This inline four engine dominated North American open wheel racing from until the s br Other early SOHC automotive engines were the Wolseley Ten the MG the Singer Junior and the Alfa Romeo C Sport Early overhead camshaft motorcycles included the Velocette K Series and the Norton CS br br br present br br The Crosley CC Four was arguably the first American mass produced car to use an SOHC engine This small mass production engine powered the winner of the Hours of Sebring br Use of a DOHC configuration gradually increased after World War II beginning with sports cars Iconic DOHC engines of this period include the Lagonda straight six engine the Jaguar XK straight six engine and the Alfa Romeo Twin Cam inline four engine The Fiat Twin Cam inline four engine was one of the first DOHC engines to use a toothed timing belt instead of a timing chain br In the s the need for increased performance while reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions saw increasing use of DOHC engines in mainstream vehicles beginning with Japanese manufacturers By the mid s most automotive engines used a DOHC layout br br br See also br Cam in block br Camless br Overhead valve
