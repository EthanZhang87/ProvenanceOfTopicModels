title: VR6 engine
id: 874398
The VR engine is a six cylinder engine configuration developed by Volkswagen The name VR comes from the combination of German words Verk rzt and Reihenmotor meaning shortened inline engine It was developed specifically for transverse engine installations and FWD front wheel drive vehicles The VR is a highly compact engine thanks to the narrower angle of to degrees between cylinder banks as opposed to the traditional V angles ranging from to degrees The compact design is cheaper to manufacture since only one cylinder head is required for all six cylinders much like a traditional inline engine br Volkswagen Group introduced the first VR engine in and VR engines remain in production today Volkswagen also produced a five cylinder VR engine based on the VR br br br Description br br VR engines share a common cylinder head for the two banks of cylinders Only two camshafts are needed for the engine regardless of whether the engine has two or four valves per cylinder This simplifies engine construction and reduces costs br Since the cylinders are not located on the centreline of the combined cylinder head the lengths of the intake and exhaust ports are different for each bank Without compensation these varying port lengths would result in the two banks of cylinders producing different amounts of power at a particular engine RPM The difference in port lengths are compensated for with the length of the runners in the intake manifold the camshaft overlap and lift profile or a combination thereof br br br Volkswagen engines br br The Volkswagen VR engine was designed for transverse engine installations in front wheel drive vehicles The narrow angle of between the two cylinder banks reduced the width of the engine compared to a traditional V engine Therefore the VR engine is easier to fit within an engine bay that was originally designed for a four cylinder engine br br br valve versions br Early VR engines had two valves per cylinder for a total of twelve valves and used one camshaft for the intake and exhaust valves of each cylinder bank without the use of rockers br The first Volkswagen VR engine uses the AAA version It had a bore of mm in and a stroke of millimetres in for a total displacement of L cu in In a L cu in ABV version was introduced in some European countries with an increased bore of mm in br The V angle between the cylinder banks is and the compression ratio is The crankshaft runs in seven main bearings and the journals are offset to one another in order to accommodate the offset cylinder placement This also allows the use of a firing interval between cylinders The firing order is The centerlines of the cylinders are offset from the centerline of the crankshaft by mm in br The valve sizes are mm in for the intake and mm in for the exhaust Since the two rows of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket the piston crown or top surface is tilted The engine management system is Bosch Motronic br br br valve versions br A version with four valves per cylinder for a total of valves was introduced in The valve versions use one camshaft for the intake valves of both banks using rockers to reach the furthest bank and the other camshaft for the exhaust valves of both banks again through the use of rockers This operating principle is more akin to a double overhead camshaft DOHC design with one camshaft for intake valves and one for exhaust valves br br br History br The Lancia V engine and Lancia V engine were the first narrow angle V engines to be used in a motor vehicle br The first versions of the VR engine were introduced in the Volkswagen Passat B sedan and Volkswagen Corrado coupe A L cu in AAA version producing kW hp was used in most Passat models and in the North American version of the Corrado A L cu in ABV version producing kW hp was used in the Passat Syncro model and the European version of the Corrado Both versions used two valves per cylinder Usage of the VR engine spread to the Volkswagen Golf Mk VR and Volkswagen Vento Jetta A VR models in The litre version was also used in the Mercedes Benz Vito W commercial vans where it was designated M br In the VR engine was introduced based on the VR engine br An AQP AUE version with four valves per cylinder was introduced in This L cu in engine produced kW hp and mostly replaced the two valve engines except for in North America where an updated version of the two valve engine was used in the Golf and Jetta from to br A L cu in EA version of the valve engine was introduced in the Volkswagen New Beetle RSi model Versions of this litre engine was also used in the Volkswagen Golf Mk R model and the Audi TT VR quattro models Peak power output was kW hp in the New Beetle engine code AXJ kW hp in the New Beetle and Golf engine code BFH BJS and kW hp in the Audi TT engine code BHE br The engine size was again increased in when a L cu in version with gasoline direct injection FSI was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat B This BLV version uses a narrower degree angle between the cylinder banks and produces kW hp A L cu in AXZ version producing kW hp was introduced in In an uprated BWS version of the litre engine producing kW hp was introduced in the Volkswagen Passat B R model br The base model Porsche Cayenne PA used liter VR engine from to and then a litre VR engine from to Then the next generation Porsche Cayenne A also used a litre VR engine from to br Volkswagen had started to phase out VR engines in favour of downsized turbocharged four cylinder engines In the VR engines made an unexpected comeback with versions of the valve VR engines being produced for the Volkswagen Atlas Volkswagen also made a new VR still EA for the Chinese market only its litre turbocharged valve VR producing kW hp or N m of torque for the Volkswagen Teramont SUV and Volkswagen Talagon MPV br br br Applications br Volkswagen Group automobiles br br Other manufacturers br br br W engines br br Volkswagen Group has produced several W engines based on combining two VR engines on a common crankshaft The first W engine to reach production was the W engine which has been produced since The W engine is constructed from two VR engines mated together at an angle of degrees Although Volkswagen has not produced a VR engine nonetheless it briefly produced a W engine from to br The largest Volkswagen W engine is the W engine introduced on the Bugatti Veyron in This engine uses an angle of degrees between the two VR engines and has four turbochargers br br br Other manufacturers br
