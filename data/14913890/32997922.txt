title: Heron cylinder head
id: 32997922
A Heron cylinder head or simply Heron head is a design for the combustion chambers of the cylinder head on an internal combustion piston engine named for engine designer S D Heron The head is machined flat with recesses only for inlet and exhaust valves spark plugs injectors and so on The combustion chamber itself is contained within a dished depression in the top of the piston The Heron head is suitable for petrol and diesel engines for ohv and ohc valve gear and for small and large engine displacement capacities br While a flat cylinder head could be combined with simple flat top pistons that option ignores the reasons for having a depression in the top of each piston namely i it provides a compact space for combustion to begin allowing an optimal flame front and ii it creates significant squish as the piston reaches TDC This causes turbulence which is desirable because it promotes more extensive mixing of the fuel air mixture cf cf cf cf Having no space available at the top of piston travel to maintain compression ratio would also mean that the air fuel mixture would be compressed to zero volume or close which is far too high a compression ratio for any internal combustion engine to run on due to detonation before the piston even reached top dead center unless the stroke was carefully designed to leave a small gap between the top of the cylinder and the head when the piston is at TDC in a normal engine the size of the combustion chamber dictates the compression ratio of the engine i e the volume of the cylinder is compressed into the space of the chamber at TDC a flat piston and flat head would leave no space for the air fuel mixture unless designed so the piston doesn t actually reach the top of the cylinder bore br br br Pros and cons br Advantages include simplicity of manufacture compact dimensions accuracy of the flat machined surface simplified valve gear efficient combustion with good fuel economy br Disadvantages include the greater size and weight of each piston volumetric efficiency poorer than conventional cylinder heads with non parallel valves br br br Applications br Alfa Romeo Alfasud boxer engine br Audi F pushrod four engine used in different Audi models of the s and s br Chevrolet V engines br Ford MEL V engines br Ford Super Duty V engines br Ford Essex V engine br Ford Essex V engine br Ford Kent engine br Jaguar V engine br Puma racing engines br Moto Guzzi br Moto Morini br Renault F Type engine also named B E B F B FT by Volvo applied to the Volvo and Volvo br Rover P br Standard Wetliner I engine as used in Standard which is a licensed Rover SD br Volkswagen EA engine e g the cc bhp engine of Audi GT br Volkswagen EA engine e g the cc bhp engine of VW Polo c f br Volkswagen EA engine also used in Porsche br Volkswagen Wasserboxer Vanagon engines br Volvo B K B K engine applied to the Volvo and in some markets br br br
