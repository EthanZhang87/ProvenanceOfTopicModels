In mechanical engineering the Beale number is a parameter that characterizes the performance of Stirling engines It is often used to estimate the power output of a Stirling engine design For engines operating with a high temperature differential typical values for the Beale number are in the range where a larger number indicates higher performance br br br Definition br The Beale number can be defined in terms of a Stirling engine s operating parameters br br br br br br B br br n br br br br br br br W br o br br br P br V br F br br br br br br displaystyle B n frac Wo PVF br br br where br br Bn is the Beale number br Wo is the power output of the engine watts br P is the mean average gas pressure Pa or MPa if volume is in cm br V is swept volume of the power piston m or cm if pressure is in MPa br F is the engine cycle frequency Hz br br br Estimating Stirling power br To estimate the power output of an engine nominal values are assumed for the Beale number pressure swept volume and frequency then the power is calculated as the product of these parameters as follows br br br br br W br o br br br B br br n br br br P br V br F br br br displaystyle Wo B n PVF br br br br See also br West number br br br br br br External links br Stirling Engine Performance Calculator br Beale number calculator
