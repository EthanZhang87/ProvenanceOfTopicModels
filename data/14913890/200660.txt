title: Straight-five engine
id: 200660
The straight five engine also referred to as an inline five engine abbreviated I or L is a piston engine with five cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankshaft br Although less common than straight four engines and straight six engines straight five engine designs have been used by automobile manufacturers since the late s The most notable examples include the Mercedes Benz s diesel engines from to and Audi s petrol engines from to the present Straight five engines are smoother running than straight four engines and shorter than straight six engines However achieving consistent fueling across all cylinders was problematic prior to the adoption of fuel injection br br br Characteristics br br Straight five engines are typically shorter than straight six engines making them easier to fit transversely in an engine bay They are also smoother than straight four engines and are narrower than V engines and flat engines br br br Engine balance and vibration br Five cylinder engines have a crankshaft with degree angles Amongst four stroke engines an advantage of engines with five or more cylinders is that the power strokes are overlapping if the engine has an even firing order br A disadvantage of the odd number of cylinders in a straight five engine is it results in imperfect primary and secondary engine balance unlike a straight six engine which has perfect primary and secondary balance Counterweights on the crankshaft can be used to reduce the vibrations from these imbalances This method is also used in straight four engines br br br Firing order br Most four stroke straight five engines use a firing order of This firing order results in the minimal primary crank speed rocking couple and is used by the Volvo Modular engine VW Audi straight five engine General Motors Atlas engine and Honda G engine Straight five engines typically have a degree crankshaft design br All two stroke straight five engines are limited in having a single firing order for a given crank configuration because a complete cycle occurs every degrees there is no chance to share piston phases without having simultaneous ignitions so the straight five is at no disadvantage in this case Some two stroke outboard engines e g the Mercury Marine Force engine use a firing order of br br br Carburettors and fuel injection br The use of straight five petrol engines in mass production cars only became truly viable with the advent of reliable fuel injection This is because of the unavoidable problems of a carburettor supplying an odd number of cylinders and the length of the inlet manifold between the carburetor varying greatly between cylinders at the ends of the engine and those nearer the carburetor Unlike other engine layouts these problems are not easily solved by using multiple carburettors br Diesel engines have always used fuel injection therefore large displacement straight five diesel engines were commonly seen decades before straight five petrol engines br br br Usage in automobiles br br br Diesel engines br The Lancia Ro trucks introduced a straight five diesel engine to replace the previous straight three engine Built for the Italian and German armed forces during World War II and later for civilian usage the truck remained in production until br The first mass production straight five passenger car engine was the Mercedes Benz OM a naturally aspirated L cu in engine introduced in the Mercedes Benz D W W models In a turbocharged version was introduced in the Mercedes Benz SD Turbo models Mercedes Benz continued to produce straight five engines for the next years until the Mercedes Benz OM engine ended production in br In the Audi R D engine was introduced in the Audi sedan In a turbocharged version was introduced initially for the U S market Audi Several Volvo cars were produced with Audi straight five diesel engines prior to the introduction of the Volvo D turbo diesel engine this engine was produced from to and was used in several diesel hybrid applications marketed as twin engine models br Other mass production straight five diesel engines include the VM Motori turbo diesel engine the Land Rover Td turbo diesel engine the Ford Duratorq turbo diesel engine and the Fiat JTD turbo diesel engine br br br Petrol engines br br Henry Ford had an inline five engine developed in the late s to early s for a compact economy car design which never saw production due to lack of demand for small cars in the United States br The first production straight five petrol engine was the Audi R introduced in the Audi in Audi has continued use of straight five petrol engines in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions to the present day The Audi TT RS and Audi RS currently use straight five engines In motorsport the first car to use a straight five engine was the Audi Quattro rally car other racing cars which used straight five engines include the Audi Sport Quattro E and the Audi Quattro IMSA GTO For the year factory team tested a hp version of the inline powered Audi S Sport Quattro br Several Volkswagen branded straight five engines have been produced beginning with the Volkswagen WH WN litre v engine used in the Volkswagen Passat The final Volkswagen straight five petrol engine was the Volkswagen EA litre v engine used in the North American Passat models until br The Volvo Modular engine was introduced in the Volvo sedan and was used in various Volvo models along with the Ford Focus ST and Ford Focus RS models All of the straight five petrol engines used by Volvo and Ford were built at the Volvo Sk vde engine plant in Sk vde Sweden until their discontinuation in br Other straight five petrol engines include br br Honda G series litre v engines br Fiat Family C litre v engine br General Motors Vortec litre v engines br In recent years the engine has been falling out of favour with Volvo announcing in it would discontinue building them for example br br br Usage in motorcycles br br Very few motorcycles have used five cylinder engines However the Honda RC and Honda RC cc four stroke racing motorcycles used straight five engines based on the cc straight twin engine from the Honda RC Grand Prix racing motorcycle These straight five engines were an unusual design in that they were configured as a straight six engine with one of the middle cylinders removed br br br See also br br Straight engine br V engine br VR engine br br br
