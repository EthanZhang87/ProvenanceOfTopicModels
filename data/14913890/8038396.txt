The West number is an empirical parameter used to characterize the performance of Stirling engines and other Stirling systems It is very similar to the Beale number where a larger number indicates higher performance however the West number includes temperature compensation The West number is often used to approximate of the power output of a Stirling engine The average value is for a wide variety of engines although it may range up to particularly for engines operating with a high temperature differential br The West number may be defined as br br br br br br W br br n br br br br br br br W br o br br br P br V br f br br br br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br br br B br br n br br br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br br br displaystyle W n frac Wo PVf frac T text H T text K T text H T text K B n frac T text H T text K T text H T text K br br br where br br Wn is the West number br Wo is the power output of the engine watts br P is the mean average gas pressure Pa or MPa if volume is in cm br V is swept volume of the expansion space m or cm if pressure is in MPa br f is the engine cycle frequency Hz br TH is the absolute temperature of the expansion space or heater kelvins br TK is the absolute temperature of the compression space or cooler kelvins br Bn is the Beale number for an engine operating between temperatures TH and TK br When the Beale number is known but the West number is not known it is possible to calculate it First calculate the West number at the temperatures TH and TK for which the Beale number is known and then use the resulting West number to calculate output power for other temperatures br To estimate the power output of a new engine design nominal values are assumed for the West number pressure swept volume and frequency and the power is calculated as follows br br br br br br W br br o br br br br br W br br n br br br P br V br f br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br T br br H br br br br br T br br K br br br br br br br br displaystyle W o W n PVf frac T text H T text K T text H T text K br br br For example with an absolute temperature ratio of the portion of the equation representing temperature correction equals With a temperature ratio of the temperature term is This factor accounts for the difference between the West equation and the Beale equation in which this temperature term is taken as a constant Thus the Beale number is typically in the range of to which is about to the value of the West number br br br br br br External links br Stirling Engine Performance Calculator
