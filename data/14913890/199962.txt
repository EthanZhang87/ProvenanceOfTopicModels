A V engine is a ten cylinder piston engine where two banks of five cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft V engines are much less common than V and V engines Several V diesel engines have been produced since and V petrol engines for road cars were first produced in with the release of the Dodge Viper br br br Design br The V configuration does not have perfect engine balance since an unbalanced rocking couple is caused by each cylinder bank functioning as a straight five engine Therefore balance shafts are sometimes used to reduce the vibrations in a V engine br br br Diesel engines br One of the first known V engines was used in the Busch Sulzer ICRR prototype locomotive of which three examples were produced in the United States br The Leopard armored tank was powered by the MTU MB CaM L cu in V diesel engine br Daimler Benz produced three V diesel engine models OM OM and OM for Mercedes Benz NG and Neoplan buses in s s br Four Japanese commercial vehicle manufacturers Isuzu Hino Mitsubishi Fuso and Nissan Diesel produced V diesel engines for their heavy duty trucks and coaches in s s br The present Tatra truck is available with a L cu in V engine br The Volkswagen V TDI is a turbocharged V engine which was produced from to for use in the Volkswagen Phaeton luxury sedan and Volkswagen Touareg SUV br br br Petrol engines br br br Production vehicles br br V engines are less common than V and V engines a V is only slightly more complicated and runs more smoothly while a V is less complex and more economical Nevertheless modern engineering has made it possible to use V engines for applications where a V would produce insufficient power and a V would be too complicated or bulky V s have been used in select luxury cars sports cars and commercial vehicles br An early V petrol engine was used in the Lamborghini P however this prototype sports car did not reach production br Dodge developed an early V originally designing a version of its LA series small block for use in trucks The Dodge engine saw its first production use in substantially revised form in the Dodge Viper while the truck version of the engine was used starting in in the Dodge Ram It discontinued in that application after However also saw the introduction of the Dodge Ram SRT a performance model meant to rival Ford s successful V powered F SVT Lightning The Viper engine a degree engine with odd firing order to obviate the need for a balance shaft was improved during its production run and produced as much as kW hp PS in a standard state of tune from an L version The Viper engine was also used by Bristol in the two seat Fighter coupe and in other low volume vehicles br Ford also developed a heavy duty V version of their Triton engine to replace the big block in truck applications It was introduced in the E Series Econoline full size van and also saw duty in the F Series Super Duty line and the Ford Excursion SUV and was offered by Ford through the model year br For the Lexus LFA the engineers selected a V engine over an equivalent displacement V because they could not get the V to rev as high as a V and over a V for its lower reciprocating mass allowing for more rapid engine response br European marques were slower to adopt the V configuration However high revving V power plants were incorporated into supercars from Lamborghini and Porsche BMW and Audi developed V s for high performance cars such as BMW M BMW M Audi S Audi RS Audi S and Audi R mostly based upon their executive cars Volkswagen also developed a V but as a turbo diesel A variant of the Volkswagen Phaeton was the first production sedan to contain a V of any kind br br Examples of petrol V production engines include br br br Motor racing br One of the first known V engines designed for motor racing was a L cu in prototype Formula One engine built by Alfa Romeo in Originally intended for the Ligier Formula One team this partnership collapsed without the engine being used in any races Alfa Romeo fitted the engine to two Alfa Romeo Pro Car prototypes in however these cars also did not compete in any races br The most widespread use of V racing engines has been in Formula One Following a ban on turbocharged engines after the first V Formula One cars were the McLaren MP and Williams FW V engines were used by the majority of teams by the season following reduction in displacement from to L to cu in The V seemed the best compromise between the lower weight of a V and the higher power of a V Renault F used a flatter angle in and but reverted to a more conventional following the change in rules which dictated that an engine must last two race weekends In a further change to the rules V s were banned for the season onwards in favor of L V s br In sports car racing the first V engine was used by the Peugeot in the two final races of the season This was followed by the Judd GV engine being used by several teams during the season and the Toyota TS that debuted in the last race of the season The Audi R TDI was a Le Mans Prototype LMP racing car that used a turbocharged diesel V engine and competed in various endurance races in and The Audi R TDI set the current distance record for the Hours of Le Mans br br br Commercial vehicle use br Until early Blue Bird Corporation offered its Vision school bus with two V engine options
