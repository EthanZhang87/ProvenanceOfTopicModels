The Minto wheel is a heat engine named after Wally Minto The engine consists of a set of sealed chambers arranged in a circle with each chamber connected to the chamber opposite it One chamber in each connected pair is filled with a liquid with a low boiling point propane TB C and R TB C are listed in the Mother Earth News articles Ideally the working fluid also has a high vapor pressure and density br br br Operation br As the lower chamber in each pair is heated the liquid begins to vaporize forcing the remaining liquid to travel to the upper chamber This fluid transfer causes a weight imbalance which causes the wheel to rotate br Minto s pamphlet also suggests obtaining a pressure differential with a dissolved gas instead of a boiling gas Soda water or propane dissolved in kerosene are suggested br br br Characteristics br The Minto wheel operates on a small temperature gradient and produces a large amount of torque but at very low rotational speed The speed of rotation is directly proportional to the surface area of the containers used the volume and the height of the wheel The higher the ratio of surface area to volume the greater the rate of revolution br br br History br br br Iske brothers and Israel L Landis br In the Iske brothers got two patents granted for a design similar to the Minto wheel br According to the patent the working fluid is alcohol or other volatile liquid Air in the tubes is to be removed and the tubes are sealed creating a partial vacuum br The patent suggests lamps as heating sources br The first patent describes glass for the bulbs and tubes The second patent does not specify materials but the construction implies metal A later patent then clearly specify metal br br US Patent US granted to the Iske brothers br br br br br br US Patent US granted to the Iske brothers br br br br br br br br br br Later the same year Israel L Landis got a patent for a similar engine Different to the Minto wheel and the Iske brothers patent the engine was oscillating not revolving Landis suggested alcohol or ether as the volatile liquid Landis suggested heating up the apparatus before removing the air from the bulb chambers br br US Patent US br br br br br br In the following years the Iske brothers were granted various patents including some relating to modification and or improvements on engines similarly to the Minto Wheel and an oscillating engine similarly to Israel L Landis design br br US Patent Variation with Flexible Tubing and Endless Chain br br br br br br br br br br US Patent br br br br br br br br br br US Patent br br br br br br br br br br br Drinking bird br The oscillating types by the Iske Brothers and Landis are related to the drinking bird toy br The drinking bird is dating back to s s The drinking bird was patented in the US in and by two different inventors br br drinking bird US patents br br br br br br br br br br br Wally Minto s contribution br Wally Minto experimented with different working fluids With the working fluids he used he got the required temperature difference down enabling the engine for example to run on solar power Based on the working fluid his improved wheel is also known as Freon Power Wheel Popular Science reported about in its March issue br br br Examples br A working example of a Minto wheel was first published in a series of articles in The Mother Earth News Issues March May and July Test units constructed by Mother Earth News Issue July and the MythBusters Episode December Ming Dynasty Astronaut did convert temperature difference into torque but not as well as overenthusiastic boosters claimed br br br See also br Drinking bird br Stirling engine br Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion br br br br br br External links br br Internet Archive archive of scans of the The Mother Earth News articles br Wally Minto s original booklet br Minto outline br YouTube video of a model Minto wheel in operation br YouTube video of a model Minto wheel in operation shows smoother action from more chambers br patents granted to the Iske brothers br US patent for the device br US br US br US patent for the device br US br US br patent granted to Israel L Landis br US br http www genuineideas com HallofInventions SolarPivots thermoscopicSolarWheel html
