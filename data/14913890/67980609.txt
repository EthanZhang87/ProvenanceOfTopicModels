The Manson engine is a hot air engine that was first described by A D Manson in the March issue of Newnes Practical Mechanics Magazines Manson engines can be started in either direction clockwise or anti clockwise It has a stepped piston The front part acts as a displacer and the back part acts as a work piston the displacer and the work piston move as a single component The engine only requires three moving parts piston piston rod and crank br The engine is double acting using both the expansion of the warmed air and atmospheric pressure overcoming the reducing pressure of the cooling air to do work br The engine currently has no commercial or practical applications The engines are built mainly as desk toys physics demonstrations and novelties br br br Functioning mechanism br br Phase cooling down the work medium suction stroke br when the Piston is moved toward the heat source the hot gas inside the engine is moved to the cool side of the cylinder br the gas is cooled there resulting in pressure dropping below atmospheric further moving the piston toward the heat source br Phase top dead centre br When the piston reaches top dead centre the inlet valve is open releasing the vacuum br the flywheel keeps the piston moving br Phase heating up the work medium expansion stroke br when the piston is moving away from the heat source the air is pushed toward the heat source br the air is then heating up resulting in the air expanding and the piston being further pushed away from the heat source br Phase bottom dead centre br when the piston reaches bottom dead centre the exhaust valve is open releasing the build up pressure and hot air br the flywheel keeps the piston moving br br br Differences from Stirling engines br Stirling engines are typically closed systems while Manson engines are open systems The displacer and work piston of the Manson engine have zero phase angle br br br Variations br br Manson Guise Engine br The valves and gas paths are considered by some to be complicated to manufacture so various variants exist with improved modified or simplified valves and gas paths br br br Sources
