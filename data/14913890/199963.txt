A V engine is a four cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration br The V engine is less common compared to straight four engines However V engines have been used in automobiles motorcycles and other applications br br br Design br Some V engines have two crankpins that are shared by opposing cylinders The crankshaft is usually supported by three main bearings in this type of engines However this arrangement results an uneven firing engine Split crankpins are preferred for even firing intervals br Compared to the more common inline four engine layout a V engine is much shorter Although different V angles can be used if the two pistons are at a V angle with shared crankpins the engine offers the additional advantage of perfect primary balance that reduces vibration The design can also result in a smaller rocking couple than an inline four engine and the shorter crankshaft is less susceptible to the effects of torsional vibration due to its increased stiffness br Disadvantages of V engines include its design being inherently wider compared to inline engines as well as the requirement of two exhaust manifolds two cylinder heads and two valvetrains thus needing two or four camshafts for overhead cam engines rather than only one cylinder head one manifold one valvetrain and one or two camshafts for an inline four engine Having two separate banks of components increases cost and complexity in comparison with inline four engines br Because V engines are wider than inline four engines incorporating auxiliary drives inlet systems and exhaust systems while maintaining an overall compact size may be more difficult like other V type engines In order to reduce width a narrower V angle could be utilized such as degrees Although a V is more compact than a V engine the design does not have perfect primary balance if the crankpins are not split and therefore often require a balance shaft to reduce vibrations similar to the V engines Additionally any four stroke V engine with shared crankpins will fire unevenly and potentially require a heavier flywheel Using split crankpins in a V as used on the Ford Essex V engine and Ford Taunus V engines results in an even firing order br br br Automobile use br br The earliest automotive use of V engines were in Grand Prix racing later called Formula One cars One of the pioneering V engines was in the Mors rear engined car built in France At the time the lack of vibration from the V engine was a key selling point However the car s V engine was replaced by a conventional inline four engine by br In the French Grand Prix the car entered by J Walter Christie used a cc cu in V engine the largest engine ever used in a Grand Prix race The engine was mounted transversely in the front and the car was front wheel drive The car retired from the French Grand Prix after just four laps however it later set a speed record of km h mph br The first V engine used in production cars was the Lancia V engine that was first used in the Lancia Lambda The Lancia engine was a narrow angle design with an angle of degrees between the banks and a single cylinder head with one overhead camshaft shared by both banks It also used aluminium for both the block and head which was unusual for the time Lancia produced V engines until when they were replaced by flat four engines br The ZAZ Zaporozhets is a Soviet city type car that used a rear mounted V engine This engine was based on the design used in the LuAZ amphibious military vehicle It featured air cooling with a magnesium block and was produced in displacements from L cu in br The AMC Air cooled was a cu in L engine built from to for use in the lightweight M Mighty Mite military vehicle The M developed was by American Motors Corporation AMC in the United States and specifically designed to be transported by helicopter br Beginning in the s Ford s European divisions produced two unrelated V engines The first was the Ford Taunus V engine produced in Germany from to The Taunus was a degree V engine with water cooling and overhead valves Initially designed for use in front engined cars it was used in various Ford models and also used in the front wheel drive Saab Saab and Saab Sonett models It was also used in the mid engine Matra sports car The second Ford V engine was the Ford Essex V engine produced in the United Kingdom from to and used in several Ford Corsair Capri Consul Zephyr and Transit models Although designed separately from the Taunus engine the Essex also was a degree V with water cooling overhead valves and designed for use in front engined cars vans br The Porsche Hybrid LMP racing car used in the seasons used a L cu in degree turbocharged V engine that was mid mounted br br br Motorcycle use br br One of the first motorcycles powered by a V engine was the Matchless Silver Hawk built in the United Kingdom The Silver Hawk used a narrow angle degree V engine with a single cylinder head pushrod valve actuation and air cooling br The Puch P was built in Austria for both civilian and military uses The P used a very wide angle degree V engine therefore being close in appearance to a flat four engine with two cylinder heads and air cooling br V engines were used during the mid to late s especially in transverse engined Honda motorcycles that had a degree V engine with water cooling br The majority of MotoGP manufacturers chose the V configuration for their bikes These include br br Honda RC V br Ducati Desmosedici br KTM RC br Aprilia V for the season br br br Boat use br Another use of the V engine is in outboard motors for boats The V configuration is popular for outboard marine applications due to its short engine length br In both Johnson and Evinrude introduced cu in cc V outboards rated at hp kW and weighing lb kg By the same basic V block was producing more than double the horsepower in stock form because of the experience manufacturers gained from racing In Yamaha introduced a hp kW two stroke V to the US market with what was called precision blend oil injection Most of the outboard motors are usually two stroke engines with a carburetor br br br Other uses br In the Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company began producing petrol gasoline V engines for industrial agricultural and stationary applications with several farm equipment manufacturers using the Wisconsin V engines In the largest Wisconsin V engine was the VR D with a displacement of cu in L and a power output of hp kW at rpm and a peak torque of lb ft N m at rpm The company produced V engines until br In the mid s Turner Manufacturing in the United Kingdom produced a diesel water cooled V engine for industrial and marine uses This engine was used in the Turner Yeoman of England tractor br Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built the ZF an air cooled diesel powered V engine used in the Type Armored Personnel Carrier and related Japanese military vehicles since br br br See also br Flat four engine br Inline four engine br br br br br br External links br Media related to V engines at Wikimedia Commons
