A compound steam engine unit is a type of steam engine where steam is expanded in two or more stages br A typical arrangement for a compound engine is that the steam is first expanded in a high pressure HP cylinder then having given up heat and losing pressure it exhausts directly into one or more larger volume low pressure LP cylinders Multiple expansion engines employ additional cylinders of progressively lower pressure to extract further energy from the steam br Invented in this technique was first employed on a Cornish beam engine in Around compound engines were first introduced into Lancashire textile mills br br br Compound systems br There are many compound systems and configurations but there are two basic types according to how HP and LP piston strokes are phased and hence whether the HP exhaust is able to pass directly from HP to LP Woolf compounds or whether pressure fluctuation necessitates an intermediate buffer space in the form of a steam chest or pipe known as a receiver receiver compounds br In a single expansion or simple steam engine the high pressure steam enters the cylinder at boiler pressure through an inlet valve The steam pressure forces the piston down the cylinder until the valve shuts e g after of the piston s stroke After the steam supply is cut off the trapped steam continues to expand pushing the piston to the end of its stroke where the exhaust valve opens and expels the partially depleted steam to the atmosphere or to a condenser This cut off allows much more work to be extracted since the expansion of the steam is doing additional work beyond that done by the steam at boiler pressure br An earlier cut off increases the expansion ratio which in principle allows more energy to be extracted and increases efficiency Ideally the steam would expand adiabatically and the temperature would drop corresponding to the volume increase However in practice the material of the surrounding cylinder acts as a heat reservoir cooling the steam in the earlier part of the expansion and heating it in the later part These irreversible heat flows decrease the efficiency of the process so that beyond a certain point further increasing the expansion ratio would actually decrease efficiency in addition to decreasing the mean effective pressure and thus the power of the engine br br br Compounding engines br A solution to the dilemma was invented in by British engineer Arthur Woolf who patented his Woolf high pressure compound engine in In the compound engine high pressure steam from the boiler first expands in a high pressure HP cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower pressure LP cylinders The complete expansion of the steam occurs across multiple cylinders and as there is less expansion in each cylinder the steam cools less in each cylinder making higher expansion ratios practical and increasing the efficiency of the engine br There are other advantages as the temperature range is smaller cylinder condensation is reduced Loss due to condensation is restricted to the LP cylinder Pressure difference is less in each cylinder so there is less steam leakage at the piston and valves The turning moment is more uniform so balancing is easier and a smaller flywheel may be used Only the smaller HP cylinder needs to be built to withstand the highest pressure which reduces the overall weight Similarly components are subject to less strain so they can be lighter The reciprocating parts of the engine are lighter reducing the engine vibrations The compound could be started at any point in the cycle and in the event of mechanical failure the compound could be reset to act as a simple and thus keep running br To derive equal work from lower pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume Therefore the bore and in rare cases the stroke as well are increased in low pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders br Double expansion usually just known as compound engines expand the steam in two stages but this does not imply that all such engines have two cylinders They may have four cylinders working as two LP HP pairs or the work of the large LP cylinder can be split across two smaller cylinders with one HP cylinder exhausting into either LP cylinder giving a cylinder layout where the cylinder and piston diameter of all three are about the same making the reciprocating masses easier to balance br Two cylinder compounds can be arranged as br br Cross compound the cylinders are side by side br Tandem compound the cylinders are end to end driving a common connecting rod br Telescopic compound the cylinders are one inside the other br Angle compound the cylinders are arranged in a vee usually at a angle and drive a common crank br The adoption of compounding was widespread for stationary industrial units where the need was for increased power at decreasing cost and almost universal for marine engines after It was not widely used in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated and unsuitable for the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge particularly in Britain Compounding was never common on British railways and not employed at all after but was used in a limited way in many other countries br The first successful attempt to fly a heavier than air fixed wing aircraft solely on steam power occurred in when George and William Besler converted a Travel Air biplane to fly on a hp angle compound V twin steam engine of their own design instead of the usual Curtiss OX inline or radial aviation gasoline engine it would have normally used br br br Multiple expansion engines br br It is a logical extension of the compound engine described above to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency The result is the multiple expansion engine Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively These engines use a series of double acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and or stroke and hence volume These cylinders are designed to divide the work into three or four equal portions one for each expansion stage The adjacent image shows an animation of a triple expansion engine The steam travels through the engine from left to right The valve chest for each of the cylinders is to the left of the corresponding cylinder br br br History br br br Early work br br Jonathan Hornblower the grandson of one of Newcomen s engine erectors in Cornwall patented a double cylinder compound reciprocating beam engine in He was prevented from developing it further by James Watt who claimed his own patents were infringed br Richard Trevithick develops an effective high pressure steam engine br Arthur Woolf develops the stationary Woolf high pressure compound engine patented in The Woolf engine lessened the increased magnitude of the continual heating and cooling of a single expansion high pressure steam engine that leads to inefficiency It also solved the problem that the contemporary cast iron cylinders could not handle it well br br br Double expansion br Hercules was modified to use an extra low pressure cylinder taken from Agrippina with steam from her high pressure cylinders This modification was designed by Dutch engineer Gerhard Moritz Roentgen making him the inventor of the naval compound steam engine The steam paddle tugboat was then successfully used for service on the river Waal becoming the first ship with a compound steam engine to enter service br William McNaught devised a method of fixing an additional high pressure cylinder within an existing beam engine To do so involved using a long pipe to connect the cylinders and an extra set of valves to balance them In effect this acted as a receiving chest and a new type of compound had been invented This system allowed greater control of the steam intake and cut offs An engine could be slowed by either a throttle which reduced the pressure of the steam or by adjusting the cut off on either cylinder The latter was more efficient as no power was lost The cycle was smoother as the two cylinders were not in phase br SS Agamemnon was launched equipped with a hp compound steam engine The engine was designed by Alfred Holt one of her owners Holt had persuaded the Board of Trade to allow a boiler pressure of psi instead of the normal psi a higher pressure was needed to realise the advantages of double expansion The efficiency obtained enabled this ship to travel miles before coaling This made her competitive on routes between China and Britain br br br Multiple expansion br br Daniel Adamson took out a patent for a multiple expansion engine with three or more cylinders connected to one beam or crankshaft He built a triple expansion engine for Victoria Mills Dukinfield which opened in br Charles Normand of Le Havre fitted a triple expansion engine to a Seine river boat in br Sir Fredrick J Bramwell reported that compound marine engines operating at psi to psi consumed lbs to lbs of coal per hour per indicated horsepower br Alexander Carnegie Kirk built SS Aberdeen the first major ship to be successfully powered by a triple expansion engine The success relied on solving the problem of designing a boiler that could operate at the then high pressures needed to realise the benefits of triple expansion br HMS Victoria launched the first battleship to be powered by triple expansion engines br Triple expansion compound marine engines operating at psi consumed on average about lbs of coal per hour per indicated horsepower br br br Applications br br br Pumping engines br br br Mill engines br br Though the first mills were driven by water power once steam engines were adopted the manufacturer no longer needed to site the mills by running water Cotton spinning required ever larger mills to fulfil the demand and this drove the owners to demand increasingly powerful engines When boiler pressure had exceeded psi compound engines achieved a thermo dynamic advantage but it was the mechanical advantages of the smoother stroke that was the deciding factor in the adoption of compounds In there was ihp indicated horsepower of engines in mills in the Manchester area of which ihp was provided by compounds though only ihp was generated from boilers operated at over psi br To generalise between and all Lancashire mills were driven by compounds The last compound built was by Buckley and Taylor for Wye No mill Shaw This engine was a cross compound design to ihp driving a ft ton flywheel and operated until br br br Marine applications br br In the marine environment the general requirement was for autonomy and increased operating range as ships had to carry their coal supplies The old salt water boiler was thus no longer adequate and had to be replaced by a closed fresh water circuit with condenser The result from onwards was the multiple expansion engine using three or four expansion stages triple and quadruple expansion engines These engines used a series of double acting cylinders of progressively increasing diameter and or stroke and hence volume designed to divide the work into three or four as appropriate equal portions for each expansion stage Where space is at a premium two smaller cylinders of a large sum volume might be used for the low pressure stage Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged in line but various other formations were used In the late th century the Yarrow Schlick Tweedy balancing system was used on some marine triple expansion engines Y S T engines divided the low pressure expansion stages between two cylinders one at each end of the engine This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced resulting in a smoother faster responding engine which ran with less vibration This made the cylinder triple expansion engine popular with large passenger liners such as the Olympic class but was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration free steam turbine br The development of this type of engine was important for its use in steamships as by exhausting to a condenser the water could be reclaimed to feed the boiler which was unable to use seawater Land based steam engines could simply exhaust much of their steam as feed water was usually readily available Prior to and during World War II the expansion engine dominated marine applications where high vessel speed was not essential It was superseded by the steam turbine when speed was required such as for warships and ocean liners HMS Dreadnought of was the first major warship to replace the proven technology of the reciprocating engine with the then novel steam turbine br br br Application to railway locomotives br br For railway locomotive applications the main benefit sought from compounding was economy in fuel and water consumption plus high power weight ratio due to temperature and pressure drop taking place over a longer cycle this resulting in increased efficiency additional perceived advantages included more even torque br While designs for compound locomotives may date as far back as James Samuel s patent for a continuous expansion locomotive the practical history of railway compounding begins with Anatole Mallet s designs in the s Mallet locomotives were operated in the United States up to the end of mainline steam by the Norfolk and Western Railway The designs of Alfred George de Glehn in France also saw significant use especially in the rebuilds of Andr Chapelon A wide variety of compound designs were tried around but most were short lived in popularity due to their complexity and maintenance liability In the th century the superheater was widely adopted and the vast majority of steam locomotives were simple expansion with some compound locomotives converted to simple It was realised by engineers that locomotives at steady speed were worked most efficiently with a wide open regulator and early cut off the latter being set via the reversing gear A locomotive operating at very early cut off of steam e g at of the piston stroke allows maximum expansion of the steam with less wasted energy at the end of the stroke Superheating eliminates the condensation and rapid loss of pressure that would otherwise occur with such expansion br Large American locomotives used two cross compound steam driven air compressors e g the Westinghouse D for the train brakes br br br The Yarrow Schlick Tweedy

work the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two cylinder simple at out of phase with each other quartered br When the double expansion group is duplicated producing a cylinder compound the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at the groups being set at to each other In one case the first type of Vauclain compound the pistons worked in the same phase driving a common
