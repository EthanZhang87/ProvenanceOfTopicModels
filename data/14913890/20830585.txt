title: Split-single engine
id: 20830585
In internal combustion engines a split single design is a type of two stroke where two cylinders share a single combustion chamber br The first production split single engine was built in and the design was used on several motorcycles and cars until the mid s although Puch continued producing split single engines for motorcycles until During this time the design was occasionally used for engines with four or more cylinders br br br Principle of operation br br The split single uses a two stroke cycle i e where every downward stroke produces power with the following phases br br Pistons travel upwards compressing the fuel air mixture in both cylinders A spark plug ignites the mixture in the right side cylinder in the animation when the pistons are near the top of the cylinders br Pressure from the ignited air fuel mixture pushes both pistons downwards Near the bottom of the travel an exhaust port becomes exposed in the left side cylinder in the animation causing the exhaust gases to exit both cylinders At the same time the intake port is exposed on the other cylinder causing a fresh air fuel mixture which has been compressed in the crankcase by the downward movement of the pistons to be drawn into the cylinder for the next cycle br br br Characteristics br The advantage of the split single engine compared to a conventional two stroke engine is that the split single can give better exhaust scavenging while minimizing the loss of fresh fuel air charge through the exhaust port As a consequence a split single engine can deliver better economy and may run better at small throttle openings A disadvantage of the split single is that for only a marginal improvement over a single cylinder engine a split single engine is larger heavier and more expensive Since a manufacturer could produce a conventional two cylinder engine at similar cost to a split single engine a two cylinder engine is usually a more space and cost effective design Most split single engines used a single combustion chamber i e two cylinders however some engines used two combustion chambers i e four cylinders or more br Initial designs of split single engines from to used a single Y shaped or V shaped connecting rod Externally these engines appeared very similar to a conventional single cylinder two stroke engine they had one exhaust one carburetor in the usual place behind the cylinders and one spark plug But the Puch GS of und the Triumph BD of used one rod for each piston br After World War II more sophisticated internal mechanisms improved mechanical reliability and led to the carburetor being placed in front of the barrel tucked under and to the side of the exhaust An example of this arrangement was used on the Puch SGS br Early engines using a side by side layout with the carburetor in the normal place behind the cylinder had similar lubrication and pollution problems to conventional two stroke engines of the era however the revised designs after World War II addressed these problems br br br Pre World War II examples br br br Lucas br The first split single engine was the Lucas built in the UK in It used separate crankshafts connected by gears to drive separate pistons so that the engine had perfect primary balance br br br Garelli br From to Italian engineer Adalberto Garelli patented a split single engine which used a single connecting rod and long wrist pin which passed through both pistons Garelli Motorcycles was formed after World War I and produced a cc cu in split single motorcycle engine for road use and racing from to br br br Trojan br The Trojan two stroke as used from in the Trojan car in the UK was independently invented but would now be described as a split single Photos of a twin model at the London Science Museum show the internals The fore and aft layout of the cylinders means that the V shaped connecting rod has to flex slightly with each revolution Unlike the German Austrian motorcycle engines this engine was water cooled The tax horsepower regulations in the United Kingdom resulted in a lower road tax for the Trojan compared with a conventional engine of similar displacement br Trojan also made another split single engine later with the cylinders arranged in a V formation The unusual V design had two split single sets of cylinders cylinders total on one bank of the V and two scavenge blower cylinders on the other bank of the V br br br Puch br After World War I ended Austrian industry struggled to recover Italian engineer Giovanni Marcellino arrived at the main factory of Puch with the instruction to wind up operations Instead of liquidating the factory he settled in the town and designed and began production of a new split single engine which debuted in the Puch LM racing motorcycle Influenced by industrial opposed piston engines the Puch engine had asymmetric port timing and pistons arranged one behind the other instead of the side to side arrangement used by Garelli To avoid flexing of the connecting rod the small end bearing of the cooler intake piston was arranged to slide slightly fore and aft in the piston In Puch won the German Grand Prix with a supercharged split single By a four cylinder version of the Puch split cylinder design produced kW hp and was used in motorcycles Since Puch produced the GS model each piston has its own connection rod br br br Triumph Werke N rnberg br the model BD with asymmetric port timing was produced Each piston had its own connection rod br br br Motor racing br From until DKW racing motorcycles powered by split single engines dominated the Lightweight and Junior racing classes br At the and Indianapolis Leon Duray s competed with cars powered by the cylinder Duray U engine using a split cylinder design br In the Monaco Trossi Grand Prix car was built with a cylinder radial engine using a split cylinder design br br br Post World War II Examples br br br Puch br Puch s split single production and racing were restarted in and a split single engine was used in the Puch T model br The Puch SGS sold in the United States by Sears as the Allstate or Twingle used with an improved system of one connecting rod hinged on the back of the other These engines typically use the forward piston to control both intake and exhaust ports with the interesting result that the carburettor is at the front of the engine under and to the side of the exhaust The rear piston controls the transfer port from the crankcase to the cylinder Increasingly these models were fitted with an oil mixing pump fed from a reservoir incorporated in the petrol tank Some also have a twin spark plug ignition system firing an almost figure eight shaped combustion chamber The improvements tamed if not virtually eliminated the previous problem of two stroke plug fouling A total of Puch SGS motorcycles were produced between and br Puch ceased production of split single engines around br br br EMC Motorcycles br EMC Motorcycles in the United Kingdom manufactured a cc cu in split single engine that was used in the EMC After the engine also was fitted with an oil pump controlled by the throttle which dispensed two stroke oil into the fuel at a variable rate depending on throttle opening instead of having to pre mix oil in the fuel br br br Iso Autoveicoli br The Italian manufacturer began producing a cc cu in split single engine in for their Iso Moto motorcycle This engine was then used in the Iso Isetta bubble car from to br br br Triumph Werke N rnberg br Triumph Werke N rnberg TWN in Germany continued production of a split single engines for their motorcycles in but not with asymmetric port timing as the pre war BD The cc cu in TWN BDG and cc cu in TWN BDG models produced from to used a Y shaped connecting rod so the pistons are side by side making the engine little different visually from a regular two stroke Other split single models from TWN were the TWN Cornet cc with volt electrics and optionally electric starter the TWN Boss cc with carburetors and the Contessa scooter cc The bulbous shape of the exhaust of the Cornet and Boss is an anti noise two stroke TWN feature All TWN motorcycle production ceased in br In TWN showed the model Duplex at a fair This cm engine was a cylinder split single with pistons This motorcycle was not produced br br br Further development br Phase shift between pistons also allows use of a supercharger which may be effective for two stroke diesel engines br br br See also br br Opposed piston engine br List of motorcycles by type of
