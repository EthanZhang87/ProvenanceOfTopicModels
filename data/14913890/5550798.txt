The intake inlet over exhaust or IOE engine known in the US as F head is a four stroke internal combustion engine whose valvetrain comprises OHV inlet valves within the cylinder head and exhaust side valves within the engine block br IOE engines were widely used in early motorcycles initially with the inlet valve being operated by engine suction instead of a cam activated valvetrain When the suction operated inlet valves reached their limits as engine speeds increased the manufacturers modified the designs by adding a mechanical valvetrain for the inlet valve A few automobile manufacturers including Willys Rolls Royce and Humber also made IOE engines for both cars and military vehicles Rover manufactured inline four and six cylinder engines with a particularly efficient version of the IOE induction system br A few designs with the reverse system exhaust over inlet EOI have been manufactured such as the Ford Quadricycle of br br br Description br In a F head IOE engine the intake manifold and its valves are located in the cylinder head above the cylinders and are operated by rocker arms which reverse the motion of the pushrods so that the intake valves open downward into the combustion chamber The exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside or as part of the cylinders in the block The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons their faces point upwards and they are not operated by separate pushrods but by contact with a camshaft through the tappet or valve lifter and an integrated valve stem pushrod The valves were offset to one side forming what seemed to be a pocket leading to the term pocket valve being used for IOE engines An F head engine combines features from both overhead valve and flathead type engines the inlet valve operating via pushrod and rocker arm and opening downward like an overhead valve engine while the exhaust valve is offset from the cylinder and opens upward via an integrated pushrod valve stem directly actuated by the camshaft much like the valves in a flathead engine br br br Origin br The earliest IOE layouts used atmospheric inlet valves which were held closed with a weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke This worked well with low speed early engines and had the benefit of being very simple and cheap but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as engine speed increased This required stronger springs which in turn required direct mechanical action to open as the atmospheric pressure of PSI limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential meaning that a pounds kg spring is theoretical limit while for practical purposes lighter springs were typically used When the limits of this system were reached the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger springs to close them In both cases the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or valve lifter and closed by springs br br br Advantages and disadvantages br The IOE design allows the use of larger valves than a sidevalve or L head or overhead valve engine Its advantages over the sidevalve flathead also include a compact combustion chamber a well located spark plug and a cooling effect from the mixture swirl along with better intake mixture flow Disadvantages include a combustion chamber of more complex shape than that of an overhead valve engine which affects combustion rates and can create hot spots in the piston head and inferior valve location which hinders efficient scavenging Due to the added complications of rocker arms and pushrods it is also more complex and expensive to make than a sidevalve engine as well as being physically larger due to the rocker arms being placed over the cylinder head and it requires an inlet valve and ports in the cylinder head while the cylinder of a sidevalve engine is simply a closed end cylinder br br br Rover IOE engines br br Rover used a more advanced form of IOE engine It was designed by Jack Swaine in the mid late s and was in production from to the early s Unlike the conventional F head IOE this had an efficient combustion chamber designed for good combustion rather than simple manufacture The top surface of the block was machined at an angle with the piston crowns angled in a pitched roof to match At TDC the piston almost touched the angled inlet valve and provided good squish to the combustion chamber itself offset to the side by half a cylinder diameter The resultant combustion chamber shape was a near ideal hemisphere although inverted and tilted from the usual hemi head design The spark plug was centrally mounted and this together with the turbulence generated by the squish provided a short flame path The thinness of the gas layer between piston and inlet valve was so confined as to reduce the risk of detonation on poor fuel one factor that kept it in service with Land Rover for so long During the late s and early s when the only petrol available was low octane pool petrol it also allowed Rover to run higher compression ratios than many competitors with the more usual side or overhead valve designs br The unusual combustion chamber arrangement with its angled valves also led to an unusual valve train The block mounted camshaft operates small wedge shaped rockers one for each valve In early models the camshaft acts on a simple pad on the rocker but for later models this pad was replaced by a roller follower The exhaust rockers act directly on the valves whilst the inlet rockers act on pushrods running up to a second set of longer flat rockers operating the inlet valves The Rover engine like many s and earlier British designs was a small bore long stroke undersquare engine to keep the RAC tax horsepower rating as low as possible thus keeping the road tax as low as possible The IOE layout enabled Rover to use larger valves than would normally be possible in a small bore engine allowing better breathing and better performance br The Rover IOE engine family encompassed straight and litres and straight and litres engines and powered much of the company s post war range in the form of the P P and P models Adapted versions of the and IOE engines were used in early version of the Land Rover as well Power outputs ranged from bhp Land Rover to bhp P litre MkII III The cylinder IOE engine had a particularly long career After being used in Rover P saloon cars it was added to long wheelbase Land Rover models from in the A Forward Control models then in in the bonneted and remained an optional fitment until when it was replaced by the Rover V br br br Similar Packard cylinder head br The shape of the combustion chamber as an inverted hemi head along with the angled cylinder head joint and pitched roof piston crowns had earlier been used in the Van Ranst designed Packard V engine although in this case the valves were both in the block as side valves and the spark plug was poorly placed at the extremity of the combustion chamber br br br Other users br Motorcycles br The IOE valvetrain layout was used extensively in early American motorcycles mainly based on a French design by De Dion Bouton Harley Davidson used IOE engines with atmospheric inlet valves until and with mechanically driven inlet valves from to Indian used IOE valvetrains on all of their four cylinder bikes except those built in and Other American motorcycle manufacturers that used IOE engines included Excelsior Henderson and Ace br br Automobiles br Hudson used an IOE inline four engine in its Essex line of cars from to and an IOE straight six engine in its Hudson line of cars from to br In Europe in the same period Humber Limited of Coventry England produced a full range of cars using IOE engines these were however phased out at the end of the s in favour of models using cheaper L head engines shared with Hillman br Post WW Willys and its successor Kaiser Jeep used variants of the Willys Hurricane engine from to br Rolls Royce used an IOE straight six engine originally designed immediately prior to WW in their post war Silver Wraith From this engine Rolls Royce derived the B series engines for British Army combat vehicles which were produced in four six and eight cylinder versions the B B and B by Rolls Royce and in the case of the B used in the Austin Champ by Morris Motors for military vehicles fire appliances and even buses A more advanced shorter stroke passenger car development the FB engine a straight six IOE engine displacing cc and producing a claimed was used by BMC in the Vanden Plas Princess litre R saloon car Over of these cars were made br br br Exhaust over intake EOI br Some engines have been made with the reverse configuration having the exhaust valve located in the cylinder head and the intake valve in the block The ABC Skootamota began production with an engine of this configuration but this was changed to an overhead valve engine before production ended br In and the Indian Four had the valve positions reversed with the exhaust valve in the head and the inlet valve in the block In theory this would improve fuel vaporization and the engine was actually more powerful However the new system made the cylinder head very hot The exhaust valve linkage required frequent adjustment The design returned to the original IOE configuration in br br br See also br
