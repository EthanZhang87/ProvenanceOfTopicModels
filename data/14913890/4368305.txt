title: Timeline of heat engine technology
id: 4368305
This timeline of heat engine technology describes how heat engines have been known since antiquity but have been made into increasingly useful devices since the th century as a better understanding of the processes involved was gained A heat engine is any system that converts heat to mechanical energy which can then be used to do mechanical work They continue to be developed today br In engineering and thermodynamics a heat engine performs the conversion of heat energy to mechanical work by exploiting the temperature gradient between a hot source and a cold sink Heat is transferred to the sink from the source and in this process some of the heat is converted into work br A heat pump is a heat engine run in reverse Work is used to create a heat differential The timeline includes devices classed as both engines and pumps as well as identifying significant leaps in human understanding br br br Pre th century br Prehistory The fire piston used by tribes in southeast Asia and the Pacific
