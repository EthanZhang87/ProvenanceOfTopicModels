title: Radial engine
id: 146924
The radial engine is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders radiate outward from a central crankcase like the spokes of a wheel It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front and is called a star engine in some other languages br The radial configuration was commonly used for aircraft engines before gas turbine engines became predominant br br br Engine operation br br Since the axes of the cylinders are coplanar the connecting rods cannot all be directly attached to the crankshaft unless mechanically complex forked connecting rods are used none of which have been successful Instead the pistons are connected to the crankshaft with a master and articulating rod assembly One piston the uppermost one in the animation has a master rod with a direct attachment to the crankshaft The remaining pistons pin their connecting rods attachments to rings around the edge of the master rod Extra rows of radial cylinders can be added in order to increase the capacity of the engine without adding to its diameter br Four stroke radials have an odd number of cylinders per row so that a consistent every other piston firing order can be maintained providing smooth operation For example on a five cylinder engine the firing order is and back to cylinder Moreover this always leaves a one piston gap between the piston on its combustion stroke and the piston on compression The active stroke directly helps compress the next cylinder to fire making the motion more uniform If an even number of cylinders were used an equally timed firing cycle would not be feasible br As with most four strokes the crankshaft takes two revolutions to complete the four strokes of each piston intake compression combustion exhaust The camshaft ring is geared to spin slower and in the opposite direction to the crankshaft Its cam lobes are placed in two rows one for the intake valves and one for the exhaust valves The radial engine normally uses fewer cam lobes than other types For example in the engine in the animated illustration four cam lobes serve all valves across the five cylinders whereas would be required for a typical inline engine with the same number of cylinders and valves br Most radial engines use overhead poppet valves driven by pushrods and lifters on a cam plate which is concentric with the crankshaft with a few smaller radials like the Kinner B and Russian Shvetsov M using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder A few engines use sleeve valves such as the cylinder Bristol Hercules and the cylinder Bristol Centaurus which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances br br br History br br br Aircraft br br C M Manly constructed a water cooled five cylinder radial engine in a conversion of one of Stephen Balzer s rotary engines for Langley s Aerodrome aircraft Manly s engine produced hp kW at rpm br In Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles to build the world s first air cooled radial engine a three cylinder engine which he used as the basis for a more powerful five cylinder model in This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free flight hops br Another early radial engine was the three cylinder Anzani originally built as a W fan configuration one of which powered Louis Bl riot s Bl riot XI across the English Channel Before Alessandro Anzani had developed radial engines ranging from cylinders spaced apart early enough to have been used on a few French built examples of the famous Bl riot XI from the original Bl riot factory to a massive cylinder engine of hp kW with its cylinders arranged in four rows of five cylinders apiece br Most radial engines are air cooled but one of the most successful of the early radial engines and the earliest stationary design produced for World War I combat aircraft was the Salmson Z series of nine cylinder water cooled radial engines that were produced in large numbers Georges Canton and Pierre Unn patented the original engine design in offering it to the Salmson company the engine was often known as the Canton Unn br From to the radial engine was overshadowed by its close relative the rotary engine which differed from the so called stationary radial in that the crankcase and cylinders revolved with the propeller It was similar in concept to the later radial the main difference being that the propeller was bolted to the engine and the crankshaft to the airframe The problem of the cooling of the cylinders a major factor with the early stationary radials was alleviated by the engine generating its own cooling airflow br In World War I many French and other Allied aircraft flew with Gnome Le Rh ne Clerget and Bentley rotary engines the ultimate examples of which reached hp kW although none of those over hp kW were successful By rotary engine development was lagging behind new inline and V type engines which by were producing as much as hp kW and were powering almost all of the new French and British combat aircraft br Most German aircraft of the time used water cooled inline cylinder engines Motorenfabrik Oberursel made licensed copies of the Gnome and Le Rh ne rotary powerplants and Siemens Halske built their own designs including the Siemens Halske Sh III eleven cylinder rotary engine which was unusual for the period in being geared through a bevel geartrain in the rear end of the crankcase without the crankshaft being firmly mounted to the aircraft s airframe so that the engine s internal working components fully internal crankshaft floating in its crankcase bearings with its conrods and pistons were spun in the opposing direction to the crankcase and cylinders which still rotated as the propeller itself did since it was still firmly fastened to the crankcase s frontside as with regular umlaufmotor German rotaries br By the end of the war the rotary engine had reached the limits of the design particularly in regard to the amount of fuel and air that could be drawn into the cylinders through the hollow crankshaft while advances in both metallurgy and cylinder cooling finally allowed stationary radial engines to supersede rotary engines In the early s Le Rh ne converted a number of their rotary engines into stationary radial engines br By the potential advantages of air cooled radials over the water cooled inline engine and air cooled rotary engine that had powered World War I aircraft were appreciated but were unrealized British designers had produced the ABC Dragonfly radial in but were unable to resolve the cooling problems and it was not until the s that Bristol and Armstrong Siddeley produced reliable air cooled radials such as the Bristol Jupiter and the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar br In the United States the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA noted in that air cooled radials could offer an increase in power to weight ratio and reliability by the U S Navy had announced it would only order aircraft fitted with air cooled radials and other naval air arms followed suit Charles Lawrance s J engine was developed in with Navy funding and using aluminum cylinders with steel liners ran for an unprecedented hours at a time when hours endurance was normal At the urging of the Army and Navy the Wright Aeronautical Corporation bought Lawrance s company and subsequent engines were built under the Wright name The radial engines gave confidence to Navy pilots performing long range overwater flights br Wright s hp kW J Whirlwind radial engine of was widely claimed as the first truly reliable aircraft engine Wright employed Giuseppe Mario Bellanca to design an aircraft to showcase it and the result was the Wright Bellanca WB which first flew later that year The J was used on many advanced aircraft of the day including Charles Lindbergh s Spirit of St Louis in which he made the first solo trans Atlantic flight br In the American Pratt Whitney company was founded competing with Wright s radial engines Pratt Whitney s initial offering the R Wasp was test run later that year beginning a line of engines over the next years that included the cylinder twin row Pratt Whitney R Twin Wasp More Twin Wasps were produced than any other aviation piston engine in the history of aviation nearly were built br br In the United Kingdom the Bristol Aeroplane Company was concentrating on developing radials such as the Jupiter Mercury and sleeve valve Hercules radials Germany Japan and the Soviet Union started with building licensed versions of the Armstrong Siddeley Bristol Wright or Pratt Whitney radials before producing their own improved versions France continued its development of various rotary engines but also produced engines derived from Bristol designs especially the Jupiter br Although other piston configurations and turboprops have taken over in modern propeller driven aircraft Rare Bear which is a Grumman F F Bearcat equipped with a Wright R Duplex Cyclone radial engine is still the fastest piston powered aircraft br of the American twin row cylinder Pratt Whitney R Double Wasp with a displacement of in L and between and hp kW powered the American single engine Vought F U Corsair Grumman F F Hellcat Republic P Thunderbolt twin engine Martin B Marauder Douglas A Invader Northrop P Black Widow etc The same firm s aforementioned smaller displacement at litres Twin Wasp cylinder twin row radial was used as the main engine design for the B Liberator PBY Catalina and Douglas C each design being among the production leaders in all time production numbers for each type of airframe design br The American Wright Cyclone series twin row radials powered American warplanes the nearly litre displacement cylinder Twin Cyclone powered the single engine Grumman TBF Avenger twin engine North American B Mitchell and some versions of the Douglas A Havoc with the massive twin row nearly litre displacement cylinder Duplex Cyclone powering the four engine Boeing B Superfortress and others br The Soviet Shvetsov OKB design bureau was the sole source of design for all of the Soviet government factory produced radial engines used in its World War II aircraft starting with the Shvetsov M itself based on the American Wright Cyclone s design and going on to design the litre displacement Shvetsov ASh fourteen cylinder radial for fighters and the massive litre displacement Shvetsov ASh eighteen cylinder radial in the smallest displacement radial design from the Shvetsov OKB during the war was the indigenously designed litre displacement Shvetsov M five cylinder radial br Over of the German litre displacement cylinder two row BMW with between and PS hp or kW powered the German single seat single engine Focke Wulf Fw W rger and twin engine Junkers Ju br In Japan most airplanes were powered by air cooled radial engines like the cylinder Mitsubishi Zuisei units e g Kawasaki Ki Mitsubishi Kinsei units e g Aichi D A Mitsubishi Kasei units e g Kawanishi H K Nakajima Sakae units e g Mitsubishi A M and Nakajima Ki and cylinder Nakajima Homare units e g Nakajima Ki The Kawasaki Ki and Yokosuka D Y were rare examples of Japanese liquid cooled inline engine aircraft at that time but later they were also redesigned to fit radial engines as the Kawasaki Ki and Yokosuka D Y br In Britain Bristol produced both sleeve valved and conventional poppet valved radials of the sleeve valved designs more than Hercules engines powered the Vickers Wellington Short Stirling Handley Page Halifax and some versions of the Avro Lancaster over of the pioneering sleeve valved Bristol Perseus were used in various types and more than of the largest displacement production British radial from the Bristol firm to use sleeve valving the Bristol Centaurus were used to power the Hawker Tempest II and Sea Fury The same firm s poppet valved radials included around of Bristol Pegasus used in the Short Sunderland Handley Page Hampden and Fairey Swordfish and over examples of the firm s origin nine cylinder Mercury were used to power the Westland Lysander Bristol Blenheim and Blackburn Skua br br br Tanks br In the years leading up to World War II as the need for armored vehicles was realized designers were faced with the problem of how to power the vehicles and turned to using aircraft engines among them radial types The radial aircraft engines provided greater power to weight ratios and were more reliable than conventional inline vehicle engines available at the time This reliance had a downside though if the engines were mounted vertically as in the M Lee and M Sherman their comparatively large diameter gave the tank a higher silhouette than designs using inline engines br The Continental R a cylinder radial aero engine which first flew in became a widely used tank powerplant being installed in the M Combat Car M Light Tank M Stuart M Lee and LVT Water Buffalo br The Guiberson T a cylinder radial diesel aero engine was used in the M A E while the Continental R saw service in the M Sherman M Priest M Hellcat tank destroyer and the M self propelled howitzer br br br Modern radials br br A number of companies continue to build radials today Vedeneyev produces the M P radial of hp kW as used on Yakovlev and Sukhoi aerobatic aircraft The M P is also used by builders of homebuilt aircraft such as the Culp Special and Culp Sopwith Pup Pitts S Monster and the Murphy Moose hp kW cylinder and hp kW cylinder engines are available from Australia s Rotec Aerosport HCI Aviation offers the R cylinder hp kW and R cylinder hp kW available ready to fly and as a build it yourself kit Verner Motor of the Czech Republic builds several radial engines ranging in power from to hp to kW Miniature radial engines for model airplanes are available from O S Engines Saito Seisakusho of Japan and Shijiazhuang of China and Evolution designed by Wolfgang Seidel of Germany and made in India and Technopower in the US br br br Comparison with inline engines br br Liquid cooling systems are generally more vulnerable to battle damage Even minor shrapnel damage can easily result in a loss of coolant and consequent engine overheating while an air cooled radial engine may be largely unaffected by minor damage Radials have shorter and stiffer crankshafts a single bank radial engine needing only two crankshaft bearings as opposed to the seven required for a liquid cooled six cylinder inline engine of similar stiffness br While a single bank radial permits all cylinders to be cooled equally the same is not true for multi row engines where the rear cylinders can be affected by the heat coming off the front row and air flow being masked br A potential disadvantage of radial engines is that having the cylinders exposed to the airflow increases drag considerably The answer was the addition of specially designed cowlings with baffles to force the air between the cylinders The first effective drag reducing cowling that didn t impair engine cooling was the British Townend ring or drag ring which formed a narrow band around the engine covering the cylinder heads reducing drag The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics studied the problem developing the NACA cowling which further reduced drag and improved cooling Nearly all aircraft radial engines since have used NACA type cowlings br While inline liquid cooled engines continued to be common in new designs until late in World War II radial engines dominated afterwards until overtaken by jet engines with the late war Hawker Sea Fury and Grumman F F Bearcat two of the fastest production piston engined aircraft ever built using radial engines br br br Hydrolock br br Whenever a radial engine remains shut down for more than a few minutes oil or fuel may drain into the combustion chambers of the lower cylinders or accumulate in the lower intake pipes ready to be drawn into the cylinders when the engine starts As the piston approaches top dead center TDC of the compression stroke this liquid being incompressible stops piston movement Starting or attempting to start the engine in such condition may result in a bent or broken connecting rod br br br Other types of radial engine br br br Multi row radials br br Originally radial engines had one row of cylinders but as engine sizes increased it became necessary to add extra rows The first radial configuration engine known to use a twin row design was the hp Gn me Double Lambda rotary engine of designed as a cylinder twin row version of the firm s hp Lambda single row seven cylinder rotary however reliability and cooling problems limited its success br Two row designs began to appear in large numbers during the s when aircraft size and weight grew to the point where single row engines of the required power were simply too large to be practical Two row designs often had cooling problems with the rear bank of cylinders but a variety of baffles and fins were introduced that largely eliminated these problems The downside was a relatively large frontal area that had to be left open to provide enough airflow which increased drag This led to significant arguments in the industry in the late s about the possibility of using radials for high speed aircraft like modern fighters br The solution was introduced with the BMW cylinder twin row radial Kurt Tank designed a new cooling system for this engine that used a high speed fan to blow compressed air into channels that carry air to the middle of the banks where a series of baffles directed the air over all of the cylinders This allowed the cowling to be tightly fitted around the engine reducing drag while still providing after a number of experiments and modifications enough cooling air to the rear This basic concept was soon copied by many other manufacturers and many late WWII aircraft returned to the radial design as newer and much larger designs began to be introduced Examples include the Bristol Centaurus in the Hawker Sea Fury and the Shvetsov ASh in the Lavochkin La br For even greater power adding further rows was not considered viable due to the difficulty of providing the required airflow to the rear banks Larger engines were designed mostly using water cooling although this greatly increased complexity and eliminated some of the advantages of the radial air cooled design One example of this concept is the BMW which never entered service br A major study into the airflow around radials using wind tunnels and other systems was carried out in the US and demonstrated that ample airflow was available with careful design This led to the R which has cylinders arranged in a row corncob configuration The R saw service on large American aircraft in the post World War II period The US and Soviet Union continued experiments with larger radials but the UK abandoned such designs in favour of newer versions of the Centaurus and rapid movement to the use of turboprops such as the Armstrong Siddeley Python and Bristol Proteus which easily produced more power than radials without the weight or complexity br Large radials continued to be built for other uses although they are no longer common An example is the ton Zvezda M diesel engine with cylinders in rows of displacing litres cu in and producing hp kW Three of these were used on the fast Osa class missile boats Another one was the Lycoming XR which was the largest piston aircraft engine ever built in the United States with cylinders totaling about in L of displacement and a power output of horsepower kilowatts br br br Diesel radials br br While most radial engines have been produced for gasoline there have been diesel radial engines Two major advantages favour diesel engines lower fuel consumption and reduced fire risk br br Packard br Packard designed and built a cylinder cubic inch litre displacement diesel radial aircraft engine the horsepower kW DR in On May a DR powered Bellanca CH with gallons of fuel piloted by Walter Edwin Lees and Frederick Brossy set a record for staying aloft for hours and minutes without being refueled This record stood for years until broken by the Rutan Voyager br br Bristol br The experimental Bristol Phoenix of was successfully flight tested in a Westland Wapiti and set altitude records in that lasted until World War II br br Clerget br In the French company Clerget developed the D a cylinder two stroke diesel radial engine After a series of improvements in the F model produced hp kW at rpm cruise power with a power to weight ratio near that of contemporary gasoline engines and a specific fuel consumption of roughly that for an equivalent gasoline engine During WWII the research continued but no mass production occurred because of the Nazi occupation By the engine had grown to produce over hp kW with a turbocharger After the war the Clerget company was integrated in the SNECMA company and had plans for a cylinder diesel engine of hp kW but in the company abandoned piston engine development in favour of the emerging turbine engines br br Nordberg br The Nordberg Manufacturing Company of the United States developed and produced a series of large two stroke radial diesel engines from the late s for electrical production primarily at aluminum smelters and for pumping water They differed from most radials in that they had an even number of cylinders in a single bank or row and an unusual double master connecting rod Variants were built that could be run on either diesel oil or gasoline or mixtures of both A number of powerhouse installations utilising large numbers of these engines were made in the U S br br EMD br Electro Motive Diesel EMD built the pancake engines and for marine use br br Zoche br Zoche aero diesels are a prototype radial design that have an even number of cylinders either four or eight but this is not problematic because they are two stroke engines with twice the number of power strokes as a four stroke engine per crankshaft rotation br br br Compressed air radial engines br A number of radial motors operating on compressed air have been designed mostly for use in model airplanes and in gas compressors br br br Model radial engines br A number of multi cylinder stroke model engines have been commercially available in a radial configuration beginning with the Japanese O S Max firm s FR five cylinder cu in cm displacement Sirius radial in The American Technopower firm had made smaller displacement five and seven cylinder model radial engines as early as but the OS firm s engine was the first mass produced radial engine design in aeromodelling history The rival Saito Seisakusho firm in Japan has since produced a similarly sized five cylinder radial four stroke model engine of their own as a direct rival to the OS design with Saito also creating a series of three cylinder methanol and gasoline fueled model radial engines ranging from cu in cm to cu in cm in displacement also all now available in spark ignition format up to cm displacement for use with gasoline The German Seidel firm formerly made both seven and nine cylinder large starting at cm displacement radio control model radial engines mostly for glow plug ignition with an experimental fourteen cylinder twin row radial being tried out the American Evolution firm now sells the Seidel designed radials with their manufacturing being done in India br br br See also br List of aircraft engines br Swashplate engine br
