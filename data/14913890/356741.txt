title: Opposed-piston engine
id: 356741
An opposed piston engine is a piston engine in which each cylinder has a piston at both ends and no cylinder head Petrol and diesel opposed piston engines have been used mostly in large scale applications such as ships military tanks and factories Current manufacturers of opposed piston engines include Cummins Achates Power and Fairbanks Morse Defense FMDefense br br br Design br br Compared to contemporary two stroke engines which used a conventional design of one piston per cylinder the advantages of the opposed piston engine have been recognized as br br Eliminating the cylinder head and valve train which reduces weight complexity cost heat loss and friction loss of the engine br Creating a uniflow scavenged movement of gas through the combustion chamber which avoided the drawbacks associated with the contemporary crossflow scavenged designs however later advancements have provided methods for achieving uniflow scavenging in conventional piston engine designs br A reduced height of the engine br The main drawback was that the power from the two opposing pistons have to be geared together This added weight and complexity when compared to conventional piston engines which use a single crankshaft as the power output br The most common layout was two crankshafts with the crankshafts geared together in either the same direction or opposing directions The Koreyvo Jumo and Napier Deltic engines used one piston per cylinder to expose an intake port and the other to expose an exhaust port Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard This layout gives superior scavenging as gas flow through the cylinder is axial rather than radial and simplifies design of the piston crowns In the Jumo and its variants the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons In designs using multiple cylinder banks each big end bearing serves one inlet and one exhaust piston using a forked connecting rod for the exhaust piston br br br History br br br s to s br br One of the first opposed piston engines was the Atkinson differential engine which has a power stroke on every rotation of the crankshaft compared with every second rotation for the contemporary Otto cycle engine but it was not a commercial success br In an Oechelh user two stroke opposed piston engine producing hp kW was installed at the Hoerde ironworks This design of engine was also produced under licence by manufacturers including Deutsche Kraftgas Gesellschaft in Germany and William Beardmore Sons in the United Kingdom br In the Kansas City Lightning Balanced Gas and Gasoline Engines were gasoline engines producing hp kW br An early opposed piston car engine was produced by the French company Gobron Brilli around In April a Gobron Brilli car powered by the opposed piston engine was the first car ever to exceed km h with a World s Record Speed of km h mph On July the Gobron Brilli car became the first to exceed mph km h for the flying kilometre The engine used a single crankshaft at one end of the cylinders and a crosshead for the opposing piston br Another early opposed piston car engine was in the Scottish Arrol Johnston car which appears to have been first installed in their hp buckboard c The engine was described and illustrated in some detail in the account of their hp car exhibited at the Olympia Motor Show The engine was a four stroke with two cylinders with opposed pistons in each with the crankshaft underneath and the pistons connected by lever arms to the two throw crankshaft br The first diesel engine with opposed pistons was a prototype built at Kolomna Locomotive Works in Russia The designer Raymond A Koreyvo patented the engine in France on November and displayed the engine at international exhibitions but it did not reach production The Kolomna design used a typical layout of two crankshafts connected by gearing br In the Simpson s Balanced Two Stroke motorcycle engine was another opposed piston engine using a single crankshaft beneath the centre of the cylinders with both pistons connected by levers This engine was a crankcase compression design with one piston used to uncover the transfer port and the other to open the exhaust port The advantage of this design was to avoid the deflector crowns for pistons used by most two stroke engines at that time br Doxford Engine Works in the United Kingdom built large opposed piston engines for marine use with the first Doxford engine being installed in a ship in This diesel engine used a single crankshaft at one end of the cylinders and a crosshead for the opposing piston After World War I these engines were produced in a number of models such as the P and J series with outputs as high as hp kW Production of Doxford engines in the UK ceased in br Later opposed piston diesel engines include the Junkers Jumo aircraft engine built in Germany which had two crankshafts not using a design similar to the Gobron Brilli engines br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br s to present br The Fairbanks Morse diesel engine originally designed in Germany in the s was used in U S submarines in the s and s and in boats from the s present It was also used in locomotives from br The latest November version of the Fairbanks Morse is known as the FM D Diesel and Dual Fuel This two stroke opposed piston engine retains the same extra heavy duty design and has a rated in service lifespan of more than years but now the optional capability of burning dual fuels gaseous and liquid fuels with automatic switchover to full diesel if the gas supply runs out is available br The Commer TS three cylinder diesel truck engines released in have a single crankshaft beneath the centre of the cylinders with both pistons connected by levers br br Also released in was the Napier Deltic engine for military boats It uses three crankshafts one at each corner to form the three banks of double ended cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle The Deltic engine was used in British Rail Class and British Rail Class locomotives and to power fast patrol boats and Royal Navy mine sweepers Beginning in Gibbs invited Mack Trucks to take part in designing FDNY s super pumper and its companion tender DeLaval Turbine was commissioned to design a multistage centrifugal pump with a Napier Deltic T C diesel to power the pumps br In the Leyland L L cu in six cylinder diesel engine was introduced The L was produced in the United Kingdom for use in the Chieftain tank br The Soviet T tank produced from also used an opposed piston diesel engine TD developed by Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv After the dissolution of the Soviet Union Malyshev Factory continued development and production of opposed piston engines for armored vehicles such as the three cylinder TD used in BTR Butsefal various upgrades of the TD and the six cylinder TD for T BM BM Oplot etc br In Achates Power published a technical paper citing a fuel economy improvement when its engine was benchmarked against a next generation diesel engine equipped with advanced technologies br Volvo filed for a patent in br The Diesel Air Dair is a two cylinder hp kW diesel aircraft engine designed and produced by Diesel Air Ltd of Olney Buckinghamshire for use in airships home built kitplanes and light aircraft br In July Cummins was awarded an M contract by the United States Army to complete the development of the Advanced Combat Engine ACE a modular and scalable diesel engine solution that uses opposed piston technology br br br Free piston engine br br A variation of the opposed piston design is the free piston engine which was first patented in Free piston engines have no crankshaft and the pistons are returned after each firing stroke by compression and expansion of air in a separate cylinder Early applications were for use as an air compressor or as a gas generator for a gas turbine br br br See also br Junk head br Michel engine br Split single engine br br br
