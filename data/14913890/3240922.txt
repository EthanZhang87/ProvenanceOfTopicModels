title: Axial engine
id: 3240922
An axial engine sometimes known as a barrel engine or Z crank engine is a type of reciprocating engine with pistons arranged around an output shaft with their axes parallel to the shaft Barrel refers to the cylindrical shape of the cylinder group result of the pistons being spaced evenly around the central crankshaft and aligned parallel to the crankshaft axis whilst the Z crank alludes to the shape of the crankshaft br As a cam engine an axial engine can use either a swashplate or a wobble plate to translate the piston motion to rotation A wobble plate is similar to a swashplate in that the pistons press down on the plate in sequence imparting a lateral moment that is translated into rotary motion This motion can be simulated by placing a compact disc on a ball bearing at its centre and pressing down at progressive places around its circumference The difference is that while a wobble plate nutates a swash plate rotates An alternative design the Rand cam engine replaces the plate with one or more sinusoidal cam surfaces Vanes mounted parallel to a shaft mounted inside a cylindrical barrel that are free to slide up and down ride the sinuous cam the segments formed by rotor stator walls and vanes constituting combustion chambers In effect these spaces serving the same purpose as the cylinders of an axial engine and the sinuous cam surface acts as the face of the pistons In other respect this form follows the normal cycles of internal combustion but with burning gas directly imparting a force on the cam surface translated into a rotational force by timing one or more detonations This design eliminates the multiple reciprocal pistons ball joints and swash plate of a conventional barrel engine but crucially depends on effective sealing provided by sliding and rotating surfaces br The key advantage of the axial design is that the cylinders are arranged in parallel around the output crank shaft in contrast to radial and inline engines both types having cylinders at right angles to the shaft As a result it is a very compact cylindrical engine allowing variation in compression ratio of the engine while running In a swashplate engine the piston rods stay parallel with the shaft and piston side forces that cause excessive wear can be eliminated almost completely The small end bearing of a traditional connecting rod one of the most problematic bearings in a traditional engine is eliminated br While axial engines are challenging to make practicable at typical engine operating speeds some cam engines have been tested that offer extremely compact size approximating to a six inch mm cube yet producing approximately forty horsepower at c rpm useful for light aerial applications The attraction of lightweight and mechanically simple far fewer major moving parts in the form of a rotor plus twelve axial vanes forming twenty four combustion chambers engines even with a finite working life have obvious application for small unmanned aircraft br br br History br br br Macomber br br In the Macomber Rotary Engine Company of Los Angeles marketed one of the first axial internal combustion engines manufactured by the Avis Engine Company of Allston Massachusetts A four stroke air cooled unit it had seven cylinders and a variable compression ratio altered by changing the wobble plate angle and hence the length of piston stroke It was called a rotary engine because the entire engine rotated apart from the end casings br Ignition was supplied by a Bosch magneto directly driven from the cam gears The high voltage current was then taken to a fixed electrode on the front bearing case from which the sparks would jump to the spark plugs in the cylinder heads as they passed within inch mm from it According to Macomber s literature it was guaranteed not to overheat br The engine was claimed to be able to run at to rpm At the normal speed of rpm it reportedly developed hp It weighed pounds kg and it was inches mm long by inches mm in diameter br Pioneer aviator Charles Francis Walsh flew an aircraft powered by a Macomber engine in May the Walsh Silver Dart br br br Statax br In Statax Motor of Z rich Switzerland introduced a swashplate engine design Only a single prototype was produced which is currently held in the Science Museum London In the company moved to London to become the Statax Engine Company and planned on introducing a series of rotary engines a cylinder of hp a cylinder of hp a cylinder of hp and a cylinder of hp br It appears only the hp design was ever produced which was installed in a Caudron G II for the British Aerial Derby but was withdrawn before the flight Hansen introduced an all aluminum version of this design in but it is not clear if they produced it in any quantity Much improved versions were introduced by Statax s German division in producing hp in a new sleeve valve version known as the B Greenwood and Raymond of San Francisco acquired the patent rights for the US Canada and Japan and planned a cylinder of hp and a cylinder of hp br br br Michell br In Anthony Michell obtained patents for his swashplate engine design Its unique feature was the means of transferring the load from the pistons to the swashplate achieved using tilting slipper pads sliding on a film of oil Another innovation by Michell was his mathematical analysis of the mechanical design including the mass and motion of the components so that his engines were in perfect dynamic balance at all speeds br In Michell established the Crankless Engines Company in Fitzroy Australia and produced working prototypes of pumps compressors car engines and aero engines all based on the same basic design br Engine designer Phil Irving worked for the Crankless Engine Company before his time at HRD br A number of companies obtained a manufacturing license for Michell s design The most successful of these was the British company Waller and Son who produced gas boosters br The largest Michell crankless engine was the XB a diesel aircraft engine built for the United States Navy Consisting of pistons it was rated at horsepower and weighed pounds br br br John O Almen br Experimental barrel engines for aircraft use were built and tested by American John O Almen of Seattle Washington in the early s and by the mid s the water cooled Almen A cylinders two groups of nine each horizontally opposed had passed its United States Army Air Corps acceptance tests However it never entered production reportedly due to limited funds and the Air Corps growing emphasis on air cooled radial engines The A had much smaller frontal area than water cooled engines of comparable power output and thereby offered better streamlining possibilities It was rated at hp kW and weighed only pounds kg thus giving a power weight ratio of better than a considerable design achievement at the time br br br Heraclio Alfaro br Heraclio Alfaro Fournier was a Spanish aviator who was knighted at the age of by King Alfonso XIII of Spain for designing building and flying Spain s first airplane He developed a barrel engine for aircraft use which was later produced by the Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company as the Alfaro It was a perfect example of the put in everything design as it included a sleeve valve system based on a rotating cylinder head a design that never entered production on any engine It was later developed further for use in the Doman helicopter by Stephen duPont son of the president of the Indian Motorcycle Company who had been one of Alfaro s students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology br br br Bristol br The Bristol Axial Engine of the mid s was designed by Charles Benjamin Redrup for the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company it was a litre cylinder wobble plate type engine It was originally conceived as a power unit for buses possibly because its compact format would allow it to be installed beneath the vehicle s floor The engine had a single rotary valve to control induction and exhaust Several variants were used in Bristol buses during the late s the engine going through several versions from RR to RR which had a power output of hp at rpm Development was halted in following a change of management at the Bristol company br br br Wooler br Perhaps the most refined of the designs was the British Wooler wobble plate engine of This cylinder engine was designed by John Wooler better known as a motorcycle engine designer for aircraft use It was similar to the Bristol axial engine but had two wobble plates driven by opposed pistons in cylinders The engine is often incorrectly referred to as a swashplate engine A single example is preserved in the Aeroplane Gallery of the Science Museum London br br br H L F Trebert br Some small barrel engines were produced by the H L F Trebert Engine Works of Rochester New York for marine usage br br br Present day br br br Dyna Cam br The Dyna Cam engine originally came from a design by the Blazer brothers two American engineers in the brass era automotive industry who worked for Studebaker in They sold the rights to Karl Herrmann Studebaker s head of engineering who developed the concept over many years eventually taking out US patent in It has double ended pistons working in cylinders and its combustion chambers are fired every revolution of the drive shaft The pistons drive a sine shaped cam as opposed to a swashplate or wobble plate hence its name br In at the age of Herrmann sold the rights to one of his employees Edward Palmer who set up the Dyna Cam Engine Corp along with son Dennis Edward s son Dennis and daughter Pat then helped get the engine installed in a Piper Arrow airplane The engine was flown for about hours from through Their longest life engine ran for nearly hours before overhaul Dyna Cam opened a research and development facility about and won many various awards from NASA the United States Navy the United States Marine Corps California Energy Commission Air Quality Management District and Los Angeles Regional Technology Alliance for different variations of the same Dyna Cam engine About prototype engines were built by the Herrmann Group and another built by the Dyna Cam Group since they acquired the engine and opened their shop A new patent was granted to Dennis Palmer and Edward Palmer first in and then several more around to Dennis Palmer In the assets of the Dyna Cam Engine Corporation were acquired by Aero Marine Corporation who changed their name to Axial Vector Engine Corporation Axial Vector then totally re designed the cam engine Axial Vector s new engine like many of the others on this list suffers from the put in everything problem including piezoelectric valves and ignition ceramic cylinder liners with no piston rings and a variety of other advanced features It has little similarity to the original Herrmann and Dyna Cam engines since the Dyna Cam engine used conventional valves piston rings accessories had no unproven ceramic materials and actually flew in an aircraft and also powered a foot m Eliminator ski boat for over four years br br br Covaxe br United Kingdom company Covaxe Limited known as FairDiesel Limited up until is designing two stroke Diesel opposed piston barrel engines that use non sinusoidal cams for industrial applications and aviation use Their engine designs range from a cylinder mm bore to cylinder mm bore br br br Duke Engines br New Zealand company Duke Engines started in has created several different engines and installed one in a car in The engine runs a cylinder litre stroke internal combustion engine platform with its unique axial arrangement which is in its third generation Due to a valveless design Duke engine loses less energy between the power strokes Current prototypes of Duke s engines claim to match characteristics of conventional internal combustion engines but with fewer parts and lighter This goes in the direction of developing a more efficient engine During development the Duke has been tested at MAHLE Powertrain in the United Kingdom and in the United States test results show that it has multi fuel capabilities The Duke engine s benefits of lightness and compactness should render this design ideal for motorcycles engines and these benefits might make the powerplant suitable for light aircraft as well There is little data on whether the Duke engine is smooth the mainshaft has a large counterweight attached br br br INNengine br A classical Spanish built design parallel pistons working in opposition sine wave swashplate in with two versions a car sized with liquid cooling as prototype and an air cooled four cylinder cc HP kg unit aimed at drones and big aeromodels in pre production stage br br br Cylindrical Energy Module br The Cylindrical Energy Module CEM is a sine wave swashplate engine that can also be used as a standalone pump powered by an external source The rotating swashplate rotor assembly is moved back and forth with the help of piston drive pins which follow a stationary sinusoidal cam track that encircles the rotor assembly br br br Devize Motors br A United States company Devize Motors is currently developing a new engine utilizing opposed pistons br br br Applications br The most well known application is in torpedoes where the cylindrical shape is desirable The modern Mark torpedo is powered by a hp swashplate engine geared to a pump jet propulsor It is fueled by Otto fuel II a monopropellant that requires no oxygen supply and can propel the torpedo at up to knots km h mph br Other applications include pneumatic and hydraulic motors hydrostatic transmissions such as Honda s Hondamatic CVT and air conditioner pumps Also some Stirling engines use a
