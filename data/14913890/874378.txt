A W engine is an eight cylinder piston engine with four banks of two cylinders each arranged in a W configuration br In practice the W engine is created from two narrow angle degree VR engines mounted at an angle of degrees from each other on a common crankshaft Thus the resulting four banks align to form a W br W engines are much less common than V engines and the only W engine to reach production was manufactured by Volkswagen from north America but up to and for Euro JPN br br br Volkswagen W engine br The sole W engine to reach production was the Volkswagen litre W engine which was available in the Volkswagen Passat B from September to September Production was minimal at only units br This engine had a displacement of cc L had a peak power rating of kW hp at rpm and a peak torque rating of N m lb ft at rpm Power and torque outputs were lower than competitors V engines with similar capacity however the W engine was praised for its smoothness br Sales of the W engined Passat models were poor and production was discontinued when the next generation of Passat switched from a longitudinal engine to a transverse engine layout which made packaging of the wide W engine difficult The W was effectively replaced by the Volkswagen litre VR petrol engine br br br WR v kW br The W badged engine is an eight cylinder W engine of four banks of two cylinders formed by joining two VR engines placed on a single crankshaft with each cylinder double bank now at a vee angle br br identification br parts code prefix D ID codes BDN BDP br engine displacement engine configuration br cc cu in WR engine bore x stroke mm mm in in stroke ratio undersquare long stroke cc per cylinder compression ratio br cylinder block crankcase br cast aluminium alloy with two part cast aluminium alloy oil sump five main bearings die forged steel crankshaft with split crankpins Lanchester principle balance shafts one above the other counter rotating at twice the crankshaft speed symmetric to the middle of the crankshaft upper one driven by a toothed belt br cylinder heads valvetrain br cast aluminium alloy four unequal length valves per cylinder valves total low friction roller finger cam followers with automatic hydraulic valve clearance compensation simplex roller chain driven relay method using three chains double overhead camshafts continuous vane adjustable variable valve timing for intake and exhaust camshafts with up to variance inlet camshafts and for exhaust camshafts br aspiration br hot film air mass meter single throttle body with electronically controlled Bosch E Gas drive by wire throttle butterfly valve four part two channel cast aluminium resonance intake manifold br fuel system ignition system engine management br two linked common rail fuel distributor rails multi point electronic sequential indirect fuel injection with eight intake manifold sited fuel injectors centrally positioned NGK longlife spark plugs mapped direct ignition with eight individual direct acting single spark coils Bosch Motronic ME electronic engine control unit ECU cylinder selective knock control via four knock sensors permanent lambda control RON ROZ AKI EuroSuperPlus premium unleaded recommended for maximum performance and fuel economy br exhaust system br vacuum operated secondary air injection pump for direct injection into exhaust ports to assist cold start operation one cast iron exhaust manifold per cylinder bank with integrated ceramic catalytic converter per cylinder bank four heated oxygen sensors monitoring pre and post catalyst exhaust gasses EU compliant br dimensions br mass kg lb length mm in length width mm in height mm in br DIN rated motive power torque output br kW PS bhp at rpm N m lbf ft at rpm bar psi MEP max engine speed rpm m s br references br Volkswagen Passat W motion spec sheet PDF CarAndDriver com Hachette Filipacchi Media U S Inc Archived from the original PDF on June Retrieved February Volkswagen Passat W AutoWeek com Crain Communications Inc August Archived from the original on January Retrieved February Volkswagen Passat W evo Dennis Publishing Ltd March Archived from the original on September Retrieved February VW Passat W motion WorldCarFans com Volkswagen AG April Archived from the original on April Retrieved February W voted best technical innovation at the Moscow Motor Show WorldCarFans com Volkswagen AG December Archived from the original on July Retrieved February br br br Applications br Volkswagen Passat B W motion br br br Awards br was voted best technical innovation and awarded the Golden Pegasus by Za ruljom at the Moscow Motor Show br br br See also br VR engine br br br
