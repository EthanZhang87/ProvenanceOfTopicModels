title: U engine
id: 877975
A U engine is a piston engine made up of two separate straight engines complete with separate crankshafts placed side by side and coupled to a shared output shaft When viewed from the front the engine block resembles the letter U br Although much less common than the similar V engine design several U engines were produced from to for use in airplanes racing cars racing and road motorcycles locomotives and tanks br br br Design br br The main benefit of a U engine layout is the ability to share common parts with straight engine upon which is it based Additionally if the two crankshafts rotate in opposite directions the gyroscopic effect of the rotating components in each cylinder bank cancel each other out br A V engine is typically more compact and lighter than a U engine in part due to the lack of a second crankshaft making V engines far more common than U engines However the V engine does not cancel the gyroscopic effect br The H engine layout uses a similar concept to U engines whereby two flat engines are stacked vertically br br br History br br br Petrol engines br br The first U engine known to have been built was the Bugatti U aircraft engine which had cylinders and a displacement of L cu in Approximately engines were built at the Duesenberg factory in the United States during World War I A small number of engines based on the Bugatti U engine were also produced after the war by Breguet Aviation in France br The Fiat was a Grand Prix racing car that was powered by a L cu in twelve cylinder U engine This engine designated the Type used a supercharger and had a single centrally mounted intake camshaft which operated the intake valves located on the inside of each cylinder bank Two separate camshafts operated the exhaust valves one per bank On test the unit delivered bhp at rpm at maximum boost The Fiat car competed in only one race the km mi Milan Grand Prix on September not to be confused with the km Italian Grand Prix held on the same day The race was won by the Fiat however Fiat then retired from Grand Prix racing and the Type did not race again br The Ariel Square Four motorcycle used a four cylinder engine also called a square four engine The engine was compact and had as narrow a frontal area as a cc parallel twin The rear pair of cylinders on this air cooled engine were prone to overheating br The Suzuki RG motorcycle and several related racing motorcycles used a water cooled four cylinder U engine Although some racing success was achieved the road bikes did not sell well and the design was phased out in favour of a conventional inline four engine br br br Diesel br In the s Sulzer Brothers Ltd began production of an LD series twelve cylinder U engine for use in rail locomotives The LD series was replaced by the LDA series for a combined production period of over years The Sulzer LDA twin bank engine formed the mainstay of British locomotives built in the s with over used in the Peak and Class locomotives The Sulzer LDA engine used a smaller gear for the central output shaft than the two gears attached to the crankshaft This resulted in the output shaft rotating at approximately rpm while the crankshafts rotated at approximately rpm The purpose of this gearing was to allow the use of a smaller and lighter electrical generator when the engine was used in a diesel electric locomotive br The General Motors is a twin engine setup that was used by Sherman tanks during World War II The was built using two straight six engines that were separately clutched to a single output shaft which was itself clutched to the transmission unit A total of D powered M A Shermans were produced After World War II several Soviet Union tanks powered by cylinder and cylinder engines that were reverse engineered from the General Motors engine These Soviet engines were designated Russkiy Dizel Diesel Energo DPN H and the DRPN H br br br Variations br br br Tandem twin engine br br A tandem twin engine occasionally used in motorcycles and go karts is a two cylinder engine which uses a similar design to U engines br The motor has two crankshafts one for each cylinder which are joined and kept in co ordination by load carrying crank phasing gears connecting the two cylinders br The tandem twin layout is used only with two stroke engines since these must have a discrete crankcase chamber per cylinder The prime advantage of a tandem twin two stroke is that the engine can be very narrow while allowing chain final drive without a power wasting turn br Between and Kawasaki used the design to win four cc and four cc world championships before they retired from Grand Prix racing The engine design was also used for a road legal production motorcycle inspired by the racer The Kawasaki KR models were instrumental in establishing the company as a manufacturer of high performance motorcycles br Rotax developed a similar tandem twin design the model which it sold to independent constructors The CCM Armstrong cc Waddon EMC Hejira Decorite and Cotton racers used this engine CCM Armstrong developed a cc version of the engine Aprilia s GP racing bikes also used the Rotax model br br br Single crankshaft br An unusual variation on the U engine is the use of a single crankshaft which is linked to the pistons in both cylinder banks by rocking beams This system was used in an eight cylinder petrol engine produced by the All British Car Company between and br br br See also br Split single engine br List of motorcycles by type of engine br br br
