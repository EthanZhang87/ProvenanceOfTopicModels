A spark arrester sometimes spark arrestor is any device which prevents the emission of flammable debris from combustion sources such as internal combustion engines fireplaces and wood burning stoves br Spark arresters play a critical role in the prevention of wildland fire and ignition of explosive atmospheres Consequently their use is required by law in many jurisdictions worldwide br br br Applications br br br Engines br br br Steam br br Spark arresters for steam locomotives may be internal in the form of wire mesh inside the smokebox or external The earliest platforms for spark arresters in the United States were steam locomotives Wood and coal burning locomotives produce embers which are readily transported by the wind One popular design was the Radley Hunter spark arrester which used a spiral shaped cone to separate embers from the exhaust flow by centrifugal force br The problem of equipment started fires continued into the th century University of California Berkeley researchers J P Fairbank and Roy Bainer provided the first known academic research on the subject Their experiments demonstrated that hot particulate matter larger than inches mm in diameter was capable of igniting wildland fuels br br br Internal combustion br In the s the United States Forest Service became interested in reducing the number of fires started by logging equipment in the National Forest System This interest led to a partnership with the Society of Automotive Engineers and the development of the following test standards for spark arresters br br SAE J Multiposition Small Engine Exhaust System Fire Ignition Suppression br SAE J Spark Arrester Test Procedure for Large Size Engines br SAE J Spark Arrester Test Procedure for Medium Size Engines br Modern technologies have largely eliminated the production of large particulate matter from internal combustion engines However as engines wear carbon deposits can build up on the internal walls of the engine When these deposits break free they exit through the exhaust system and present a potential fire hazard Vehicles without properly functioning spark arresters have been suspected of starting numerous wildfires including the devastating track fire near Raton New Mexico in June br Today spark arresters can be found as OEM or aftermarket components on many types of equipment such as large agricultural machines off highway vehicles OHVs and small engines chainsaws string trimmers leaf blowers etc br br br Buildings br Spark arresters are also fitted to the top of a flue or a chimney pot to prevent floating embers from a fire particularly one burning wood setting light to a flammable roofing surface shingle thatch or bitumen felt or falling onto combustible material on the ground Such a spark arrester typically consists of a double layer of metal mesh which catches the ember and allows the flue gas to escape br Large power station boilers are commonly fitted with electrostatic precipitators br br br Electrical equipment br br br Types br br br Centrifugal br Centrifugal type spark arresters employ stationary vanes baffles or other devices to trap large particles by centrifugal force These spark arresters are typically found on heavy agricultural and construction equipment tractors combines bulldozers etc but some have been developed for motorcycles and other all terrain vehicles br br br Screen br Screen type spark arresters use a physical mesh to prevent large particles from leaving the exhaust system This is the simplest and most common type of spark arrester Screen type devices are used on most motorcycles ATVs and small engines br br br Electrostatic precipitator br br br Regulatory requirements br br br United States br br Laws governing spark arrester use in the United States depend on the jurisdiction Internal combustion engines operating on USDA Forest Service and most other federally managed lands must meet the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations CFR This mandate requires the operator to have a certified and properly maintained spark arrester installed at all times Many state and local land management agencies defer to the federal requirement br br Exemptions exist for automobiles legally registered with their state s department of motor vehicles During periods of extreme fire danger land managers may prevent the use of all motorized equipment even if a properly functioning spark arrester is installed Spark arrester inspections are performed by trained agency law enforcement or fire prevention personnel They may occur on an individual basis or as part of an inspection checkpoint during busy recreation weekends Operators caught using unqualified or modified devices could be cited Penalties for violating spark arrester laws depend on the issuing agency If it is determined a noncompliant vehicle was responsible for starting a fire the operator could be held liable in civil or even criminal court br Certification testing of spark arresters is performed by the USDA Forest Service Technology and Development Center in San Dimas CA The technical requirements are outlined in Forest Service Specification FS All spark arresters meeting the requirements of CFR must be certified and listed in the USDA Forest Service Spark Arrester Guide This guide is a comprehensive directory of all qualified products available in the United States and is published biannually The Spark Arrester Guide is used by field inspectors and consumers to verify product certification status Manufacturers pursuing spark arrester qualification in the United States should consult the USDA Forest Service s Manufacturer s Submission Procedure for both general purpose and small engine spark arresters br br
