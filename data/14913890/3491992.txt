id: 3491992
An X engine is a piston engine with four banks of cylinders around a common crankshaft such that the cylinders form an X shape when viewed front on br The advantage of an X engine is that it is shorter than a V engine of the same number of cylinders however the drawbacks are greater weight and complexity as compared to a radial engine Therefore the configuration has been rarely used br Several of the X engine designs were based on combining two V engines br br br Examples br Four types of X engines are known to have reached production In Rolls Royce Vulture a L cu in X aircraft engine which was built using two Rolls Royce Peregrine V engines The Rolls Royce Vulture was briefly used in the Avro Manchester heavy bomber before engine failures caused it to be replaced by the Avro Lancaster powered by the Rolls Royce Merlin V engine br General Motors also produced X engines for US naval ships during the Second World War The engine was installed in several hundred subchaser boats from onwards where they were typically used in pairs It was considered a successful design and a few have survived to the present day From the similar engine was produced for submarines where four were used in each of the first four members of the USN Tang class These proved unreliable in service and were subsequently replaced by three Fairbanks Morse engines in each boat br The other production X engine is the ChTZ Uraltrac N X engine first produced in and used in the Russian Armata tank platform br Several prototype cylinder X engines for military aircraft were developed during World War II including the Daimler Benz DB Rolls Royce Exe and Isotta Fraschini Zeta R C along with the cylinder Napier Cub br Other prototype X engines include a s Ford X automotive engine which was investigated during the development process of the Ford Flathead V engine During the s Honda is said to have experimented with an X engine configuration for their Formula One racing efforts but abandoned the design as being too complex and unreliable From to the Revetec X v and Revetec x v X experimental petrol engines were developed by an engine research company followed in by the Revetec X D experimental petrol engine br br br See also br Radial engine br W engine br br br
