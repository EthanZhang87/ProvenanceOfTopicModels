title: Hot air engine
id: 1471717
A hot air engine historically called an air engine or caloric engine is any heat engine that uses the expansion and contraction of air under the influence of a temperature change to convert thermal energy into mechanical work These engines may be based on a number of thermodynamic cycles encompassing both open cycle devices such as those of Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson and the closed cycle engine of Robert Stirling Hot air engines are distinct from the better known internal combustion based engine and steam engine br In a typical implementation air is repeatedly heated and cooled in a cylinder and the resulting expansion and contraction are used to move a piston and produce useful mechanical work br br br Definition br br The term hot air engine specifically excludes any engine performing a thermodynamic cycle in which the working fluid undergoes a phase transition such as the Rankine cycle Also excluded are conventional internal combustion engines in which heat is added to the working fluid by combustion of fuel within the working cylinder Continuous combustion types such as George Brayton s Ready Motor and the related gas turbine could be seen as borderline cases br br br History br The expansive property of heated air was known to the ancients Hero of Alexandria s Pneumatica describes devices that might be used to automatically open temple doors when a fire was lit on a sacrificial altar Devices called hot air engines or simply air engines have been recorded from as early as In Guillaume Amontons presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris a report on his invention a wheel that was made to turn by heat The wheel was mounted vertically Around the wheel s hub were water filled chambers Air filled chambers on the wheel s rim were heated by a fire under one side of the wheel The heated air expanded and via tubes forced water from one chamber to another unbalancing the wheel and causing it to turn br See br br Amontons June Moyen de

Descriptive Anecdotes of Steam engines and of Their Inventors and Improvers London England Wightman and Cramp vol pages an illustration of the machine appears on around the time when the laws of gasses were first set out and early patents include those of Henry Wood Vicar of High Ercall near Coalbrookdale Shropshire English patent of and Thomas Mead an engineer from Sculcoats Yorkshire English patent of the latter in particular containing the essential elements of a displacer type engine Mead termed it the transferrer It is unlikely that either of these patents resulted in an actual engine and the earliest workable example was probably the open cycle furnace gas engine of the English inventor Sir George Cayley c br It is likely that Robert Stirling s air engine of which incorporated his innovative Economiser patented in was the first air engine put to practical work The economiser now known as the regenerator stored heat from the hot portion of the engine as the air passed to the cold side and released heat to the cooled air as it returned to the hot side This innovation improved the efficiency of Stirling s engine and should be present in any air engine that is properly called a Stirling engine br Stirling patented a second hot air engine together with his brother James in They inverted the design so that the hot ends of the displacers were underneath the machinery and they added a compressed air pump so the air within could be increased in pressure to around atmospheres It is stated by Chambers to have been unsuccessful owing to mechanical defects and to the unforeseen accumulation of heat not fully extracted by the sieves or small passages in the cool part of the regenerator of which the external surface was not sufficiently large to throw off the unrecovered heat when the engine was working with highly compressed air br Parkinson and Crossley English patent came up with their own hot air engine In this engine the air chamber is partly exposed by submergence in cold water to external cold and its upper portion is heated by steam An internal vessel moves up and down in this chamber and in so doing displaces the air alternately exposing it to the hot and cold influences of the cold water and the hot steam changing its temperature and expansive condition The fluctuations cause the reciprocation of a piston in a cylinder to whose ends the air chamber is alternately connected br In Arnott patented his air expansion machine where a fire is placed on a grate near the bottom of a close cylinder and the cylinder is full of fresh air recently admitted A loose piston is pulled upwards so that all the air in the cylinder above will be made to pass by a tube through the fire and will receive an increased elasticity tending to the expansion or increase of volume which the fire is capable of giving it br He is followed the next year by Captain Ericsson who patented his second hot air engine The specification describes it more particularly as consisting of a circular chamber in which a cone is made to revolve on a shaft or axis by means of leaves or wings alternately exposed to the pressure of steam these wings or leaves being made to work through slits or openings of a circular plane which revolves obliquely to and is thereby kept in contact with the side of the cone br Ericsson built his third hot air engine the caloric engine in which excited so much interest a few years ago in England and which if it should be brought into practical operation will prove the most important mechanical invention ever conceived by the human mind and one that will confer greater benefits on civilized life than any that has ever preceded it For the object of it is the production of mechanical power by the agency of heat at an expenditure of fuel so exceedingly small that man will have an almost unlimited mechanical force at his command in regions where fuel may now be said hardly to exist br sees the patent of Franchot hot air engine certainly the hot air engine that was best following the Carnot requirements br So far all these air engines have been unsuccessful but the technology was maturing In James Stirling the brother of Robert build the famous Dundee Stirling Engine This one at least lasted years but then was discontinued due to improper technical contrivances br Hot air engines is a story of trials and errors and it took another years before hot air engines could be used on an industrial scale The first reliable hot air engines were built by Shaw Roper Ericsson Several thousands of them were built br br br Commercial Manufacturers br Hot engines found a market for pumping water mainly to a household water tank as the water inlet provided the cold required to maintain the temperature difference
