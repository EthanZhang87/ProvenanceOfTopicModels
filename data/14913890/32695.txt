A V engine is a six cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration br br The first V engines were designed and produced independently by Marmon Motor Car Company Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik and Delahaye Engines built after World War II include the Lancia V engine in for the Lancia Aurelia and the Buick V engine in for the Buick Special The V layout has become the most common layout for six cylinder automotive engines br br br Design br Due to their short length V engines are often used as the larger engine option for vehicles which are otherwise produced with inline four engines especially in transverse engine vehicles A downside for luxury cars is that V engines produce more vibrations than straight six engines Some sports cars like the Porsche use flat six engines instead of V engines due to their near perfect primary engine balance and lower centre of gravity which improves the handling br The displacement of modern V engines is typically between to L to cu in though larger and smaller examples have been produced such as the L cu in Mazda V used in the Mazda MX or the L cu in Mitsubishi V engine used in the Mirage Lancer while the largest gasoline V built was the L cu in GMC V used in the GMC C K series br br br Balance and smoothness br All V engines with even firing spacing regardless of the V angle between the cylinder banks are subject to a primary imbalance caused by each bank consisting of an inline three engine due to the odd number of cylinders in each bank Straight six engines and flat six engines do not experience this imbalance To reduce the vibrations caused by this imbalance most V engines use a harmonic damper on the crankshaft and or a counter rotating balance shaft br Six cylinder designs have less pulsation in the power delivery than four cylinder engines due to the overlap in the power strokes of the six cylinder engine In a four cylinder four stroke engine only one piston is on a power stroke at any given time Each piston comes to a complete stop and reverses direction before the next one starts its power stroke which results in a gap between power strokes especially at lower engine speeds RPM In a six cylinder engine with an even firing interval the next piston starts its power stroke before the previous one finishes which results in smoother delivery of power to the flywheel br Comparing engines on a dynamometer a V engine shows instantaneous torque peaks of above mean torque and valleys of below mean torque with a small amount of negative torque engine torque reversals between power strokes In the case of a four cylinder engine the peaks are approximately above mean torque and below mean torque with negative torque being delivered between strokes However a V with uneven firing intervals of and shows large torque variations of above and below mean torque br br br Cylinder bank angles br br br to degrees br br Since Volkswagen has produced narrow angle VR engines with V angles of and degrees These engines use a single cylinder head shared by both banks of cylinders in a design similar to the Lancia V engine The VR engines were used in transverse engine front wheel drive cars which were originally designed for inline four engines Due to the minimal extra length and width of the VR engine it could be fitted to the engine compartments relatively easily in order to provide a displacement increase of percent br Since there is no room in the V between the cylinder banks for an intake system all the intakes are on one side of the engine and all the exhausts are on the other side It uses a firing order of which is the firing order used by most straight six engines rather than the common V firing order of or br br br degrees br br A V angle of degrees is the optimal configuration for V engines regarding engine balance When individual crank pins are used for each cylinder i e using a six throw crankshaft an even firing interval of degrees can be used This firing interval is a multiple of the degree V angle therefore the combustion forces can be balanced through use of the appropriate firing order br The inline three engine that forms each cylinder bank however produces unbalanced rotating and reciprocal forces These forces remain unbalanced in all V engines often leading to the use of a balance shaft to reduce the vibration br The Lancia V engine was pioneering in its use of a six throw crankshaft in order to reduce vibration More recent designs often use a three throw crankshaft with flying arms between the crankpins to allow an even firing interval of degrees to be achieved A pair of counterweights on the crankshaft can then be used to almost perfectly cancel out the primary forces and reduce the secondary vibrations to acceptable levels The engine mounts can be designed to absorb these remaining vibrations br A degree V angle results in a narrower engine overall than V engines with larger V angles This angle often results in the overall engine size being a cube shape making the engine easier to fit either longitudinally or transversely in the engine compartment br br br degrees br br Many manufacturers particularly American ones built V engines with a V angle of degrees based on their existing degree V engines Such configurations were easy to design by removing two cylinders and replacing the V engine s four throw crankshaft with a three throw crankshaft This reduced design costs allowed the new V to share components with the V engine and sometimes allowed manufacturers to build the V and V engines on the same production line br The downsides of a degree design are a wider engine which is more vibration prone than a degree V The initial degree V engines such as the Buick Fireball V engine had three shared crankpins arranged at degrees from each other due to their origins from the V engines This resulted in an uneven firing order with half of the cylinders using a firing interval of degrees and other half using an interval of degrees The uneven firing intervals resulted in rough running engines with unpleasant vibrations at low engine speeds br Several modern degree V engines reduce the vibrations using split crankpins offset by degrees between piston pairs which creates an even firing interval of degrees for all cylinders For example the Buick even fire V engine was an upgraded version of the Buick Fireball engine with a split pin crankshaft to reduce vibration by achieving an even firing order Such a split crankpin is weaker than a straight one but modern metallurgical techniques can produce a crankshaft that is adequately strong br A balance shaft and or crankshaft counterweights can be used to reduce vibrations in degree V engines br br br degrees br At first glance degrees might seem to be the optimal V angle for a V engine since pairs of pistons in alternate banks can share crank pins in a three throw crankshaft and the combustion forces are balanced by the firing interval being equal to the angle between the cylinder banks A degree configuration unlike the degree or degree configurations would not require crankshafts with flying arms split crankpins or seven main bearings to be even firing However the primary imbalance caused by odd number of cylinders in each bank still remains in a degree V engine This differs from the perfect balance achieved by a degree V engine with a commonly used crossplane crankshaft because the inline four engine in each bank of the V engine does not have this primary imbalance br A degree design also results in a large width for the engine being only slightly narrower than a flat six engine which does not have the balance problems of the V engine Therefore the flat six engine has been used in various automobiles whereas use of the degree V engine has been limited to a few truck and racing car engines with the exception of McLaren Automotive s M V engine which uses a degree bank angle with a single balance shaft to eliminate all primary couples The McLaren M engine also takes advantage of the wide angle by placing the turbochargers inside the vee commonly referred to as a hot vee configuration The Ferrari GTB is the first Ferrari road car to sport a V turbo with a vee angle of degrees between the cylinder banks br br br Other angles br Other angle V engines are possible but can suffer from severe vibration problems unless very carefully designed Notable V angles include br br degrees EMD and EMD locomotive marine and stationary Diesel engines These engines were based on V and V engines which also used a V angle of degrees br degrees General Motors degree automotive engine A slightly smaller than usual V angle was used to reduce the width of the engine allowing it to be used in small transverse engine front wheel drive cars br degrees Ferrari Dino automobile engine The V angle was increased from the then common degree angle to allow larger carburetors to be used for potentially higher power in race tuning Crankpins with an offset of degrees within every pair of cylinders were used to achieve the even firing interval of a degree V engine The present Nissan Renault V X automobile engine also used a degree bank angle to allow a turbocharger to fit between the cylinder banks br degrees Mercedes Benz OM BlueTEC diesel engine This engine uses crank pins offset by degrees to achieve an even firing interval br degrees Isuzu V engine used in the Isuzu Rodeo and Isuzu Trooper These engines were produced in both SOHC and DOHC versions A degree V engine is also used by the Honda NSX br degrees Honda RA E engine used in the McLaren MP Formula One racing car br br br Use in automobiles br br In a few years after cylinder engines and V engines had come into existence the first known V engine was built This V engine was a single prototype automotive engine built by Marmon Motor Car Company in the United States The engine did not reach production Similarly a single prototype engine was produced by Buick in br In Delahaye produced the first litre V which was installed in the Delahaye Type automobile br The Lancia V engine was introduced in the Lancia Aurelia Lancia had been producing V engines for approximately years and one of the key goals was to reduce the vibrations compared with the V engine The V engine used a degree V angle and six crankpins resulting in an evenly spaced firing order to reduce vibrations br Other manufacturers took note and soon other V engines were designed In the GMC V engine was introduced in the form of a degree cu in L petrol engine used in pickup trucks and carryalls The Buick V engine was introduced in and was based on the all alloy Buick V which shared its bank angle but unlike the Buick V used all cast iron construction Initially an uneven firing engine Buick later redesigned the crankshaft to a split pin configuration to create an even firing version After it became the V in the engine gained a reputation as a reliable powerful fuel efficient workhorse that became a mainstay of GM s FWD mid size and full size cars It was discontinued in Over million units had been built making it one of the most produced engines in history and it was on Ward s Best Engines of the th century list br Ford introduced its European road car engines in with the German division s Cologne V and the Ford Essex V engine introduced by Ford s United Kingdom division in both engines used a degree V angle The Dino GT was Ferrari s first V road car which had a degree V angle br The Alfa Romeo V engine was introduced in the Alfa Romeo Alfa luxury sedan and later used in many other Alfa Romeo models This engine used a degree V angle an all aluminium construction and two valves per cylinder A turbocharged version was introduced in and a four valve per cylinder version was introduced in Also in the Citro n SM grand tourer was introduced powered by a degree V built by Maserati The Chevrolet

followed by the Mitsubishi G engine and the Mazda J engine in the Toyota VZ engine in and the Isuzu V engine in Hyundai introduced the first South Korean Hyundai Sigma engine based on technology shared from the Mitsubishi unit in br German car manufacturers were relatively slow to adopt V engines because engineers believed that they lacked the smoothness of an inline engine Eventually the first German V engine was a liter V that was launched in the Audi and the narrow angle VR which was introduced across Volkswagen s mid size and sports car lineup in the s In Mercedes Benz introduced the M its first V engine while BMW has continued to use inline engines Mercedes Benz discontinued its V engines in and has since returned to making inline engines br The first independently designed British V engine was the Rover KV engine which replaced the Honda C engine that was previously used in the Rover Jaguar used the Ford based AJ V engine until in their smaller cars but also shared a V version of the AJ V engine with Land Rover for use in the XE XF XJ F Type and the F Pace Land Rover used it in the Range Rover Range Rover Sport Range Rover Velar and the Discovery br The V engine was discontinued in and Jaguar Land Rover replaced it with the new Ingenium engine which has an inline variant for JLR s bigger cars and SUVs br By the mid s the V layout was the most common configuration for six cylinder automotive engines with V engines having replaced most of the straight six engines Today it is being progressively replaced across the car industry by turbocharged cylinder engines which can produce similar power but in a smaller package that produces cleaner emissions has better fuel economy and are less expensive to produce br br br Motor racing br br The Lancia Aurelia the first series production car with a V engine was also successful in motor racing Four of the Aurelia B Coupes were entered in the Mille Miglia with the best placed cars finishing second and fourth A

initial version of the Ferrari Dino engine was a L cu in racing engine used in Formula Two racing in the season It had a V angle of degrees and dual overhead camshafts The Dino V underwent several evolutions including a L cu in version used in the Ferrari Formula One racing car A few years later the Ferrari Formula One car used a new V engine with a V angle of degrees and a displacement of L cu in This engine was shorter and lighter than the Ferrari Dino engine and the simplicity and low center of gravity of the engine was an advantage in racing It won a large number of races between and However Ferrari s founder had a personal dislike of the degree layout preferring a degree layout and after that time it was replaced by other engines The Dino engine was also used in the Lancia Stratos which was a highly successful rally car that won the World Rally Championship in and br A notable racing use of the Alfa Romeo V engine was the Alfa Romeo V TI designed for the DTM season and
