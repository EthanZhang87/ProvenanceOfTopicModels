distribution and sales of Chevrolet vehicles in Oceania starting with the Silverado In Chevrolet was relaunched in Europe primarily selling vehicles built by GM Daewoo of South Korea with the tagline Daewoo has grown up enough to become Chevrolet a move rooted in General Motors attempt to build a global brand around Chevrolet With the reintroduction of Chevrolet to Europe GM intended Chevrolet to be a mainstream value brand while GM s traditional European standard bearers Opel of Germany and Vauxhall of the United Kingdom were to be moved upmarket However GM reversed this move in late announcing that the brand would be withdrawn from Europe from onward with the exception of the Camaro and Corvette Chevrolet vehicles were to continue to be marketed in the CIS states including Russia After General Motors fully acquired GM Daewoo in to create GM Korea the last usage of the Daewoo automotive brand was discontinued in its native South Korea and succeeded by Chevrolet br In North America Chevrolet produces and sells a wide range of vehicles from subcompact automobiles to medium duty commercial trucks Due to the prominence and name recognition of Chevrolet as one of General Motors global marques Chevrolet Chevy or Chev is used at times as a synonym for General Motors or its products one example being the GM LS engine commonly known by the name or a variant thereof of its progenitor the Chevrolet small block engine br br br History br On November the Chevrolet Motor Car Company was incorporated It was founded by Swiss race car driver and automotive engineer Louis Chevrolet with his brother Arthur Chevrolet William C Durant and investment partners William Little maker of the Little automobile former Buick owner James H Whiting Edwin R Campbell son in law of Durant and in R S McLaughlin CEO of General Motors in Canada Former Buick officers were also employed including Curtis R Hatheway as secretary br Durant was dismissed from his senior management position at General Motors in a company that he had founded in In he had taken over the Flint Wagon Works and Buick Motor Company of Flint Michigan He also incorporated the Mason and Little companies As head of Buick Durant had hired Louis Chevrolet to drive Buicks in promotional races Durant planned to use Chevrolet s reputation as a racer as the foundation for his new automobile company The first factory location was in Flint Michigan at the corner of Wilcox and Kearsley Street now known as Chevy Commons at coordinates N W Chevy Commons along the Flint River across the street from Kettering University br One of the technical advancements Chevrolet benefited from was the implementation of an overhead valve engine from the very beginning as the company was developed by the former owner of Buick which had patented the overhead valve and cross flow cylinder design as being more efficient than the conventional use of the flathead engine br Actual design work for the first Chevy the costly Series C Classic Six was drawn up by Etienne Planche following instructions from Louis The first C prototype was ready months before Chevrolet was actually incorporated However the first actual production was not until the model So in essence there were no or production models only one pre production model was made and fine tuned throughout the early part of Then in the fall of that year the new model was introduced at the New York auto show br br Chevrolet first used the bowtie emblem logo in on the H series models Royal Mail and Baby Grand and The L Series Model Light Six It may have been designed from wallpaper Durant once saw in a French hotel room More recent research by historian Ken Kaufmann presents a case that the logo is based on a logo of the Coalettes coal company An example of this logo as it appeared in an advertisement for Coalettes appeared in the Atlanta Constitution on November Others claim that the design was a stylized Swiss cross in tribute to Chevrolet s home country Over time Chevrolet used several different iterations of the bowtie logo at the same time often using blue for passenger cars gold for trucks and an outline often in red for cars that had performance packages Chevrolet eventually unified all vehicle models with the gold bowtie in for both brand cohesion as well as to differentiate itself from Ford with its blue oval logo and Dodge who has often used red for its imaging its two primary domestic rivals br br Louis Chevrolet had differences with Durant over design and in sold Durant his share in the company By Chevrolet was profitable enough with successful sales of the cheaper Series to allow Durant to repurchase a controlling interest in General Motors After the deal was completed in Durant became president of
