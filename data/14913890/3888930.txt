A single cylinder engine sometimes called a thumper is a piston engine with one cylinder This engine is often used for motorcycles motor scooters motorized bicycles go karts all terrain vehicles radio controlled vehicles power tools and garden machinery such as chainsaws lawn mowers cultivators and string trimmers Single cylinder engines are made both as strokes and strokes br br br Characteristics br br Compared with multi cylinder engines single cylinder engines are usually simpler and compact Due to the greater potential for airflow around all sides of the cylinder air cooling is often more effective for single cylinder engines than multi cylinder engines This reduces the weight and complexity of air cooled single cylinder engines compared with liquid cooled engines br Drawbacks of single cylinder engines include a more pulsating power delivery through each cycle and higher levels of vibration The uneven power delivery means that often a single cylinder engine requires a heavier flywheel than a comparable multi cylinder engine resulting in relatively slower changes in engine speed To reduce the vibration level they often make greater use of balance shafts than multi cylinder engines as well as more extreme methods such as a dummy connecting rod for example the Ducati Supermono These balancing devices can reduce the benefits of single cylinder engines regarding lower weight and complexity br Most single cylinder engines used in motor vehicles are fueled by petrol and use a four stroke cycle however diesel single cylinder engines are also used in stationary applications such as the Lombardini LD and LD br A variation known as the split single makes use of two pistons which share a single combustion chamber br br br Uses br br Early motorcycles automobiles and other applications such as marine engines all tended to be single cylinder The configuration is almost exclusively used in portable tools along with garden machinery such as lawn mowers Single cylinder engines also remain in widespread use in motorcycles motor scooters go karts auto rickshaws and radio controlled models From to the Lanz Bulldog tractor used a large horizontally mounted single cylinder two stroke engine However they are rarely used in modern automobiles and tractors due to developments in engine technology br Single cylinder engines remain the most common engine layout in motor scooters and low powered motorcycles The Honda Super Cub the motor vehicle with the highest overall sales since its introduction in uses a cc cu in four stroke single cylinder engine There are also several single cylinder sportbikes such as the KTM Duke R dual sport motorcycles such as the BMW G GS and the classic styled Royal Enfield Bullet br The Moto class in the MotoGP World Championship have used four stroke cc cu in single cylinder engines since the class replaced cc cu in two strokes in br br br Other single cylinder engines br Engines of other sorts like the beam engine and certain types of Stirling engine operate using one cylinder and thus can also be considered single cylinder engines br br br
