A flat twelve engine also known as a horizontally opposed twelve is a twelve cylinder piston engine with six cylinders on each side of a central crankshaft br Flat twelve engines are less common than V engines but they have been used in various racing cars during the s and s and in mid engined Ferrari road cars from to br br br Design br br Unlike most flat twin flat four and flat six engines flat twelve engines typically use the crankshaft configuration of a V engine Instead of the boxer engine design of each piston having its own crankpin flat twelve engines have each pair of pistons sharing a crankpin and thus are flat but not true boxers br Compared with a V engine a flat twelve has a lower center of gravity but because a flat twelve is wider they are rarely used in front engined cars br br br Racing cars br br br Formula One br The first known flat twelve engine was built by Porsche in for the abandoned Cisitalia Grand Prix racing car The engine known as the Porsche Typ was supercharged and had a displacement of L cu in One engine was built and the car conducted top speed testing but it never competed in any races br In the Ferrari F competed in several Formula One races The F was powered by a L cu in flat twelve engine and raced alongside the V engined Ferrari upon which it was based Ferrari returned to using flat twelve engines in when the Ferrari B switched from the V engine used by its predecessor Its successor the Ferrari T was introduced in and won the Formula One constructors championships from to The success of the Ferrari T led other Formula One teams to build flat twelve engines such as the Alfa Romeo br In the Subaru flat twelve engine was built for Subaru s unsuccessful attempt to compete in Formula One as an engine manufacturer br br br Sports car racing br br In the Porsche sports prototype racing car introduced an air cooled flat twelve engine This flat twelve engine was based on the previous flat eight engine but it used a V crankshaft configuration instead of the boxer configuration used by the flat eight The domination of the Porsche probably influenced Ferrari because they switched from V engines to flat twelve engines using a boxer configuration for the Ferrari PB which competed from to Alfa Romeo also used flat twelve engines in the Alfa Romeo TT and Alfa Romeo SC sports prototype racing cars br For the sports prototype racing category Mercedes Benz switched from a twin turbo V engine to a naturally aspirated flat twelve engine for in the Mercedes Benz C racing car This engine employed a cylinder head design with exhaust ports where the intake ports would normally be on top of the engine pointing upwards The intake ports are between the intake and exhaust camshafts just above the spark plugs pointing at an outward angle from the vertical This was done to allow the engine to be installed lower in the chassis The C was unsuccessful and Mercedes withdrew from sports prototype racing after the season br br br Production cars br From to Ferrari used flat twelve engines in various production models the Ferrari GT BB the Ferrari BB the Ferrari BBi the Ferrari Testarossa the Ferrari TR and the Ferrari F M br br br Other uses br During World War II the British Covenanter tank was powered by a Meadows D A V flat hp kW and the Churchill by a hp kW Bedford engine flat Another military vehicle usage was the Panhard EBR armored cars during the s br During the s the Franklin Engine Company in the United States produced a flat twelve aircraft engine called the O br br br
