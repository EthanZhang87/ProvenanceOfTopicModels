Thermoacoustic engines sometimes called TA engines are thermoacoustic devices which use high amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another this requires work which is provided by the loudspeaker or use a heat difference to produce work in the form of sound waves these waves can then be converted into electrical current the same way as a microphone does br These devices can be designed to use either a standing wave or a travelling wave br Compared to vapor refrigerators thermoacoustic refrigerators have no coolant and few moving parts only the loudspeaker therefore require no dynamic sealing or lubrication br br br History br The ability of heat to produce sound was noted by glassblowers centuries ago br In the s experiments showed that a temperature differential drove the phenomenon and that acoustic volume and intensity vary with tube length and bulb size br Rijke demonstrated that adding a heated wire screen a quarter of the way up the tube greatly magnified the sound supplying energy to the air in the tube at its point of greatest pressure Further experiments showed that cooling the air at its points of minimal pressure produced a similar amplifying effect A Rijke tube converts heat into acoustic energy using natural convection br In about Lord Rayleigh discussed the possibility of pumping heat with sound br In Rott reopened the topic Using the Navier Stokes equations for fluids he derived equations specific for thermoacoustics br Linear thermoacoustic models were developed to form a basic quantitative understanding and numeric models for computation br Swift continued with these equations deriving expressions for the acoustic power in thermoacoustic devices br In a similar thermoacoustic refrigeration device was used on Space Shuttle Discovery br Orest Symko at University of Utah began a research project in called Thermal Acoustic Piezo Energy Conversion TAPEC br Niche applications such as small to medium scale cryogenic applications Score Ltd was awarded M in March to research a cooking stove that also delivers electricity and cooling for use in developing countries br A radioisotope heated thermoacoustic system was proposed and prototyped for deep space exploration missions by Airbus The system has slight theoretical advantages over other generator systems like existing thermocouple based systems or a proposed Stirling engine used in ASRG prototype br SoundEnergy developed the THEAC system that turns heat typically waste heat or solar heat into cooling with no other power source The device uses argon gas The device amplifies sound created by the waste heat converts the resulting pressure back into another heat differential and uses a Stirling cycle to produce the cooling effect br br br Operation br A thermoacoustic device takes advantages of the fact that in a sound wave parcels of gas adiabatically alternatively compress and expand and pressure and temperature change simultaneously when pressure reaches a maximum or minimum so does the temperature It basically consists of heat exchangers a resonator and a stack on standing wave devices or regenerator on travelling wave devices Depending on the type of engine a driver or loudspeaker might be used to generate sound waves br In a tube closed at both ends interference can occur between two waves traveling in opposite directions at certain frequencies The interference causes resonance and creates a standing wave The stack consists of small parallel channels When the stack is placed at a certain location in the resonator having a standing wave a temperature differential develops across the stack By placing heat exchangers at each side of the stack heat can be moved The opposite is possible as well a temperature difference across the stack produces a sound wave The first example is a heat pump while the second is a prime mover br br br Heat pump br Creating or moving heat from a cold to a warm reservoir requires work Acoustic power provides this work The stack creates a pressure drop Interference between the incoming and reflected acoustic waves is now imperfect The difference in amplitude causes the standing wave to travel giving the wave acoustic power br Heat pumping along a stack in a standing wave device follows the Brayton cycle br A counter clockwise Brayton cycle for a refrigerator consists of four processes that affect a parcel of gas between two plates of a stack br br Adiabatic compression of the gas When a parcel of gas is displaced from its rightmost position to its leftmost position the parcel is adiabatically compressed increasing its temperature At the leftmost position the parcel now has a higher temperature than the warm plate br Isobaric heat transfer The parcel s higher temperature causes it to transfer heat to the plate at constant pressure cooling the gas br Adiabatic expansion of the gas The gas is displaced back from the leftmost position to the rightmost position Due to adiabatic expansion the gas cools to a temperature lower than that of the cold plate br Isobaric heat transfer The parcel s lower temperature causes heat to be transferred from the cold plate to the gas at a constant pressure returning the parcel s temperature to its original value br Travelling wave devices can be described using the Stirling cycle br br br Temperature gradient br Engines and heat pumps both typically use stacks and heat exchangers The boundary between a prime mover and heat pump is given by the temperature gradient operator which is the mean temperature gradient divided by the critical temperature gradient br br br br br br I br br br br br br br br T br br m br br br br br br br T br br c br r br i br t br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathrm I

that depends on characteristics of the device such as frequency cross sectional area and gas properties br If the temperature gradient operator exceeds one the mean temperature gradient is larger than the critical temperature gradient and the stack operates as a prime mover If the temperature gradient operator is less than one the mean temperature gradient is smaller than the critical gradient and the stack operates as a heat pump br br br Theoretical efficiency br In thermodynamics the highest achievable efficiency is the Carnot efficiency The efficiency of thermoacoustic engines can be

on the heat engine temperatures br Higher hot end temperatures may be possible with thermoacoustic devices because they have no moving parts thus allowing the Carnot efficiency to be higher This may partially offset their lower efficiency compared to conventional heat engines as a percentage of Carnot br The ideal Stirling cycle approximated by traveling wave devices is inherently more efficient than the ideal Brayton cycle approximated by standing wave devices However the narrower pores required to give good thermal contact in a travelling wave device as compared to a standing wave stack which requires deliberately imperfect thermal contact also gives rise to greater frictional losses reducing practical efficiency The toroidal geometry often used in traveling wave devices but not required for standing wave devices can also boost losses due to Gedeon streaming around the loop br br br See also br Sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation SASER br br br br br br
