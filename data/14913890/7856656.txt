title: Six-stroke engine
id: 7856656
The term six stroke engine has been applied to a number of alternative internal combustion engine designs that attempt to improve on traditional two stroke and four stroke engines Claimed advantages may include increased fuel efficiency reduced mechanical complexity and or reduced emissions These engines can be divided into two groups based on the number of pistons that contribute to the six strokes br In the single piston designs the engine captures the heat lost from the four stroke Otto cycle or Diesel cycle and uses it to drive an additional power and exhaust stroke of the piston in the same cylinder in an attempt to improve fuel efficiency and or assist with engine cooling The pistons in this type of six stroke engine go up and down three times for each injection of fuel These designs use either steam or air as the working fluid for the additional power stroke br The designs in which the six strokes are determined by the interactions between two pistons are more diverse The pistons may be opposed in a single cylinder or may reside in separate cylinders Usually one cylinder makes two strokes while the other makes four strokes giving six piston movements per cycle The second piston may be used to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional engine which may reduce mechanical complexity and enable an increased compression ratio by eliminating hotspots that would otherwise limit compression The second piston may also be used to increase the expansion ratio decoupling it from the compression ratio Increasing the expansion ratio in this way can increase thermodynamic efficiency in a similar manner to the Miller or Atkinson cycle br br br Engine types br br br Single piston designs br These designs use a single piston per cylinder like a conventional two or four stroke engine A secondary nondetonating fluid is injected into the chamber and the leftover heat from combustion causes it to expand for a second power stroke followed by a second exhaust stroke br br br Griffin six stroke engine br br In the Bath based engineer Samuel Griffin was an established maker of steam and gas engines He wished to produce an internal combustion engine but without paying the licensing costs of the Otto patents His solution was to develop a patent slide valve and a single acting six stroke engine using it br By Scottish steam locomotive maker Dick Kerr Co saw a future in large oil engines and licensed the Griffin patents These were double acting tandem engines and sold under the name Kilmarnock A major market for the Griffin engine was in electricity generation where they developed a reputation for happily running light for long periods then suddenly being able to take up a large demand for power Their large heavy construction did not suit them to mobile use but they were capable of burning heavier and cheaper grades of oil br The key principle of the Griffin Simplex was a heated exhaust jacketed external vapouriser into which the fuel was sprayed The temperature was held around F C sufficient to physically vapourise the oil but not to break it down chemically This fractional distillation supported the use of heavy oil fuels the unusable tars and asphalts separating out in the vapouriser br Hot bulb ignition was used which Griffin termed the catathermic igniter a small isolated cavity connected to the combustion chamber The spray injector had an adjustable inner nozzle for the air supply surrounded by an annular casing for the oil both oil and air entering at psi kPa pressure and being regulated by a governor br Griffin went out of business in br Only two known examples of a Griffin six stroke engine survive One is in the Anson Engine Museum The other was built in and for some years was in the Birmingham Museum of Science and Technology but in it returned to Bath and the Museum of Bath at Work br br br Dyer six stroke engine br Leonard Dyer invented a six stroke internal combustion water injection engine in very similar to Crower s design see below A dozen more similar patents have been issued since br Dyer s six stroke engine features br br No cooling system required br Improves a typical engine s fuel consumption br Requires a supply of pure water to act as the medium for the second power stroke br Extracts the additional power from the expansion of steam br br br Bajulaz six stroke engine br The Bajulaz six stroke engine is similar to a regular combustion engine in design but modifications were made to the cylinder head with two supplementary fixed capacity chambers a combustion chamber and an air preheating chamber above each cylinder The combustion chamber receives a charge of heated air from the cylinder the injection of fuel begins an isochoric constant volume burn which increases the thermal efficiency compared to a burn in the cylinder The high pressure achieved is then released into the cylinder to work the power or expansion stroke Meanwhile a second chamber which blankets the combustion chamber has its air content heated to a high degree by heat passing through the cylinder wall This heated and pressurized air is then used to power an additional stroke of the piston br The claimed advantages of the engine include reduction in fuel consumption by at least two expansion strokes in six strokes multiple fuel usage capability and a dramatic reduction in pollution br The Bajulaz six stroke engine was invented in by Roger Bajulaz of the Bajulaz S A company based in Geneva Switzerland it has U S patent and U S patent br The Bajulaz six stroke engine features claimed are br br Reduction in fuel consumption by at least br Two expansion work strokes in six strokes br Multifuel including liquefied petroleum gas br Dramatic reduction in air pollution br Costs comparable to those of a four stroke engine br br br Velozeta six stroke engine br In a Velozeta engine fresh air is injected into the cylinder during the exhaust stroke which expands by heat and therefore forces the piston down for an additional stroke The valve overlaps have been removed and the two additional strokes using air injection provide for better gas scavenging The engine seems to show reduction in fuel consumption and dramatic reduction in air pollution Its power to weight ratio is slightly less than that of a four stroke gasoline engine The engine can run on a variety of fuels ranging from gasoline and diesel fuel to LPG An altered engine shows a reduction in carbon monoxide pollution when compared with the four stroke engine from which it was developed The engine was developed in by a team of mechanical engineering students U Krishnaraj Boby Sebastian Arun Nair and Aaron Joseph George of the College of Engineering Trivandrum br br br NIYKADO six stroke engine br This engine was developed by Chanayil Cleetus Anil of Cochin India who patented the design in The name of the engine is taken from the name of his company NIYKADO Motors The engine underwent a preliminary round of full throttle tests at the Automotive Research Association of India Pune The inventor claims this engine is more fuel efficient compared to a conventional four stroke engine and it is very low on pollution br Anil a mechanic developed the NIYKADO engine over the course more than years The engine was first tested in and Anil applied for his patent in He claims that his design produces drastically less pollution and that use in the automotive industry could lead to emission less mobility br Engine functionality br The different strokes are br br Intake stroke br Compression stroke br Power stroke br Exhaust stroke br Air intake br Air exhaust br The engine has four valves br br Air fuel intake valve br Air only intake valve br Combustion exhaust valve br Air only exhaust valve br Intake stroke In this stroke the piston moves from top dead center TDC to bottom dead center BDC The intake valve opens and the air fuel mixture enters the cylinder br Compression stroke The piston moves from BDC to TDC and all valves are closed br Power stroke The spark plug ignites the air fuel mixture The piston moves from TDC to BDC while all valves remain closed br Exhaust stroke The piston moves from BDC to TDC while the exhaust valve opens allowing exhaust gases to exit the cylinder br Air intake stroke The air only intake valve opens while the piston moves from TDC to BDC pulling fresh air from the atmosphere into the cylinder This air mixes with any leftover exhaust or unburnt fuel while cooling the inside of the cylinder br Air exhaust stroke The air exhaust valve opens while the piston moves from BDC to TDC The fresh air and most of the leftover fuel and exhaust leave the cylinder Anil claims that this creates a fresher atmosphere inside the cylinder before the next air fuel intake stroke helps the engine to burn almost of the air fuel mixture and reduces harmful emissions including a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions br br br Crower six stroke engine br In a six stroke engine prototyped in the United States by Bruce Crower water is injected into the cylinder after the exhaust stroke and is instantly turned to steam which expands and forces the piston down for an additional power stroke Thus waste heat that requires an air or water cooling system to discharge in most engines is captured and put to use driving the piston Crower estimated that his design would reduce fuel consumption by by generating the same power output at a lower rotational speed The weight associated with a cooling system could be eliminated but that would be balanced by a need for a water tank in addition to the normal fuel tank br The Crower six stroke engine was an experimental design that attracted media attention in because of an interview given by the year old American inventor who has applied for a patent on his design That patent application was subsequently abandoned br br br Opposed piston designs br These designs use two pistons per cylinder operating at different rates with combustion occurring between the pistons br br br Beare head br The design of the Beare head engine was developed by Malcolm Beare of Australia The technology combines a four stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the bottom piston Functionally the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine Claimed benefits include a increase in power and improved thermodynamic efficiency through an increased compression ratio enabled by the elimination of the hot exhaust valve br br br M br br The idea was developed at the Silesian University of Technology Poland under the leadership of EngD Adam Ciesio kiewicz It was granted patent nr by the Polish Patent Office br The M engines have much in common with the Beare head engines combining two opposed pistons in the same cylinder One piston works at half the cyclical rate of the other but while the main function of the second piston in a Beare head engine is to replace the valve mechanism of a conventional four stroke engine the M takes the principle one step further The double piston combustion engine s work is based on the cooperation of both modules The air load change takes place in the two stroke section of the engine The piston of the four stroke section is an air load exchange aiding system working as a system of valves The cylinder is filled with air or with an air fuel mixture The filling process takes place at overpressure by the slide inlet system The exhaust gases are removed as in the classical two stroke engine by exhaust windows in the cylinder The fuel is supplied into the cylinder by a fuel injection system Ignition is realized by two spark plugs The effective power output of the double piston engine is transferred by two crankshafts The characteristic feature of this engine is an opportunity of continuous change of cylinder capacity and compression rate during engine work by changing the piston s location The mechanical and thermodynamical models were meant for double piston engines which enable to draw up new theoretical thermodynamic cycle for internal combustion double pistons engine br The working principle of the engine is explained in the two and four stroke engines article br br br Other two piston designs br br br Piston charger engine br br In this engine similar in design to the Beare head a piston charger replaces the valve system The piston charger charges the main cylinder and simultaneously regulates the inlet and the outlet aperture leading to no loss of air and fuel in the exhaust In the main cylinder combustion takes place every turn as in a two stroke engine while lubrication is achieved in the same manner as in a four stroke Fuel injection can take place in the piston charger in the gas transfer channel or in the combustion chamber It is also possible to charge two working cylinders with one piston charger The combination of compact design for the combustion chamber together with no loss of air and fuel is claimed to give the engine more torque more power and better fuel efficiency The benefit of fewer moving parts and design is claimed to lead to lower manufacturing costs The engine is claimed to be suited to alternative fuels since no corrosion or deposits are left on valves br The six strokes are br br Aspiration br Precompression br Gas transfer br Compression br Ignition br Ejection br This is an invention of Helmut Kottmann from Germany while working years at MAHLE GmbH piston and cylinder construction Kottman s US patents and are listed below br br br Ilmor Schmitz five stroke br This design was invented by Belgian engineer Gerhard Schmitz and has been prototyped by Ilmor Engineering br These designs use two or four six or eight cylinders with a conventional Otto four stroke cycle An additional piston in its own cylinder is shared by the two Otto cycle cylinders The exhaust from the Otto cycle cylinder is directed into the shared cylinder where it is expanded generating additional work This is in some respects similar to the operation of a compound steam engine with the Otto cycle cylinders being the high pressure stage and the shared cylinder the low pressure stage The operation of the engine is br br The designers consider this to be a five stroke design regarding the simultaneous HP exhaust stroke and LP expansion stroke as a single stroke This design provides higher fuel efficiency due to the higher overall expansion ratio of the combined cylinders Expansion ratios comparable to diesel engines can be achieved while still using gasoline petrol fuel Five stroke engines allegedly are lighter and have higher power density than diesel engines br br br Revetec engines br The controlled combustion engines designed by Bradley Howell Smith of Australian firm Revetec Holdings Pty Ltd use opposed pairs of pistons to drive a pair of counter rotating three lobed cams through bearings These elements replace the conventional crankshaft and connecting rods which enable the motion of the pistons to be purely axial so that most of the power otherwise wasted on lateral motion of the con rods is effectively transferred to the output shaft This gives six power strokes per revolution of the shaft spread across a pair of pistons An independent test measured the brake specific fuel consumption of Revetec s X v prototype gasoline engine at g kW h corresponding to an energy efficiency of Any even number of pistons can be used in boxer or X configurations the three lobes of the cams can be replaced by any other odd number greater than one and the geometry of the cams can be changed to suit the needs of the target fuels and applications of the engines Such
