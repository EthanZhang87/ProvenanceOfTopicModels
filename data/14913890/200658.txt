title: Straight-six engine
id: 200658
The straight six engine also referred to as an inline six engine abbreviated I or L is a piston engine with six cylinders arranged in a straight line along the crankshaft A straight six engine has perfect primary and secondary engine balance resulting in fewer vibrations than other designs of six or fewer cylinders br Until the mid th century the straight six layout was the most common design for engines with six cylinders However V engines became more common in the s By the s V engines replaced most straight six engines br br br Characteristics br In terms of packaging straight six engines are almost always narrower than a V engine or V engine but longer than straight four engines V s and most V s br Straight six engines are typically produced in displacements ranging from to L to cu in p however engines ranging in size from the L cu in Benelli Sei motorcycle engine to the L cu in Cummins B Series engine pickup truck engine have also been produced Due to its well balanced configuration the straight six can be scaled up to substantial sizes for heavy trucks locomotives industrial and marine use p br br br Engine balance and vibration br br If an appropriate firing order is used a straight six engine has perfect primary and secondary engine balance The primary balance is due to the front and rear trio of cylinders moving in pairs albeit out of phase thus canceling out the rocking motion present in a straight three engine The secondary balance is due to the crank throws being arranged in three planes offset at resulting in the non sinusoidal forces summing to zero for all free forces until the sixth order br The engine balance characteristics of a straight six engine compare favorably with the more common straight four engines and V engines which experience significant secondary dynamic imbalance resulting in engine vibration pp As engine reciprocating forces increase with the cube of piston bore the straight six is a preferred configuration for large truck engines pp br br br Two stroke engines br An even firing six cylinder two stroke engine requires ignitions at intervals or else it would run with simultaneous ignitions and be no smoother than a triple in power delivery As such it also requires crank throws at Such designs appear to have been limited to diesel engines such as the Detroit series marine engines and outboard motors br Some of the possible crankshaft configurations have useful properties Still all of them have a rocking imbalance that may or may not require a balance shaft depending on the application The six pistons with six unique phases cannot be paired as in the four stroke case The Detroit engines used a configuration that once the primary rocking couple was balanced out was also perfectly balanced at all other rocking couples until the th order Mercury came to use a configuration that canceled only the primary rocking couple and was run without a balancer br The reciprocating masses of all configurations are still imbalanced at only th order and up in their plane of motion Still the balance of kinetic energy exchange between pistons has improved to a residual th order and up inertial torque oscillation compared with the four stroke design being imbalanced at rd order and up br br br Crankshaft br br Crankshafts for straight six engines usually have either four main bearings i e a bearing in between each pair of crankpins and one at each end or seven main bearings i e a bearing between every crankpin br br Large displacement and diesel engines typically use seven bearings to minimize crankshaft flex When an engine is subject to high loads at low speeds the greater distance between main bearings causes increased crankshaft flex Modern high compression engines subject the crankshaft to greater bending loads from higher peak gas pressures requiring the crank throws to have more significant support from adjacent bearings So it is common for straight six engines to use seven main bearings p br Smaller and high performance engines typically use four bearings since having fewer main journals increases the torsional stiffness of the crankshaft The lack of torsional stiffness can make the seven main bearing designs susceptible to torsional flex and potential breakage at high engine speeds Any torsional flex in the crankshaft is compounded by the torsional flex of the camshafts for the rear cylinders since the camshafts are rather long and subject to torsional flex At high engine speeds the combination of camshaft and crankshaft flex results in inaccurate timing of the valve openings which in the worst case can cause the valves and pistons to collide with catastrophic results br br br Usage in cars br The first production straight six engine was introduced in the Dutch Spyker HP racing car in Straight six engines increased in popularity in the years after and by approximately manufacturers were using them including in the United Kingdom Prior to the s V engines were rarely used due to the poorer engine balance of V engines compared to straight six engines Since the s however the shorter length of V engines has seen most manufacturers replace straight six engines with V engines An exception to this trend is the German brand BMW which has always used a straight six layout for its six cylinder engines br Since the trend of switching to V engines has reversed due to the ability to create a modular engine family of straight engines sharing many components Examples include the present Mercedes Benz M engine the present Jaguar Land Rover Ingenium engines AJ and AJ D versions the present Stellantis Hurricane engine and the present Mazda Skyactiv X and Skyactiv D engines br br br Europe br br Alfa Romeo s first production straight six engine L flathead petrol
