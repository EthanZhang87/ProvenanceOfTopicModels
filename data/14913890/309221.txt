Lubrication is the process or technique of using a lubricant to reduce friction and wear and tear in a contact between two surfaces The study of lubrication is a discipline in the field of tribology br Lubrication mechanisms such as fluid lubricated systems are designed so that the applied load is partially or completely carried by hydrodynamic or hydrostatic pressure which reduces solid body interactions and consequently friction and wear Depending on the degree of surface separation different lubrication regimes can be distinguished br Adequate lubrication allows smooth continuous operation of machine elements reduces the rate of wear and prevents excessive stresses or seizures at bearings When lubrication breaks down components can rub destructively against each other causing heat local welding destructive damage and failure br br br Lubrication mechanisms br br br Fluid lubricated systems br As the load increases on the contacting surfaces distinct situations can be observed with respect to the mode of lubrication which are called lubrication regimes br br Fluid film lubrication is the lubrication regime in which through viscous forces the load is fully supported by the lubricant within the space or gap between the parts in motion relative to one another is avoided br In hydrostatic lubrication external pressure is applied to the lubricant in the bearing to maintain the fluid lubricant film where it would otherwise be squeezed out br In hydrodynamic lubrication the motion of the contacting surfaces as well as the design of the bearing pump lubricant around the bearing to maintain the lubricating film This design of bearing may wear when started stopped or reversed as the lubricant film breaks down The basis of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication is the Reynolds equation The governing equations of the hydrodynamic theory of lubrication and some analytical solutions can be found in the reference br Elastohydrodynamic lubrication Mostly for nonconforming surfaces or higher load conditions the bodies suffer elastic strains at the contact Such strain creates a load bearing area which provides an almost parallel gap for the fluid to flow through Much as in hydrodynamic lubrication the motion of the contacting bodies generates a flow induced pressure which acts as the bearing force over the contact area In such high pressure regimes the viscosity of the fluid may rise considerably At full film elastohydrodynamic lubrication the generated lubricant film completely separates the surfaces Due to the strong coupling between lubricant hydrodynamic action and the elastic deformation in contacting solids this regime of lubrication is an example of Fluid structure interaction The classical elastohydrodynamic theory considers Reynolds equation and the elastic deflection equation to solve for the pressure and deformation in this lubrication regime Contact between raised solid features or asperities can also occur leading to a mixed lubrication or boundary lubrication regime br Boundary lubrication is defined as the regime in which the load is carried by the surface asperities high points rather than by the lubricant This is the effect that makes Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene self lubricating br Boundary film lubrication The hydrodynamic effects are negligible The bodies come into closer contact at their asperities high points the heat developed by the local pressures causes a condition which is called stick slip and some asperities break off At the elevated temperature and pressure conditions chemically reactive constituents of the lubricant react with the contact surface forming a highly resistant tenacious layer or film on the moving solid surfaces boundary film which is capable of supporting the load and major wear or breakdown is avoided br Mixed lubrication This regime is in between the full film elastohydrodynamic and boundary lubrication regimes The generated lubricant film is not enough to separate the bodies completely but hydrodynamic effects are considerable br Besides supporting the load the lubricant may have to perform other functions as well for instance it may cool the contact areas and remove wear products While carrying out these functions the lubricant is constantly replaced from the contact areas either by the relative movement hydrodynamics or by externally induced forces br Lubrication is required for correct operation of mechanical systems such as pistons pumps cams bearings turbines gears roller chains cutting tools etc where without lubrication the pressure between the surfaces in close proximity would generate enough heat for rapid surface damage which in a coarsened condition may literally weld the surfaces together causing seizure br In some applications such as piston engines the film between the piston and the cylinder wall also seals the combustion chamber preventing combustion gases from escaping into the crankcase br If an engine required pressurised lubrication to say plain bearings there would be an oil pump and an oil filter On early engines such as a Sabb marine diesel where pressurised feed was not required splash lubrication would suffice br br br See also br Automatic lubricator Device fitted to a steam engine to supply lubricating oil br Automatic lubrication system A system that delivers
