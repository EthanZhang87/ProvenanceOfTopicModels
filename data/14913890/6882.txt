engineered car at an affordable price Elements of this car are traceable to a prototype which had been under development at Willys during Chrysler s tenure The original Chrysler included a carburetor air filter high compression engine full pressure lubrication and an oil filter features absent from most autos at the time Among the innovations in its early years were the first practical mass produced four wheel hydraulic brakes a system nearly completely engineered by Chrysler with patents assigned to Lockheed and rubber engine mounts called Floating Power to reduce vibration Chrysler also developed a wheel with a ridged rim designed to keep a deflated tire from flying off the wheel This wheel was eventually adopted by the auto industry worldwide br The Maxwell brand was dropped after the model year with the new lower priced four cylinder Chryslers introduced for the year being badge engineered Maxwells The advanced engineering and testing that went into Chrysler Corporation

American Motors on the Rambler Rebel Bendix Corporation s Electrojector used a transistor computer brain modulator box but teething problems on pre production cars meant very few cars were made The EFI system in the Rambler ran fine in warm weather but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures and AMC decided not to use this EFI system on its Rambler Rebel production cars that were sold to the public Chrysler also used the Bendix Electrojector fuel injection system and only around vehicles were built with this option on its production built car models Owners of EFI Chryslers were so dissatisfied that all but one were retrofitted with carburetors while that one has been completely restored with original EFI electronic problems resolved br The Valiant was also introduced for the

sold very well Additional burdens came from increased US import competition and tougher government regulation of car safety fuel economy and emissions As the smallest of the Big US automakers Chrysler lacked the financial resources to meet all of these challenges In with the demise of the reliable Dart Valiant quality control declined Their replacements the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare were comfortable and had good roadability but owners soon experienced major reliability problems which crept into other models as well Engines failed and or did not run well and premature rust plagued bodies In Lee Iacocca was brought in to turn the company around and in Iacocca sought US government help Congress later passed the Loan Guarantee Act providing billion in loan guarantees The Loan

the British as part of the United States under the counter support for Great Britain against Nazi Germany the U S not yet being formally in the war with the balance of the revised order going to the U S Army as the Lee After December and the United States entry into the war against the Axis powers the Tank division rapidly expanded with new facilities such as the Tank Arsenal Proving Ground at then Utica Michigan It also quickly widened the range of products it was developing and producing including the M Sherman tank and the Chrysler A multibank tank engine br br br Special programs br During World War II essentially all of Chrysler s facilities were devoted to building military vehicles the Jeep brand came later after Chrysler acquired American Motors Corporation They were also designing

made air raid sirens powered by its Hemi V engines br br br Radar antennas br When the Radiation Laboratory at MIT was established in to develop microwave radars one of the first projects resulted in the SCR the most widely recognized radar system of the war era This system included a parabolic antenna six feet in diameter that was mechanically aimed in a helical pattern round and round as well as up and down br One of Chrysler s most significant contributions to the war effort was in radar technology For the final production design of this antenna and its highly complex drive mechanism the Army s Signal Corps Laboratories turned to Chrysler s Central Engineering Office There the parabola was changed from aluminum to steel allowing production to form using standard automotive presses To keep weight down equally spaced holes were drilled in the face this had no effect on the radiation pattern The drive mechanism was completely redesigned using technology derived from Chrysler s research in automotive gears and differentials The changes resulted in improved performance reduced weight and easier maintenance A large portion of the Dodge plant was used in building of the SCR antennas as well as the vans used in the systems br br br Aircraft br Chrysler VZ br br br Missiles br In April the U S Army established the Ordnance Guided Missile Center OGMC at Redstone Arsenal adjacent to Huntsville Alabama To form OGMC over civilian and military personnel were transferred from Fort Bliss Texas Included was a group of German scientists and engineers led by Wernher von Braun

Missile Division to serve as the Redstone prime contractor setting up an engineering operation in Huntsville and for production obtaining use from the U S Navy of a large plant in Sterling Heights Michigan The Redstone was in active service from until it was also the first missile to test launch a live nuclear weapon first detonated in a test in the South Pacific br Working together the Missile Division and von Braun s team greatly increased the capability of the Redstone resulting in the PGM Jupiter a medium range ballistic missile In May a Jupiter missile launched two small monkeys into space in a nose cone this was America s first successful flight and recovery of live space payloads Responsibility for deploying Jupiter missiles was transferred from the Army to the Air Force armed with nuclear warheads they were first deployed in Italy and Turkey during the early s br br br Space boosters br In July NASA chose the Redstone missile as the basis for the Mercury Redstone Launch Vehicle to be used for suborbital test flights of the Project Mercury spacecraft Three uncrewed MRLV launch attempts were made between November and March two of which were successful The MRLV

plans included the design of the Saturn series of heavy lift launch vehicles by a team headed by Wernher von Braun Chrysler s Huntsville operation then designated the Space Division became Marshall Space Flight Center s prime contractor for the first stage of the Saturn I and Saturn IB versions The design was based on a cluster of Redstone and Jupiter fuel tanks and Chrysler built it for the Apollo program in the Michoud Assembly Facility in East New Orleans one of the largest manufacturing plants in the world Between October and July NASA used ten Saturn Is and nine Saturn IBs for suborbital and orbital flights all of which were successful Chrysler missiles and boosters never suffered a launch failure The division was also a subcontractor which modified one of the mobile launcher platforms for use with the Saturn IB rockets using Saturn V infrastructure br br br See also br br br Countries br Chrysler Fevre Argentina sold to Volkswagen in br Chrysler Kamyon Turkey
