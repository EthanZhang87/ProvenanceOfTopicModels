A reciprocating engine also often known as a piston engine is typically a heat engine that uses one or more reciprocating pistons to convert high temperature and high pressure into a rotating motion This article describes the common features of all types The main types are the internal combustion engine used extensively in motor vehicles the steam engine the mainstay of the Industrial Revolution and the Stirling engine for niche applications Internal combustion engines are further classified in two ways either a spark ignition SI engine where the spark plug initiates the combustion or a compression ignition CI engine where the air within the cylinder is compressed thus heating it so that the heated air ignites fuel that is injected then or earlier br br br Common features in all types br br There may be one or more pistons Each piston is inside a cylinder into which a gas is introduced either already under pressure e g steam engine or heated inside the cylinder either by ignition of a fuel air mixture internal combustion engine or by contact with a hot heat exchanger in the cylinder Stirling engine The hot gases expand pushing the piston to the bottom of the cylinder This position is also known as the Bottom Dead Center BDC or where the piston forms the largest volume in the cylinder The piston is returned to the cylinder top Top Dead Center TDC by a flywheel the power from other pistons connected to the same shaft or in a double acting cylinder by the same process acting on the other side of the piston This is where the piston forms the smallest volume in the cylinder In most types the expanded or exhausted gases are removed from the cylinder by this stroke The exception is the Stirling engine which repeatedly heats and cools the same sealed quantity of gas The stroke is simply the distance between the TDC and the BDC or the greatest distance that the piston can travel in one direction br In some designs the piston may be powered in both directions in the cylinder in which case it is said to be double acting br br In most types the linear movement of the piston is converted to a rotating movement via a connecting rod and a crankshaft or by a swashplate or other suitable mechanism A flywheel is often used to ensure smooth rotation or to store energy to carry the engine through an un powered part of the cycle The more cylinders a reciprocating engine has generally the more vibration free smoothly it can operate The power of a reciprocating engine is proportional to the volume of the combined pistons displacement br A seal must be made between the sliding piston and the walls of the cylinder so that the high pressure gas above the piston does not leak past it and reduce the efficiency of the engine This seal is usually provided by one or more piston rings These are rings made of a hard metal and are sprung into a circular groove in the piston head The rings fit closely in the groove and press lightly against the cylinder wall to form a seal and more heavily when higher combustion pressure moves around to their inner surfaces br It is common to classify such engines by the number and alignment of cylinders and total volume of displacement of gas by the pistons moving in the cylinders usually measured in cubic centimetres cm or cc or litres l or L US liter For example for internal combustion engines single and two cylinder designs are common in smaller vehicles such as motorcycles while automobiles typically have between four and eight and locomotives and ships may have a dozen cylinders or more Cylinder capacities may range from cm or less in model engines up to thousands of liters in ships engines br The compression ratio affects the performance in most types of reciprocating engine It is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke br The bore stroke ratio is the ratio of the diameter of the piston or bore to the length of travel within the cylinder or stroke If this is around the engine is said to be square If it is greater than i e the bore is larger than the stroke it is oversquare If it is less than i e the stroke is larger than the bore it is undersquare br Cylinders may be aligned in line in a V configuration horizontally opposite each other or radially around the crankshaft Opposed piston engines put two pistons working at opposite ends of the same cylinder and this has been extended into triangular arrangements such as the Napier Deltic Some designs have set the cylinders in motion around the shaft such as the rotary engine br br In some steam engines the cylinders may be of varying size with the smallest bore cylinder working the highest pressure steam This is then fed through one or more increasingly larger bore cylinders successively to extract power from the steam at increasingly lower pressures These engines are called compound engines br Aside from looking at the power that the engine can produce the mean effective pressure MEP can also be used in comparing the power output and performance of reciprocating engines of the same size The mean effective pressure is the fictitious pressure which would produce the same amount of net work that was produced during the power stroke cycle This is shown by br br br br br br W br br n br e br

engines valves are required to allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston s cycle These are worked by cams eccentrics or cranks driven by the shaft of the engine Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by piston valve or poppet valve designs In steam engines the point in the piston cycle at which the steam inlet valve closes is called the cutoff and this can often be controlled to adjust the torque supplied by the engine and improve efficiency In some steam engines the action of the valves can be replaced by an oscillating cylinder br Internal combustion engines operate through a sequence of strokes that admit and remove gases to and from the cylinder These operations are repeated cyclically and an engine is said to be stroke stroke or stroke depending on the number of strokes it takes to complete a cycle br The most common type is stroke which has following cycles br br Intake Also known as induction or suction This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center T D C and ends at bottom dead center B D C In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston br Compression This stroke begins at B D C or just at the end of the suction stroke and ends at T D C In this stroke the piston compresses the air fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke below Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage br Combustion Also known as power or ignition This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle At this point the crankshaft has completed a full degree revolution While the piston is at T D C the end of the compression stroke the compressed air fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug in a gasoline engine or by heat generated by high compression diesel engines forcefully returning the piston to B D C This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft br Exhaust Also known as outlet During the exhaust stroke the piston once again returns from B D C to T D C while the exhaust valve is open This action expels the spent air fuel mixture through the exhaust valve br br br History br br An early known example of rotary to reciprocating motion is the crank mechanism The earlier hand operated cranks appeared in China during the Han dynasty BC AD The Chinese used the crank and connecting rod for operating querns as far back as the Western Han dynasty BC AD Eventually crank and connecting rods were used in the inter conversion of rotary and reciprocating motion for other applications such as flour sifting silk reeling machines treadle spinning wheels and furnace bellows driven either by horses or waterwheels Several saw mills in Roman Asia and Byzantine Syria during the rd th centuries AD had a crank and connecting rod mechanism which converted the rotary motion of a water wheel into the linear movement of saw blades In Arab engineer Al Jazari invented a crankshaft br The reciprocating engine developed in Europe during the th century first as the atmospheric engine then later as the steam engine These were followed by the Stirling engine and internal combustion engine in the th century Today the most common form of reciprocating engine is the internal combustion engine running on the combustion of petrol diesel liquefied petroleum gas LPG or compressed natural gas CNG and used to power motor vehicles and engine power plants br One notable reciprocating engine from the World War II era was the cylinder hp kW Pratt Whitney R Wasp Major radial engine It powered the last generation of large piston engined planes before jet engines and turboprops took over from onward It had a total engine capacity of L cu in and a high power to weight ratio br The largest reciprocating engine in production at present but not the largest ever built is the W rtsil Sulzer RTA C turbocharged two stroke diesel engine of built by W rtsil It is used to power the largest modern container ships such as the Emma M rsk It is five stories high m or ft m ft long and weighs over metric tons short tons in its largest cylinders version producing more than MW bhp Each cylinder has a capacity of L cu ft making a total capacity of L cu ft for the largest versions br br br Engine capacity br For piston engines an engine s capacity is the engine displacement in other words the volume swept by all the pistons of an engine in a single movement It is generally measured in litres l or cubic inches c i d cu in or in for larger engines and cubic centimetres abbreviated cc for smaller engines All else being equal engines with greater capacities are more powerful and consumption of fuel increases accordingly although this is not true of every reciprocating engine although power and fuel consumption are affected by many factors outside of engine displacement br br br Power br Reciprocating engines can be characterized by their specific power which is typically given in kilowatts per litre of engine displacement in the U S also horsepower per cubic inch The result offers an approximation of the peak power output of an engine This is not to be confused with fuel efficiency since high efficiency often requires a lean fuel air ratio and thus lower power density A modern high performance car engine makes in excess of kW L hp in br br br Other modern non internal combustion types br Reciprocating engines that are powered by compressed air steam or other hot gases are still used in some applications such as to drive many modern torpedoes or as pollution free motive power Most steam driven applications use steam turbines which are more efficient than piston engines br The French designed FlowAIR vehicles use compressed air stored in a cylinder to drive a reciprocating engine in a local pollution free urban vehicle br Torpedoes may use a working gas produced by high test peroxide or Otto fuel II which pressurize without combustion The kg lb Mark torpedo for example can travel km mi underwater at km h mph fuelled by Otto fuel without oxidant br br br Reciprocating quantum heat engine br Quantum heat engines are devices that generate power from heat that flows from a hot to a cold reservoir br The mechanism of operation of the engine can be described by the laws of quantum mechanics br Quantum refrigerators are devices that consume power with the purpose to pump heat from a cold to a hot reservoir br In a reciprocating quantum heat engine the working medium is a quantum system such as spin systems or a harmonic oscillator br The Carnot cycle and Otto cycle are the ones most studied br The quantum versions obey the laws of thermodynamics In addition these models can justify the assumptions of br endoreversible thermodynamics br A theoretical study has shown that it is possible and practical to build a reciprocating engine that is composed of a single oscillating atom This is an area for future research and could have applications in nanotechnology br br br Miscellaneous engines br There are a large number of unusual varieties of piston engines that have various claimed advantages
