title: Uniflow steam engine
id: 9730335
The uniflow type of steam engine uses steam that flows in one direction only in each half of the cylinder Thermal efficiency is increased by having a temperature gradient along the cylinder Steam always enters at the hot ends of the cylinder and exhausts through ports at the cooler centre By this means the relative heating and cooling of the cylinder walls is reduced br br br Design details br br Steam entry is usually controlled by poppet valves which act similarly to those used in internal combustion engines that are operated by a camshaft The inlet valves open to admit steam when minimum expansion volume has been reached at the start of the stroke For a period of the crank cycle steam is admitted and the poppet inlet is then closed allowing continued expansion of the steam during the stroke driving the piston Near the end of the stroke the piston will uncover a ring of exhaust ports mounted radially around the centre of the cylinder These ports are connected by a manifold and piping to the condenser lowering the pressure in the chamber below that of the atmosphere causing rapid exhausting Continued rotation of the crank moves the piston From the animation the features of a uniflow engine can be seen with a large piston almost half the length of the cylinder poppet inlet valves at either end a camshaft whose motion is derived from that of the driveshaft and a central ring of exhaust ports br br br Advantages br Uniflow engines potentially allow greater expansion in a single cylinder without the relatively cool exhaust steam flowing across the hot end of the working cylinder and steam ports of a conventional counterflow steam engine during the exhaust stroke This condition allows higher thermal efficiency The exhaust ports are open for only a small fraction of the piston stroke with the exhaust ports closed just after the piston begins traveling toward the admission end of the cylinder The steam remaining within the cylinder after the exhaust ports are closed is trapped and this trapped steam is compressed by the returning piston This is thermodynamically desirable as it preheats the hot end of the cylinder before the admission of steam However the risk of excessive compression often results in small auxiliary exhaust ports being included at the cylinder heads Such a design is called a semi uniflow engine br Engines of this type usually have multiple cylinders in an in line arrangement and may be single or double acting A particular advantage of this type is that the valves may be operated by the effect of multiple camshafts and by changing the relative phase of these camshafts the amount of steam admitted may be increased for high torque at low speed and may be decreased at cruising speed for economy of operation Alternatively designs using a more complex cam surface allowed the varying of timing by shifting the entire camshaft longitudinally compared to its follower allowing the admission timing to be varied The camshaft could be shifted by mechanical or hydraulic devices And by changing the absolute phase the engine s direction of rotation may be changed The uniflow design also maintains a constant temperature gradient through the cylinder avoiding passing hot and cold steam through the same end of the cylinder br br br Disadvantages br In practice the uniflow engine has a number of operational shortcomings The large expansion ratio requires a large cylinder volume To gain the maximum potential work from the engine a high reciprocation rate is required typically faster than a double acting counterflow type engine This causes the opening times of the inlet valves to be very short putting great strain on a delicate mechanical part In order to withstand the huge mechanical forces encountered engines have to be heavily built and a large flywheel is required both to smooth out the variations in torque as the steam pressure rapidly rises and falls in the cylinder and to compensate for the inertia of the heavy piston Because there is a thermal gradient across the cylinder the metal of the wall expands to different extents This requires the cylinder bore to be machined wider in the cool center sometimes described as egg shaped than at the hot ends If the cylinder is not heated correctly or if water enters the delicate balance can be upset causing seizure mid stroke and potentially destruction br br br History br The uniflow engine was first used in Britain in by Jacob Perkins and was patented in by Leonard Jennett Todd It was popularised by German engineer Johann Stumpf in with the first commercial stationary engine produced a year previously in br br br Steam locomotives br The uniflow principle was mainly used for industrial power generation but was also tried in a few railway locomotives in England such as the North Eastern Railway uniflow locomotives No of and No of and the Midland Railway Paget locomotive Experiments were also made in France Germany the United States and Russia In no case were the results encouraging enough for further development to be undertaken br br br Steam wagons br br The first large scale utilization of a Uniflow engine was in Atkinson steam wagons in Only one such steam wagon is known to be still in existence it was built in spent its working life and a period of dereliction in Australia and was then repatriated to England and restored by Tom Varley in br br br Skinner Unaflow br The final commercial evolution of the uniflow engine occurred in the United States during the late s and s by the Skinner Engine Company with the development of the Compound Unaflow Marine Steam Engine This engine operates in a steeple compound configuration and provides efficiencies approaching contemporary diesels Many car ferries on the Great Lakes were so equipped one of which is still operating SS Badger of The Casablanca class escort carrier the most prolific aircraft carrier design in history used two cylinder Skinner Unaflow engines but these were not steeple compounds A non compound Skinner Uniflow remained in service until in the Great Lakes cement carrier SS St Marys Challenger installed when the vessel was re powered in br In small sizes less than about hp kW reciprocating steam engines are much more efficient than steam turbines White Cliffs Solar Power Station used a three cylinder uniflow engine with Bash type admission valves to generate about kW electrical output br br br Home made conversions of two stroke engines br The single acting uniflow steam engine configuration closely resembles that of a two stroke internal combustion engine and it is possible to convert a two stroke engine to a uniflow steam engine by feeding the cylinder with steam via a bash valve fitted in place of the spark plug As the rising piston nears the top of its stroke it knocks open the bash valve to admit a pulse of steam The valve closes automatically as the piston descends and the steam is exhausted through the existing cylinder porting The inertia of the flywheel then carries the piston back to the top of its stroke against the compression as it does in the original form of the engine Also like the original the conversion is not self starting and must be turned over by an external power source to start An example of such a conversion is the steam powered moped which is started by pedalling br br br See also br Advanced steam technology br br br br br br Sources br Teach yourself heat engines by E de Ville published by The English Universities Press Limited London pp
