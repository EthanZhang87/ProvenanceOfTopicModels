title: Hemispherical combustion chamber
id: 317124
A hemispherical combustion chamber is a combustion chamber in the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine with a domed hemispheric shape An engine featuring this type of hemispherical chamber is known as a hemi engine In practice shapes less than a full hemisphere are typically employed as are variations or faceting in parts of a true hemispheric profile The primary advantage of such shapes are increased compression leading to greater power and very large intake and exhaust valves allowing better flow of intake and exhaust gasses also resulting in improved volumetric efficiency and greater power the primary disadvantages are complex valve trains caused by valves being placed opposite one another in a head and expense of machining the heads and pistons and additional valve train components br While hemispherical combustion chambers are still found in the s multi valve arrangements of four and even five valves per cylinder and the popularity of overhead cam including double overhead cam arrangements have altered the traditional trade offs in employing hemi heads br br br History br br Hemispherical combustion chambers were introduced on some of the earliest automotive engines shortly after the viability of the internal combustion engine was first demonstrated Their name reflects the domed recess in a cylinder head and correspondingly shaped top of a piston enclosing a space that approximates a half of a sphere hemi sphere ical although in practice the actual enclosed space is generally less than half br Hemispherical cylinder heads have been used since at least they were used by the Belgian car maker Pipe in and by the Fiat HP Grand Prix racer The Peugeot Grand Prix car of and the Alfa Romeo Grand Prix car of were both four valve engines and Daimler and Riley were also using hemispherical combustion chambers at the time Beginning in Stutz used four valve engines conceptually anticipating modern car engines Other examples include the BMW double pushrod design adopted by Bristol Cars the Peugeot the Toyota T engine and Toyota V engine Toyota s first V engine Miller racing engines and the Jaguar XK engine br br br Technology and implementation br A hemispherical head hemi head gives an efficient combustion chamber with minimal heat loss to the head and allows for two large valves However a hemi head usually allows no more than two valves per cylinder due to the difficulty in arranging the valve gear for four valves at diverging angles and these large valves are necessarily heavier than those in a multi valve engine of similar valve area as well as generally requiring more valve lift The intake and exhaust valves lie on opposite sides of the chamber and necessitate a cross flow head design Since the combustion chamber is virtually a hemisphere a flat topped piston yields a lower compression ratio unless a smaller chamber is utilized br Significant challenges in the commercialization of engines utilizing hemispherical chambers revolved around the design of the valve actuation and how to make it effective efficient and reliable at an acceptable cost which normally requires the use of either a dual rocker system or dual camshafts to operate the inlet and exhaust valves Complexity was referenced early in Chrysler s development of their s hemi engine the head was referred to in company advertising as the Double Rocker head Ford s CVH Compound Valve Hemispherical engine of the s solved the problem by way of utilizing a complex geometry of the valve angle combined with a cam in head configuration that allowed hemispherical arranged valves to be operated by a single camshaft and without the need for two rocker shafts br br br Benefits and drawbacks br Although a wedge head design offers simplified valve actuation it usually does so by placing the valves side by side within the chamber with parallel stem axes This can restrict the flow of the intake and exhaust into and out of the chamber by limiting the diameters of valve heads to total no more than the bore of the cylinder in a two valve per cylinder arrangement With a hemispherical chamber with splayed valve stem angle this limitation is increased by the angle making the total valve diameter size possible to exceed the bore size within an overhead valve configuration See IOE engine for another method br Also the splayed valve angle causes the valve seat plane to be tilted giving a straighter flow path for the intake and exhaust to from the port exiting the cylinder head Engineers have learned that while increasing the valve size with straighter port is beneficial for increasing the maximum power at high rpm it slows the intake flow speed not providing the best combustion event for emissions efficiency or power in the normal rpm range br Domed pistons are commonly used to maintain a higher mechanical compression ratio which tend to increase the flame propagation distance being also detrimental to efficient combustion unless the number of spark plugs per cylinder is increased br Flame temperatures are very high leading to excessive NOx output which may require exhaust gas recirculation and other emission control measures to meet modern standards Other drawbacks of the hemispherical chamber include increased production cost and high relative weight heavier than a comparable wedge head according to Chrysler s engineers These had pushed the hemi head out of favor in the modern era until Chrysler s redesign that has proven popular br br br Use br br br Alfa Romeo br Alfa Romeo has produced successful hemi head engines throughout the years Arguably one of their most beloved examples is Giuseppe Busso s original liter V which has been cited by some as one of the best and most distinctive sounding production engines even in its latter v forms of all time Part of this praise is likely because the hemispherical heads on the original valve engine allowed for an almost completely straight exhaust port resulting in a less diluted or muddied engine sound allowing Alfa Romeo to use quieter stock exhausts without losing much of their distinct and beloved race bred engine noise br br br Aston Martin br br Aston Martin s DOHC V used a hemispherical chamber during the late s through to the late s Each of four cams controlled one set of valves per cylinder bank The Aston Martin V L cc in produced hp kW gross br br br BMW br BMW became a worldwide marque on the strength of its responsive yet durable SOHC hemi head inline M engine most famously made in a L cu in displacement in its sports sedan of the s and s br br br Chrysler br br Perhaps the most widely known proponent of the hemispherical chamber design is the Chrysler Corporation Chrysler became identified primarily by trademarking the Hemi name and then using it extensively in their advertising campaigns beginning in the s Chrysler has produced three generations of such engines the Chrysler FirePower engine in the s the Hemi developed for NASCAR in and produced through the early s and the new HEMI from to The most recent rendition of the Chrysler Hemi engine uses part of an oblate spheroid flattened sphere for its head shape to improve combustion efficiency over a true hemispherical head br br br Ford br br In Ford produced a single overhead cam cu in FE based hemi V known as the SOHC Cammer Designed in days of intensive engineering effort for use in racing it never appeared in a production Ford vehicle instead being sold as an optional engine at Ford parts counters Period dynamometer results claim the SOHC Hemi produced almost hp kW in crate form hp per liter It used the side oiler engine block modified to replace an in block cam with an idler shaft driving the distributor and oil pump and accommodate other overhead camshaft issues The overhead cams meant that it was not as rpm limited as the Chrysler Hemis were with their pushrods and heavy and complex valvetrains br Because of its power output and the fact that Chrysler had showed NASCAR chief Bill France that a DOHC Hemi was in the works it was banned from NASCAR races though allowed in certain drag racing classes br Later Ford engine designs with hemispherical chambers included the Calliope which used two in block cams arranged one over the other to drive valves per hemispherical chamber The pushrods activating the valves from the top camshaft were almost horizontal In Ford brought out the completely new series engine family which used a modified Semi Hemi form of the hemispherical chamber br br In the s Ford designed and produced a small block Windsor engine with hemispherical heads to address the growing concerns about fuel economy Unfortunately even with an ahead of its time direct fuel injection system feeding a stratified charge chamber the hemi s emissions could not be made clean enough for compliance with regulations This plus the cost of the valve actuation systems along with the cost of the high pressure pump needed to deliver fuel directly into the chamber as well as the gilmer belt drive system needed to drive the pump made further development pointless at the time br Most s cylinder Fords used the Ford CVH engine CVH meaning Compound Valve Hemispherical combustion chamber Post the cylinder head of this engine was reworked to heart shaped lean burn combustion chambers and used in low performance models not benefiting from multipoint fuel injection in Europe though was still referred to colloquially as the CVH br br br Jaguar br br The hemi head Jaguar XK engine introduced in powered cars ranging from the Le Mans winning D Type to the XJ br br br Lamborghini br The Lamborghini V designed in and produced for more than years used hemispherical chambers br br br Lancia br The Lancia V and Lancia V engines both used hemispherical combustion chambers br br br Lotus br br Lotus has used hemispherical chambers as in the Lotus Ford Twin Cam br br br Mercedes Benz br Hemispherical chambers were a feature of the M engine introduced in which together with the crossflow head design promoted greater efficiency over the M engine it replaced br br br MG br The MGA Twin Cam was a variant of the pushrod MGA MkI MG MGA line from to The original pushrod cc cast iron block was fitted with a cast aluminum twin cam two valve cylinder head Early versions proved fragile on the street and in competition due to pre ignition detonation and oil loss which led to decreasing the compression ratio from to with redesigned pistons It was a successful update but sales dropped off so rapidly the company halted Twin Cam production and used the matching chassis for some MGAs with pushrod engines known as the MGA MkI and MkII DeLuxe models br br br Mitsubishi br Mitsubishi produced several hemi engines including the Orion Astron and Saturn units br br br Nissan br Nissan s Z VG SOHC version only and DOHC VQ engines use hemispherical combustion chambers The Z and VG are true hemispherical while the VQ uses a compound pent roof shape br br br Porsche br br Porsche has made extensive use of hemi head engines including the air cooled flat engine in Porsche models from to The L version generated hp per naturally aspirated litre of piston displacement br br br Toyota br Toyota s V engine family were longitudinally mounted V s used in the prestigious Toyota Century from the s through the s Toyota had worked with Yamaha to produce the first Japanese full aluminum alloy block engine The V Family is often referred to as the Toyota HEMI as the engine features a similar cylinder head design to those found on the Chrysler s Hemi even though most of the engine design is completely different br Other Toyota engines e g T C M M etc at the time used a hemispherical combustion chamber The spark plugs were located at the top of the combustion chamber br br br Design evolution in modern engines br br In the modern emissions era the hemi chamber has morphed into more sophisticated and complex designs that are able to extract more power with lower emissions from any given combustion event br Many of today s engines use active combustion chambers designed to tumble and swirl the fuel air mix within the chamber for the most efficient combustion event possible These chambers usually look like kidney beans or two merged small hemi areas surrounded by flat quenching areas over the pistons br br br
