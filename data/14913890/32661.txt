title: V-twin engine
id: 32661
A V twin engine also called a V engine is a two cylinder piston engine where the cylinders are arranged in a V configuration and share a common crankshaft br The V twin is widely associated with motorcycles primarily installed longitudinally though also transversely They are also used in a variety of other land air and marine vehicles as well as industrial applications The V twin design dates back to the late s br br br Origins br br One of the first V twin engines was built by Gottlieb Daimler in It was used as a stationary engine for boats and in the Daimler Stahlradwagen steel wheeled car Daimler s second car The engine was also manufactured under licence in France by Panhard et Levassor br An early V twin engined motorcycle was produced in November by the Princeps AutoCar Company in the United Kingdom The following year V twin motorcycles were produced by Eclipse Motor Cycle Co in the United Kingdom the XL ALL model Glenn Curtiss in the United States and NSU Motorenwerke in Germany br br Peugeot which had used Panhard built Daimler V twins in its first cars began producing its own V twin engines in the early th century This Peugeot engine powered a Norton motorcycle that won the first Isle of Man TT race in br br br Typical design br br br Crankshaft configuration br br Most V twin engines have a single crankpin which is shared by both connecting rods The connecting rods may sit side by side with offset cylinders or have fork and blade connecting rods which avoids the twisting forces caused by having offset cylinders br Some notable exceptions include a crank pin offset used by the Moto Guzzi cc a dual crankpin configuration used by the Honda Shadow and the crank pin offset offset in the United States used by the Suzuki VX br br br V angle br Although any V angle the angle between the two banks of cylinders between zero and degrees is theoretically possible for a V twin engine in practice angles smaller than degrees are rarely used The most common V angle for a V twin engine is degrees which can achieve a perfect primary balance if the correct counterweight is used like most Ducatis most Moto Guzzis the Honda RC Suzuki TL S and TL R However this arrangement results in an uneven firing order with the second cylinder firing degrees after the first cylinder then a degrees interval until the first cylinder fires again degree engines are sometimes called L twin like the L in TL R or TL S rather than V twin br The alternating longer and shorter gaps between firings produce a characteristic V twin alternating engine noise phutphut phutphut

vibration Vehicles which use engines with V angles of less than degrees include br br degrees Daimler Steel wheel car br degrees Indian Powerplus Indian Scout Indian Chief br degrees present Harley

Rotax engines br Vehicles which use engines with V angles of greater than degrees include the Moto Guzzi cc degrees and the Z ndapp KS degrees br br br Motorcycles br br As per other motor vehicles the terms longitudinal engine and transverse engine are most often used to refer to the crankshaft orientation relative to the frame However some companies use the opposite terminology stating that a transverse V twin engine has the cylinders mounted on each side of the motorcycle therefore with the crankshaft running in line with the frame and that a longitudinal V twin engine has the cylinders at the front and rear The latter terminology is used by the Italian manufacturer Moto Guzzi br To avoid such ambiguity some people use descriptions of transverse crankshaft engine longitudinal crankshaft engine or transversely mounted cylinders br br br Transverse engine br The most common arrangement is to mount the engine with the crankshaft oriented transversely to the frame The advantage of this mounting is that the width of the motorcycle can be smaller than a longitudinally mounted V twin A disadvantage of this configuration for air cooled engines is that the two cylinders receive different air flows and cooling of the rear cylinder tends to be restricted although the uneven cooling isn t as pronounced as a parallel twin engine where the inner faces of the cylinders are not exposed to any airflow Some transverse V twins use a single carburettor in the middle of the V angle to feed both cylinders While this avoids the need for two carburettors it creates further cooling problems for the rear cylinder by placing its hot exhaust port and pipe at the back of the cylinder where it may be exposed to less cooling airflow br Transverse V twin engines have been used by Harley Davidson Ducati and many recent Japanese motorcycles such as the Suzuki SV Some Ducati V twin engines have been marketed as L twin engines due to the front cylinder being vertical and the rear cylinder being horizontal thus forming an L shape br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Longitudinal engine br A less common arrangement is to mount the engine longitudinally An advantage of this arrangement is that both cylinder heads can protrude into the air stream so they can each receive the same amount of cooling for air cooled engines Also the transmission being located behind the engine is easier to fit within a typical motorcycle frame and for shaft drive motorcycles a bevel gear is not needed at the start of the driveshaft br As per all longitudinal engines a disadvantage is that the torque reaction will twist the motorcycle to one side such as on sharp acceleration deceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral instead of shifting the weight balance between the front and rear wheels However many modern motorcycles reduce this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft br Longitudinal V twin engines have been used by the Honda CX series and several Moto Guzzi motorcycles br br br br br br br br br br br br Automobiles br Most cars are powered by engines with three or more cylinders however several small cars have been produced with V twin engines particularly during the period from to when cyclecars were made by many companies due to a favourable tax position Almost all of these used proprietary engines either adapting the larger motorcycle engines used for sidecar work large singles or V twins or using engines specifically made for cyclecars such as those made by J A Prestwich Industries J A P engines or F E Baker Ltd Precision engines br In Humber produced a light car called the Humberette with a Humber made V twin side valve engine of cc The engine had a directly attached clutch speed gearbox and prop shaft output to a rear differential A water cooled version of this engine was made available in but WW ended Humberette production in br From to various Morgan wheelers three wheeled cyclecar models were powered by V twin engines Production of three wheeler models then resumed with the present Morgan Wheeler Also in the United Kingdom Birmingham Small Arms Company BSA produced several cars powered by their V twin motorcycle engines These were produced from to four wheel models and three wheel and four wheel models br Several manufacturers have produced models inspired by the original Morgan three wheeled car such as the present Triking Cyclecar using a Moto Guzzi engine the present Ace Cycle Car using a Harley Davidson engine and the present JZR Trikes kit car using engines from several manufacturers br Mazda s first car the Mazda R rear engined kei car was powered by the cc cu in Mazda V twin engine The Mazda B front engined light commercial vehicle used a cc cu in version of this engine br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Industrial engines br br Various V twin engines have been produced for industrial uses such as pressure washers lawn and garden tractors tillers generators and water pumps The engines are usually air cooled with a V angle Depending on the application the engine s orientation can have either a horizontal or vertical crankshaft br Manufacturers of commercial V twin engines include Briggs Stratton with its Vanguard Professional and Intek V twin series Honda with its V twin series engines Kawasaki with its FD FH FR FS and FX series Subaru with its EH series Tecumseh with its OV EA and TVT engines and Kohler br br br See also br Flat twin engine br List of
