title: Straight-eight engine
id: 200044
The straight eight engine or inline eight engine often abbreviated as I or L is an eight cylinder internal combustion engine with all eight cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankcase The type has been produced in side valve IOE overhead valve sleeve valve and overhead cam configurations br A straight eight can be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance with no unbalanced primary or secondary forces or moments However crankshaft torsional vibration present to some degree in all engines is sufficient to require the use of a harmonic damper at the accessory end of the crankshaft Without such damping fatigue cracking near the rear main bearing journal may occur leading to engine failure br Although an inline six cylinder engine can also be timed for inherent primary and secondary balance a straight eight develops more power strokes per revolution and as a result will run more smoothly under load than an inline six Also due to the even number of power strokes per revolution a straight eight does not produce unpleasant odd order harmonic vibration in the vehicle s driveline at low engine speeds br The smooth running characteristics of the straight eight made it popular in luxury and racing cars of the past However the engine s length demanded the use of a long engine compartment making the basic design unacceptable in modern vehicles Also due to the length of the engine torsional vibration in both crankshaft and camshaft can adversely affect reliability and performance at high speeds In particular a phenomenon referred to as crankshaft whip caused by the effects of centrifugal force on the crank throws at high engine rpm can cause physical contact between the connecting rods and crankcase walls leading to the engine s destruction As a result the design has been displaced almost completely by the shorter V engine configuration br br br Early period br The first straight eight was conceived by Charron Girardot et Voigt CGV in but never built Great strides were made during World War I as Mercedes made straight eight aircraft engines like the Mercedes D IV Advantages of the straight eight engine for aircraft applications included the aerodynamic efficiency of the long narrow configuration and the inherent balance of the engine making counterweights on the crankshaft unnecessary The disadvantages of crank and camshaft twisting were not considered at this time since aircraft engines of the time ran at low speeds to keep propeller tip speed below the speed of sound br Unlike the V engine configuration examples of which were used in De Dion Bouton Scripps Booth and Cadillac automobiles by no straight eight engines were used in production cars before br br br Inter war period br br br Luxury automobiles br br Italy s Isotta Fraschini introduced the first production automobile straight eight in their Tipo at the Paris Salon in Leyland Motors introduced their OHC straight eight powered Leyland Eight luxury car at the International Motor Exhibition at Olympia London in The Duesenberg brothers introduced their first production straight eight in p br Straight eight engines were used in expensive luxury and performance vehicles until after World War II Bugattis and Duesenbergs commonly used double overhead cam straight eight engines Other notable straight eight powered automobiles were built by Daimler Mercedes Benz Isotta Fraschini Alfa Romeo Stutz Stearns Knight and Packard One marketing feature of these engines was their impressive length some of the Duesenberg engines were over ft m long resulting in the long hoods bonnets found on these automobiles br br br Premium automobiles in the United States br In the United States in the s automobile manufacturers including Hupmobile Chandler Marmon Gardner Kissel Locomobile and Auburn began using straight eight engines in cars targeted at the middle class Engine manufacturer Lycoming built straight eight engines for sale to automobile manufacturers including Gardner Auburn Kissel and Locomobile Hupmobile built their own engine Lycoming was purchased by Auburn owner Errett Lobban Cord who used a Lycoming straight eight in his front drive Cord L automobile and had Lycoming build the straight eight engine for the Duesenberg Model J which had been designed by the Duesenberg brothers for the Cord owned Duesenberg Inc The automobile manufacturers within the Cord Corporation comprising Auburn Cord and Duesenberg were shut down in Lycoming continues to this day as an aircraft engine manufacturer br br In the late s volume sellers Hudson and Studebaker introduced straight eight engines for the premium vehicles in their respective lines They were followed in the early s by Nash with a dual ignition unit REO and the Buick Oldsmobile and Pontiac divisions of General Motors br The Buick straight eight was an overhead valve design while the Oldsmobile straight and Pontiac straight straight eights were flathead engines Chevrolet as an entry level marque did not have a straight eight Cadillac the luxury brand of General Motors stayed with their traditional V engines In order to have engines as smooth as the straight eights of its competitors Cadillac introduced the crossplane crankshaft for its V and added V and V engines to the top of its lineup br Ford never adopted the straight eight their entry level Ford cars used flathead V engines until the s while their Lincoln luxury cars used V from the s to the s and V engines in the s and s Chrysler used flathead straight eights in its premium Chrysler cars including the Imperial luxury model br br br Airships br The British R rigid airship was fitted with five Beardmore Tornado Mk I inline eight cylinder diesel engines These engines were intended to give an output of bhp kW at rpm but in practice had a continuous output rating of only bhp kW at rpm br br br Post war br br After World War II changes in the automobile market resulted in the decline and final extinction of the straight eight as an automobile engine The primary users of the straight eight were American luxury and premium cars that were carried over from before the war A Flxible inter city bus used the Buick straight eight br During World War II improvements in the refinery technology used to produce aviation gasoline resulted in the availability of large amounts of inexpensive high octane gasoline Engines could be designed with higher compression ratios to take advantage of high octane gasoline This led to more highly stressed engines which amplified the limitations of the long crankshaft and camshaft in the straight eight engines br br Oldsmobile replaced their straight eight flathead engine with an overhead valve V engine in at which time Cadillac s V was changed to one with overhead valves Chrysler replaced its straight eight with its famous Hemi V for Hudson retired its straight eight at the end of the model year Buick introduced a bore stroke in L V in with similar displacement as their bore stroke in L straight the latter being produced until the end of the model year Pontiac maintained production on their straight eight as well as a L head inline six through the end of the model year after which a V became standard Packard ended production of their signature straight eight at the end of replacing it with an overhead valve V br By the end of the s overhead valve V s powered of automobiles built in the US and most of the rest had six cylinder engines pp br In Europe many automobile factories had been destroyed during World War II and it took many years before war devastated economies recovered enough to make large cars popular again The change in the design of cars from a long engine compartment between separate fenders to the modern configuration with its shorter engine compartment quickly led to the demise of the straight engine As a result of this and of gasoline prices several times as expensive as in the U S four and six cylinder engines powered the majority of cars in Europe and the few eight cylinder cars produced were in the V configuration pp br br br Military use br The British Army selected Rolls Royce B series of straight eight engines in the Alvis FV armoured vehicle family The Alvis Saladin armoured car was a x design with the engine compartment in the rear a mm low pressure gun turret in the centre and the driver in front The Saracen armoured personnel carrier had the engine in front with the driver in the centre and space for up to nine troops in the rear The Stalwart amphibious logistics carrier has the driver s compartment over the front wheels the larger B engine in the rear and a large load compartment over the middle and rear The Salamander firefighting vehicle was unarmoured and resembled the Stalwart with a conventional fire engine superstructure br The Rolls Royce B series of engines were also used in other military and civilian applications such as the Leyland Martian military truck the winch engine in the Centurion ARV and various Dennis fire engines br br br Performance and racing cars br br Despite the shortcomings of length weight bearing friction and torsional vibrations that led to the straight eight s post war demise the straight eight was the performance engine design of choice from the late s to the late s and continued to excel in motorsport until the mid s Bugatti Duesenberg Alfa Romeo Mercedes Benz and Miller built successful racing cars with high performance dual overhead camshaft straight eight engines in the s and s br The Duesenberg brothers introduced the first successful straight eight racing engine in when their L engine placed third fourth and sixth at the Indianapolis The following year one of their cars won the French Grand Prix while two others placed fourth and sixth in the race Based on work the company had done on cylinder aircraft engines during World War I the overhead camshaft three valve per cylinder engine produced brake horsepower kW at rpm and was capable of revving to an astonishing at the time rpm No Grand Prix engine before the war had peaked at more than rpm pp br Bugatti experimented with straight eight engines from and in he introduced the L Bugatti Type one of the most successful racing cars of all time which eventually won over races Like the Duesenbergs Bugatti got his ideas from building aircraft engines during World War I and like them his engine was a high revving overhead camshaft unit with three valves per cylinder It produced bhp kW at rpm and could be revved to over rpm Nearly of the Type and its derivatives were produced an all time record for Grand Prix motor racing pp br br Alfa Romeo were the first to react to the engineering problems of the straight eight in their racing car engines for the P and P and in their Alfa Romeo C sports cars of Mille Miglia and Le Mans fame the camshaft drive had been moved to the engine centre between cylinders four and five thus reducing the aforementioned limitations The straight eight was actually built as a symmetrical pair of straight four engines joined in the middle at common gear trains for the camshafts and superchargers It had two overhead camshafts but only two valves per cylinder pp br The Alfa Romeo straight eight would return after World War II to dominate the first season of Formula One racing in and to win the second season against competition from Ferrari s V powered car in The Alfa Romeo Alfetta was originally designed in and won of Grands Prix entered between and with a six year gap in the middle caused by the war By their L supercharged engines could produce bhp kW at rpm and could rev as high as rpm However the engines were at the end of their potential and rule changes for the season made the Alfettas obsolete pp br Mercedes Benz would create the last notable straight eight racing cars in with the championship winning W Formula One racing car and the SLR sports racing car The SLR was famous for Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson s victory in the Mille Miglia but notorious for Pierre Levegh s deadly accident at the Hours of Le Mans The SLR was the final development of the Alfa Romeo design of the early s as not only the camshaft but now also the gearbox was driven from the engine s centre Engineers calculated that torsional stresses would be too high if they took power from the end of the long crankshaft so they put a central gear train in the middle which also ran the dual camshafts dual magnetos and other accessories and ran a drive shaft to the clutch housing at the rear pp br br br See also br List of GM engines br br br br br br Websites br Davies John William Welsh Motor Sport Cars John William Davies Archived from the original on
