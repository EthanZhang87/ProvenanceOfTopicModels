The General Motors Detroit Diesel V engine is a series of diesel V engines first introduced by General Motors for their C K pickup trucks in Developed in collaboration with GM subsidiary Detroit Diesel the engine family was produced by GM through when it was replaced by the new Duramax line AM General s subsidiary General Engine Products GEP still produces a military variant of this engine for the HMMWV br The General Motors light truck L and L diesel engines were optional in many through full size GM pickups SUVs and vans They were also available in motor homes The engine was standard on AM General s military HMMWV civilian Hummer H and the s GM military Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle br br br L br br The original L cu in diesel V was introduced in for the Chevrolet C K and was produced until The L diesel emerged as a high fuel economy alternative to the V gasoline engine lineup and achieved better mileage than Chevrolet s L V gasoline engine of the s at a time when the market was focused on power rather than efficiency However it was designed to easily install in place of the gasoline V using the same mounting and attachments for transmissions as all GM truck engines Overall weight for the complete engine is slightly heavier than the L V big block gasoline engine There were about L diesel engines which were placed into door cars in prior to official production These were then given to the United States government and issued to various federal agencies and military branches These were used as testbeds regarding long term fuel economy and

turbocharger This engine was never meant to be a power and torque competitor with Ford International and Dodge Cummins but rather a simply designed workhorse engine that made credible power achieved decent fuel economy and met emission standards in half ton trucks The Duramax replaced the in light trucks beginning in and the C HD medium duty cab and chassis replaced by the C Kodiak TopKick and vans beginning in but the Optimizer is still produced by AM General for the HMMWV br There are several GM liter diesel engine production options The turbocharged L VIN S was used in ton and light duty ton Heavy duty ton and ton trucks used the turbocharged L VIN F engine The L is emissions controlled with EGR and catalytic converters The L engine has neither an EGR system nor a catalytic converter but there is a soot trap on L engines that is often mistaken for a catalytic converter GM was the first manufacturer to introduce an electronically controlled fuel injection system into a diesel pickup truck The L VIN P and L VIN Y are both naturally aspirated engines L is listed as HO or Heavy Duty Additional RPO codes are LQM hp kW and LQN hp kW br Changes were made by GM to the in their light trucks for emissions or reliability improvement The model years used a specific Stanadyne DB mechanical injection pump GM replaced the DB with the electronic throttle DS in vehicles In mid GM implemented a redesigned engine cooling system incorporating twin non bypass blocking thermostats and a US gallon per minute liter per minute water pump This improved the flow through the block by and

pump feeds a Stanadyne rotary distributor injection pump at low pressure The distributor injection pump controls both metering via an internal centrifugal governor and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps Near the top of the compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors This is called indirect injection GM used fully mechanical DB series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and s and s From until end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS series of injection pumps in its light trucks A mechanical DB series injection pump can be found on some L marine engines br br br Common problems br Main Bearing Web Crack In both L and L engines this is reportedly fixed with a combination of improved higher nickel cast iron alloy and lower block re design including but not limited to a main bearing girdle These features are in the new for AM General GEP P Optimizer enhanced L diesel presently being sold to the U S government for the ton armored HMMWV br Crank Failure Related to age failures of the harmonic balancer the vibration dampened accessory drive pulley or the dual mass flywheel br Pump Mounted Driver Relates to thermal failures The PMD is screwed to the DS injection pump on the L diesel utilizing fuel flow to dissipate heat The injection pump is mounted in the intake valley a high heat area The PMD contains two power transistors that should be cooled by proper contact with the injection pump body If the pump is not precisely machined to make complete contact with the transistors via the silicone thermal gasket and paste the PMD is improperly installed without the gasket or paste the PMD is installed off center with the pump body or corrosion develops on the mounting surface the PMD will overheat Several companies manufacture an extension harness and heat sink kits These allow an owner or a mechanic to relocate the PMD away from the injection pump to a lower heat environment or a place that can get more air flow br Cylinder Head Cracking Higher mileage engines can exhibit stress related fractures in the cylinder head bowl Stronger cylinder heads remedy this problem br Oil Cooler Line Failure Stock s GM oil cooler lines are held together by a C clip at the engine block and since the engine has no low oil pressure shutoff switch if one clip fails the engine loses its oil and seizes Aftermarket oil cooler lines that utilize compression fittings rectify this br br br br br br External links br br DB Injection Pump
