title: Rotary engine
id: 26103
The rotary engine is an early type of internal combustion engine usually designed with an odd number of cylinders per row in a radial configuration The engine s crankshaft remained stationary in operation while the entire crankcase and its attached cylinders rotated around it as a unit Its main application was in aviation although it also saw use in a few early motorcycles and automobiles br This type of engine was widely used as an alternative to conventional inline engines straight or V during World War I and the years immediately preceding that conflict It has been described as a very efficient solution to the problems of power output weight and reliability br By the early s the inherent limitations of this type of engine had rendered it obsolete br br br Description br br br Distinction between rotary and radial engines br A rotary engine is essentially a standard Otto cycle engine with cylinders arranged radially around a central crankshaft just like a conventional radial engine but instead of having a fixed cylinder block with rotating crankshaft the crankshaft remains stationary and the entire cylinder block rotates around it In the most common form the crankshaft was fixed solidly to the airframe and the propeller was simply bolted to the front of the crankcase br br This difference also has much impact on design lubrication ignition fuel admission cooling etc and functioning see below br The Mus e de l Air et de l Espace in Paris has on display a special sectioned working model of an engine with seven radially disposed cylinders It alternates between rotary and radial modes to demonstrate the difference between the internal motions of the two types of engine br br br Arrangement br Like fixed radial engines rotaries were generally built with an odd number of cylinders usually or so that a consistent every other piston firing order could be maintained to provide smooth running Rotary engines with an even number of cylinders were mostly of the two row type br Most rotary engines were arranged with the cylinders pointing outwards from a single crankshaft in the same general form as a radial but there were also rotary boxer engines and even one cylinder rotaries br br br Advantages and drawbacks br Three key factors contributed to the rotary engine s success at the time br br Smooth running Rotaries delivered power very smoothly because relative to the engine mounting point there are no reciprocating parts and the relatively large rotating mass of the crankcase cylinders as a unit acted as a flywheel br Improved cooling when the engine was running the rotating crankcase cylinder assembly created its own fast moving cooling airflow even with the aircraft at rest br Weight advantage rotaries shared with other radial configuration engines the advantage of a small flat crankcase The superior air cooling imparted by the moving engine also meant that cylinders could be made with thinner walls and shallower cooling fins Their power to weight ratio was further enhanced in comparison with engines that required an added flywheel for smooth running br Engine designers had always been aware of the many limitations of the rotary engine so when static style engines became more reliable and gave better specific weights and fuel consumption the days of the rotary engine were numbered br br Rotary engines had a fundamentally inefficient total loss oiling system In order to reach the whole engine the lubricating medium needed to enter the crankcase through the hollow crankshaft but the centrifugal force of the revolving crankcase was directly opposed to any re circulation The only practical solution was for the lubricant to be aspirated with the fuel air mixture as in most two stroke engines br Power increase also came with mass and size increases multiplying gyroscopic precession from the rotating mass of the engine Thus aircraft with these engines had stability and control problems especially for inexperienced pilots br Power output increasingly went into overcoming the air resistance of the spinning engine br Engine controls were tricky see below and resulted in fuel waste br The late World War I Bentley BR was the largest and most powerful rotary engine it reached a point beyond which this type of engine could not be further developed and it was the last of its kind to be adopted into RAF service br br br Rotary engine control br br br Monosoupape rotaries br It is often asserted that rotary engines had no throttle and hence power could only be reduced by intermittently cutting the ignition using a blip switch This was only true of the Monosoupape single valve type which took most of the air into the cylinder through the exhaust valve which remained open for a portion of the downstroke of the piston Thus the mixture of fuel and air in the cylinder could not be controlled via the crankcase intake The throttle fuel valve of a monosoupape provided only a limited degree of speed regulation as opening it made the mixture too rich while closing it made it too lean in either case quickly stalling the engine or damaging the cylinders Early models featured a pioneering form of variable valve timing in an attempt to give greater control but this caused the valves to burn and therefore it was abandoned br The only way of running a Monosoupape engine smoothly at reduced revs was with a switch that changed the normal firing sequence so that each cylinder fired only once per two or three engine revolutions but the engine remained more or less in balance As with excessive use of the blip switch running the engine on such a setting for too long resulted in large quantities of unburned fuel and oil in the exhaust and gathering in the lower cowling where it was a notorious fire hazard br br br Normal rotaries br Most rotaries had normal inlet valves so that the fuel and lubricating oil was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air as in a normal four stroke engine Although a conventional carburetor with the ability to keep the fuel air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings was precluded by the spinning crankcase it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or bloctube The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting usually full open and then adjust the fuel air mixture to suit using a separate fine adjustment lever that controlled the air supply valve in the manner of a manual choke control Due to the rotary engine s large rotational inertia it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel air mixture by trial and error without stalling it although this varied between different types of engine and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to idle the air valve was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained br Throttling a running engine back to reduce revs was possible by closing off the fuel valve to the required position while re adjusting the fuel air mixture to suit This process was also tricky so that reducing power especially when landing was often accomplished instead by intermittently cutting the ignition using the blip switch br Cutting cylinders using ignition switches had the drawback of letting fuel continue to pass through the engine oiling up the spark plugs and making smooth restarting problematic Also the raw oil fuel mix could collect in the cowling As this could cause a serious fire when the switch was released it became common practice for part or all of the bottom of the basically circular cowling on most rotary engines to be cut away or fitted with drainage slots br By a Clerget handbook advised maintaining all necessary control by using the fuel and air controls and starting and stopping the engine by turning the fuel on and off The recommended landing procedure involved shutting off the fuel using the fuel lever while leaving the blip switch on The windmilling propeller made the engine continue to spin without delivering any power as the aircraft descended It was important to leave the ignition on to allow the spark plugs to continue to spark and keep them from oiling up so that the engine could if all went well be restarted simply by re opening the fuel valve Pilots were advised to not use an ignition cut out switch as it would eventually damage the engine br Pilots of surviving or reproduction aircraft fitted with rotary engines still find that the blip switch is useful while landing as it provides a more reliable quicker way to initiate power if needed rather than risk a sudden engine stall or the failure of a windmilling engine to restart at the worst possible moment br br br History br br br Millet br br F lix Millet showed a cylinder rotary engine built into a bicycle wheel at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in Millet had patented the engine in so must be considered the pioneer of the internal combustion rotary engine A machine powered by his engine took part in the Paris Bordeaux Paris race of and the system was put into production by Darracq and Company London in br br br Hargrave br Lawrence Hargrave first developed a rotary engine in using compressed air intending to use it in powered flight Materials weight and lack of quality machining prevented it becoming an effective power unit br br br Balzer br Stephen M Balzer of New York a former watchmaker constructed rotary engines in the s He was interested in the rotary layout for two main reasons br br To generate hp kW at the low rpm at which the engines of the day ran the pulse resulting from each combustion stroke was quite large To damp out these pulses engines needed a large flywheel which added weight In the rotary design the engine acted as its own flywheel thus rotaries could be lighter than similarly sized conventional engines br The cylinders had good cooling airflow over them even when the aircraft was at rest which was important as the low airspeed of aircraft of the time provided limited cooling airflow and alloys of the day were less advanced Balzer s early designs even dispensed with cooling fins though subsequent rotaries did have this common feature of air cooled engines br Balzer produced a cylinder rotary engined car in then later became involved in Langley s Aerodrome attempts which bankrupted him while he tried to make much larger versions of his engines Balzer s rotary engine was later converted to static radial operation by Langley s assistant Charles M Manly creating the notable Manly Balzer engine br br br De Dion Bouton br The famous De Dion Bouton company produced an experimental cylinder rotary engine in Though intended for aviation use it was not fitted to any aircraft br br br Adams Farwell br br The Adams Farwell firm s automobiles with the firm s first rolling prototypes using cylinder rotary engines designed by Fay Oliver Farwell in led to production Adams Farwell cars with first the cylinder then very shortly thereafter cylinder rotary engines later in as another early American automaker utilizing rotary engines expressly manufactured for automotive use Emil Berliner sponsored its development of the cylinder Adams Farwell rotary engine design concept as a lightweight power unit for his unsuccessful helicopter experiments Adams Farwell engines later powered fixed wing aircraft in the US after It has also been asserted that the Gn me design was derived from the Adams Farwell since an Adams Farwell car is reported to have been demonstrated to the French Army in In contrast to the later Gn me engines and much like the later Clerget B and Bentley BR aviation rotaries the Adams Farwell rotaries had conventional exhaust and inlet valves mounted in the cylinder heads br br br Gnome br br The Gnome engine was the work of the three Seguin brothers Louis Laurent and Augustin They were talented engineers and the grandsons of famous French engineer Marc Seguin In the eldest brother Louis had formed the Soci t des Moteurs Gnome to build stationary engines for industrial use having licensed production of the Gnom single cylinder stationary engine from Motorenfabrik Oberursel who in turn built licensed Gnome engines for German aircraft during World War I br Louis was joined by his brother Laurent who designed a rotary engine specifically for aircraft use using Gnom engine cylinders The brothers first experimental engine is said to have been a cylinder model that developed hp kW and was a radial rather than rotary engine but no photographs survive of the five cylinder experimental model The Seguin brothers then turned to rotary engines in the interests of better cooling and the world s first production rotary engine the cylinder air cooled hp kW Omega was shown at the Paris automobile show The first Gnome Omega built still exists and is now in the collection of the Smithsonian s National Air and Space Museum The Seguins used the highest strength material available recently developed nickel steel alloy and kept the weight down by machining components from solid metal using the best American and German machine tools to create the engine s components the cylinder wall of a hp Gnome was only mm inches thick while the connecting rods were milled with deep central channels to reduce weight While somewhat low powered in terms of units of power per litre its power to weight ratio was an outstanding hp kW per kg br The following year the inventor Roger Ravaud fitted one to his A roscaphe a combination hydrofoil aircraft which he entered in the motor boat and aviation contests at Monaco Henry Farman s use of the Gnome at the famous Rheims aircraft meet that year brought it to prominence when he won the Grand Prix for the greatest non stop distance flown kilometres mi and also set a world record for endurance flight The very first successful seaplane flight of Henri Fabre s Le Canard was powered by a Gnome Omega on March near Marseille br Production of Gnome rotaries increased rapidly with some being produced before World War I and Gnome also produced a two row version the h p Double Omega the larger hp Gnome Lambda and the hp two row Double Lambda By the standards of other engines of the period the Gnome was considered not particularly temperamental and was credited as the first engine able to run for ten hours between overhauls br In the Seguin brothers introduced the new Monosoupape single valve series which replaced inlet valves in the pistons by using a single valve in each cylinder head which doubled as inlet and exhaust valve The engine speed was controlled by varying the opening time and extent of the exhaust valves using levers acting on the valve tappet rollers a system later abandoned due to valves burning The weight of the Monosoupape was slightly less than the earlier two valve engines and it used less lubricating oil The hp Monosoupape was built with cylinders and developed its rated power at rpm The later hp nine cylinder Gnome N rotary engine used the Monosoupape valve design while adding the safety factor of a dual ignition system and was the last known rotary engine design to use such a cylinder head valving format The N also featured an unusual ignition setup that allowed output values of one half one quarter and one eighth power levels to be achieved through use of the coupe switch and a special five position rotary switch that selected which of the trio of alternate power levels would be selected when the coupe switch was depressed allowing it to cut out all spark voltage to all nine cylinders at evenly spaced intervals to achieve the multiple levels of power reduction The airworthy reproduction Fokker D VIII parasol monoplane fighter at Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome uniquely powered with a Gnome N often demonstrates the use of its Gnome N s four level output capability in both ground runs and in flight br br Rotary engines produced by the Clerget and Le Rh ne companies used conventional pushrod operated valves in the cylinder head but used the same principle of drawing the fuel mixture through the crankshaft with the Le Rh nes having prominent copper intake tubes running from the crankcase to the top of each cylinder to admit the intake charge br The hp kW seven cylinder Gnome was the standard at the outbreak of World War I as the Gnome Lambda and it quickly found itself being used in a large number of aircraft designs It was so good that it was licensed by a number of companies including the German Motorenfabrik Oberursel firm who designed the original Gnom engine Oberursel was later purchased by Fokker whose hp Gnome Lambda copy was known as the Oberursel U It was not at all uncommon for French Gn me Lambdas as used in the earliest examples of the Bristol Scout biplane to meet German versions powering Fokker E I Eindeckers in combat from the latter half of on br The only attempts to produce twin row rotary engines in any volume were undertaken by Gnome with their Double Lambda fourteen cylinder hp design and with the German Oberursel firm s early World War I clone of the Double Lambda design the U III of the same power rating While an example of the Double Lambda went on to power one of the Deperdussin Monocoque racing aircraft to a world record speed of nearly km h mph in September the Oberursel U III is only known to have been fitted into a few German production military aircraft the Fokker E IV fighter monoplane and Fokker D III fighter biplane both of whose failures to become successful combat types were partially due to the poor quality of the German powerplant which was prone to wearing out after only a few hours of combat flight br br br World War I br br The favourable power to weight ratio of the rotaries was their greatest advantage While larger heavier aircraft relied almost exclusively on conventional in line engines many fighter aircraft designers preferred rotaries right up to the end of the war br Rotaries had a number of disadvantages notably very high fuel consumption partially because the engine was typically run at full throttle and also because the valve timing was often less than ideal Oil consumption was also very high Due to primitive carburetion and absence of a true sump the lubricating oil was added to the fuel air mixture This made engine fumes heavy with smoke from partially burnt oil Castor oil was the lubricant of choice as its lubrication properties were unaffected by the presence of the fuel and its gum forming tendency was irrelevant in a total loss lubrication system An unfortunate side effect was that World War I pilots inhaled and swallowed a considerable amount of the oil during flight leading to persistent diarrhoea Flying clothing worn by rotary engine pilots was routinely soaked with oil br The rotating mass of the engine also made it in effect a large gyroscope During level flight the effect was not especially apparent but when turning the gyroscopic precession became noticeable Due to the direction of the engine s rotation left turns required effort and happened relatively slowly combined with a tendency to nose up while right turns were almost instantaneous with a tendency for the nose to drop In some aircraft this could be advantageous in situations such as dogfights The Sopwith Camel suffered to such an extent that it required left rudder for both left and right turns and could be extremely hazardous if the pilot applied full power at the top of a loop at low airspeeds Trainee Camel pilots were warned to attempt their first hard right turns only at altitudes above ft m The Camel s most famous German foe the Fokker Dr I triplane also used a rotary engine usually the Oberursel Ur II clone of the French built Le Rhone J hp powerplant br Even before the First World War attempts were made to overcome the inertia problem of rotary engines As early as Charles Benjamin Redrup had demonstrated to the Royal Flying Corps at Hendon a Reactionless engine in which the crankshaft rotated in one direction and the cylinder block in the opposite direction each one driving a propeller A later development of this was the reactionless Hart engine designed by Redrup in which there was only one propeller connected to the crankshaft but it rotated in the opposite direction to the cylinder block thereby largely cancelling out negative effects This proved too complicated for reliable operation and Redrup changed the design to a static radial engine which was later tried in the experimental Vickers F B b and F B aircraft unfortunately without success br As the war progressed aircraft designers demanded ever increasing amounts of power Inline engines were able to meet this demand by improving their upper rev limits which meant more power Improvements in valve timing ignition systems and lightweight materials made these higher revs possible and by the end of the war the average engine had increased from rpm to The rotary was not able to do the same due to the drag of the rotating cylinders through the air For instance if an early war model of rpm increased its revs to only the drag on the cylinders increased as air drag increases with the square of velocity At lower rpm drag could simply be ignored but as the rev count rose the rotary was putting more and more power into spinning the engine with less remaining to provide useful thrust through the propeller br br br Siemens Halske bi rotary designs br One clever attempt to rescue the design in a similar manner to Redrup s British reactionless engine concept was made by Siemens The crankcase with the propeller still fastened directly to the front of it and cylinders spun counterclockwise at rpm as seen externally from a nose on viewpoint while the crankshaft which unlike other designs never emerged from the crankcase and other internal parts spun clockwise at the same speed so the set was effectively running at rpm This was achieved by the use of bevel gearing at the rear of the crankcase resulting in the eleven cylindered Siemens Halske Sh III with less drag and less net torque Used on several late war types notably the Siemens Schuckert D IV fighter the new engine s low running speed coupled with large coarse pitched propellers that sometimes had four blades as the SSW D IV used gave types powered by it outstanding rates of climb with some examples of the late production Sh IIIa powerplant even said to be delivering as much as hp br One new rotary powered aircraft Fokker s own D VIII was designed at least in part to provide some use for the Oberursel factory s backlog of otherwise redundant hp kW Ur II engines themselves clones of the Le Rh ne J rotary br Because of the Allied blockade of shipping the Germans were increasingly unable to obtain the castor oil necessary to properly lubricate their rotary engines Substitutes were never entirely satisfactory causing increased running temperatures and reduced engine life br br br Postwar br By the time the war ended the rotary engine had become obsolete and it disappeared from use quite quickly The British Royal Air Force probably used rotary engines for longer than most other operators The RAF s standard post war fighter the Sopwith Snipe used the Bentley BR rotary as the most powerful at some hp kW rotary engine ever built by the Allies of World War I The standard RAF training aircraft of the early post war years the origin Avro K had a universal mounting to allow the use of several different types of low powered rotary of which there was a large surplus supply Similarly the Swedish FVM Tummelisa advanced training aircraft fitted with a Le Rhone Thulin hp kW rotary engine served until the mid thirties br Designers had to balance the cheapness of war surplus engines against their poor fuel efficiency and the operating expense of their total loss lubrication system and by the mid s rotaries had been more or less completely displaced even in British service largely by the new generation of air cooled stationary radials such as the Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar and Bristol Jupiter br Experiments with the concept of the rotary engine continued br The first version of the Michel engine an unusual opposed piston cam engine used the principle of a rotary engine in that its cylinder block rotated This was soon replaced by a version with the same cylinders and cam but with stationary cylinders and the cam track rotating in lieu of a crankshaft A later version abandoned the cam altogether and used three coupled crankshafts br By the Soviet helicopter pioneers Boris N Yuriev and Alexei M Cheremukhin both employed by Tsentralniy Aerogidrodinamicheskiy Institut TsAGI the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute constructed one of the first practical single lift rotor machines with their TsAGI EA single rotor helicopter powered by two Soviet designed and built M rotary engines themselves up rated copies of the Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine of World War I The TsAGI EA set an unofficial altitude record of meters ft with Cheremukhin piloting it on August on the power of its twinned M rotary engines br br br Use in cars and motorcycles br Although rotary engines were mostly used in aircraft a few cars and motorcycles were built with rotary engines Perhaps the first was the Millet motorcycle of A famous motorcycle winning many races was the Megola which had a rotary engine inside the front wheel Another motorcycle with a rotary engine was Charles Redrup s Redrup Radial which was a three cylinder cc rotary engine fitted to a number of motorcycles by Redrup br In the Barry engine also designed by Redrup was built in Wales a rotating cylinder boxer engine weighing kg was mounted inside a motorcycle frame br The early s German Megola motorcycle used a five cylinder rotary engine within its front wheel design br In the s Cyril Pullin developed the Powerwheel a wheel with a rotating one cylinder engine clutch and drum brake inside the hub but it never entered production br br br Other rotary engines br Besides the configuration of cylinders moving around a fixed crankshaft several different engine designs are also called rotary engines The most notable pistonless rotary engine the Wankel rotary engine has been used by NSU in the Ro car by Mazda in a variety of cars such as the RX series and in some experimental aviation applications br In the late s a concept engine called the Bricklin Turner Rotary Vee was tested The Rotary Vee is similar in configuration to the elbow steam engine Piston pairs connect as solid V shaped members with each end floating in a pair of rotating cylinders clusters The rotating cylinder cluster pairs are set with their axes at a wide V angle The pistons in each cylinder cluster move parallel to each other instead of a radial direction This engine design has not gone into production The Rotary Vee was intended to power the Bricklin SV br br br See also br Petrol engine br Monosoupape engine br
