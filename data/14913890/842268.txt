id: 842268
An O ring also known as a packing or a toric joint is a mechanical gasket in the shape of a torus it is a loop of elastomer with a round cross section designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts forming a seal at the interface br The O ring may be used in static applications or in dynamic applications where there is relative motion between the parts and the O ring Dynamic examples include rotating pump shafts and hydraulic cylinder pistons Static applications of O rings may include fluid or gas sealing applications in which the O ring is compressed resulting in zero clearance the O ring material is vulcanized solid such that it is impermeable to the fluid or gas and the O ring material is resistant to degradation by the fluid or gas The wide range of potential liquids and gases that need to be sealed has necessitated the development of a wide range of O ring materials br O rings are one of the most common seals used in machine design because they are inexpensive easy to make reliable and have simple mounting requirements They have been tested to seal up to psi MPa of pressure The maximum recommended pressure of an O ring seal depends on the seal hardness material cross sectional diameter and radial clearance br br br Manufacturing br O rings can be produced by extrusion injection molding pressure molding or transfer molding br br br History br The first patent for the O ring is dated May as a Swedish patent J O Lundberg the inventor of the O ring received the patent The US patent for the O ring was filed in by a then year old Danish born machinist Niels Christensen In his previously filed application in resulting in Patent he opens by saying This invention relates to new and useful improvements in hydraulic brakes and more particularly to an improved seal for the pistons of power conveying cylinders He describes a circular section ring made of solid rubber or rubber composition and explains this sliding or partial rolling of the ring kneads or works the material of the ring to keep it alive and pliable without deleterious effects of scuffing which are caused by purely static sliding of rubber upon a surface By this slight turning or kneading action the life of the ring is prolonged His application filed in says that it is a continuation in part of my copending application Serial No for Hydraulic brakes filed December now U S Patent No granted April br Soon after migrating to the United States in he patented an air brake system for streetcars trams Despite his legal efforts the patents were passed from company to company until they ended up at Westinghouse During World War II the US government commandeered the O ring patent as a critical war related item and gave the right to manufacture to other organizations Christensen received a lump sum payment of US for his efforts Litigation resulted in a payment to his heirs in years after his death br br br Theory and design br br O rings are available in various metric and inch standard sizes Sizes are specified by the inside diameter and the cross section diameter thickness In the US the most common standard inch sizes are per SAE AS C specification e g AS ISO contains the most commonly used standard sizes both inch and metric worldwide The UK also has standards sizes known as BS sizes typically ranging from BS to BS Several other size specifications also exist br br br Typical applications br Successful O ring joint design requires a rigid mechanical mounting that applies a predictable deformation to the O ring This introduces a calculated mechanical stress at the O ring contacting surfaces As long as the pressure of the fluid being contained does not exceed the contact stress of the O ring leaking cannot occur The pressure of the contained fluid transfers through the essentially incompressible O ring material and the contact stress rises with increasing pressure For this reason an O ring can easily seal high pressure as long as it does not fail mechanically The most common failure is extrusion through the mating parts br The seal is designed to have a point contact between the O ring and sealing faces This allows a high local stress able to contain high pressure without exceeding the yield stress of the O ring body The flexible nature of O ring materials accommodates imperfections in the mounting parts But it is still important to maintain good surface finish of those mating parts especially at low temperatures where the seal rubber reaches its glass transition temperature and becomes increasingly inflexible and glassy Surface finish is also especially important in dynamic applications A surface finish that is too rough will abrade the surface of the O ring and a surface that is too smooth will not allow the seal to be adequately lubricated by a fluid film br br br Vacuum applications br In vacuum applications the permeability of the material renders the point contacts unusable Instead higher mounting forces are used and the ring fills the whole groove Also round back up rings are used to save the ring from excessive deformation br Because the ring is subject to the ambient pressure and the partial pressure of gases only at the seal their gradients will be steep near the seal and shallow in the bulk opposite to the gradient of the contact stress See Vacuum flange KF FQF High vacuum systems below Torr use copper or nickel O rings Also vacuum systems that have to be immersed in liquid nitrogen use indium O rings because rubber becomes hard and brittle at low temperatures br br br High temperature applications br In some high temperature applications O rings may need to be mounted in a tangentially compressed state to compensate for the Gow Joule effect br br br Sizes br O rings come in a variety of sizes Society of Automotive Engineers SAE Aerospace Standard AS specifies the inside diameters cross sections tolerances and size identification codes dash numbers for O rings

polar solvents glycol based brake fluids and low molecular weight organic acids In addition to the standard FKM materials a number of specialty materials with different monomer compositions and fluorine content to are available that offer improved chemical or temperature resistance and or better low temperature performance br Nitrile rubber NBR HNBR HSN Buna N a common material for o rings because of its good mechanical properties its resistance to lubricants and greases and its relatively low cost The physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are determined by the acrylonitrile ACN content of the base polymer low content ensures good flexibility at low temperatures but offers limited resistance to oils and fuels As the ACN content increases the low temperature flexibility reduces and the resistance to oils and fuels improves Physical and chemical resistance properties of NBR materials are also affected by the cure system of the polymer Peroxide cured materials have improved physical properties chemical resistance and thermal properties as compared to sulfur donor cured materials Standard grades of NBR are typically resistant to mineral oil based

section there are now variations in cross section design The shape can have different profiles such as an x shaped profile commonly called the X ring Q ring or by the trademarked name Quad Ring When squeezed upon installation they seal with contact surfaces small contact surfaces on the top and bottom This contrasts with the standard O ring s comparatively larger single contact surfaces top and bottom X rings are most commonly used in reciprocating applications where they provide reduced running and breakout friction and reduced risk of spiraling when compared to O rings br There are also rings with a square profile commonly called square cuts lathe cuts tabular cut or Square rings When O rings were selling at a premium because of the novelty lack of efficient manufacturing processes and high labor content Square rings were introduced as an economical substitution for O rings The square ring is typically manufactured by molding an elastomer sleeve which is then lathe cut This style of seal is sometimes less expensive to manufacture with certain materials and molding technologies compression molding transfer molding injection molding especially in low volumes The physical sealing performance of square rings in static applications is superior to that of O rings however in dynamic applications it is inferior to that of O rings Square rings are usually used only in dynamic applications as energizers in cap seal assemblies Square rings can also be more difficult to install than O rings br Similar devices with a non round cross sections are called seals packings or gaskets See also washers br Automotive cylinder heads are typically sealed by flat gaskets faced with copper br Knife edges pressed into copper gaskets are used for high vacuum br Elastomers or soft metals that solidify in place are used as seals br br br Failure modes br O ring materials may be subjected to high or low temperatures chemical attack vibration abrasion and movement Elastomers are selected according to the situation br There are O ring materials which can tolerate temperatures as low as F C or as high as F C At the low end nearly all engineering materials become rigid and fail to seal at the high end the materials often burn or decompose Chemical attack can degrade the material start brittle cracks or cause it to swell For example NBR seals can crack when exposed to ozone gas at very low concentrations unless protected Swelling by contact with a low viscosity fluid causes an increase in dimensions and also lowers the tensile strength of the rubber Other failures can be caused by using the wrong size of ring for a specific recess which may cause extrusion of the rubber br Elastomers are sensitive to ionizing radiation In typical applications O rings are well protected from less penetrating radiation such as ultraviolet and soft X rays but more penetrating radiation such as neutrons may cause rapid deterioration In such environments soft metal seals are used br There are a few common reasons for O ring failure br br Installation damage This is caused by improper installation of the O ring br Spiral failure Found on long stroke piston seals and to a lesser degree on rod seals The seal gets hung up at one point on its diameter against the cylinder wall and slides and rolls at the same time This twists the O ring as the sealed device is cycled and finally causes a series of deep spiral cuts typically at a degree angle on the surface of the seal br Explosive decompression An O ring embolism also called gas expansion rupture occurs when high pressure gas becomes trapped inside the elastomeric seal element This expansion causes blisters and ruptures on the surface of the seal br br br Space Shuttle Challenger disaster br br The failure of an O ring seal was determined to be the cause of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on January A crucial factor was cold weather prior to the launch This was famously demonstrated on television by Caltech physics professor Richard Feynman when he placed a small O ring into ice cold water and subsequently showed its loss of flexibility before an investigative committee br The material of the failed O ring was FKM which was specified by the shuttle motor contractor Morton Thiokol When an O ring is cooled below its glass transition temperature Tg it loses its elasticity and becomes brittle More importantly when an O ring is cooled near but not beyond its Tg the cold O ring once compressed will take longer than normal to return to its original shape O rings and all other seals work by producing positive pressure against a surface thereby preventing leaks On the night before the launch exceedingly low air temperatures were recorded Due to this NASA technicians performed an inspection the ambient temperature was within launch parameters and the launch sequence was allowed to proceed However the temperature of the rubber O rings remained significantly lower than that of the surrounding air During his investigation of the launch footage Feynman observed a small out gassing event from the Solid Rocket Booster at the joint between two segments in the moments immediately preceding the disaster This was blamed on a failed O ring seal The escaping high temperature gas impinged upon the external tank and the entire vehicle was destroyed as a result br Since the accident rubber production companies have enacted changes Many O rings now come with batch and cure date coding as is done in medicine production to precisely track and control distribution For aerospace and military applications O rings are usually individually packaged and labeled with the material cure date and batch information O rings can if needed be recalled off the shelf Furthermore O rings and other seals are routinely batch tested for quality control by the manufacturers and often undergo quality assurance testing several more times by the distributor and ultimate end users br As for the boosters themselves NASA and Morton Thiokol redesigned them with a new joint design which now incorporated three O rings instead of two with the joints themselves having onboard heaters that can be turned on when temperatures drop below F C No O ring issues have occurred since Challenger and they did not play a role in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster of br br br Standards br br br ISO Fluid
