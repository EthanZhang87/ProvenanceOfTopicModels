A W engine is a twelve cylinder piston engine where either three banks of four cylinders or four banks of three cylinders are arranged in a W configuration around a common crankshaft br W engines with three banks of four cylinders were used by several aircraft engines from until the s A three bank design was also used for an unsuccessful W engine which was intended to compete in Formula One in br W engines are less common than V engines as only a handful of automobile manufacturers use them br The WR engine has been produced by the Volkswagen Group since This four bank engine based on two VR engines with a common crankshaft has only been used in flagship high performance car models produced by the Volkswagen Group and by Spyker br br br Aircraft engines br The Napier Lion was a three bank design also called broad arrow design W engine produced in the United Kingdom from to the late s It had a capacity of litres cu in and produced kW hp As well as use in various military and racing airplanes the Lion was also used in land speed record cars such as the Napier Railton and the Napier Campbell Blue Bird and racing boats such as the Miss Britain III br During the s the Farman We aircraft engine was produced in France The We produced hp kW and was one of the company s best selling engines in the s br The Lorraine E Courlis is another W aircraft engine that was produced in France during the s and s br br br Motor racing engines br br For the Formula One season the Italian team Life Racing Engines built a three bank W engine with a displacement of L cu in The Life Racing Engine F used a central master connecting rod with a slave rod locating onto each side of the master rod rather than directly onto the crank pin This meant that there was no offset between the cylinders reducing the length of the crankpins The engine was used in rounds to of the season however it was unreliable and lacking in power and the car failed to pre qualify for any races The W engine was replaced by a third party V engine after round br br br Road car engines br br The only mass production W engine is the Volkswagen WR v a four bank design that was first released in The engine is constructed by mating two narrow angle VR engines at an inclined angle of The narrow angle of each set of cylinders allows just two overhead camshafts to drive each pair of banks so the WR engine has both a crankshaft design and the same number of camshafts as the V engine Where the VR is a staggered bank straight the WR in turn is a staggered bank V in terms of engineering design As a consequence it cannot be considered a true three block W engine in the manner of the Life F engine or the Napier Railton br Within Volkswagen the engine is designated a WR engine terminology in derivation of its use of the VR geometry for each bank Early Volkswagen and Audi cars using this engine were badged with a W with inset V to emphasise the engine design Later badging after approximately of cars with this engine did not make use of that particular badging leading to confusion of the staggered bank V with a true W engine in the public mind br The naturally aspirated variant of the WR engine has been used in the brands of Audi and Volkswagen In a twin turbocharged version of the WR engine was produced to be used exclusively in the Bentley Continental GT and Bentley Flying Spur br The WR engine has a very compact design for a cylinder engine with the overall size of the L cu in engine being smaller than Volkswagen s contemporary L cu in V engine br The first application of the Volkswagen WR was the Volkswagen W a mid engined concept car which set the hour world endurance record in with a distance of kilometres mi and an average speed of km h mph br The first production car to use the WR engine was the Audi A D The succeeding Audi A D and Audi A D also had the WR as an upgrade engine only for the long wheelbase variant the Audi A L W which was last available in the model year The Audi A L W with its all wheel drive was unique among its German contemporaries as cylinder rivals from BMW and Mercedes Benz used V engines with rear wheel drive br Other cars to use the WR engine are the present Bentley Continental GT present Bentley Flying Spur present Bentley Bentayga Volkswagen Phaeton W and the Volkswagen Touareg W The engine was also used in the Spyker C La Turbie and Spyker C Zagato low volume sports cars br br br
