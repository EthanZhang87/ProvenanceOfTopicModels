id: 58664
A gas turbine gas turbine engine or also known by its old name internal combustion turbine is a type of continuous flow internal combustion engine The main parts common to all gas turbine engines form the power producing part known as the gas generator or core and are in the direction of flow br br a rotating gas compressor br a combustor br a compressor driving turbine br Additional components have to be added to the gas generator to suit its application Common to all is an air inlet but with different configurations to suit the requirements of marine use land use or flight at speeds varying from stationary to supersonic A propelling nozzle is added to produce thrust for flight An extra turbine is added to drive a propeller turboprop or ducted fan turbofan to reduce fuel consumption by increasing propulsive efficiency at subsonic flight speeds An extra turbine is also required to drive a helicopter rotor or land vehicle transmission turboshaft marine propeller or electrical generator power turbine Greater thrust to weight ratio for flight is achieved with the addition of an afterburner br The basic operation of the gas turbine is a Brayton cycle with air as the working fluid atmospheric air flows through the compressor that brings it to higher pressure energy is then added by spraying fuel into the air and igniting it so that the combustion generates a high temperature flow this high temperature pressurized gas enters a turbine producing a shaft work output in the process used to drive the compressor the unused energy comes out in the exhaust gases that can be repurposed for external work such as directly producing thrust in a turbojet engine or rotating a second independent turbine known as a power turbine that can be connected to a fan propeller or electrical generator The purpose of the gas turbine determines the design so that the most desirable split of energy between the thrust and the shaft work is achieved The fourth step of the Brayton cycle cooling of the working fluid is omitted as gas turbines are open systems that do not reuse the same air br Gas turbines are used to power aircraft trains ships electrical generators pumps gas compressors and tanks br br br Timeline of development br br Earliest records of Hero s engine aeolipile It most likely served no practical purpose and was rather more of a curiosity nonetheless it demonstrated an important principle of physics that all modern turbine engines rely on br The Trotting Horse Lamp Chinese z um d ng was used by the Chinese at lantern fairs as early as the Northern Song dynasty When the lamp is lit the heated airflow rises and drives an impeller with horse riding figures attached on it whose shadows are then projected onto the outer screen of the lantern br The Smoke jack was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci Hot air from a fire rises through a single stage axial turbine rotor mounted in the exhaust duct of the fireplace and turns the roasting spit by gear chain connection br A patent was given to John Barber an Englishman for the first true gas turbine His invention had most of the elements present in the modern day gas turbines The turbine was designed to power a horseless carriage br Sir Charles Parsons patented the idea of propelling a ship with a steam turbine and built a demonstration vessel the Turbinia easily the fastest vessel afloat at the time br Charles Gordon Curtis patented the first gas turbine engine in the US br Sanford Alexander Moss submitted a thesis on gas turbines In Moss became an engineer for General Electric s Steam Turbine Department in Lynn Massachusetts While there he applied some of his concepts in the development of the turbocharger br A Norwegian gidius Elling built the first gas turbine that was able to produce more power than needed to run its own components which was considered an achievement in a time when knowledge about aerodynamics was limited Using rotary compressors and turbines it produced hp br A gas turbine engine designed by Franz Stolze based on his earlier patent application is built and tested in Berlin The Stolze gas turbine was too inefficient to sustain its own operation br The Armengaud Lemale gas turbine tested in France This was a relatively large machine which included a stage centrifugal compressor designed by Auguste Rateau and built by the Brown Boveri Company The gas turbine could sustain its own air compression but was too inefficient to produce useful work br Holzwarth gas turbine pulse combustion achieved kW hp br s The practical theory of gas flow through passages was developed into the more formal and applicable to turbines theory of gas flow past airfoils by A A Griffith resulting in the publishing in of An Aerodynamic Theory of Turbine Design Working testbed designs of axial turbines suitable for driving a propeller were developed by the Royal Aeronautical Establishment br Having found no interest from the RAF for his idea Frank Whittle patented the design for a centrifugal gas turbine for jet propulsion The first successful test run of his engine occurred in England in April br The Brown Boveri Company of Switzerland starts selling axial compressor and turbine turbosets as part of the turbocharged steam generating Velox boiler Following the gas turbine principle the steam evaporation tubes are arranged within the gas turbine combustion chamber the first Velox plant was erected in Mondeville Calvados France br The first constant flow industrial gas turbine is commissioned by the Brown Boveri Company and goes into service at Sun Oil s Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania US br Working proof of concept prototype turbojet engine runs in UK Frank Whittle s and Germany Hans von Ohain s Heinkel HeS Henry Tizard secures UK government funding for further development of Power Jets engine br The First MW utility power generation gas turbine is built by the Brown Boveri Company for an emergency power station in Neuch tel Switzerland The turbojet powered Heinkel He the world s first jet aircraft makes its first flight br Jendrassik Cs a turboprop engine made its first bench run The Cs was designed by Hungarian engineer Gy rgy Jendrassik and was intended to power a Hungarian twin engine heavy fighter the RMI Work on the Cs stopped in without the type having powered any aircraft br The Junkers Jumo engine enters full production powering the first German military jets such as the Messerschmitt Me This marks the beginning of the reign of gas turbines in the sky br National Gas Turbine Establishment formed from Power Jets and the RAE turbine division to bring together Whittle and Hayne Constant s work In Beznau Switzerland the first commercial reheated recuperated unit generating MW was commissioned br A Metropolitan Vickers G Gatric becomes the first marine gas turbine when it completes sea trials on the Royal Navy s M G B vessel The Gatric was an aeroderivative gas turbine based on the Metropolitan Vickers F jet engine br Siemens becomes the first manufacturer of large electricity producing gas turbines to incorporate single crystal turbine blade technology into their production models allowing higher operating temperatures and greater efficiency br Mitsubishi Heavy Industries tests the first efficiency combined cycle gas turbine the M J at its Takasago Hy go works br br br Theory of operation br br In an ideal gas turbine gases undergo four thermodynamic processes an isentropic compression an isobaric constant pressure combustion an isentropic expansion and isobaric heat rejection Together these make up the Brayton cycle also known as the constant pressure cycle It is distinguished from the Otto cycle in that all the processes compression ignition combustion exhaust occur at the same time continuously br In a real gas turbine mechanical energy is changed irreversibly due to internal friction and turbulence into pressure and thermal energy when the gas is compressed in either a centrifugal or axial compressor Heat is added in the combustion chamber and the specific volume of the gas increases accompanied by a slight loss in pressure During expansion through the stator and rotor passages in the turbine irreversible energy transformation once again occurs Fresh air is taken in in place of the heat rejection br Air is taken in by a compressor called a gas generator with either an axial or centrifugal design or a combination of the two This air is then ducted into the combustor section which can be of a annular can or can annular design In the combustor section roughly of the air from the compressor is ducted around the combustor itself for cooling purposes The remaining roughly the air is mixed with fuel and ignited by the already burning air fuel mixture which then expands producing power across the turbine This expansion of the mixture then leaves the combustor section and has its velocity increased across the turbine section to strike the turbine blades spinning the disc they are attached to thus creating useful power Of the power produced is solely used to power the gas generator The remaining power is used to power what the engine is being used for typically an aviation application being thrust in a turbojet driving the fan of a turbofan rotor or accessory of a turboshaft and gear reduction and propeller of a turboprop br If the engine has a power turbine added to drive an industrial generator or a helicopter rotor the exit pressure will be as close to the entry pressure as possible with only enough energy left to overcome the pressure losses in the exhaust ducting and expel the exhaust For a turboprop engine there will be a particular balance between propeller power and jet thrust which gives the most economical operation In a turbojet engine only enough pressure and energy is extracted from the flow to drive the compressor and other components The remaining high pressure gases are accelerated through a nozzle to provide a jet to propel an aircraft br The smaller the engine the higher the rotation rate of the shaft must be to attain the required blade tip speed Blade tip speed determines the maximum pressure ratios that can be obtained by the turbine and the compressor This in turn limits the maximum power and efficiency that can be obtained by the engine In order for tip speed to remain constant if the diameter of a rotor is reduced by half the rotational speed must double For example large jet engines operate around rpm while micro turbines spin as fast as rpm br Mechanically gas turbines can be considerably less complex than Reciprocating engines Simple turbines might have one main moving part the compressor shaft turbine rotor assembly with other moving parts in the fuel system This in turn can translate into price For instance costing for materials the Jumo proved cheaper than the Junkers piston engine which was and needed only hours of lower skill labor to complete including manufacture assembly and shipping compared to for the BMW This however also translated into poor efficiency and reliability More advanced gas turbines such as those found in modern jet engines or combined cycle power plants may have or shafts spools hundreds of compressor and turbine blades movable stator blades and extensive external tubing for fuel oil and air systems they use temperature resistant alloys and are made with tight specifications requiring precision manufacture All this often makes the construction of a simple gas turbine more complicated than a piston engine br Moreover to reach optimum performance in modern gas turbine power plants the gas needs to be prepared to exact fuel specifications Fuel gas conditioning systems treat the natural gas to reach the exact fuel specification prior to entering the turbine in terms of pressure temperature gas composition and the related Wobbe index br The primary advantage of a gas turbine engine is its power to weight ratio br Since significant useful work can be generated by a relatively lightweight engine gas turbines are perfectly suited for aircraft propulsion br Thrust bearings and journal bearings are a critical part of a design They are hydrodynamic oil bearings or oil cooled rolling element bearings Foil bearings are used in some small machines such as micro turbines and also have strong potential for use in small gas turbines auxiliary power units br br br Creep br A major challenge facing turbine design especially turbine blades is reducing the creep that is induced by the high temperatures and stresses that are experienced during operation Higher operating temperatures are continuously sought in order to increase efficiency but come at the cost of higher creep rates Several methods have therefore been employed in an attempt to achieve optimal performance while limiting creep with the most successful ones being high performance coatings and single crystal superalloys These technologies work by limiting deformation that occurs by mechanisms that can be broadly classified as dislocation glide dislocation climb and diffusional flow br Protective coatings provide thermal insulation of the blade and offer oxidation and corrosion resistance Thermal barrier coatings TBCs are often stabilized zirconium dioxide based ceramics and oxidation corrosion resistant coatings bond coats typically consist of aluminides or MCrAlY where M is typically Fe and or Cr alloys Using TBCs limits the temperature exposure of the superalloy substrate thereby decreasing the diffusivity of the active species typically vacancies within the alloy and reducing dislocation and vacancy creep It has been found that a coating of m can decrease blade temperatures by up to C F br Bond coats are directly applied onto the surface of the substrate using pack carburization and serve the dual purpose of providing improved adherence for the TBC and oxidation resistance for the substrate The Al from the bond coats forms Al O on the TBC bond coat interface which provides the oxidation resistance but also results in the formation of an undesirable interdiffusion ID zone between itself and the substrate The oxidation resistance outweighs the drawbacks associated with the ID zone as it increases the lifetime of the blade and limits the efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades br Nickel based superalloys boast improved strength and creep resistance due to their composition and resultant microstructure The gamma FCC nickel is alloyed with aluminum and titanium in order to precipitate a uniform dispersion of the coherent Ni Al Ti gamma prime phases The finely dispersed precipitates impede dislocation motion and introduce a threshold stress increasing the stress required for the onset of creep Furthermore is an ordered L phase that makes it harder for dislocations to shear past it Further Refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added in solid solution to improve creep strength The addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase thus preserving the fatigue resistance strength and creep resistance The development of single crystal superalloys has led to significant improvements in creep resistance as well Due to the lack of grain boundaries single crystals eliminate Coble creep and consequently deform by fewer modes decreasing the creep rate Although single crystals have lower creep at high temperatures they have significantly lower yield stresses at room temperature where strength is determined by the Hall Petch relationship Care needs to be taken in order to optimize the design parameters to limit high temperature creep while not decreasing low temperature yield strength br br br Types br br br Jet engines br br Airbreathing jet engines are gas turbines optimized to produce thrust from the exhaust gases or from ducted fans connected to the gas turbines Jet engines that produce thrust from the direct impulse of exhaust gases are often called turbojets While still in service with many militaries and civilian operators turbojets have mostly been phased out in favor of the turbofan engine due to the turbojet s low fuel efficiency and high noise Those that generate thrust with the addition of a ducted fan are called turbofans or rarely fan jets These engines produce nearly of their thrust by the ducted fan which can be seen from the front of the engine They come in two types low bypass turbofan and high bypass the difference being the amount of air moved by the fan called bypass air These engines offer the benefit of more thrust without extra fuel consumption br Gas turbines are also used in many liquid fuel rockets where gas turbines are used to power a turbopump to permit the use of lightweight low pressure tanks reducing the empty weight of the rocket br br br Turboprop engines br A turboprop engine is a turbine engine that drives an aircraft propeller using a reduction gear to translate high turbine section operating speed often in the s of thousands into low thousands necessary for efficient propeller operation The benefit of using the turboprop engine is to take advantage of the turbine engines high power to weight ratio to drive a propeller thus allowing a more powerful but also smaller engine to be used Turboprop engines are used on a wide range of business aircraft such as the Pilatus PC commuter aircraft such as the Beechcraft and small cargo aircraft such as the Cessna Caravan or De Havilland Canada Dash and large aircraft typically military such as the Airbus A M transport Lockheed AC and the year old Tupolev Tu strategic bomber While military turboprop engines can vary in the civilian market there are two primary engines to be found the Pratt Whitney Canada PT a free turbine turboshaft engine and the Honeywell TPE a fixed turbine engine formerly designated as the Garrett AiResearch br br br Aeroderivative gas turbines br br Aeroderivative gas turbines are generally based on existing aircraft gas turbine engines and are smaller and lighter than industrial gas turbines br Aeroderivatives are used in electrical power generation due to their ability to be shut down and handle load changes more quickly than industrial machines They are also used in the marine industry to reduce weight Common types include the General Electric LM General Electric LM and aeroderivative versions of the Pratt Whitney PW Pratt Whitney FT and Rolls Royce RB br br br Amateur gas turbines br Increasing numbers of gas turbines are being used or even constructed by amateurs br In its most straightforward form these are commercial turbines acquired through military surplus or scrapyard sales then operated for display as part of the hobby of engine collecting In its most extreme form amateurs have even rebuilt engines beyond professional repair and then used them to compete for the land speed record br The simplest form of self constructed gas turbine employs an automotive turbocharger as the core component A combustion chamber is fabricated and plumbed between the compressor and turbine sections br More sophisticated turbojets are also built where their thrust and light weight are sufficient to power large model aircraft The Schreckling design constructs the entire engine from raw materials including the fabrication of a centrifugal compressor wheel from plywood epoxy and wrapped carbon fibre strands br Several small companies now manufacture small turbines and parts for the amateur Most turbojet powered model aircraft are now using these commercial and semi commercial microturbines rather than a Schreckling like home build br br br Auxiliary power units br Small gas turbines are used as auxiliary power units APUs to supply auxiliary power to larger mobile machines such as an aircraft and are a turboshaft design They supply br br compressed air for air cycle machine style air conditioning and ventilation br compressed air start up power for larger jet engines br mechanical shaft power to a gearbox to drive shafted accessories and br electrical hydraulic and other power transmission sources to consuming devices remote from the APU br br br Industrial gas turbines for power generation br br Industrial gas turbines differ from aeronautical designs in that the frames bearings and blading are of heavier construction They are also much more closely integrated with the devices they power often an electric generator and the secondary energy equipment that is used to recover residual energy largely heat br They range in size from portable mobile plants to large complex systems weighing more than a hundred tonnes housed in purpose built buildings When the gas turbine is used solely for shaft power its thermal efficiency is about However it may be cheaper to buy electricity than to generate it Therefore many engines are used in CHP Combined Heat and Power configurations that can be small enough to be integrated into portable container configurations br Gas turbines can be particularly efficient when waste heat from the turbine is recovered by a heat recovery steam generator HRSG to power a conventional steam turbine in a combined cycle configuration The MW General Electric HA achieved a efficiency rate with temperatures as high as C F br For GE offers its MW HA at over efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in additive manufacturing and combustion breakthroughs up from in orders and on track to achieve by the early s br In March GE Power achieved a gross efficiency for its HA turbine br Aeroderivative gas turbines can also be used in combined cycles leading to a higher efficiency but it will not be as high as a specifically designed industrial gas turbine They can also be run in a cogeneration configuration the exhaust is used for space or water heating or drives an absorption chiller for cooling the inlet air and increase the power output technology known as turbine inlet air cooling br Another significant advantage is their ability to be turned on and off within minutes supplying power during peak or unscheduled demand Since single cycle gas turbine only power plants are less efficient than combined cycle plants they are usually used as peaking power plants which operate anywhere from several hours per day to a few dozen hours per year depending on the electricity demand and the generating capacity of the region In areas with a shortage of base load and load following power plant capacity or with low fuel costs a gas turbine powerplant may regularly operate most hours of the day A large single cycle gas turbine typically produces to megawatts of electric power and has thermodynamic efficiency br br br Industrial gas turbines for mechanical drive br Industrial gas turbines that are used solely for mechanical drive or used in collaboration with a recovery steam generator differ from power generating sets in that they are often smaller and feature a dual shaft design as opposed to a single shaft The power range varies from megawatt up to megawatts These engines are connected directly or via a gearbox to either a pump or compressor assembly The majority of installations are used within the oil and gas industries Mechanical drive applications increase efficiency by around br Oil and gas platforms require these engines to drive compressors to inject gas into the wells to force oil up via another bore or to compress the gas for transportation They are also often used to provide power for the platform These platforms do not need to use the engine in collaboration with a CHP system due to getting the gas at an extremely reduced cost often free from burn off gas The same companies use pump sets to drive the fluids to land and across pipelines in various intervals br br br Compressed air energy storage br br One modern development seeks to improve efficiency in another way by separating the compressor and the turbine with a compressed air store In a conventional turbine up to half the generated power is used driving the compressor In a compressed air energy storage configuration power is used to drive the compressor and the compressed air is released to operate the turbine when required br br br Turboshaft engines br br Turboshaft engines are used to drive compressors in gas pumping stations and natural gas liquefaction plants They are also used in aviation to power all but the smallest modern helicopters and function as an auxiliary power unit in large commercial aircraft A primary shaft carries the compressor and its turbine which together with a combustor is called a Gas Generator A separately spinning power turbine is usually used to drive the rotor on helicopters Allowing the gas generator and power turbine rotor to spin at their own speeds allows more flexibility in their design br br br Radial gas turbines br br br Scale jet engines br br Also known as miniature gas turbines or micro jets br With this in mind the pioneer of modern Micro Jets Kurt Schreckling produced one of the world s first Micro Turbines the FD This engine can produce up to newtons of thrust and can be built by most mechanically minded people with basic engineering tools such as a metal lathe br br br Microturbines br br Evolved from piston engine turbochargers aircraft APUs or small jet engines microturbines are to kilowatt turbines the size of a refrigerator br Microturbines have around efficiencies without a recuperator to with one and they can reach combined thermal electrical efficiency in cogeneration br br br External combustion br Most gas turbines are internal combustion engines but it is also possible to manufacture an external combustion gas turbine which is effectively a turbine version of a hot air engine br Those systems are usually indicated as EFGT Externally Fired Gas Turbine or IFGT Indirectly Fired Gas Turbine br External combustion has been used for the purpose of using pulverized coal or finely ground biomass such as sawdust as a fuel In the indirect system a heat exchanger is used and only clean air with no combustion products travels through the power turbine The thermal efficiency is lower in the indirect type of external combustion however the turbine blades are not subjected to combustion products and much lower quality and therefore cheaper fuels are able to be used br When external combustion is used it is possible to use exhaust air from the turbine as the primary combustion air This effectively reduces global heat losses although heat losses associated with the combustion exhaust remain inevitable br Closed cycle gas turbines based on helium or supercritical carbon dioxide also hold promise for use with future high temperature solar and nuclear power generation br br br In surface vehicles br br Gas turbines are often used on ships locomotives helicopters tanks and to a lesser extent on cars buses and motorcycles br A key advantage of jets and turboprops for airplane propulsion their superior performance at high altitude compared to piston engines particularly naturally aspirated ones is irrelevant in most automobile applications Their power to weight advantage though less critical than for aircraft is still important br Gas turbines offer a high powered engine in a very small and light package However they are not as responsive and efficient as small piston engines over the wide range of RPMs and powers needed in vehicle applications In series hybrid vehicles as the driving electric motors are mechanically detached from the electricity generating engine the responsiveness poor performance at low speed and low efficiency at low output problems are much less important The turbine can be run at optimum speed for its power output and batteries and ultracapacitors can supply power as needed with the engine cycled on and off to run it only at high efficiency The emergence of the continuously variable transmission may also alleviate the responsiveness problem br Turbines have historically been more expensive to produce than piston engines though this is partly because piston engines have been mass produced in huge quantities for decades while small gas turbine engines are rarities however turbines are mass produced in the closely related form of the turbocharger br The turbocharger is basically a compact and simple free shaft radial gas turbine which is driven by the piston engine s exhaust gas The centripetal turbine wheel drives a centrifugal compressor wheel through a common rotating shaft This wheel supercharges the engine air intake to a degree that can be controlled by means of a wastegate or by dynamically modifying the turbine housing s geometry as in a variable geometry turbocharger br It mainly serves as a power recovery device which converts a great deal of otherwise wasted thermal and kinetic energy into engine boost br Turbo compound engines actually employed on some semi trailer trucks are fitted with blow down turbines which are similar in design and appearance to a turbocharger except for the turbine shaft being mechanically or hydraulically connected to the engine s crankshaft instead of to a centrifugal compressor thus providing additional power instead of boost While the turbocharger is a pressure turbine a power recovery turbine is a velocity one br br br Passenger road vehicles cars bikes and buses br A number of experiments have been conducted with gas turbine powered automobiles the largest by Chrysler More recently there has been some interest in the use of turbine engines for hybrid electric cars For instance a consortium led by micro gas turbine company Bladon Jets has secured investment from the Technology Strategy Board to develop an Ultra Lightweight Range Extender ULRE for next generation electric vehicles The objective of the consortium which includes luxury car maker Jaguar Land Rover and leading electrical machine company SR Drives is to produce the world s first commercially viable and environmentally friendly gas turbine generator designed specifically for automotive applications br The common turbocharger for gasoline or diesel engines is also a turbine derivative br br br Concept cars br br The first serious investigation of using a gas turbine in cars was in when two engineers Robert Kafka and Robert Engerstein of Carney Associates a New York engineering firm came up with the concept where a unique compact turbine engine design would provide power for a rear wheel drive car After an article appeared in Popular Science there was no further work beyond the paper stage br br Early concepts s s br In designer F R Bell and Chief Engineer Maurice Wilks from British car manufacturers Rover unveiled the first car powered with a gas turbine engine The two seater JET had the engine positioned behind the seats air intake grilles on either side of the car and exhaust outlets on the top of the tail During tests the car reached top speeds of km h mph at a turbine speed of rpm After being shown in the United Kingdom and the United States in JET was further developed and was subjected to speed trials on the Jabbeke highway in Belgium in June where it exceeded km h mph The car ran on petrol paraffin kerosene or diesel oil but fuel consumption problems proved insurmountable for a production car JET is on display at the London Science Museum br A French turbine powered car the SOCEMA Gr goire was displayed at the October Paris Auto Show It was designed by the French engineer Jean Albert Gr goire br br The first turbine powered car built in the US was the GM Firebird I which began evaluations in While photos of the Firebird I may suggest that the jet turbine s thrust propelled the car like an aircraft the turbine actually drove the rear wheels The Firebird I was never meant as a commercial passenger car and was built solely for testing evaluation as well as public relation purposes Additional Firebird concept cars each powered by gas turbines were developed for the and Motorama auto shows The GM Research gas turbine engine also was fitted to a series of transit buses starting with the Turbo Cruiser I of br br Starting in with a modified Plymouth the American car manufacturer Chrysler demonstrated several prototype gas turbine powered cars from the early s through the early s Chrysler built fifty Chrysler Turbine Cars in and conducted the only consumer trial of gas turbine powered cars Each of their turbines employed a unique rotating recuperator referred to as a regenerator that increased efficiency br In Fiat unveiled a concept car with a turbine engine called Fiat Turbina This vehicle looking like an aircraft with wheels used a unique combination of both jet thrust and the engine driving the wheels Speeds of km h mph were claimed br In the s Ford and GM also were developing gas turbine semi trucks Ford displayed the Big Red at the World s Fair With the trailer it was m ft long m ft high and painted crimson red It contained the Ford developed gas turbine engine with output power and torque of kW hp and N m lb ft The cab boasted a highway map of the continental U S a mini kitchen bathroom and a TV for the co driver The fate of the truck was unknown for several decades but it was rediscovered in early in private hands having been restored to running order The Chevrolet division of GM built the Turbo Titan series of concept trucks with turbine motors as analogs of the Firebird concepts including Turbo Titan I c shares GT engine with Firebird II Turbo Titan II c shares GT engine with Firebird III and Turbo Titan III GT engine in addition the GM Bison gas turbine truck was shown at the World s Fair br br Emissions and fuel economy s s br As a result of the U S Clean Air Act Amendments of research was funded into developing automotive gas turbine technology Design concepts and vehicles were conducted by Chrysler General Motors Ford in collaboration with AiResearch and American Motors in conjunction with Williams Research Long term tests were conducted to evaluate comparable cost efficiency Several AMC Hornets were powered by a small Williams regenerative gas turbine weighing lb kg and producing hp kW PS at rpm br In General Motors used an Oldsmobile Delta powered by a gas turbine using pulverised coal dust This was considered for the United States and the western world to reduce dependence on middle east oil at the time br Toyota demonstrated several gas turbine powered concept cars such as the Century gas turbine hybrid in the Sports Gas Turbine Hybrid in and the GTV in No production vehicles were made The GT engine was exhibited in without a vehicle br br Later development br In the early s Volvo introduced the Volvo ECC which was a gas turbine powered hybrid electric vehicle br In General Motors developed a gas turbine powered EV series hybrid as a prototype of the General Motors EV A Williams International kW turbine drove an alternator which powered the battery electric powertrain The turbine design included a recuperator In GM went into the EcoJet concept car project with Jay Leno br At the Paris Motor Show Jaguar demonstrated its Jaguar C X concept car This electrically powered supercar has a top speed of mph km h and can go from to mph to km h in seconds It uses Lithium ion batteries to power four electric motors which combine to produce bhp It will travel miles km on a single charge of the batteries and uses a pair of Bladon Micro Gas Turbines to re charge the batteries extending the range to miles km br br br Racing cars br br The first race car in concept only fitted with a turbine was in by a US Air Force group as a hobby project with a turbine loaned them by Boeing and a race car owned by Firestone Tire Rubber company The first race car fitted with a turbine for the goal of actual racing was by Rover and the BRM Formula One team joined forces to produce the Rover BRM a gas turbine powered coupe which entered the Hours of Le Mans driven by Graham Hill and Richie Ginther It averaged mph km h and had a top speed of mph km h American Ray Heppenstall joined Howmet Corporation and McKee Engineering together to develop their own gas turbine sports car in the Howmet TX which ran several American and European events including two wins and also participated in the Hours of Le Mans The cars used Continental gas turbines which eventually set six FIA land speed records for turbine powered cars br For open wheel racing s revolutionary STP Paxton Turbocar fielded by racing and entrepreneurial legend Andy Granatelli and driven by Parnelli Jones nearly won the Indianapolis the Pratt Whitney ST B powered turbine car was almost a lap ahead of the second place car when a gearbox bearing failed just three laps from the finish line The next year the STP Lotus turbine car won the Indianapolis pole position even though new rules restricted the air intake dramatically In Team Lotus principal Colin Chapman introduced the Lotus B F car powered by a Pratt Whitney STN gas turbine Chapman had a reputation of building radical championship winning cars but had to abandon the project because there were too many problems with turbo lag br br br Buses br General Motors fitted the GT x series of gas turbines branded Whirlfire to several prototype buses in the s and s including Turbo Cruiser I GT Turbo Cruiser II GT Turbo Cruiser III GT RTX GT and RTS T br The arrival of the Capstone Turbine has led to several hybrid bus designs starting with HEV by AVS of Chattanooga Tennessee in and closely followed by Ebus and ISE Research in California and DesignLine Corporation in New Zealand and later the United States AVS turbine hybrids were plagued with reliability and quality control problems resulting in liquidation of AVS in The most successful design by Designline is now operated in cities in countries with over buses in operation worldwide and order for several hundred being delivered to Baltimore and New York City br Brescia Italy is using serial hybrid buses powered by microturbines on routes through the historical sections of the city br br br Motorcycles br The MTT Turbine Superbike appeared in hence the designation of Y K Superbike by MTT and is the first production motorcycle powered by a turbine engine specifically a Rolls Royce Allison model turboshaft engine producing about kW bhp Speed tested to km h or mph according to some stories the testing team ran out of road during the test it holds the Guinness World Record for most powerful production motorcycle and most expensive production motorcycle with a price tag of US br br br Trains br br Several locomotive classes have been powered by gas turbines the most recent incarnation being Bombardier s JetTrain br br br Tanks br br The Third Reich Wehrmacht Heer s development division the Heereswaffenamt Army Ordnance Board studied a number of gas turbine engine designs for use in tanks starting in mid The first gas turbine engine design intended for use in armored fighting vehicle propulsion the BMW based GT was meant for installation in the Panther tank Towards the end of the war a Jagdtiger was fitted with one of the aforementioned gas turbines br The second use of a gas turbine in an armored fighting vehicle was in when a unit PU specifically developed for tanks by C A Parsons and Company was installed and trialed in a British Conqueror tank The Stridsvagn was developed in the s and was the first mass produced main battle tank to use a turbine engine the Boeing T Since then gas turbine engines have been used as auxiliary power units in some tanks and as main powerplants in Soviet Russian T s and U S M Abrams tanks among others They are lighter and smaller than diesel engines at the same sustained power output but the models installed to date are less fuel efficient than the equivalent diesel especially at idle requiring more fuel to achieve the same combat range Successive models of M have addressed this problem with battery packs or secondary generators to power the tank s systems while stationary saving fuel by reducing the need to idle the main turbine T s can mount three large external fuel drums to extend their range Russia has stopped production of the T in favor of the diesel powered T based on the T while Ukraine has developed the diesel powered T UD and T with nearly the power of the gas turbine tank The French Leclerc tank s diesel powerplant features the Hyperbar hybrid supercharging system where the engine s turbocharger is completely replaced with a small gas turbine which also works as an assisted diesel exhaust turbocharger enabling engine RPM independent boost level control and a higher peak boost pressure to be reached than with ordinary turbochargers This system allows a smaller displacement and lighter engine to be used as the tank s power plant and effectively removes turbo lag This special gas turbine turbocharger can also work independently from the main engine as an ordinary APU br A turbine is theoretically more reliable and easier to maintain than a piston engine since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts but in practice turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher working speeds The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily An improperly fitted filter or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter can damage the engine Piston engines especially if turbocharged also need well maintained filters but they are more resilient if the filter does fail br Like most modern diesel engines used in tanks gas turbines are usually multi fuel engines br br br Marine applications br br br Naval br br Gas turbines are used in many naval vessels where they are valued for their high power to weight ratio and their ships resulting acceleration and ability to get underway quickly br The first gas turbine powered naval vessel was the Royal Navy s motor gunboat MGB formerly MGB converted in Metropolitan Vickers fitted their F jet engine with a power turbine The Steam Gun Boat Grey Goose was converted to Rolls Royce gas turbines in and operated as such from The Bold class Fast Patrol Boats Bold Pioneer and Bold Pathfinder built in were the first ships created specifically for gas turbine propulsion br The first large scale partially gas turbine powered ships were the Royal Navy s Type Tribal class frigates with combined steam and gas powerplants The first HMS Ashanti was commissioned in br The German Navy launched the first K ln class frigate in with Brown Boveri Cie gas turbines in the world s first combined diesel and gas propulsion system br The Soviet Navy commissioned in the first of Kashin class destroyer with gas turbines in combined gas and gas propulsion system Those vessels used M E gas turbines which generated kW hp Those ships were the first large ships in the world to be powered solely by gas turbines br br The Danish Navy had S l ven class torpedo boats the export version of the British Brave class fast patrol boat in service from to which had Bristol Proteus later RR Proteus Marine Gas Turbines rated at kW shp combined plus two General Motors Diesel engines rated at kW shp for better fuel economy at slower speeds And they also produced Willemoes Class Torpedo Guided Missile boats in service from to which had Rolls Royce Marine Proteus Gas Turbines also rated at kW shp same as the S l ven class boats and General Motors Diesel Engines rated at kW shp also for improved fuel economy at slow speeds br The Swedish Navy produced Spica class torpedo boats between and powered by Bristol Siddeley Proteus turbines each delivering kW shp They were later joined by upgraded Norrk ping class ships still with the same engines With their aft torpedo tubes replaced by antishipping missiles they served as missile boats until the last was retired in br The Finnish Navy commissioned two Turunmaa class corvettes Turunmaa and Karjala in They were equipped with one kW shp Rolls Royce Olympus TM gas turbine and three W rtsil marine diesels for slower speeds They were the fastest vessels in the Finnish Navy they regularly achieved speeds of knots and knots during sea trials The Turunmaas were decommissioned in Karjala is today a museum ship in Turku and Turunmaa serves as a floating machine shop and training ship for Satakunta Polytechnical College br The next series of major naval vessels were the four Canadian Iroquois class helicopter carrying destroyers first commissioned in They used ft main propulsion engines ft cruise engines and Solar Saturn kW generators br br The first U S gas turbine powered ship was the U S Coast Guard s Point Thatcher a cutter commissioned in that was powered by two kW shp turbines utilizing controllable pitch propellers The larger Hamilton class High Endurance Cutters was the first class of larger cutters to utilize gas turbines the first of which USCGC Hamilton was commissioned in Since then they have powered the U S Navy s Oliver Hazard Perry class frigates Spruance and Arleigh Burke class destroyers and Ticonderoga class guided missile cruisers USS Makin Island a modified Wasp class amphibious assault ship is to be the Navy s first amphibious assault ship powered by gas turbines br The marine gas turbine operates in a more corrosive atmosphere due to the presence of sea salt in air and fuel and use of cheaper fuels br br br Civilian maritime br Up to the late s much of the progress on marine gas turbines all over the world took place in design offices and engine builder s workshops and development work was led by the British Royal Navy and other Navies While interest in the gas turbine for marine purposes both naval and mercantile continued to increase the lack of availability of the results of operating experience on early gas turbine projects limited the number of new ventures on seagoing commercial vessels being embarked upon br In the diesel electric oil tanker Auris deadweight tonnage DWT was used to obtain operating experience with a main propulsion gas turbine under service conditions at sea and so became the first ocean going merchant ship to be powered by a gas turbine Built by Hawthorn Leslie at Hebburn on Tyne UK in accordance with plans and specifications drawn up by the Anglo Saxon Petroleum Company and launched on the UK s Princess Elizabeth s st birthday in the ship was designed with an engine room layout that would allow for the experimental use of heavy fuel in one of its high speed engines as well as the future substitution of one of its diesel engines by a gas turbine The Auris operated commercially as a tanker for three and a half years with a diesel electric propulsion unit as originally commissioned but in one of its four kW bhp diesel engines which were known as Faith Hope Charity and Prudence was replaced by the world s first marine gas turbine engine a kW bhp open cycle gas turbo alternator built by British Thompson Houston Company in Rugby Following successful sea trials off the Northumbrian coast the Auris set sail from Hebburn on Tyne in October bound for Port Arthur in the US and then Curacao in the southern Caribbean returning to Avonmouth after days at sea successfully completing her historic trans Atlantic crossing During this time at sea the gas turbine burnt diesel fuel and operated without an involuntary stop or mechanical difficulty of any kind She subsequently visited Swansea Hull Rotterdam Oslo and Southampton covering a total of nautical miles The Auris then had all of its power plants replaced with a kW shp directly coupled gas turbine to become the first civilian ship to operate solely on gas turbine power br Despite the success of this early experimental voyage the gas turbine did not replace the diesel engine as the propulsion plant for large merchant ships At constant cruising speeds the diesel engine simply had no peer in the vital area of fuel economy The gas turbine did have more success in Royal Navy ships and the other naval fleets of the world where sudden and rapid changes of speed are required by warships in action br The United States Maritime Commission were looking for options to update WWII Liberty ships and heavy duty gas turbines were one of those selected In the John Sergeant was lengthened and equipped with a General Electric kW shp HD gas turbine with exhaust gas regeneration reduction gearing and a variable pitch propeller It operated for hours using residual fuel Bunker C for hours Fuel efficiency was on a par with steam propulsion at kg kW lb hp per hour and power output was higher than expected at kW shp due to the ambient temperature of the North Sea route being lower than the design temperature of the gas turbine This gave the ship a speed capability of knots up from knots with the original power plant and well in excess of the knot targeted The ship made its first transatlantic crossing with an average speed of knots in spite of some rough weather along the way Suitable Bunker C fuel was only available at limited ports because the quality of the fuel was of a critical nature The fuel oil also had to be treated on board to reduce contaminants and this was a labor intensive process that was not suitable for automation at the time Ultimately the variable pitch propeller which was of a new and untested design ended the trial as three consecutive annual inspections revealed stress cracking This did not reflect poorly on the marine propulsion gas turbine concept though and the trial was a success overall The success of this trial opened the way for more development by GE on the use of HD gas turbines for marine use with heavy fuels The John Sergeant was scrapped in at Portsmouth PA br br Boeing launched its first passenger carrying waterjet propelled hydrofoil Boeing in April Those ships were powered by two Allison KF gas turbines br Between and Seatrain Lines operated a scheduled container service between ports on the eastern seaboard of the United States and ports in northwest Europe across the North Atlantic with four container ships of tonnes DWT Those ships were powered by twin Pratt Whitney gas turbines of the FT series The four ships in the class were named Euroliner Eurofreighter Asialiner and Asiafreighter Following the dramatic Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries OPEC price increases of the mid s operations were constrained by rising fuel costs Some modification of the engine systems on those ships was undertaken to permit the burning of a lower grade of fuel i e marine diesel Reduction of fuel costs was successful using a different untested fuel in a marine gas turbine but maintenance costs increased with the fuel change After the ships were sold and refitted with what at the time was more economical diesel fueled engines but the increased engine size reduced cargo space br The first passenger ferry to use a gas turbine was the GTS Finnjet built in and powered by two Pratt Whitney FT C DLF turbines generating kW shp and propelling the ship to a speed of knots However the Finnjet also illustrated the shortcomings of gas turbine propulsion in commercial craft as high fuel prices made operating her unprofitable After four years of service additional diesel engines were installed on the ship to reduce running costs during the off season The Finnjet was also the first ship with a combined diesel electric and gas propulsion Another example of commercial use of gas turbines in a passenger ship is Stena Line s HSS class fastcraft ferries HSS class Stena Explorer Stena Voyager and Stena Discovery vessels use combined gas and gas setups of twin GE LM plus GE LM power for a total of kW shp The slightly smaller HSS class Stena Carisma uses twin ABB STAL GT turbines rated at kW shp gross The Stena Discovery was withdrawn from service in another victim of too high fuel costs br In July the Millennium became the first cruise ship to be powered by both gas and steam turbines The ship featured two General Electric LM gas turbine generators whose exhaust heat was used to operate a steam turbine generator in a COGES combined gas electric and steam configuration Propulsion was provided by two electrically driven Rolls Royce Mermaid azimuth pods The liner RMS Queen Mary uses a combined diesel and gas configuration br In marine racing applications the C Mystic catamaran Miss GEICO uses two Lycoming T turbines for its power system br br br Advances in technology br Gas turbine technology has steadily advanced since its inception and continues to evolve Development is actively producing both smaller gas turbines and more powerful and efficient engines Aiding in these advances are computer based design specifically computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis and the development of advanced materials Base materials with superior high temperature strength e g single crystal superalloys that exhibit yield strength anomaly or thermal barrier coatings that protect the structural material from ever higher temperatures These advances allow higher compression ratios and turbine inlet temperatures more efficient combustion and better cooling of engine parts br Computational fluid dynamics CFD has contributed to substantial improvements in the performance and efficiency of gas turbine engine components through enhanced understanding of the complex viscous flow and heat transfer phenomena involved For this reason CFD is one of the key computational tools used in design and development of gas turbine engines br The simple cycle efficiencies of early gas turbines were practically doubled by incorporating inter cooling regeneration or recuperation and reheating These improvements of course come at the expense of increased initial and operation costs and they cannot be justified unless the decrease in fuel costs offsets the increase in other costs The relatively low fuel prices the general desire in the industry to minimize installation costs and the tremendous increase in the simple cycle efficiency to about percent left little desire for opting for these modifications br On the emissions side the challenge is to increase turbine inlet temperatures while at the same time reducing peak flame temperature in order to achieve lower NOx emissions and meet the latest emission regulations In May Mitsubishi Heavy Industries achieved a turbine inlet temperature of C F on a megawatt gas turbine and MW in gas turbine combined cycle power generation applications in which gross thermal efficiency exceeds br Compliant foil bearings were commercially introduced to gas turbines in the s These can withstand over a hundred thousand start stop cycles and have eliminated the need for an oil system The application of microelectronics and power switching technology have enabled the development of commercially viable electricity generation by microturbines for distribution and vehicle propulsion br In General Electric started the development of the GE X with a

compared to reciprocating engines br Smaller than most reciprocating engines of the same power rating br Smooth rotation of the main shaft produces far less vibration than a reciprocating engine br Fewer moving parts than reciprocating engines results in lower maintenance cost and higher reliability availability over its service life br Greater reliability particularly in applications where sustained high power output is required br Waste heat is dissipated almost entirely in the exhaust This results in a high temperature exhaust stream that is very usable for boiling water in a combined cycle or for cogeneration br Lower peak combustion pressures than reciprocating engines in general br High shaft speeds in smaller free turbine units although larger gas turbines employed in power generation operate at synchronous speeds br Low lubricating oil cost and consumption br Can run on a wide variety of fuels br Very low toxic emissions of CO and HC due to excess air complete combustion and no quench of the flame on cold surfaces br Disadvantages include br br Core engine costs can be high due to the use of exotic materials especially in applications where high reliability is required e g aircraft propulsion br Less efficient than reciprocating engines at idle speed br Longer startup than reciprocating engines br Less responsive to changes in power demand compared with

national and international test codes are used to standardize the procedures and definitions used to test gas turbines Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems In the United States ASME has produced several performance test codes on gas turbines This includes ASME PTC These ASME performance test codes have gained international recognition and acceptance for testing gas turbines The single most important and differentiating characteristic of ASME performance test codes including PTC is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance br br br See also br List of aircraft engines
