A V engine is a twenty cylinder piston engine where two banks of ten cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft Large diesel V engines have been used in diesel locomotives haul trucks electric generators and marine applications br br br History br br Beginning in the late s Mercedes Benz produced several large V diesel engines for use in marine applications The first engine was the MB which was based on the MB V engine and was installed in the class Schnellboot fast attack boat and several submarines Later versions included the supercharged MB engine and the MB which also added an intercooler A copy of the MB was produced by VEB Motorenwerk in Ludwigsfelde and called the VEB KVD Production of the MB resumed in and a version of the engine was also manufactured by MTU called the MB V br The Electro Motive Diesel EMD E two stroke V turbo diesel engine was used in s diesel electric locomotives such as the EMD SD The engine has a displacement of L cu in and produces a net traction of MW hp The maximum gross power output is closer to hp when operated in self test mode with the generated output being dissipated by resistors Later versions of the EMD engine were used in the EMD SD and EMD SD T locomotives EMD also produces a V version of the EMD diesel engine which was used in the EMD SD MAC locomotive The EMD remains in production to this day and is mostly used in power generation and marine propulsion br The Detroit Diesel Series V has an output of hp kW from a capacity of cu in L It was discontinued in br Current production V diesel engines include the Fairbanks Morse FM MAN D STC FM MAN CR FM MAN D FM COLT PIELSTICK PA B STC Others are the W rtsil V which produces up to MW hp the MTU V MW hp MTU V MW hp MTU V MW hp Cummins L QSK hp Caterpillar C MW hp and the G series br br br See also br V engine br Media related to V engines at Wikimedia Commons br br br
