A flat engine is a piston engine where the cylinders are located on either side of a central crankshaft Flat engines are also known as horizontally opposed engines however this is distinct from the less common opposed piston engine design whereby each cylinder has two pistons sharing a central combustion chamber br The most common configuration of flat engines is the boxer engine configuration in which the pistons of each opposed pair of cylinders move inwards and outwards at the same time The other configuration is effectively a V engine with a degree angle between the cylinder banks in this configuration each pair of cylinders shares a single crankpin so that as one piston moves inward the other moves outward br The first flat engine Benz Contramotor was built in by Karl Benz Flat engines have been used in aviation motorcycle and automobile applications They are now less common in cars than straight engines for engines with fewer than six cylinders and V engines for engines with six or more cylinders Flat engines are more common in aircraft where straight engines are a rarity and V engines have almost vanished except in historical aircraft They have even replaced radial engines in many smaller installations br br br Design br br The advantages of flat engines are a short length low centre of mass and suitability for air cooling br Compared with the more common straight engines flat engines have better primary balance resulting in less vibration however the disadvantages are increased width and the need to have two cylinder heads Compared with V engines the most common layout for engines with six cylinders or more flat engines have a lower centre of mass and better primary balance than V engines however they typically have a larger width br The most common usages of flat engines are br br Flat twin engines are mostly used in motorcycles Occasionally they have been used in light cars aircraft and industrial applications mostly up until the s br Flat four engines are mostly used in cars particularly in the earlier Volkswagen Type to and by Subaru in most of their models and have occasionally been used in motorcycles Their most common use is in smaller single engine general aviation aircraft in which they are still manufactured and used to this day br Flat six engines are mostly used in cars particularly by the Porsche sports car and have occasionally been used in motorcycles and aircraft br Flat eight engines have been used in several racing cars mostly by Porsche in the s br Flat ten engines are not known to have reached production A prototype road car engine was built by Chevrolet in the s br Flat twelve engines have been used in various racing cars notably the Porsche K during the s and s and in Ferrari road cars from to br Flat sixteen engines are not known to have reached production Prototype racing car engines were built by Coventry and Porsche in the s and s br br br Boxer configuration br br Most flat engines use a boxer configuration where each pair of opposing pistons move inwards and outwards at the same time somewhat like boxing competitors punching their gloves together before a fight Boxer engines have low vibrations since they are the only common configuration that have no unbalanced forces regardless of the number of cylinders Boxer engines therefore do not require a balance shaft or counterweights on the crankshaft to balance the weight of the reciprocating parts However a rocking couple is present since each cylinder is slightly offset from its opposing pair due to the distance between the crankpins along the crankshaft br br br degree V engine br An alternative configuration for flat engines is as a degree V engine which has been used on most twelve cylinder flat engines In this configuration each pair of pistons shares a crankpin rather than the boxer configuration where each piston has its own crankpin br br br Aviation use br br In the Pearse monoplane which would later become one of the first aircraft to achieve flight was powered by a flat twin engine Amongst the first commercially produced aircraft to use a flat engine is the Santos Dumont Demoiselle range of airplanes which was powered by boxer twin engines br Several boxer four engines have been produced specifically for light aircraft Several manufacturers produced boxer six aircraft engines during the s and s br During World War II boxer twin engines called the Riedel starter were used as a starter motor mechanical APU for the early German jet engines such as the Junkers Jumo and BMW Designed by Norbert Riedel these engines have a very oversquare stroke ratio of so that they could fit within the intake diverter directly forward of the turbine compressor br br br Motorcycle use br Flat engines offer several advantages for motorcycles including a low center of mass low vibration suitability for shaft drive and even cooling of the cylinders for air cooled engines The most common design of flat engines for motorcycles is the boxer twin beginning with the F e manufactured by the Light Motors Company flat twin which was the first production motorcycle to use a flat engine BMW Motorrad have a long history of boxer twin motorcycles beginning in with the BMW R br Several motorcycles have been produced with flat four engines such as the Z ndapp K and the Honda Gold Wing In the Honda Gold Wing engine was upsized to a flat six design br br br Automotive use br br When used in cars advantages of flat engines are a low center of mass which improves the handling of the car short length low vibration and suitability for air cooling due to the well exposed large surface area cylinder heads and short length However the larger width of flat engines compared with the more common inline and V layouts is a drawback particularly when the engine is located between the steered wheels br Flat engines were used by various automobile manufacturers mostly with a boxer four design up until the late s Since then only Porsche and Subaru have remained as significant manufacturers of flat engines br br br Drivetrain layout br br Due to the short length of flat engines locating a flat engine outside of the car s wheelbase results in minimal overhang Therefore many cars with flat engines have used a rear engine rear wheel drive layout Examples include the flat twin BMW and BMW the flat four Tatra Volkswagen Beetle and Porsche and the flat six Chevrolet Corvair Porsche present and Tucker br The opposite layout front engine front wheel drive was also common for cars with flat engines Examples include the Citro n CV Panhard Dyna X Lancia Flavia Citro n GS Alfa Romeo Alfasud and Subaru Leone br Subaru have been producing cars with a front engine four wheel drive layout powered by flat engines mostly boxer four engines since Examples include the Subaru Leone Subaru Legacy present and Subaru Impreza present The front half shafts come out of a front differential that is part of the gearbox A rear driveshaft connects the gearbox to the rear half shafts br The traditional front engine rear wheel drive layout is relatively uncommon for cars with flat engines however some examples include the Toyota Subaru BRZ present Jowett Javelin Glas Isar and the Tatra br br br History br br The first flat engine was produced in by German engineer Karl Benz Called the kontra engine it was a boxer twin design Early uses of flat engines in cars include the Lanchester hp Phaeton boxer twin the Wilson Pilcher boxer four the Wilson Pilcher HP boxer six and the Ford Model A the Ford Model C and the Ford Model F br In the Volkswagen Beetle then called the KdF Wagen was released with a rear mounted flat four engine This Volkswagen air cooled engine was produced for many years and also used in the Volkswagen Type Transporter Kombi or Microbus the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia sports car and the Volkswagen Type compact car A water cooled version known as the Wasserboxer was introduced in and eventually replaced the air cooled versions br The majority of sports cars throughout Porsche s history are powered by flat engines beginning with its first car the Porsche used an air cooled boxer four engine Also using boxer four engines were the Porsche the Porsche and the present Porsche Boxster Cayman The Porsche has exclusively used boxer six engines from its introduction in until the present In the Porsche switched from being air cooled to water cooled br Porsche flat eight engines were used in various racing cars throughout the s such as the Porsche Formula One car and the Porsche sports car A flat twelve engine was also produced by Porsche for the Porsche sports car br Chevrolet used a horizontally opposed air cooled cylinder engine in its Corvair line during its entire production run from to in various applications and power ratings including one of the first uses of a turbocharger in a mass produced automobile br The Subaru EA engine was introduced in and began Subaru s line of boxer four engines that remain in production to this day Most of Subaru s models are powered by a boxer four engine in either naturally aspirated or turbocharged form A print ad for the Subaru GL coupe referred to the engine as quadrozontal The company also produced boxer six engines from to and In the Subaru EE engine became the world s first passenger car diesel boxer engine This engine is a turbocharged boxer four with common rail fuel injection br Ferrari used flat twelve engines for various Formula One cars in the s A road car flat twelve engine using a degree V configuration was used for the Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer Ferrari Testarossa and their derivatives br Toyota uses the designation Toyota U GSE for the boxer four engine in the Toyota badged versions of the Toyota Subaru BRZ twins although the engine is actually designed and built by Subaru as the Subaru FA engine br br br See also br H engine br V engine br W engine br X engine br Radial
