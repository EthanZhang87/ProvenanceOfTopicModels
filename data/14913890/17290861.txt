The VR engines are a family of petroleum fuelled Internal combustion engines developed by the Volkswagen Group and produced from to They are derived from the VR engine family also developed by Volkswagen but with one fewer cylinders The VR is highly compact thanks to the narrower angle of and a displacement of cc L cu in The VR was the first production block to use five cylinders in a VR design with a degree angle br br br Technical Information br A VR engine block houses two staggered rows of cylinders within a single short and wide bank one row of two cylinders and the other having three This narrow angle single bank block makes the five cylinder engine as short as an inline three cylinder while also having single inlet and exhaust manifolds In a transverse layout the three cylinder row is located towards the front and in a longitudinal layout towards the right Due to the narrow bank angle of the two cylinder rows the arrangement works as a zig zag staggered W patterned inline five cylinder The engines have a firing order of br The VR was initially made with valves per cylinder as the AGZ engine from until resulting in a valve engine producing PS kW hp at RPM and N m lb ft of torque at RPM The engine was updated in as the AQN AZX engine adding an additional valves per cylinder and variable valve timing resulting in an valve engine now with valves per cylinder producing PS kW hp at RPM and N m lb ft at RPM Both versions of the engine had cast aluminium alloy cylinder heads and cast iron cylinder blocks br br br Valvetrain and cylinder head br The AGZ had valves in total with unequal sized valves per cylinder and chain driven camshafts When this was updated the AQN AZX engine had valves in total with unequal sized valves per cylinder br Due to the use of a single cylinder head a key design principle of the VR engines exhaust and intake ports were of unequal length between the two cylinder banks To mitigate this Volkswagen used unequally sized valves to ensure even flow and power output from the cylinders br br br Engine block and pistons br The AGZ engine used a cast iron cylinder block with five staggered cylinders Each cylinder was mm mm in in bore x stroke resulting in cc cu in per cylinder with a stroke ratio creating an undersquare long stroke engine The top of each piston was angled to accommodate for the use of the narrow V angle br br br Aspiration fuel system and engine management br The AGZ engine was managed by a Bosch Motronic M engine management system and the AQN AZX engine by a Bosch Motronic ME engine management system The engine used multi point common rail sequential fuel injection with fuel injected indirectly into the lower inlet manifold section just before the cylinder head intake ports Fuel and air delivery was controlled by a cable operated throttle body with a potentiometer monitoring throttle position and allowing the Motronic ECU to deliver the correct amount of fuel The engine also had a vacuum actuated variable intake manifold controlled by the ECU via a valve part of the engines vacuum system The valve is opened and closed depending on engine load engine speed and throttle position This allows the engine to take advantage of pressure waves created by the intake valves opening and closing br br The VR was used in the Volkswagen Golf Bora New Beetle and Passat The engine was also included in the Toledo a saloon car made by Volkswagen Group s subsidiary SEAT br br br
