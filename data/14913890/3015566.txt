A flat eight engine also called a horizontally opposed eight is an eight cylinder piston engine with two banks of four inline cylinders one on each side of a central crankshaft apart br In a flat eight engine the connecting rods for corresponding pistons from the left and right banks may share a crankshaft journal A boxer eight engine is a special case of a flat eight where each piston s connecting rod has its own journal and each pair of opposed pistons moves inwards or outwards at the same time br Flat eight engines have been used in automotive aircraft and marine applications br br br Design br br The advantages of a flat eight engine are its minimal length and low centre of mass A disadvantage is its greater width compared to a V or inline eight engine A flat eight engine is able to have perfect primary balance and secondary balance br A boxer eight engine has a single piston per crankpin which increases the linear offset between the cylinder banks A boxer eight with nine main bearings may be thought of as two boxer four engines laid end to end with a phase angle between their crankshafts br Alternatively a flat eight engine where corresponding pistons from the two opposing banks share a crankshaft journal is often called a degree V engine One possible configuration for this design uses a two plane crankshaft Another configuration uses a single plane crankshaft with the leading and trailing crankpins in the same position while the two central crankpins are in the opposite position br br br Use in automobiles br br One of the earliest flat eight engines was used in the Buffum Model G Greyhound racing car which used an engine based on two of Buffum s existing flat four engines joined together The Model G was built in the United States and was introduced one year after the Winton Motor Carriage Company Bullet No which used a straight engine Around the same time the first V engines were beginning to appear in Europe br Several racing cars have used bespoke flat eight engines based on two inline four engines and a custom crankshaft These include the Anderson Specials Number built in Scotland using two Humber engines The car is on display at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow Another example is a Eagle chassis raced by Bruce Crower in the United States This engine used the cylinder heads from two Chevrolet Cosworth Vega engines In a one off engine was built for racing driver Emerson Fittipaldi to compete in the Thousand Miles of Guanabara endurance race This flat eight engine was made by joining two L Volkswagen flat four crankcases with an elastomeric gasket and connecting the two crankshafts together Several similar Volkswagen based engines were built for Fittipaldi s racing cars in the early s br br br Porsche br br Porsche used flat eight engines in various racing cars throughout the s br The first Porsche flat eight was the Type Work began on it in following the announcement of a L cu in displacement limit for the Formula One season Designed by Hans Mezger and Hans Honich the engine includes features shaft driven double overhead camshafts a two piece magnesium crankcase casting eight individual finned cylinder barrels a solid crankshaft running in nine main bearings and Lucas electronic ignition The version of the Type used for its debut at the Dutch Formula One Grand Prix produced kW hp At the French Grand Prix the Type engine delivered Porsche s only F race win as a constructor in an driven by Dan Gurney The also influenced the design of the flat six engine used in the first generation Porsche br A L cu in version of the Porsche flat eight designated the Type was developed alongside the Type This engine was intended for sports car and endurance racing and was used in the Porsche W RS Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche and Porsche racing cars between and A version of the Type enlarged to L cu in was designated Type br In a new flat eight engine called the Type was introduced in the Porsche which competed in the Group Prototype Sports Cars category The Type was not based on the Type but instead the Type flat six racing six cylinder engine with two additional cylinders Porsche also installed Type engines into two Porsche mid engined road cars The first of these was a concept study built by the head of the racing department and the second was built as a th birthday present for the company chairman br Although Porsche never produced any road cars with a flat eight engine a prototype of such an engine was built in the late s and early s During this time Porsche had been commissioned by Volkswagen to develop Project EA a replacement for the Volkswagen Beetle Project EA was powered by a water cooled inline four engine which was mounted longitudinally under the rear passenger seat with the cylinders oriented horizontally Porsche investigated using the Project EA chassis as the basis for a mid engined replacement for the Porsche called the Typ As part of the Typ development process a prototype water cooled flat eight engine was built However Project EA was cancelled by Volkswagen all materials relating to the Typ were destroyed including the prototype flat eight engine br br br Use in aircraft br br Several flat eight aircraft engines have been produced over the years br br Lycoming GSO Air cooled L cu in br present Lycoming IO Air cooled L cu in br

engines are seldom used in marine applications with the Fageol VIP outboard engine being a rare example of a production engine The VIP consisted of two L cu in Crosley engine blocks joined on a common crankshaft br Another marine engine was the one off Miller marine engine which was built in and used in the racing boat Miss Rioco III The Miller had dual overhead camshafts and a displacement of L cu
