id: 200031
A straight twin engine also known as an inline twin vertical twin or parallel twin is a two cylinder piston engine whose cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft br Straight twin engines are primarily used in motorcycles other uses include automobiles marine vessels snowmobiles jet skis all terrain vehicles tractors and ultralight aircraft br Various different crankshaft configurations have been used for straight twin engines with the most common being degrees degrees and degrees br br br Terminology br The straight twin layout is also referred to as parallel twin vertical twin and inline twin Some of these terms originally had specific meanings relating to the crankshaft angle or engine orientation however they are often also used interchangeably br In the United Kingdom the term parallel twin is traditionally used for engines with a crankshaft angle of degrees since the two pistons are in the same direction i e parallel to each other Vertical twin was used to describe engines with a crankshaft angle of degrees which causes the pistons to travel in opposite directions The terms straight twin and inline twin were used more generically for any crankshaft angle br For motorcycles inline twin has sometimes referred to either a longitudinal engine orientation i e with the crankshaft in line with the chassis or a U engine tandem twin where the cylinders are arranged longitudinally in the chassis although the two crankshafts are actually oriented transversely br br br Design br Compared with V twin engines and flat twin engines straight twins are more compact a simpler design and cheaper to produce Straight twin engines can be prone to vibration either because of the irregular firing interval present in crank engines or the large uncountered reciprocating mass in crank engines Inline twins also suffer further from torsional torque reactions and vibration br br br Crankshaft angle br br The most common crankshaft configurations for straight twin engines are degrees degrees and degrees br br degrees br In an engine with a degree crankshaft both pistons move up and down at the same time However the firing interval is offset between cylinders with one of the cylinders firing during the first crankshaft rotation and then the other cylinder in the following rotation This set up results an even degree firing interval unlike other crank configurations in inline twin engines The degree engines can use a single ignition system for both cylinders using a wasted spark system br The imperfect primary balance is as per a single cylinder engine of equivalent reciprocating mass Early engines attempted to reduce vibration through counterweights on the crankshaft however later methods also included balance shafts and a separate weighted connecting rod Compared with a single cylinder engine the more frequent firing interval degrees compared with degrees results in smoother running characteristics despite the similar dynamic imbalance br From the s most British four stroke straight twin motorcycle engines used a degree crankshaft since this avoided the uneven intake pulsing of other configurations thus preventing the need for twin carburettors In the s even though Japanese motorcycles mostly switched to degree crankshafts for engines sized from to cc various smaller and larger engines continued to use a degree crankshaft Vibration was less of an issue for smaller engines such as the Honda CB and Honda CM Larger engines such as the Yamaha XS and Yamaha TX often used balance shafts to reduce the vibration The later Honda CB N CB N engines also used a degree crankshaft The BMW F series parallel twin motorcycles also use degree crankshafts with a third vestigial connecting rod acting as a counterbalance and a rev limit of rpm to reduce vibrations In Fiat launched Multiair inline twin car engines that use degree crankshaft which relied on balance shafts to reduce the vibrations br br degrees br In an engine with a degree crankshaft one piston rises as the other falls In a four stroke engine the firing interval is uneven with the second cylinder firing degrees after the first followed by a gap of degrees until the first cylinder fires again The uneven firing interval causes vibrations and results in a lumpy power delivery A engine also requires a separate ignition system for each cylinder br Perfect primary balance is possible with a degree straight twin engine however the design creates a rocking couple which requires use of a balance shaft to reduce the vibration A degree straight twin engine has a secondary imbalance similar to an inline four engine however the lower reciprocating mass means that this often does not require treatment br A crankshaft engine suffers fewer pumping losses than a twin because displacement of the crankcase is relatively unchanged as the pistons move br In the s Japanese motorcycle manufacturers favoured the use of degree crankshafts since the increased smoothness allowed higher rpm and thus higher power outputs For example the Honda CB degree crankshaft engine has a similar power output to contemporary British degree crankshaft engines despite having a smaller displacement of cc compared with cc Both the Yamaha TX and the Suzuki GS had a degree crankshaft and a balance shaft Since most Honda straight twin motorcycle engines use degree crankshafts br Two stroke engines typically use a degree crankshaft since this results in two evenly spaced power strokes per revolution The fundamental frequency of vibration is twice that of an equivalent single cylinder engine however the amplitude is halved Two stroke engines that do not use a degree crankshaft include the Yankee br br degrees br In an engine with a degree crankshaft one piston follows three quarters of a rotation behind the other This results in an uneven firing interval where the second cylinder fires degrees after the first followed by a gap of degrees until the first cylinder fires again This is the same pattern as a degree V twin engine and both configurations have a similar pulsing exhaust sound as a result The pistons in a degree straight twin engine are never both stationary at the same time as per a degree V twin engine thereby reducing the net momentum exchange between the crank and pistons during a full rotation br An imperfect primary balance is created in a degree straight twin engine due to a combination of free force and rocking couple a balance shaft is often used to compensate for this The secondary balance of a degree engine is perfect however the configuration does result in an unbalanced rocking couple br The first production degree straight twin motorcycle engines were fitted to the Yamaha TRX and Yamaha TDM Later examples include the Triumph Thunderbird Norton Commando Honda NC series Yamaha MT Triumph Thruxton and Royal Enfield Interceptor Continental GT This architecture is proving popular among manufacturers which are upgrading models that were previously equipped with other engine types such as the Honda Africa Twin formerly a V twin Honda Hornet formerly an inline or V Strom the older design being equipped with a V twin br br br Main bearings br Each cylinder in a straight twin engine has a separate crank pin unlike V twin engines which can use a common crank pin for both connecting rods Most vintage British straight twin motorcycle engines such as Triumph BSA Norton and Royal Enfield had two main bearings Beginning in the late s most Honda straight twin engines had four main bearings Subsequent straight twin engines had four or occasionally three main bearings br br br Usage in motorcycles br br br History br br The world s first production motorcycle the Hildebrand Wolfm ller used a straight twin engine The cylinders lay flat and forward facing with the pistons connected directly to the rear wheel using a locomotive style connecting rod In the Werner Motocyclette became the second production motorcycle model using a straight twin engine with vertical cylinders The Werner engine uses cast iron cylinders with integral heads side valves and has a displacement of cc br The Triumph Speed Twin was a successful straight twin motorcycle which also led to straight twin engines becoming more widely used by other brands The engine was designed by Edward Turner and Val Page and was initially used in the Triumph sidecar hauler which won the International Six Days Trial silver medal and the Maudes Trophy During the development of the engine it was found that a degree crank angle was better suited to the use of a single carburettor than a degree crank angle br Following the trend created by the Triumph Speed Twin the most common design used by British motorcycle manufacturers until the mid s was a four stroke straight twin engine with a degree crankshaft The manufacturers producing these motorcycles included BSA Norton Triumph Ariel Matchless and AJS Straight twin engines were also produced by Italian and German manufacturers along with the American manufacturer Indian br In the AJS E Porcupine won the Grand Prix World Championship becoming the first and only straight twin motorcycle to win the championship This engine is one of few four stroke straight twins to use cylinders oriented horizontally rather than vertically br Since the s BMW and several Japanese manufacturers have continued to produce straight twin engines mostly for middleweight models Several large scooters have also used straight twin engines such as the Yamaha TMAX and the Honda Silver Wing Straight twin engines are also used in motorcross sidecar racing br br br Transverse engined models br br Many large British motorcycles from to the s used a straight twin transverse engine i e oriented with the crankshaft perpendicular to the frame such as the Triumph Bonneville and Norton Commando This layout is well suited to air cooling since both cylinders receive equal airflow and the exhaust can exit in the well cooled location at the front of each cylinder br The transverse engine straight twin design has been largely replaced by V twin engines however the straight twin design has the advantage of easier packaging of ancillaries such as the air filter carburettor and ignition components which also improves access to ancillaries for maintenance repairs A straight twin engine using a degree crankshaft can have a similar sound and feel to a V twin engine with an uneven firing order br br br Longitudinal engined models br br Longitudinal engine straight twin motorcycles are less common however examples include the Dresch Monobloc and the Sunbeam S and S br This engine orientation allows for a motorcycle as narrow as a single cylinder engine which reduces the aerodynamic drag especially for the purpose of motorcycle racing However the main disadvantage for air cooled engines is that the rear cylinder runs hotter than the front cylinder br br br Usage in automobiles br br Although two cylinder engines are quite uncommon in cars the straight twin layout has been used for several automobile engines over time br The first known straight twin engine was a variant of the Daimler Motors Phoenix engine introduced in these engines were used in Panhard cars that year Another early straight twin engined car was the Decauville Voiturelle which used a pair of cylinders taken from a de Dion model mounted fore and aft and positioned below the seat br Straight twin engines have been used in various small cars such as the Fiat Subaru NSU Prinz Mitsubishi Minica Honda N Honda Z Fiat VAZ Oka Dacia L stun Daihatsu Cuore and the Tata Nano br As of January petrol straight twin engines used in production cars currently just include the Fiat TwinAir engine used in various models from Fiat Lancia and Alfa Romeo br The Piaggio Porter made use of a diesel straight twin engine until br br br Usage in marine vessels br br Straight twin engines have been often used as inboard motors outboard motors and jet pump motors br In the early th century gaff rigged British fishing boats such as Morecambe Bay PrawnersLancashire Nobbys would sometimes retrofit an inboard engine such as the Lister or the Kelvin E litre petrol paraffin engine br From the s manufacturers of outboard motors had settled on the use of the basic inline engine design cylinders stacked on top of each other with the crankshaft driving the propeller shaft The Suzuki outbound motor was introduced in br br br Other uses br br Other uses include tractors such as various John Deere models until snowmobiles personal watercrafts and all terrain vehicles Design variations include two stroke four stroke petrol diesel air cooling water cooling natural aspiration and turbocharging br Ultralight aircraft single seat gyro copters and small homebuilt aircraft have also used straight twin engines often using engines originally designed for snowmobiles such as the Hirth and Cuyuna D Purpose built engines for ultralight aircraft include the Rotax and Rotax Straight twin engines are sometimes also used in large scale radio controlled
