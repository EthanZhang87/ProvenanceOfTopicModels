title: Camless piston engine
id: 2905732
A camless or free valve piston engine is an engine that has poppet valves operated by means of electromagnetic hydraulic or pneumatic actuators instead of conventional cams Actuators can be used to both open and close valves or to open valves closed by springs or other means br Camshafts normally have one lobe per valve with a fixed valve duration and lift Although many modern engines use camshaft phasing adjusting the lift and valve duration in a working engine is more difficult Some manufacturers use systems with more than one cam lobe but this is still a compromise as only a few profiles can be in operation at once This is not the case with the camless engine where lift and valve timing can be adjusted freely from valve to valve and from cycle to cycle It also allows multiple lift events per cycle and indeed no events per cycle switching off the cylinder entirely br br br Camless development br Camless valve trains have long been investigated by several companies including Renault BMW Fiat Valeo General Motors Ricardo Lotus Engineering who developed electro hydraulic valve actuation in the late s as a spinoff of their active suspension program both utilised similar electro hydraulic actuation and control Ford Jiangsu Gongda Power Technologies and Koenigsegg s sister company FreeValve Some of these systems are commercially available although not yet in engines in production road vehicles In the Spring of Christian von Koenigsegg told reporters that the technology pursued by his company is getting ready for fruition but said nothing specific about his company s timetable br In November Chinese automobile manufacturer Qoros Auto displayed the Qoros hatchback at the Guangzhou Motor Show which showcased a new Qoros Qamfree engine The engine s Swedish designer FreeValve claims that the litre cu in turbocharged engine will produce kW hp and N m lb ft of torque They also claim that compared to a similar traditional engine it offers a reduction in size including a mm in lower height reduction in weight improvement in power and torque improvement in fuel economy and a reduction in emissions Christian von Koenigsegg claims in a video that the Qamfree engine with the PHEA camless technology is based on an existing Qoros engine that was developed in Germany and Austria five six years ago br Christian von Koenigsegg also claims that the PHEA camless technology allows the elimination of the pre catalytic converter because the standard catalytic converter can be brought up to temperature quickly by manipulating the exhaust cycle br br br Camless engines in marine and power stations br br br Advantages br Because camless engines have no camshaft they may have fewer moving parts In these systems the camshaft follower rocker arms and or pushrods have been replaced by an electro hydraulic actuator system which uses the existing oil pumps thus reducing development risks of the new system by employing existing technology Direction changing on older B W MC engines was engaged by physically changing the direction of the cam roller whereas with the new camless engine it is controlled by a computer This eliminates the risk of mechanical failures that could damage the engine if there was a malfunction while changing directions Additionally because there is no chain connection between the crankshaft and the camshaft the engine is lighter with fewer points of failure The absence of a camshaft also means that the parasitic load on the engine is lower which is particularly useful in large marine engines as it can equate to a large amount of power savings With a camless engine fuel injection and exhaust timing are directly controlled by an engine control unit and can be constantly changed and adjusted without stopping the engine This allows for the engine to run at a lower RPM a feature useful in ships as it allows better low speed maneuvering while docking Additionally when a ship is maneuvering the computer controlled fuel injection and valve timing allows for faster RPM control hence faster stopping in emergency situations br Solenoid valves are used to control valve activation that is electronically operated These are used for controlling liquid or gas flow and most commonly used in fluidics as control elements They are multifunctional in a way to release shut off mix or distribute fluids with high reliability and fast processing Solenoid valves market is growing with the imperative growth in all the regions Increasing application areas year on year and advancement in technology and developed fluid automation technologies all are driving the market on a global scale br br br Technical limitations of camless engines br Conventional mechanical camshaft actuation is capable of generating extremely high forces which combined with very high stiffness low mechanical compliance of a conventional modern valve train layout is used to very accurately and consistently control the position the engine valves This enables very high levels of valve acceleration and lift and also very small valve to valve and valve to piston clearances to be used in combination with very high engine speeds For example prior to the FIA restrictions Formula engines ran at speeds of over rpm and power outputs of over bhp litre normally aspirated using a conventional camshaft and mechanical valve actuation it is extremely unlikely that this high engine speed and output can be achieved with camless valve actuation At rpm the valves open and close times a second br br br Emissions br Camless engines are able to produce fewer emissions than their equivalent camshaft counterparts because they are able to more precisely control the combustion procedure allowing for more complete combustion of all hydrocarbons The computer is able to sense when not all of the fuel is being consumed and immediately relax valve timings to supply less fuel to a cylinder The ECU can constantly adjust valve timing height and fuel air mixtures to optimize efficiency for a given RPM torque load It can sense when there is a high amount of NOx and SOx sulfur oxide emission and change the timing to make the exhaust gas hotter or cooler Since the engine is run electronically and not mechanically camless engines can be updated to meet new emission regulations without mechanical modifications br br br Fuel injection br Camless engines can further reduce NOx emissions with the use of fuel staging Instead of simply injecting a constant stream of fuel fuel staging injects the fuel at the optimal time for the most complete combustion Fuel injection can shut off when there is sufficient pressure and add more fuel when there is less pressure allowing the engines to run closer to a perfect diesel cycle This allows the engine to run as efficiently as the environment and heat capacity of the metal will allow br br br Long term effects br Because these new engines can diagnose themselves and run efficiently without an operator changing settings these engines require a smaller crew to maintain them at sea This crew reduction equates to cheaper shipping and more global trade br br br Camless engines in cars br The British company Camcon Technology is developing a camless engine for passenger vehicles based on their proprietary Intelligent Valve Actuation IVA system Camcon has collaborated with Jaguar Land Rover to fit IVA onto an Ingenium l cylinder petrol engine and they jointly published results at the Aachen Colloquium Camcon also discussed features and benefits in an article and video that was published in Autocar magazine br The Swedish company Freevalve AB formerly Cargine a sister company to Koenigsegg Automotive AB is developing a camless system on an existing SAAB car engine br In April the Chinese car manufacturer Qoros presented a concept car incorporating Freevalve technology br In March Koenigsegg Automotive AB announced its first four seater car the Gemera which is powered by a sequentially turbocharged liter inline three engine in conjunction with three electric motors Two of those electric motors each of which makes bhp kW are on the rear wheels The third motor is attached to the engine crankshaft and makes bhp kW Working with the motor to propel the front wheels is what Koenigsegg calls the Tiny Friendly Giant TFG engine It is rated at bhp and
