id: 17047276
Two and four stroke engines are engines that combine elements from both two stroke and four stroke engines They usually incorporate two pistons br br br M engine br br The M engine also known as the double piston internal combustion engine is a type of internal combustion engine invented by Polish patent holder Piotr M yk br The M engine took its name from a combination of two stroke engines and four stroke engines The two stroke combustion engine is characterized by a simple construction and system of air load change as well as a bigger index of power output However its filling ratio is worse than in a four stroke engine The ecological index of a two stroke engine is also unfavorable The system of valves of the four stroke engine is its disadvantage The cylinders of both modules of the double pistons engine have been joined along one axis with a common cylinder head in the form of a ring The pistons are moved at different speeds and with appropriate stage displacement The two crankshafts are connected with a special transmission that rotates the four stroke crankshaft at twice the speed of the two stroke crankshaft The engine is named double piston because of its construction double pistons and crankshafts In the M the advantages of both engines being connected are obvious the pistons of the engine working in one combustion cylinder are set opposite to each other but in different modes Although the projects of connecting two stroke modes in one cylinder were attempted a long time ago in the opposed piston engine the combination of the two different cycles had never been tried before It turned out that the engine is not only able to work but also the effects are very promising The engine has a far greater efficiency over the break even value known to combustion engines about and closer to the one associated with steam turbines or electric engines about br br Other advantages br br More efficient power production horsepower from cc of volume in the basic version br Ability to use different fuel types natural plant oils as well as petroleum br Much better ecological effects a huge reduction of carbon dioxide and other gases emission br Lower fuel consumption br Prolonged stroke expansion br Possibility to change the compression parameters without having to stop the engine br Simplicity of construction br The idea was developed at the Silesian University of Technology Poland under the leadership of Adam Ciesio kiewicz It was granted the patent number by the Polish Patent Office The work with the new combustion engine has been done by IZOLING P W Company in cooperation with the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice Consultations with researchers from Technical University of Krak w were also held So far two working engine models have been made The preliminary model is based on two existing engines a two stroke motorbike engine and a four stroke small machine engine This model confirms the concept of two and four stroke engines connection The second model is the functional model The new solution for a combustion engine was presented during scientific conferences KONES Seminary of biofuels etc and in mass media journals newspapers TVP radio br The hope to build a modern and universal ecological engine with good technical parameters and low fuel consumption is connected to the double piston internal combustion engine br br br The M engine working cycle br br The stages of the working cycle br br Gas exhaust br Fresh air inlet two stages br Medium compression br Two stage combustion br Gas expansion br The filling process takes place at the overpressure phase using a mechanical gas compressor and a throttle for the purpose of regulation br The load change is assisted by a four stroke piston working as a dynamic boosting system and allowing the good scavenging of working space br A possibility exists of changing the relative piston positions during the engine work which gives the possibility of changing the compression ratio depending on the temporary level of the load This suggests the possibility of different fuels for combustion low octane petrol biofuels with high levels of vegetable components br The working cycle is characterized by an almost constant combustion characteristic of the working space volume increasing during the expansion stage br The engine is characterized by br br Extended gas expansion and limited exhaust gas temperature on the outlet br The variability of the compression ratio and the possibility of changing the compression ratio during the engine work depending on the temporary load br A beneficial changing of working space during the mixture compression with different crankshafts polar locations That makes the pressure forming in the cylinder possible within reasonable limits br An almost constant characteristic of volume increasing during the expansion stage at different piston positions it influences the steady power transport br Calculations prove the new engine has more favorable parameters and work indicators br br The increase of engine thermal efficiency Although the mechanical efficiency is lesser than a conventional engine br Higher total efficiency efficiency characteristic is more favorable at medium load It is comparable with the diesel engine efficiency so the exploitation of fuel consumption is relatively smaller br The higher torque and the higher power output compared to the four stroke SI engine with the same stroke volume br br br Ricardo x engine br The two cycle modes are currently being researched at Ricardo Consulting Engineers in the UK The concept consists in switching from one mode to the other depending on the rpm value The four stroke engine is more efficient when running at full throttle while the opposite is the case for the two stroke engine When a small car under heavy load runs at half speed the engine automatically switches to the two cycle mode which is then more efficient The research on this showed a reduction in fuel consumption br The M engine has a four stroke piston and a two stroke piston The shaft of the four stroke piston rotates twice as fast as the shaft of the two stroke piston and the two stroke part always runs at half speed This ensures that both parts work optimally regarding fuel consumption at all times The same principles apply to having two distinct engines but the design of the M is much simpler br br br See also br Six stroke engine br Rotary engine br br br
