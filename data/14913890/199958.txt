A V engine sometimes called a Vee engine is a common configuration for internal combustion engines It consists of two cylinder banks usually with the same number of cylinders in each bank connected to a common crankshaft These cylinder banks are arranged at an angle to each other so that the banks form a V shape when viewed from the front of the engine br V engines typically have a shorter length than equivalent inline engines however the trade off is a larger width V V and V engines are the most common layout for automobile engines with or cylinders respectively br br br History br The first V engine a two cylinder V twin was designed by Wilhelm Maybach and used in the Daimler Stahlradwagen automobile br The first V engine was produced in in the form of the Antoinette engine designed by L on Levavasseur for racing boats and airplanes The first V engine was produced the following year by Putney Motor Works in London again for use in racing boats The first V engine to reach production appeared soon after in by the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Germany for use as a generator for gasoline electric railway engines However it was not until that the V engine was used in series production automobiles with the first example being the Lancia V engine This V engine used a degree V angle and separate crankpins for each cylinder to reduce the vibration issues experienced by earlier attempts at production V engines br br br Characteristics br Compared with an equivalent inline engine the most common configuration for engines with less than six cylinders a V engine has a shorter length but is wider This effect increases with the number of cylinders in the engine the length difference between a H br twin and straight twin engines might be insignificant however V engines have a significantly smaller length than straight engines Compared with the less common flat engine a V engine is narrower taller and has a higher center of mass br br The V angle or included angle between the cylinder banks varies significantly between engines Some engines have used a V angle of degrees the same angle as a flat engine such as several Ferrari V engines At the other end of the scale the Lancia V engine and the present Volkswagen VR engine use V angles as small as degrees along with a single cylinder head used by both banks of cylinders br The engine balance of a V engine is that of perfect primary and secondary balance For V engines with fewer cylinders the engine balance will depend on factors such as the firing interval crankshaft counterweights and whether balance shafts are present br The crankpins on a V engine are usually shared by two cylinders from opposing banks with an offset between the two cylinders Alternative configurations are separate crankpins per cylinder such as several V twin engines or articulated connecting rods for example the such as the Rolls Royce Merlin aero engine br br br Inverted engines br br Some airplanes of the s and s used inverted engines whereby the crankshaft is located at the top of the engine and the cylinder heads are at the bottom Advantages include better visibility in a single engined airplane a higher thrust line and resultant increased ground clearance for the propeller Examples include the Argus As V engine and the Daimler Benz DB V engines br br br Specific configurations br br It is common practice for V engines to be described with V notation where represents the number of cylinders Configurations of V engines which have reached production are as follows br br br See also br br br
