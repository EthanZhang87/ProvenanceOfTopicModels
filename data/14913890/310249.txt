title: Straight-three engine
id: 310249
A straight three engine also called an inline triple or inline three is a three cylinder piston engine where cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft br Less common than straight four engines straight three engines have nonetheless been used in various motorcycles cars and agricultural machinery br br br Design br br A crankshaft angle of degrees is typically used by straight three engines since this results in an evenly spaced firing interval Another benefit of this configuration is perfect primary balance and secondary balance however an end to end rocking couple is induced because there is no symmetry in the piston velocities about the middle piston A balance shaft is sometimes used to reduce the vibrations caused by the rocking couple br Other crankshaft angles have been used occasionally The Laverda Jota motorcycle used a degree crankshaft where the outer pistons rise and fall together and inner cylinder is offset from them by degrees This results in three power strokes evenly spaced at degrees each and then no power strokes during the final degrees of crankshaft rotation The Triumph Tiger motorcycle uses a T Plane crankshaft where the crankshaft throws are at intervals such that the throws for cylinders and are separated by degrees therefore the three throws together forming a T shape when viewed from the end br br br Usage in cars br br Among the first cars to use a straight three engine is the DKW F powered by a cc cu in two stroke engine The Saab saw the introduction of Saab s cc cu in two stroke engine which was also used in the Saab Saab and Saab Sonett until after which it was replaced by the Ford Taunus V engine br The Wartburg cars manufactured in East Germany and FSO Syrena manufactured in Poland also used straight three engines br The Suzuki Fronte uses a cc cu in two stroke engine In Suzuki began production of a cc cu in four stroke engine which was introduced in the Alto and Fronte models br The Subaru EF engine is a stroke petrol engine which was introduced in and used in the Justy and the Sumo the export version of the Sambar br The straight three versions of the Ford EcoBoost engine a turbocharged litre petrol engine was introduced in the Ford Focus It uses an unbalanced flywheel to shift the inherent three cylinder imbalance to the horizontal plane where it is more easily managed by engine mounts and so remove the need to use balance shafts In cylinder deactivation was added claimed to be a world first for three cylinder engines br br br Usage in motorcycles br br The advantages of a straight three engine for motorcycles are that it has a shorter length than an inline four engine and produces less vibration than a straight twin engine br br br Four stroke br Four stroke straight three engines have been used in road bikes and racing bikes by several companies br From the BMW K was produced with a straight three engine based on the straight four engine from the BMW K br British company Triumph is particularly renowned for a transversely mounted straight three engine Variants have been used in their Speed Triple Trident Sprint and Tiger series br In addition Triumph makes the Rocket III model various variants of which have held the record for motorcycle with the largest engine displacement br In the Moto class in the MotoGP World Championship switched to using Triumph cc cu in triple engines br br br Two stroke br Two stroke designs are less common in straight three engines than four stroke designs however several were produced by Japanese manufacturers in the late s through to s br The Kawasaki triple engine was produced from to and was used in various road bikes and racing bikes Most versions were air cooled however several were water cooled Similarly the Suzuki GT series engines were used for both road bike and racing bikes and were available in both air cooled and water cooled versions br br br Other uses br br br Agriculture br br An example of an agricultural application is the Fairbanks Morse E low speed diesel engine br The straight three layout is common for diesel tractor engines such as the Perkins AD This engine was used in the Massey Ferguson and Fordson Dextra tractors as well as for marine and stationary applications br br br Aviation br The Hewland AE is a cc two stroke aircraft engine that was produced in the mid s It was an inverted three cylinder design with liquid cooling that produced bhp kW br br br See also br br Straight engine br V engine br br br
