An aeolipile aeolipyle or eolipile from the Greek also known as a Hero s or Heron s engine is a simple bladeless radial steam turbine which spins when the central water container is heated Torque is produced by steam jets exiting the turbine The Greek Egyptian mathematician and engineer Hero of Alexandria described the device in the st century AD and many sources give him the credit for its invention However Vitruvius was the first to describe this appliance in his De architectura ca BC br The aeolipile is considered to be the first recorded steam engine or reaction steam turbine but it is neither a practical source of power nor a direct predecessor of the type of steam engine invented during the Industrial Revolution br The name derived from the Greek word and Latin word pila translates to the ball of Aeolus Aeolus being the Greek god of the air and wind br Due to its use of steam as the medium for performing work the Aeolipile in profile view was adopted as the symbol for the U S Navy s Boiler Technician Rate which had formed out of the Watertender Boilermaker and Boilerman ratings that used the same symbol br br br Physics br br The aeolipile usually consists of a spherical or cylindrical vessel with oppositely bent or curved nozzles projecting outwards It is designed to rotate on its axis When the vessel is pressurised with steam the gas is expelled out of the nozzles which generates thrust due to the rocket principle as a consequence of the nd and rd of Newton s laws of motion When the nozzles pointing in different directions produce forces along different lines of action perpendicular to the axis of the bearings the thrusts combine to result in a rotational moment mechanical couple or torque causing the vessel to spin about its axis Aerodynamic drag and frictional forces in the bearings build up quickly with increasing rotational speed rpm and consume the accelerating torque eventually cancelling it and achieving a steady state speed br Typically and as Hero described the device the water is heated in a simple boiler which forms part of a stand for the rotating vessel Where this is the case the boiler is connected to the rotating chamber by a pair of pipes that also serve as the pivots for the chamber Alternatively the rotating chamber may itself serve as the boiler and this arrangement greatly simplifies the pivot bearing arrangements as they then do not need to pass steam This can be seen in the illustration of a classroom model shown here br br br History br br Both Hero and Vitruvius draw on the much earlier work by Ctesibius BC also known as Kt s bios or Tesibius who was an inventor and mathematician in Alexandria Ptolemaic Egypt He wrote the first treatises on the science of compressed air and its uses in pumps br br br Vitruvius s description br Vitruvius c BC c BC mentions aeolipiles by name br br Aeolipilae are hollow brazen vessels which have an opening or mouth of small size by means of which they can be filled with water Prior to the water being heated over the fire but little wind is emitted As soon however as the water begins to boil a violent wind issues forth br br br Hero s description br Hero c AD takes a more practical approach in that he gives instructions how to make one br br No The Steam Engine br PLACE a cauldron over a fire a ball shall revolve on a pivot A fire is ignited under a

the ball to revolve as in the case of the dancing figures br br br Practical usage br br It is not known whether the aeolipile was put to any practical use in ancient times and if it was seen as a pragmatic device a whimsical novelty an object of reverence or some other thing A source described it as a mere curiosity for the ancient Greeks or a party trick Hero s drawing shows a standalone device and was presumably intended as a temple wonder like many of the other devices described in Pneumatica br Vitruvius on the other hand mentions use of the aeolipile for demonstrating the physical properties of the weather He describes them as br br brazen olipyl which clearly shew that an attentive examination of human inventions often leads to a knowledge of the general laws of nature br After describing the device s construction see above he concludes br br Thus a simple experiment enables us to ascertain and determine the causes and effects of the great operations of the heavens and the winds br In Blasco de Garay a scientist and a captain in the Spanish navy allegedly demonstrated before the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and a committee of high officials an invention he claimed could propel large ships in the absence of wind using an apparatus consisted of copper boiler and moving wheels on either side of the ship This account was preserved by the royal Spanish archives at Simancas It is proposed that de Garay used Hero s aeolipile and combined it with the technology used in Roman boats and late medieval galleys Here de Garay s invention introduced an innovation where the aeolipile had practical usage which was to generate motion to the paddlewheels demonstrating the feasibility of steam driven boats This claim was denied by Spanish authorities br br br See also br
