A Carnot heat engine is a theoretical heat engine that operates on the Carnot cycle The basic model for this engine was developed by Nicolas L onard Sadi Carnot in The Carnot engine model was graphically expanded by Beno t Paul mile Clapeyron in and mathematically explored by Rudolf Clausius in work that led to the fundamental thermodynamic concept of entropy The Carnot engine is the most efficient heat engine which is theoretically possible The efficiency depends only upon the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold heat reservoirs between which it operates br A heat engine acts by transferring energy from a warm region to a cool region of space and in the process converting some of that energy to mechanical work The cycle may also be reversed The system may be worked upon by an external force and in the process it can transfer thermal energy from a cooler system to a warmer one thereby acting as a refrigerator or heat pump rather than a heat engine br Every thermodynamic system exists in a particular state A thermodynamic cycle occurs when a system is taken through a series of different states and finally returned to its initial state In the process of going through this cycle the system may perform work on its surroundings thereby acting as a heat engine br The Carnot engine is a theoretical construct useful for exploring the efficiency limits of other heat engines An actual Carnot engine however would be completely impractical to build br br br Carnot s diagram br In the adjacent diagram from Carnot s work Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire there are two bodies A and B kept each at a constant temperature that of A being higher than that of B These two bodies to which we can give or from which we can remove the heat without causing their temperatures to vary exercise the functions of two unlimited reservoirs of caloric We will call the first the furnace and the second the refrigerator Carnot then explains how we can obtain motive power i e work by carrying a certain quantity of heat from body A to body B br It also acts as a cooler and hence can also act as a refrigerator br br br Modern diagram br br The previous image shows the original piston and cylinder diagram used by Carnot in discussing his ideal engine The figure at right shows a block diagram of a generic heat engine such as the Carnot engine In the diagram the working body system a term introduced by Clausius in can be any fluid or vapor body through which heat Q can be introduced or transmitted to produce work Carnot had postulated that the fluid body could be any substance capable of expansion such as vapor of water vapor of alcohol vapor of mercury a permanent gas air etc Although in those early years engines came in a number of configurations typically QH was supplied by a boiler wherein water was boiled over a furnace QC was typically removed by a stream of cold flowing water in the form of a condenser located on a separate part of the engine The output work W is transmitted by the movement of the piston as it is used to turn a crank arm which in turn was typically used to power a pulley so as to lift water out of flooded salt mines Carnot defined work as weight lifted through a height br br br Carnot cycle br br The Carnot cycle when acting as a heat engine consists of the following steps br br Reversible isothermal expansion of the gas at the hot temperature TH isothermal heat addition or absorption During this step A to B the gas is allowed to expand and it does work on the surroundings The temperature of the gas the system does not change during the process and thus the expansion is isothermic The gas expansion is propelled by absorption of heat energy QH and of entropy SH QH TH from the high temperature reservoir br Isentropic reversible adiabatic expansion of the gas isentropic work output For this step B to C the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated thus they neither gain nor lose heat The gas continues to expand doing work on the surroundings and losing an equivalent amount of internal energy The gas expansion causes it to cool to the cold temperature TC The entropy remains unchanged br Reversible isothermal compression of the gas at the cold temperature TC isothermal heat rejection C to D Now the gas is exposed to the cold temperature reservoir while the surroundings do work on the gas by compressing it such as through the return compression of a piston while causing an amount of waste heat QC with the standard sign convention for heat and of entropy SC QC TC to flow out of the gas to the low temperature reservoir In magnitude this is the same amount of entropy absorbed in step The entropy decreases in isothermal compression since the multiplicity of the system decreases with the volume In terms of magnitude the recompression work performed by the surroundings in this step is less than the work performed on the surroundings in step because it occurs at a lower pressure due to the lower temperature i e the resistance to compression is lower under step than the force of expansion under step br Isentropic compression of the gas isentropic work input D to A Once again the piston and cylinder are assumed to be thermally insulated and the cold temperature reservoir is removed During this step the surroundings continue to do work to further compress the gas and both the temperature and pressure rise now that the heat sink has been removed This additional work increases the internal energy of the gas compressing it and causing the temperature to rise to TH The entropy remains unchanged At this point the gas is in the same state as at the start of step br br br Carnot s theorem br br Carnot s theorem is a formal statement of this fact No engine operating between two heat reservoirs can be more efficient than a Carnot engine operating between the same reservoirs br br br br br br br br I br br br br br br W br br Q br br br H br br br br br

I is defined as above br br W is the work done by the system energy exiting the system as work br QH is the heat put into the system heat energy entering the system br TC is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir and br TH is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir br A corollary to Carnot s theorem states that All reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient br It is easily shown that the efficiency is maximum when the entire cyclic process is a reversible process This means the total entropy of system and surroundings the entropies of the hot furnace the working fluid of the heat engine and the cold sink remains constant when the working fluid completes one cycle and returns to its original state In the general and more realistic case of an irreversible process the total entropy of this combined system would increase br Since the working fluid comes back to the same state after one cycle and entropy of the system is a state function the change in entropy of the working fluid system is Thus it implies that the total entropy change of the furnace and sink is zero for the process to be reversible and the efficiency of the engine to be maximum This derivation is carried out in the next section br The coefficient of performance COP of the heat engine is the reciprocal of its efficiency br br br Efficiency of real heat engines br For a real heat engine the total thermodynamic process is generally irreversible The working fluid is brought back to its initial state after one cycle and thus the change of entropy of the fluid system is but the sum of the entropy changes in the hot and cold reservoir in this one cyclical process is greater than br The internal energy of the fluid is also a state variable so its total change in one cycle is So the total work done by the system W is equal to the net heat put into the system the sum of br br br br br Q br br H br br br br br displaystyle Q text H br br taken up and

the hot reservoir and released by it to the cold reservoir respectively no longer remain ideally reversible and there is a temperature differential between the temperature of the reservoir and the temperature of the fluid while heat exchange takes place br During heat transfer from the hot reservoir at br br br br br T br br H br br br br br displaystyle T text H br br to the fluid the fluid

this process of transfer of heat to the cold reservoir the temperature of the fluid T is always slightly greater than br br br br br T br br C br br br br br displaystyle T text C br br br We have only considered the magnitude of the entropy change here Since the total change of entropy of the fluid system for the cyclic process is we must have br br The previous three equations namely substituted into to give br br For Sh Qh Th Sc Qc Tc br Sh Qh Th Sc Qc Tc br Sc Qc Tc br it is at least Qh Th Qc Tc br Equations and combine to give br br To derive this step needs two adiabatic processes involved to show an isentropic process property for the ratio of the changing volumes of two isothermal processes are equal br Most importantly since the two adiabatic processes are volume works without heat lost and since the ratio of volume changes for this two processes are the same so the works for these two adiabatic processes are the same with opposite direction to each other namely one direction is work done by the system and the other is work done on the system therefore heat efficiency only concerns the amount of work done by the heat absorbed comparing to the amount of heat absorbed by the system br Therefore W Qh Qh Qc Qh br Qc Qh br Tc Th br And from br Qh Th Qc Tc here Qc it is less than release heat br Tc Th Qc Qh br Tc Th Qc Qh br Tc Th Qc Qh br Tc Th Qh Qc Qh

the efficiency of the real engine is always less than the ideal Carnot engine br Equation signifies that the total entropy of system and surroundings the fluid and the two reservoirs increases for the

According to the second theorem The efficiency of the Carnot engine is independent of the nature of the working substance br br br The Carnot engine and Rudolf Diesel br In Rudolf Diesel patented an internal combustion engine inspired by the Carnot engine Diesel knew a Carnot engine is an ideal that cannot be built but he thought he had invented a working approximation His principle was unsound but in his struggle to implement it he developed a practical Diesel engine br The conceptual problem was how to achieve isothermal expansion in an internal combustion engine since burning fuel at the highest temperature of the cycle would only raise the temperature further Diesel s patented solution was having achieved the highest temperature just by compressing the air to add a small amount of fuel at a controlled rate such that heating caused by burning the fuel would be counteracted by cooling caused by air expansion as the piston moved Hence all the heat from the fuel would be transformed into work during the isothermal expansion as required by Carnot s theorem br For the idea to work a small mass of fuel would have to be burnt in a huge mass of air Diesel first proposed a working engine that would compress air to atmospheres at C F then cycle to one atmosphere at C F However this was well beyond the technological capabilities of the day since it implied a compression ratio of Such an engine if it could have been built would have had an efficiency of In contrast the best steam engines of his day achieved br Accordingly Diesel sought to compromise He calculated that were he to reduce the peak pressure to a less ambitious atmospheres he would sacrifice only of the thermal efficiency Seeking financial support he published the Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Engine to Take the Place of the Steam Engine and All Presently Known Combustion Engines Endorsed by scientific opinion including Lord Kelvin he won the backing of Krupp and Maschinenfabrik Augsburg He clung to the Carnot cycle as a symbol But years of practical work failed to achieve an isothermal combustion engine nor could have done since it requires such an enormous quantity of air that it cannot develop enough power to compress it Furthermore controlled fuel injection turned out to be no easy matter br Even so the Diesel engine slowly evolved over years to become a practical high compression air engine its fuel injected near the end of the compression stroke and ignited by the heat of compression capable by of efficiency br br br As a macroscopic construct br The Carnot heat engine is ultimately a theoretical construct based on an idealized thermodynamic system On a practical human scale level the Carnot cycle has proven a valuable model as in advancing the development of the diesel engine However on a macroscopic scale limitations placed by the model s assumptions prove it impractical and ultimately incapable of doing any work As such per Carnot s theorem the Carnot engine may be thought as the theoretical limit of macroscopic scale heat engines rather than any practical device that could ever be built br For example for the isothermal expansion part of the Carnot cycle the following br infinitesimal conditions must be satisfied simultaneously at every step in the expansion br br The hot reservoir temperature TH is infinitesimally higher than the system gas temperature T so heat flow energy transfer from the hot reservoir to the gas is made without increasing T via infinitesimal work on the surroundings by the gas as another energy transfer if TH is significantly higher than T then T may be not uniform through the gas so the system would deviate from thermal equilibrium as well as not being a reversible process i e not a Carnot cycle or T might increase noticeably so it would not be an isothermal process br The force externally applied on the piston opposite to the internal force on the piston by the gas needs to be infinitesimally reduced externally Without this assistance it would not be possible to follow a gas PV Pressure Volume curve downward at a constant T since following this curve means that the gas to piston force decreases P decreases as the volume expands the piston moves outward If this assistance is so strong that the volume expansion is significant the system may deviate from thermal equilibrium and the process fail to be reversible and thus not a Carnot cycle br Such infinitesimal requirements as these and others cause the Carnot cycle to take an infinite amount of time rendering the production of work impossible br Other practical requirements that make the Carnot cycle impractical to realize include fine control of the gas and perfect thermal contact with the surroundings
