A flat four engine also known as a horizontally opposed four engine or boxer engine is a four cylinder piston engine with two banks of cylinders lying on opposite sides of a common crankshaft The most common type of flat four engine is the boxer four engine each pair of opposed pistons moves inwards and outwards at the same time br A boxer four engine has perfect primary and secondary balance however the two cylinder heads means the design is more expensive to produce than an inline four engine There is a minor secondary unbalanced rotational torque pulse in the plane of the pistons when a piston pair at one end of the engine is at TDC and the other pair at BDC The TDC pair creates a torque greater than the BDC pair so the net unbalanced torque pulse is the difference The difference in TDC vs BDC inertial forces is explained in the Engine balance section Boxer four engines have been used in cars since especially by Volkswagen and Subaru They have also occasionally been used in motorcycles and frequently in aircraft Cessna and Piper use flat four engines from Lycoming and Continental in the most common civil aircraft in the world the Cessna and Piper Cherokee while many ultralight and LSA planes use versions of the Rotax br br br Design br br In a flat four engine each pair of opposing pistons successively moves inwards together and outwards together The advantages of the boxer four layout are perfect secondary vibration resulting in minimal vibration a low centre of gravity and a short engine length Flat four engine have successfully used air cooling although air cooled engines are noisier and have a lower power output than an equivalent engine with liquid cooling In light aircraft where lightness is of primary importance air cooling has traditionally been common br The downsides of boxer four engines compared with inline four engines are their extra width the increased costs associated with having two cylinder heads instead of one and the long exhaust manifold required to achieve evenly spaced exhaust pulses Due to these factors inline four engines are more common in cars than are flat four engines and V engines are often used where larger displacements are required br br br Engine balance br The equal and opposing forces generated in a boxer four engine result in perfect secondary balance unlike the unbalanced vertical forces produced by inline four engines Boxer four engines are therefore better suited to displacements above L cu in since they do not require balance shafts to reduce the secondary vibration br In a boxer engine each cylinder is slightly offset from its opposing pair due to the distance between the crankpin journals This offset gives rise to a slight rocking couple but any resulting vibration is normally insufficient to require balance shafts br As with all four stroke engines of four cylinders or less the lack of overlap in the power strokes results in a pulsating delivery of torque to the flywheel causing a torsional vibration along the crankshaft axis Such vibration if excessive may be minimised using a harmonic damper br br br Exhaust manifold br The typical firing order for a boxer four engine is for the left bank of cylinders to ignite one after another followed by the right bank of cylinders or vice versa with the firing interval evenly spaced at degrees Traditionally the exhausts from the two cylinders on each bank were merged with the resulting uneven exhaust pulses causing a characteristic flat four burble exhaust sound br The other common exhaust configuration such as used by Subaru since the mid s is to pair the cylinders with a firing interval offset of degrees in order to optimise the exhaust pulses This configuration requires long exhaust manifolds in order to pair the cylinders on opposite banks and results in a less distinctive exhaust sound br br br Use in automobiles br br br br br In the first flat four engine was produced by Benz Cie based on Benz s contra flat twin engine This engine was used in Benz racing cars produced hp kW had a displacement of L cu in and was designed by Georg Diehl br London company Wilson Pilcher released its first car in which was powered by a flat four engine This engine was mounted longitudinally in the chassis water cooled produced hp kW and had a displacement of L cu in Unusually for its day the bore and stroke were equal with each being mm in br In the Buffum automobile was equipped with opposed four cylinder engines that were rated at horsepower Herbert H Buffum produced an American Automobile called the Buffum in Abington Massachusetts from to br Having previously produced flat twin engines the Tatra was the Czech company s first model powered by a flat four engine Tatra produced various flat four engined model through the s and s br br br br br The Tatra T pioneered the rear engined air cooled flat four backbone chassis layout later used by the Volkswagen Beetle and at the same time though unrelated came the Steyr from Austria sporting a front boxer engine with rear wheel drive Also in English company Jowett expanded its model range from flat twin engines to also include flat four engines Production of Jowett flat four engines continued until when the Jowett Javelin saloon and Jowett Jupiter sports models ended production br The longest production flat four engine is the Volkswagen air cooled engine which was produced from until and was most famously used in the rear engined Volkswagen Beetle and Volkswagen Transporter This air cooled engine was designed by Porsche and was also used in the Porsche Porsche Porsche and Porsche In to comply with exhaust emissions regulations a water cooled version called the Volkswagen Wasserboxer was introduced in the Volkswagen Transporter T br During the s and s several manufacturers produced flat four engines including the air cooled Citro n flat four engine the water cooled Alfa Romeo flat four engine the water cooled Lancia flat four engine and the water cooled Subaru EA engine br Two important engines designed during this period but never saw the light of day in series production were the Morris cc side valve engine by Alec Issigonis in originally destined for the Morris Minor and the Ferguson litre SOHC engine by Claude Hill in as part of the R vehicle research project br br br present br br By most manufacturers had replaced flat four engines with inline four engines A notable exception is Subaru with the water cooled Subaru EJ engine being available in turbocharged form in the Subaru WRX sports sedan and its World Rally Car counterpart Subaru s adoption of all wheel drive was a factor in retaining the flat four engine since the shorter length of this engine assists in fitting the all wheel drive components into the chassis Although it is more expensive than an inline four engine the flat four engine allows Subaru to build an all wheel drive vehicle at little extra cost from two wheel drive br In a naturally aspirated version of the Subaru FA engine was used in the Toyota also called the Subaru BRZ and Scion FR S rear wheel drive sports coupe This engine is water cooled has gasoline direct injection produces kW hp and has a displacement of L cu in br The Porsche Boxster Cayman mid engined sports cars downsized from a naturally aspirated flat six engine to a turbocharged flat four engine Porsche s first flat four since the mid s This engine is produced in displacements of L cu in and produces up to hp kW Several reviewers criticised the Boxster Cayman for an uninspiring engine sound br br br Use in motorcycles br br Most motorcycles with four cylinder engines use an inline four engine layout however several flat four engine engines have been used in shaft drive motorcycles br br Z ndapp K air cooled br Honda Gold Wing liquid cooled br Wooler cc air cooled br BFG in French using the air cooled Citro n flat four car engine Approximately were built with one quarter of these purchased by the French police br br br Use in aircraft br br Light aircraft commonly use flat four engines with displacements up to L cu in from manufacturers such as Lycoming Engines Continental Motors and Franklin Engine Company br For radio controlled aircraft flat four engines with displacements of cc cu in are produced by companies such as O S Engines br A notable recent flat four aero engine is the side valve Belgian D Motor LF Although the side valve format has long been abandoned for most automotive applications because its combustion chamber is a bar to high engine rpm the massively over square D Motor is a very simple low revving compact reliable lightweight aero engine without the heavy complication of ohv valve gear br br br See also br Inline four engine br V engine
