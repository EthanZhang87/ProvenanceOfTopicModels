title: Straight-four engine
id: 200655
A straight four engine also referred to as an inline four engine is a four cylinder piston engine where cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft br The majority of automotive four cylinder engines use a straight four layout pp with the exceptions of the flat four engines produced by Subaru and Porsche and the layout is also very common in motorcycles and other machinery Therefore the term four cylinder engine is usually synonymous with straight four engines When a straight four engine is installed at an inclined angle instead of with the cylinders oriented vertically it is sometimes called a slant four br Between and the proportion of new vehicles sold in the United States with four cylinder engines rose from to By the model year the share for light duty vehicles had risen to br br br Design br A four stroke straight four engine always has a cylinder on its power stroke unlike engines with fewer cylinders where there is no power stroke occurring at certain times Compared with a V engine or a flat four engine a straight four engine only has one cylinder head which reduces complexity and production cost br br br Displacement br Petrol straight four engines used in modern production cars typically have a displacement of L cu in but larger engines have been used in the past for example the Bentley Litre br Diesel engines have been produced in larger displacements such as a L turbocharged Mitsubishi engine used the Pajero Shogun Montero SUV and a L Toyota engine European and Asian trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating between and tonnes typically use inline four cylinder diesel engines with displacements around litres Larger displacements are found in locomotive marine and stationary engines br Displacement can also be very small as found in kei cars sold in Japan Several of these engines had four cylinders at a time when regulations dictated a maximum displacement of cc the maximum size is currently at cc br br br Primary and secondary balance br Straight four engines with the preferred crankshaft configuration have perfect primary balance p This is because the pistons are moving in pairs and one pair of pistons is always moving up at the same time as the other pair is moving down br However straight four engines have a secondary imbalance This is caused by the acceleration deceleration of the pistons during the top half of the crankshaft rotation being greater than that of the pistons in the bottom half of the crankshaft rotation because the connecting rods are not infinitely long As a result two pistons are always accelerating faster in one direction while the other two are accelerating more slowly in the other direction which leads to a secondary dynamic imbalance that causes an up and down vibration at twice crankshaft speed This imbalance is common among all piston engines but the effect is particularly strong on four stroke inline four because of the two pistons always moving together br The strength of this imbalance is determined by the reciprocating mass the ratio of connecting rod length to stroke and the peak piston velocity Therefore small displacement engines with light pistons show little effect and racing engines use long connecting rods However the effect grows quadratically with engine speed rpm br br br Pulsations in power delivery br br Four stroke engines with five or more cylinders are able to have at least one cylinder performing its power stroke at any given point in time However four cylinder engines have gaps in the power delivery since each cylinder completes its power stroke before the next piston starts a new power stroke This pulsating delivery of power results in more vibrations than engines with more than four cylinders br br br Usage of balance shafts br A balance shaft system is sometimes used to reduce the vibrations created by a straight four engine most often in engines with larger displacements The balance shaft system was invented in and consists of two shafts carrying identical eccentric weights that rotate in opposite directions at twice the crankshaft s speed pp This system was patented by Mitsubishi Motors in the s and has since been used under licence by several other companies br Not all large displacement straight four engines have used balance shafts however Examples of relatively large engines without balance shafts include the litre Citro n DS engine the litre Austin Healey engine the L Ford Model A engine and the L GM Iron Duke engine Soviet Russian GAZ Volga and UAZ engines with displacements of up to litres were produced without balance shafts from the s to the s however these were relatively low revving engines which reduces the need for a balance shaft system pp br br br Usage in production cars br br Most modern straight four engines used in cars have a displacement of L cu in The smallest automotive straight four engine was used in the Honda T kei truck and has a displacement of cc cu in while the largest mass produced straight four car engine is the Mitsubishi M diesel engine which was used in the Mitsubishi Pajero and has a displacement of L cu in br Significant straight four car engines include br br Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine one of the first mass produced twin cam engines In it became the first production engine with variable valve timing br Ford Model T engine one of the most widely produced engines in the world br BMC A Series engine the first engine to be used in a mass production transverse engined front wheel drive car br Fiat Twin Cam engine one of the first mass produced twin cam engines produced from br Triumph Slant engine an early multi valve engine which formed the basis of Saab s first turbocharged engines br Honda F C engine produced the highest specific output for a naturally aspirated engine of its time br br br Usage in racing cars br br Many early racing cars used straight four engines however the Peugeot engine which won the Indianapolis was a highly influential engine Designed by Ernest Henry this engine had double overhead camshafts DOHC with four valves per cylinder a layout that would become the standard until today for racing inline four engines pp br Amongst the engines inspired by the Peugeot design was the Miller engine which was a successful racing engine through the s and early s The Miller engine evolved into the Offenhauser engine which had a highly successful spanning from the until including five straight victories at the Indianapolis from to pp br Many cars produced for the pre WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing category used inline four engine designs L supercharged engines found their way into cars such as the Maserati CL and various English Racing Automobiles ERA models These were resurrected after the war and formed the foundation of what was later to become Formula One although the straight eight supercharged Alfettas would dominate the early years of F br Another engine that played an important role in racing history is the straight four Ferrari engine designed by Aurelio Lampredi This engine was originally designed as a L Formula engine for the Ferrari but evolved to L to compete in Formula One in the Ferrari pp For sports car racing capacity was increased up to L for the Ferrari Monza br The Coventry Climax straight four engine was also a very successful racing engine which began life as a litre Formula engine Enlarged to litres for Formula One in it evolved into the large cc FPF that won the Formula One championship in Cooper s chassis in and pp br In Formula One the s were dominated by the cc turbocharged cars The BMW M engine was notable for the era for its high boost pressures and performance The cast iron block was based on a standard road car block and powered the F cars of Brabham Arrows and Benetton and won the world championship in The version of the engine was said to produce about hp kW in qualifying trim br br br Usage in motorcycles br br Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal which had been making motorcycles since began producing the first motorcycles with inline fours in The FN Four had its engine mounted upright with the crankshaft longitudinal Other manufacturers that used this layout included Pierce Henderson Ace Cleveland and Indian in the United States Nimbus in Denmark Windhoff in Germany and Wilkinson in the United Kingdom br The first across the frame cylinder motorcycle was the racer Gilera Rondine it also had double over head camshafts forced inducting supercharger and was liquid cooled Modern inline four motorcycle engines first became popular with Honda s SOHC CB introduced in and others followed in the s Since then the inline four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes Outside of the cruiser category the inline four is the most common configuration because of its relatively high performance to cost ratio All major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline four engines as do MV Agusta and BMW BMW s earlier inline four motorcycles were mounted horizontally along the frame but all current four cylinder BMW motorcycles have transverse engines The modern Triumph company has offered inline four powered motorcycles though they were discontinued in favour of triples br The Yamaha R has an inline four engine that does not fire at even intervals of Instead it uses a crossplane crankshaft that prevents the pistons from simultaneously reaching top dead centre This results in better secondary balance which is particularly beneficial in the higher rpm range and big bang firing order theory says the irregular delivery of torque to the rear tire makes sliding in the corners at racing speeds easier to control br Inline four engines are also used in MotoGP by the Suzuki since and Yamaha since teams In when the four stroke Moto class was introduced the engines for the class were a cc cu in inline four engine made by Honda based on the CBR RR with a maximum power output of kW hp Starting in the engines were replaced by a Triumph cc cu in triple engine br br br Usage in light and medium duty commercial vehicles br Inline four engines are also used in light duty commercial vehicles such as Karsan Jest and Mercedes Benz Sprinter br br br See also br Flat four engine br V engine br br br br br br External links br Media related to
