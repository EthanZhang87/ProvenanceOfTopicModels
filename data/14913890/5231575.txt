A V engine is a five cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration br Even by contrast to the fairly rare straight five engine V engine designs are very uncommon The first production V was the Volkswagen Group VR engine It is arguably not a true V engine as all the cylinders share a single cylinder head However Honda produced a true V motorcycle racing engine used in the RC V br br br Automobiles br br br General Motors br In the early s Oldsmobile developed a prototype L cu in V diesel engine however it never reached production stages and the project was subsequently abandoned The engine is based on the Oldsmobile V diesel engine with the fuel injection pump in the location of the missing sixth cylinder A prototype engine is on display at the RE Olds Museum in Lansing Michigan br br br Volkswagen Group br br The only V automobile engine to reach production was the L cu in VR engine manufactured by Volkswagen from to Based on Volkswagen s VR engine the VR was a narrow angle engine with staggered cylinders three cylinders on one bank and two on the other sharing a single cylinder head As per the VR engine the angle between the banks was degrees Initial versions used valves per cylinder however an update in resulted in a total of valves per cylinder and the addition of variable valve timing br br br Motorcycles br br br Honda br The Honda RC V a MotoGP racing motorcycle which competed in the seasons used a V engine The transversely mounted cc cu in engine had three cylinders at the front two cylinders at the rear and a V angle of degrees The engine used valves per cylinder br br br BSA br In the last days of the BSA motorcycle manufacturer the factory design team produced plans for a modular range of four engines all using a cc cylinder It was planned to increase the cylinder capacity to up to cc in due course The range which never went further than the drawing board comprised br br cc single br cc parallel twin br cc triple br cc V muscle bike br The company avoided the perhaps obvious cc straight four option to avoid direct competition with the major Japanese factories that already dominated the market with such machines br br br See also br Straight five engine br br br
