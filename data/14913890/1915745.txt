title: Back-fire
id: 1915745
A backfire or afterburn is combustion or an explosion produced by a running internal combustion engine that occurs in the exhaust system rather than inside the combustion chamber It is also sometimes referred to as an afterfire especially in cases where the word backfire is used to mean a fuel burn that occurs while an intake valve is open causing the fire to move backward through the system and out through the intake instead of the exhaust When the flame moves backward it may also be called a pop back A backfire can be caused either by ignition that happens with an exhaust valve open or unburnt fuel making its way into the hot exhaust system A visible flame may momentarily shoot out of the exhaust pipe A backfire is often a sign that the engine is improperly tuned br The term derives from parallel experiences with early unreliable firearms or ammunition in which the explosive force was directed out at the breech instead of the muzzle That is the origin of the use of backfire to indicate producing an unintended unexpected and undesired result br br br Explanation br Common causes of backfire are running rich too much fuel going into cylinders or faulty ignition possibly a fouled dirty spark plug coil or plug wire br Pop backs are usually caused by problems with timing If the timing is too early the spark plug fires before the intake valves close causing the combustion to propagate into the intake manifold further igniting the air fuel mixture there the resulting explosion then travels out of the carburetor and air filter On many small marine engines a screen is placed over the intake of the carburetor as a flame arrestor to prevent these flames from escaping the intake and potentially igniting fuel or fuel vapors in the enclosed sump or bilge of the boat causing a fire or explosion Alternatively the ignition timing may be late in which case the combustion is not completed by the time the exhaust valves open allowing the combustion to propagate into the exhaust system br Additionally improperly adjusted carburetors that create a lean condition during acceleration can cause the air fuel mixture to burn so slowly that combustion is still taking place during the exhaust stroke and even when the intake valve opens The flame front can then travel up the intake and cause a popback In this situation it is conceivable that there is a popback occurring in the intake manifold and exhaust manifold simultaneously br In both cases combustion occurring before and after the combustion chamber the result is a sharp pop which is colloquially referred to as a backfire However for troubleshooting engine mechanics more strictly define an ignition of fuel within the engine exhaust system as a backfire while a popback is this same process taking place in the induction system br br br Causes br Exhaust system backfires occur in engines that have an emission system malfunction like an air injection system diverter valve problem an exhaust leak or when the catalytic converter has been removed In some high performance vehicles when a driver shifts up and lets off the accelerator the engine has a moment of running rich This causes an incomplete burn which causes the fumes to explode in the exhaust system along with an audible pop or bang sound This is a result of working equipment and is unlikely to cause damage br A fuel injected engine may backfire if an intake leak is present causing the engine to run lean or a fuel injection component such as an air flow sensor is defective br Common causes of backfires are br br Wankel rotary engines are known for leaking oil into the exhaust system which causes backfire br Poor or unregulated engine timing is often a cause of intake backfires but can also be responsible for exhaust backfires Backfires and loud explosion like sounds are common when an antilag system is present and active br Improper wiring in the ignition can also lead to timing issues and backfires br Low fuel pressure clogged fuel filters and weak fuel pumps could cause a severely lean air to fuel ratio during the fuel injection process br A missing or damaged catalytic converter can result in backfires out the tailpipe br Broken exhaust system piping especially if located immediately downstream of the exhaust manifold can result in backfiring underneath the vehicle br br br Applications br With older engine designs backfiring can be common or unavoidable Backfire is rare in modern vehicles with fuel injection and computer controlled fuel mixtures br Cars with sports exhausts both factory fitted and aftermarket are much more likely to backfire In some circumstances the backfire is seen as an additional perk of the car The TVR Cerbera is an example of a car with factory fitted sports exhausts which produce frequent backfires on engine braking br In high powered supercharged aircraft piston engines such as the Rolls Royce Merlin and Griffon backfiring into the inlet manifold is prevented with flame traps inside the manifold the traps preventing the flame propagating into the compressed air fuel mixture within the manifold br br br See also br Dieseling an after run
