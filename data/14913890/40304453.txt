A cam engine is a reciprocating engine where instead of the conventional crankshaft the pistons deliver their force to a cam that is then caused to rotate The output work of the engine is driven by this cam br The first engine to get an airworthiness certificate from the United States government was a radial cam engine A variation of the cam engine the swashplate engine also the closely related wobble plate engine was briefly popular br Cam engines are generally thought of as internal combustion engines although they have also been used as hydraulic and pneumatic motors Hydraulic motors particularly the swashplate form are widely and successfully used Internal combustion engines though remain almost unknown br br br Operation br br br Operating cycle br Some cam engines are two stroke engines rather than four stroke In a two stroke engine the forces on the piston act uniformly downwards throughout the cycle In a four stroke engine these forces reverse cyclically In the induction phase the piston is forced upwards against the reduced induction depression The simple cam mechanism only works with a force in one direction In the first Michel engines the cam had two surfaces a main surface on which the pistons worked when running and another ring inside this that gave a desmodromic action to constrain the piston position during engine startup br Usually only one cam is required even for multiple cylinders Most cam engines were thus opposed twin or radial engines An early version of the Michel engine was a rotary engine a form of radial engine where the cylinders rotate around a fixed crank br br br Advantages br Perfect balance a crank system is impossible to dynamically balance because one cannot attenuate a reciprocal force or action with a rotary reaction or force br A more ideal combustion dynamic a look at a PV diagram of the ideal IC engine and one will find that the combustion event ideally should be a more or less constant volume event br The short dwell time that a crank produces does not provide a more or less constant volume for the combustion event to take place in A crank system reaches significant mechanical advantage at before TDC it then reaches maximum advantage at to This limits the burn time to less than Also the quickly descending piston lowers the pressure ahead of the flame front reducing the burn time This means less time to burn under lower pressure This dynamic is why in all crank engines a significant amount of the fuel is burned not above the piston where its power can be extracted but in the catalytic converter which only produces heat br A modern cam can be manufactured with computer numerical control CNC technology so as to have a delayed mechanical advantage br Other advantages of modern cam engines include br br Ideal piston dynamics br Lower internal friction br Cleaner exhaust br Lower fuel consumption br Longer life br More power per kilogram br Compact modular design permits better vehicle design br Fewer parts cost less to make br To suggest that cam engines were or are a failure when robustness is concerned is in error After extensive testing by the United States government the Fairchild Model C radial cam engine had the distinction of receiving the very first Department of Commerce Approved Type Certificate At a time when aircraft crank engine had a life of to hours the Model C was far more robust than any other aircraft engine then in production br Sadly in this pre CNC age it had a very poor cam profile which meant it shook too severely for the wood propellers and the wood wire and cloth airframes of the time br One advantage is that the bearing surface area can be larger than for a crankshaft In the early days of bearing material development the reduced bearing pressure this allowed could give better reliability A relatively successful swashplate cam engine was developed by the bearing expert George Michell who also developed the slipper pad thrust block br The Michel engine no relation began with roller cam followers but switched during development to plain bearing followers br Unlike a crankshaft a cam may easily have more than one throw per rotation This allows more than one piston stroke per revolution For aircraft use this was an alternative to using a propeller speed reduction unit high engine speed for an improved power to weight ratio combined with a slower propeller speed for an efficient propeller In practice the cam engine design weighed more than the combination of a conventional engine and gearbox br br br Swashplate and wobble plate engines br The only internal combustion cam engines that have been remotely successful were the swashplate engines These were almost all axial engines where the cylinders are arranged parallel to the engine axis in one or two rings The purpose of such engines was usually to achieve this axial or barrel layout making an engine with a very compact frontal area There were plans at one time to use barrel engines as aircraft engines with their reduced frontal area allowing a smaller fuselage and lower drag br A similar engine to the swashplate engine is the wobble plate engine also known as nutator or Z crank drive This uses a bearing that purely nutates rather than also rotating as for the swashplate The wobble plate is separated from the output shaft by a rotary bearing Wobble plate engines are thus not cam engines br br br Pistonless rotary engines br Most pistonless engines relying on cams such as the Rand cam engine use the cam mechanism to control the motion of sealing vanes Combustion pressure against these vanes causes a vane carrier separate from the cam to rotate In the Rand engine the camshaft moves the vanes so that they have a varying length exposed and so enclose a combustion chamber of varying volume as the engine rotates The work done in rotating the engine to cause this expansion is the thermodynamic work done by the engine and what causes the engine to rotate br br br br br br Bibliography br Comments on Crankless Engine Types Report NACA Technical Memorandum Vol Washington D C NACA May
