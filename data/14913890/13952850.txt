title: Free-piston engine
id: 13952850
A free piston engine is a linear crankless internal combustion engine in which the piston motion is not controlled by a crankshaft but determined by the interaction of forces from the combustion chamber gases a rebound device e g a piston in a closed cylinder and a load device e g a gas compressor or a linear alternator br The purpose of all such piston engines is to generate power In the free piston engine this power is not delivered to a crankshaft but is instead extracted through either exhaust gas pressure driving a turbine through driving a linear load such as an air compressor for pneumatic power or by incorporating a linear alternator directly into the pistons to produce electrical power br The basic configuration of free piston engines is commonly known as single piston dual piston or opposed pistons referring to the number of combustion cylinders The free piston engine is usually restricted to the two stroke operating principle since a power stroke is required every fore and aft cycle However a split cycle four stroke version has been patented GB A published br br br First generation br br The modern free piston engine was proposed by R P Pescara and the original application was a single piston air compressor Pescara set up the Bureau Technique Pescara to develop free piston engines and Robert Huber was technical director of the Bureau from to br The engine concept was a topic of much interest in the period and a number of commercially available units were developed These first generation free piston engines were without exception opposed piston engines in which the two pistons were mechanically linked to ensure symmetric motion The free piston engines provided some advantages over conventional technology including compactness and a vibration free design br br br Air compressors br The first successful application of the free piston engine concept was as air compressors In these engines air compressor cylinders were coupled to the moving pistons often in a multi stage configuration Some of these engines utilised the air remaining in the compressor cylinders to return the piston thereby eliminating the need for a rebound device br Free piston air compressors were in use among others by the German Navy and had the advantages of high efficiency compactness and low noise and vibration br br br Gas generators br After the success of the free piston air compressor a number of industrial research groups started the development of free piston gas generators In these engines there is no load device coupled to the engine itself but the power is extracted from an exhaust turbine The turbine s rotary motion can thus drive a pump propeller generator or other device br In this arrangement the only load for the engine is supercharging the inlet air albeit in theory some of this air could be diverted for use as a compressed air source if desired Such a modification would enable the free piston engine when used in conjunction with the aforementioned exhaust driven turbine to provide both motive power from the output shaft of the turbine in addition to compressed air on demand br A number of free piston gas generators were developed and such units were in widespread use in large scale applications such as stationary and marine powerplants Attempts were made to use free piston gas generators for vehicle propulsion e g in gas turbine locomotives but without success br br br Modern applications br Modern applications of the free piston engine concept include hydraulic engines aimed for off highway vehicles and free piston engine generators aimed for use with hybrid electric vehicles br br br Hydraulic br These engines are commonly of the single piston type with the hydraulic cylinder acting as both load and rebound device using a hydraulic control system This gives the unit high operational flexibility Excellent part load performance has been reported br br br Generators br br Free piston linear generators that eliminate a heavy crankshaft with electrical coils in the piston and cylinder walls are being investigated by multiple research groups for use in hybrid electric vehicles as range extenders The first free piston generator was patented in Examples include the Stelzer engine and the Free Piston Power Pack manufactured by Pempek Systems based on a German patent A single piston Free piston linear generator was demonstrated in at the German Aerospace Center Deutsches Zentrum f r Luft und Raumfahrt DLR br These engines are mainly of the dual piston type giving a compact unit with high power to weight ratio A challenge with this design is to find an electric motor with sufficiently low weight Control challenges in the form of high cycle to cycle variations were reported for dual piston engines br In June Toyota announced a prototype Free Piston Engine Linear Generator FPEG As the piston is forced downward during its power stroke it passes through windings in the cylinder to generate a burst of three phase AC electricity The piston generates electricity on both strokes reducing piston dead losses The generator operates on a two stroke cycle using hydraulically activated exhaust poppet valves gasoline direct injection and electronically operated valves The engine is easily modified to operate under various fuels including hydrogen natural gas ethanol gasoline and diesel A two cylinder FPEG is inherently balanced br Toyota claims a thermal efficiency rating of in continuous use greatly exceeding today s average of Toyota demonstrated a inch long by inch in diameter unit producing hp greater than kW br br br Features br The operational characteristics of free piston engines differ from those of conventional crankshaft engines The main difference is due to the piston motion not being restricted by a crankshaft in the free piston engine leading to the potentially valuable feature of variable compression ratio This does however also present a control challenge since the position of the dead centres must be accurately controlled in order to ensure fuel ignition and efficient combustion and to avoid excessive in cylinder pressures or worse the piston hitting the cylinder head The free piston engine has a number of unique features some give it potential advantages and some represent challenges that must be overcome for the free piston engine to be a realistic alternative to conventional technology br As the piston motion between the endpoints is not mechanically restricted by a crank mechanism the free piston engine has the valuable feature of variable compression ratio which may provide extensive operation optimization higher part load efficiency and possible multi fuel operation These are enhanced by variable fuel injection timing and valve timing through proper control methods br Variable stroke length is achieved by a proper frequency control scheme such as PPM Pulse Pause Modulation control in which piston motion is paused at BDC using a controllable hydraulic cylinder as rebound device The frequency can therefore be controlled by applying a pause between the time the piston reaches BDC and the release of compression energy for the next stroke br Since there are fewer moving parts the frictional losses and manufacturing cost are reduced The simple and compact design thus requires less maintenance and this increases lifetime br The purely linear motion leads to very low side loads on the piston hence lesser lubrication requirements for the piston br The combustion process of free piston engine is well suited for Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition HCCI mode in which the premixed charge is compressed and self ignited resulting in very rapid combustion along with lower requirements for accurate ignition timing control Also high efficiencies are obtained due to nearly constant volume combustion and the possibility to burn lean mixtures to reduce gas temperatures and thereby some types of emissions br By running multiple engines in parallel vibrations due to balancing issues may be reduced but this requires accurate control of engine speed Another possibility is to apply counterweights which results in more complex design increased engine size and weight and additional friction losses br Lacking a kinetic energy storage device like a flywheel in conventional engines free piston engines are more susceptible to shutdown caused by minute variations in the timing or pressure of the engine cycle Precise control of the speed and timing is required as if the engine fails to build up sufficient compression or if other factors influence the injection ignition and combustion the engine may misfire or stop br br br Advantages br Potential advantages of the free piston concept include br br Simple design with few moving parts giving a compact engine with low maintenance costs and reduced frictional losses br The operational flexibility through the variable compression ratio allows operation optimisation for all operating conditions and multi fuel operation The free piston engine is further well suited for homogeneous charge compression ignition HCCI operation br High piston speed around top dead centre TDC and a fast power stroke expansion enhances fuel air mixing and reduces the time available for heat transfer losses and the formation of temperature dependent emissions such as nitrogen oxides NOx br br br Challenges br The main challenge for the free piston engine is engine control which can only be said to be fully solved for single piston hydraulic free piston engines Issues such as the influence of cycle to cycle variations in the combustion process and engine performance during transient operation in dual piston engines are topics that need further investigation Crankshaft engines can connect traditional accessories such as alternator oil pump fuel pump cooling system starter etc br Rotational movement to spin conventional automobile engine accessories such as alternators air conditioner compressors power steering pumps and anti pollution devices could be captured from a turbine situated in the exhaust stream br br br Opposing piston engine br Most free piston engines are of the opposed piston type with a single central combustion chamber A variation is the Opposing piston engine which has two separate combustion chambers An example is the Stelzer engine br br br Recent developments br In the st century research continues into free piston engines and patents have been published in many countries In the UK Newcastle University is undertaking research into free piston engines br A new kind of the free piston engine a Free piston linear generator is being developed by the German aerospace center br In addition to these prototypes researchers at West Virginia University in the US are working on the development of a single cylinder free piston engine prototype with mechanical
