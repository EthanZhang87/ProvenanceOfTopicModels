The five stroke engine is a compound internal combustion engine patented by Gerhard Schmitz in br br br Concept br The goal of the five stroke engine is to achieve higher efficiency than a four stroke engine In order to increase efficiency a secondary cylinder is added as an expansion processor to extract more energy from the fuel Schmitz s concept engine uses two primary high pressure cylinders with standard four stroke power cycles in addition to a larger secondary low pressure expansion cylinder The hot exhaust gas from the two primary cylinders is fed into the secondary cylinder halving the volume of gases in the primary cylinders after combustion br This concept is similar to that of compound steam engines which expand steam in high pressure cylinders before exhausting it into low pressure cylinders in order to extract more energy from the steam In Nicolaus Otto built a stroke engine which was commercially produced but suffered from poor performance Two Spanish patents ES F Jimeno Cataneo and ES C Ubierna Laciana describe stroke engines identical to that of Schmitz s design this engine had a fellowship to Burgundy University to be studied J W Eisenhuth patented an air and gas engine with double expansion US A car with this engine was in the Harrah Collection though its fate after the collection was dismantled is unknown br In Schmitz s design the compression ratio of the low pressure expansion cylinder is adjustable to achieve an optimal expansion ratio regardless of the primary cylinders compression ratio The prototype has demonstrated an approximately decrease in fuel consumption over a standard gas engine br The operation of a stroke SI engine is as follows Induction Compression Power Initial exhaust re expansion Final exhaust br br br Prototype br br Schmitz s concept was being developed by Ilmor Ilmor s prototype intended for motorcycle use and consisting of primary cylinders and secondary cylinder uses a solid cylinder block with electrically driven oil and water pumps two overhead camshafts with standard poppet valves and turbocharging Its displacement is cc cu in without the secondary cylinder and cc cu in in total and it can produce hp kW at rpm and N m lb ft at rpm br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Four stroke engine animation br Detailed Engine Animations Archived at the Wayback Machine br How Car Engines Work br Animated Engines four stroke Archived at the Wayback Machine another explanation of the four stroke engine br New stroke
