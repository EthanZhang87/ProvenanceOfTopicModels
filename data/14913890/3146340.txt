The Bourke engine was an attempt by Russell Bourke in the s to improve the two stroke internal combustion engine Despite finishing his design and building several working engines the onset of World War II lack of test results and the poor health of his wife compounded to prevent his engine from ever coming successfully to market The main claimed virtues of the design are that it has only two moving parts is lightweight has two power pulses per revolution and does not need oil mixed into the fuel br The Bourke engine is basically a two stroke design with one horizontally opposed piston assembly using two pistons that move in the same direction at the same time so that their operations are degrees out of phase The pistons are connected to a Scotch yoke mechanism in place of the more usual crankshaft mechanism thus the piston acceleration is perfectly sinusoidal This causes the pistons to spend more time at top dead center than conventional engines The incoming charge is compressed in a chamber under the pistons as in a conventional crankcase charged two stroke engine The connecting rod seal prevents the fuel from contaminating the bottom end lubricating oil br br br Operation br The operating cycle is very similar to that of a current production spark ignition two stroke with crankcase compression with two modifications br br The fuel is injected directly into the air as it moves through the transfer port br The engine is designed to run without using spark ignition once it is warmed up This is known as auto ignition or dieseling and the air fuel mixture starts to burn due to the high temperature of the compressed gas and or the presence of hot metal in the combustion chamber br br br Design features br The following design features have been identified br br br Mechanical features br Scotch yoke and linearly sliding connecting rods br Fewer moving parts only moving assemblies per opposed cylinder pair and the opposed cylinders are combinable to make or any even number of cylinders br The piston is connected to the Scotch yoke through a slipper bearing a type of hydrodynamic tilting pad fluid bearing br Mechanical fuel injection br Ports rather than valves br Easy maintenance top overhauling with simple tools br The Scotch yoke does not create lateral forces on the piston reducing friction and piston wear br O rings are used to seal joints rather than gaskets br The Scotch yoke makes the pistons dwell very slightly longer at top dead center so the fuel burns more completely in a smaller volume br br br Gas flow and thermodynamic features br Low exhaust temperature below that of boiling water so metal exhaust components are not required plastic ones can be used if strength is not required from exhaust system br to compression ratio for high efficiency and it can be easily changed as required for different fuels and operation requirements br Fuel is vaporised when it is injected into the transfer ports and the turbulence in the intake manifolds and the piston shape above the rings stratifies the fuel air mixture into the combustion chamber br Lean burn for increased efficiency and reduced emissions br br br Lubrication br This design uses oil seals to prevent the pollution from the combustion chamber created by piston ring blow by in four strokes and just combustion in two strokes from polluting the crankcase oil extending the life of the oil as it is used slowly for keeping the rings full of oil Oil was shown to be used slowly but checking the quantity and cleanness of it was still recommended by Russell Bourke its creator br The lubricating oil in the base is protected from combustion chamber pollution by an oil seal over the connecting rod br The piston rings are supplied with oil from a small supply hole in the cylinder wall at bottom dead center br br br Claimed and measured performance br Efficiency lb h hp is claimed about the same as the best diesel engine or roughly twice as efficient as the best two strokes This is equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of which is an exceedingly high figure for a small internal combustion engine In a test witnessed by a third party the actual fuel consumption was hp lb hr or lb hr hp equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of about which is typical of a s steam engine A test of a cubic inch Vaux engine built by a close associate of Bourke gave a fuel consumption of lb bhp hr or lb hr hp at maximum power br Power to weight The Silver Eagle was claimed to produce hp from lb or a power to weight ratio of hp lb The larger cubic inch engine was good for hp from lb or approximately hp lb The Model H was claimed to produce hp with a weight of lb hence giving a power to weight ratio of hp lb The cu in twin was reported to produce hp at rpm while weighing only lb an incredible hp lb However a cu in replica from Vaux Engines produced just hp at rpm even after substantial reworking Other sources claim to hp lb although no independently witnessed test to support these high figures has been documented The upper range of this is roughly twice as good as the best four stroke production engine shown here or hp lb better than a Graupner G two stroke The lower claim is unremarkable easily exceeded by production four stroke engines never mind two strokes br Emissions Achieved virtually no hydrocarbons ppm or carbon monoxide less than ppm in published test results however no power output was given for these results and NOx was not measured br Low Emissions The engine is claimed to be able to operate on hydrogen or any hydro carbon fuel without any modifications producing only water vapor and carbon dioxide as emissions br br br Engineering critique of the Bourke engine br br The Bourke Engine has some interesting features but the extravagant claims for its performance are unlikely to be borne out by real tests Many of the claims are contradictory br br Seal friction from the seal between the air compressor chamber and the crankcase against the connecting rod will reduce the efficiency br Efficiency will be reduced due to pumping losses as the air charge is compressed and expanded twice but energy is only extracted for power in one of the expansions per piston stroke br Engine weight is likely to be high because it will have to be very strongly built to cope with the high peak pressures seen as a result of the rapid high temperature combustion br Each piston pair is highly imbalanced as the two pistons move in the same direction at the same time unlike in a boxer engine This will limit the speed range and hence the power of the engine and increase its weight due to the strong construction necessary to react the high forces in the components br High speed two stroke engines tend to be inefficient compared with four strokes because some of the intake charge escapes unburnt with the exhaust br Use of excess air will reduce the torque available for a given engine size br Forcing the exhaust out rapidly through small ports will incur a further efficiency loss br Operating an internal combustion engine in detonation reduces efficiency due to heat lost from the combustion gases being scrubbed against the combustion chamber walls by the shock waves br Emissions although some tests have shown low emissions in some circumstances these were not necessarily at full power As the scavenge ratio i e engine torque is increased more HC and CO will be emitted br Increased dwell time at TDC will allow more heat to be transferred to the cylinder walls reducing the efficiency br When running in auto ignition mode the timing of the start of the burn is controlled by the operating state of the engine rather than directly as in a spark ignition or diesel engine As such it may be possible to optimize it for one operating condition but not for the wide range of torques and speeds that an engine typically sees The result will be reduced efficiency and higher emissions br If the efficiency is high then combustion temperatures must be high as required by the Carnot cycle and the air fuel mixture must be lean High combustion temperatures and lean mixtures cause nitrogen dioxide to be formed br br br Patents br Russell Bourke obtained British and Canadian patents for the engine in GB and CA br He also obtained U S patent in br br br br br br External
