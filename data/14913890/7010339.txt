A Cornish engine is a type of steam engine developed in Cornwall England mainly for pumping water from a mine It is a form of beam engine that uses steam at a higher pressure than the earlier engines designed by James Watt The engines were also used for powering man engines to assist the underground miners journeys to and from their working levels for winching materials into and out of the mine and for powering on site ore stamping machinery br br br Background br Cornwall has long had tin copper and other metal ore mines but if mining is to take place at greater depths a means to dewater the mine must be found Lifting the weight of water up from the depths requires great amounts of work input This energy may be weakly supplied by horse power or a waterwheel to operate pumps but horses have limited power and waterwheels need a suitable stream of water Accordingly the innovation of coal fired steam power to work pumps was more versatile and effective to the mining industry than primitive means br The mine Wheal Vor had one of the earliest Newcomen engines in cylinder condensing engines utilising sub atmospheric pressure before but Cornwall has no coalfield and coal imported from south Wales was expensive The cost of fuel for pumping was thus a significant part of mining costs Later many of the more efficient early Watt engines using an external condenser were erected by Boulton and Watt in Cornwall They charged the mine owners a royalty based on a share of the fuel saving The fuel efficiency of an engine was measured by its duty expressed in the work in foot pounds generated by a bushel pounds kg of coal Early Watt engines had a duty of million and later ones over million br br br Cornish cycle br br The Cornish cycle operates as follows br Starting from a condition during operation with the piston at the top of the cylinder the cylinder below the piston full of steam from the previous stroke the boiler at normal working pressure and the condenser at normal working vacuum br br The pressurized steam inlet valve and low pressure steam exhaust valves are opened Pressurized steam from the boiler enters the top part of the cylinder above the piston pushing it down and the steam below the piston is drawn into the condenser creating a vacuum below the piston The pressure difference between the steam at boiler pressure above the piston and the vacuum below it drives the piston down br Part way down the stroke the pressurized steam inlet valve is closed The steam above the piston then expands through the rest of the stroke while the low pressure steam on the other side bottom of the piston continues to be drawn into the condenser thereby maintaining the partial vacuum in that part of the cylinder br At the bottom of the stroke the exhaust valve to the condenser is closed and the equilibrium valve is opened The weight of the pump equipment down in the mine transferred by the walking beam draws the piston up and as the piston comes up steam is transferred through the equilibrium pipe from above the piston to the bottom of the cylinder below the piston br When the piston reaches the top of the cylinder the cycle is ready to repeat br The next stroke may occur immediately or it may be delayed by a timing device such as a cataract if it was not necessary for the engine to work at its maximum rate reducing the rate of operation saved fuel br The engine is single acting and the steam piston is pulled up by the weight of the pump piston and rodding Steam may be supplied at a pressure of up to pounds per square inch kPa br Real photos showing the components of the schematic design East Pool mine Tailer s shaft Harvey s Engine br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Characteristics br The principal advantage of the Cornish engine was its increased efficiency accomplished by making more economical use of higher pressure steam At the time improvements in efficiency were important in Cornwall because of the high cost of coal there are no coal fields in Cornwall and all the coal used had to be brought in from outside the county br Increasing the boiler pressure above the very low virtually atmospheric pressure steam used by James Watt was an essential element of the improvement in efficiency of the Cornish engine However simply increasing the boiler pressure would have made an engine more powerful without increasing its efficiency The key advance was allowing the steam to expand in the cylinder While James Watt had conceived of the idea of allowing expansive working of steam and included it in his patent he realized that the low steam pressure of his application made the improvement in efficiency negligible and so did not pursue it br In a Watt engine steam is admitted throughout the piston s power stroke At the end of the stroke the steam is exhausted and any remaining energy is wasted in the condenser where the steam is cooled back to water br In a Cornish engine by contrast the intake valve is shut off midway through the power stroke allowing the steam already in that part of the cylinder to expand through the rest of the stroke to a lower pressure This results in the capture of a greater proportion of its energy and less heat being lost to the condenser than in a Watt engine br Other characteristics include insulation of steam lines and the cylinder and steam jacketing the cylinder both of which had previously been used by Watt br Few Cornish engines remain in their original locations the majority having been scrapped when their related industrial firm closed br The Cornish engine developed irregular power throughout the cycle completely pausing at one point while having rapid motion on the down stroke making it unsuitable for rotary motion and most industrial applications This also requires some unusual valve gear see Cornish engine valve gear br br br Development of the Cornish engine br The Cornish engine depended on the use of steam pressure above atmospheric pressure as devised by Richard Trevithick in the th century Trevithick s early puffer engines discharged steam into the atmosphere This differed from the Watt steam engine which moved the condensing steam from the cylinder to a condenser separate from the cylinder hence Watt s engine depended on the creation of a vacuum when the steam was condensed Trevithick s later engines in the s combined the two principles starting with high pressure steam which was then passed to the other side of the piston where it condensed and there it acted as a sub atmospheric pressure engine In a parallel development Arthur Woolf developed the compound steam engine in which the steam expanded in two cylinders successively each of which were at pressures above atmospheric br When Trevithick left for South America in he passed his patent right of his latest invention to William Sims who built or adapted a number of engines including one at Wheal Chance operating at pounds per square inch kPa above atmospheric pressure which achieved a duty of nearly million but its efficiency then fell back A test was carried out between a Trevithick type single cylinder engine and a Woolf compound engine at Wheal Alfred in when both achieved a duty of slightly more than million br The next improvement was achieved in the late s by Samuel Grose who decreased the heat loss by insulating the pipes cylinders and boilers of the engines improving the duty to more than million at Wheal Hope and later to almost million at Wheal Towan Nevertheless the best duty was usually a short lived achievement due to general deterioration of machinery leaks from boilers and the deterioration of boiler plates meaning that pressure had to be reduced br Minor improvements increased the duty somewhat but the engine seems to have reached its practical limits by the mid s With pressures of up to pounds per square inch kPa the forces are likely to have caused machinery breakages The same improvements in duty occurred in engines operating Cornish stamps and whims but generally came slightly later In both cases the best duty was lower than for pumping engines particularly so for whim engines whose work was discontinuous br The impetus for the improvement of the steam engine came from Cornwall due to the high price of coal there but both capital and maintenance costs were higher than a Watt steam engine This long delayed the installation of Cornish engines outside Cornwall A secondhand Cornish engine was installed at East London Waterworks in and compared to a Watt engine with favourable results because the price of coal in London was even higher than in Cornwall However in the main textile manufacturing areas such as Manchester and Leeds the coal price was too low to make replacement economic Only in the late s did textile manufacturers begin moving to high pressure engines usually by adding a high pressure cylinder forming a compound engine rather than following the usual Cornish practice br br br Preserved Cornish engines br br Several Cornish engines are preserved in England The London Museum of Water Steam has the largest collection of Cornish engines in the world At Crofton Pumping Station in Wiltshire are two Cornish engines one of which the Boulton and Watt is the oldest working beam engine in the world still in its original engine house and capable of actually doing the job for which it was installed that of pumping water to the summit pound of the Kennet and Avon Canal Two examples also survive at the Cornish Mines and Engines museum on the site of East Pool mine near the town of Pool Cornwall br Another example is at Poldark Mine at Trenear Cornwall a Harvey of Hayle Cornish Beam Engine from about originally employed at Bunny Tin Mine and later at Greensplat China Clay Pit both near St Austell It no longer works as a steam engine but is instead moved by a hydraulic mechanism In use at Greensplat until it is the last Cornish engine to have worked commercially in Cornwall It was moved to Poldark in br The Cruquius pumping station in the Netherlands contains a Cornish engine with the largest diameter cylinder ever built for a Cornish engine at metres inches diameter The engine which was built by Harvey Co in Hayle Cornwall has eight beams connected to the one cylinder each beam driving a single pump The engine was restored to working order between and although it is now operated by an oil filled hydraulic system since restoration to steam operation was not viable br The Cornish Engines Preservation Committee an early industrial archaeology organisation was formed in to preserve the Levant winding engine The Committee was later re named for Richard Trevithick They acquired another winding engine and two pumping engines They publish a newsletter a journal and many books on Cornish engines the mining industry engineers and other industrial archaeological topics
