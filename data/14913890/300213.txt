The Napier Deltic engine is a British opposed piston valveless supercharged uniflow scavenged two stroke diesel engine used in marine and locomotive applications designed and produced by D Napier Son Unusually the cylinders were disposed in a three bank triangle with a crankshaft at each corner of the triangle br The term Deltic meaning in the form of the Greek letter capital delta is used to refer to both the Deltic E opposed piston high speed diesel engine and the locomotives produced by English Electric using these engines including its demonstrator locomotive named DELTIC and the production version for British Railways which designated these as the Class br A single half sized turbocharged Deltic power unit also featured in the English Electric built Type locomotive designated as the Class Both locomotive and engine became better known as the Baby Deltic br br br History and design br The Deltic story began in when the British Admiralty set up a committee to develop a high power lightweight diesel engine for motor torpedo boats Hitherto in the Royal Navy such boats had been driven by petrol engines but their highly flammable fuel made them vulnerable to fire unlike diesel powered E boats A patent for an engine similar in complexity but with four lines of pistons not just three was filed in by Wifredo Ricart linked to Alfa Romeo and to the Spanish INI truck maker Pegaso Pat ES br Until this time diesel engines had poor power to weight ratios and low speed Before the war Napier had been working on an aviation diesel design known as the Culverin after licensing versions of the Junkers Jumo The Culverin was an opposed piston two stroke design Instead of each cylinder having a single piston and being closed at one end with a cylinder head the Jumo based design used an elongated cylinder containing two pistons moving in opposite directions towards the centre This obviates the need for a heavy cylinder head as the opposing piston filled this role On the downside the layout required separate crankshafts on each end of the engine that must be coupled through gearing or shafts The primary advantages of the design were uniflow breathing and a rather flat engine br The Admiralty required a much more powerful engine and knew about Junkers designs for multicrankshaft engines of straight six and diamond forms The Admiralty felt that these would be a reasonable starting point for the larger design that it required The result was a triangle the cylinder banks forming the sides with crankshafts at each corner connected by phasing gears to a single output shaft effectively three separate V engines The Deltic could be produced with varying numbers of cylinders and were the most common having either three or six cylinders per bank respectively In the Admiralty placed a contract with the English Electric Company parent of Napier to develop this engine br One feature of the engine was the way that crankshaft phasing was arranged to allow for exhaust port lead and inlet port lag These engines are called uniflow designs because the flow of gas into and out of the cylinder is one way assisted by blowers to improve cylinder exhaust scavenging The inlet outlet port order is in out in out in out going around the triangular ring i e the inlet and outlet manifold arrangements have C rotational symmetry br Earlier attempts at designing such an engine met with the difficulty of arranging the pistons to move in the correct manner for all three cylinders in one delta and this was the problem that caused Junkers Motorenbau to leave behind work on the delta form while continuing to prototype a diamond form four crankshaft cylinder Junkers Jumo Herbert Penwarden a senior draughtsman with the Admiralty Engineering Laboratory suggested that one crankshaft needed to revolve anticlockwise to achieve the correct piston phasing so Napier designers produced the necessary gearing so one of them rotated in the opposite direction to the other two br Being an opposed piston design with no inlet or exhaust valves and no ability to vary the port positions the Deltic design arranged each crankshaft to connect two adjacent pistons operating in different cylinders in the same plane using fork and blade connecting rods the latter an inlet piston used to open and close the inlet port and the former an exhaust piston in the adjacent cylinder to open and close the exhaust port This would have led the firing in each bank of cylinders to be apart but arranging that each cylinder s exhaust piston would lead its inlet piston by of crankshaft rotation was adopted This allowed the exhaust port to be opened well before the inlet port and allowed the inlet port to be closed after the exhaust port which led to both good scavenging of exhaust gas and good volumetric efficiency for the fresh air charge This required the firing events for adjacent cylinders to be apart For the cylinder design firing events could be interlaced over all six banks This led to the even buzzing exhaust note of the Deltic with a charge ignition every of crankshaft revolution and a lack of torsional vibration ideal for use in mine hunting vessels The cylinder design having three banks of cylinders has its crankshafts rotating in the opposite direction The exhaust lead of is added to the between banks giving firing events for adjacent cylinders in the same bank apart Interlacing firing events over all three banks of cylinders still leads to an even buzzing exhaust note and charge ignition occurring every of crankshaft revolution with consequent reduction of torsional vibration br Although the engine was cylinder ported and required no poppet valves each bank had a camshaft driven at crankshaft speed This was used solely to drive the fuel injection pumps each cylinder having its own injector and pump driven by its own cam lobe br br br Uses br br br Naval service br br Development began in and the first Deltic model was the D B produced in It was designed to produce hp kW at rpm for a minute rating the continuous rating being hp kW at rpm based on a hour overhaul or replacement life By January six engines were available enough for full development and endurance trials A captured German E Boat S was selected as it was powered by Mercedes Benz diesels with approximately the same power as the cylinder Deltics When two of the three Mercedes Benz engines were replaced the compactness of the Napier engines was graphically illustrated they were half the size of the original engines and approximately one fifth the weight br Proving successful Deltic Diesel engines became a common power plant in small and fast naval craft The Royal Navy used them first in the Dark class fast attack craft Subsequently they were used in a number of other smaller attack craft Being largely of aluminium construction their low magnetic signature allowed their use in mine countermeasures vessels and the Deltic was selected to power the Ton class minesweepers The Deltic engine is still in service in some Hunt class These versions are de rated to reduce engine stress br Deltic Diesels served in MTBs and PT boats built for other navies Particularly notable was the Norwegian Tjeld or Nasty class which was also sold to Germany Greece and the United States Navy Nasty class boats served in the Vietnam War largely for covert operations br Smaller nine cylinder Deltic engines were used as marine engines notably by minesweepers The Ton class vessels were powered by a pair of Deltic s and used an additional Deltic for power generation for their magnetic influence sweep The Hunt class used three Deltic s two for propulsion and again one for power generation but this time with a hydraulic pump integrated to power bow thrusters for slow speed man uvring until a refurbishment programme by BAE Systems that ran from to replaced the Deltic with Caterpillar C engines in the eight remaining commissioned Royal Navy vessels br br br Railway use br br Deltic engines were used in two types of British rail locomotive the built class and the built class These locomotive types were known as Deltics and Baby Deltics respectively br The Class used two D series II type V Deltic engines mechanically blown cylinder engines each rated at hp kW continuous at rpm The Class used a single less powerful nine cylinder turbocharged T Deltic of hp kW br Six out of the original Class locomotives survive Class leader D Royal Scots Grey was returned to main line serviceable status in Following a power unit failure this locomotive was fitted for a time with an ex Royal Norwegian Navy T K type after various modifications were cleverly designed to make the new unit compatible br br br Fire department use br The New York City Fire Department used a Napier Deltic engine to power their one of a kind Super Pumper System This was a very high volume trailer mounted fire pump with a separate tender br br br Reliability in service br While the Deltic engine was successful in marine and rail use and very powerful for its size and weight it was a highly strung unit requiring careful maintenance This led to a policy of unit replacement rather than repair in situ Deltic engines were easily removed after breakdown generally being sent back to the manufacturer for repair although after initial contracts expired both the Royal Navy and British Railways set up their own workshops for overhauls br br br Turbo compound Deltic br The E or Compound Deltic turbo compound variant was planned and a single prototype was built in and tested in This capitalised on Napier s experience with both the Nomad and its increasing involvement with gas turbines It used the Deltic as the gas generator inside a gas turbine with both a twelve stage axial compressor and a three stage gas turbine Unlike the Nomad this turbine was not mechanically coupled to the crankshaft but merely drove the compressor It was hoped that it would produce horsepower with fuel economy and power to weight ratio second to none Predictions by the engineers closely connected with it were that connecting rod failure would be the limit on this power failing at around bhp On test it actually produced bhp before throwing a connecting rod through the crankcase just as predicted Naval interest had waned by in favour of the pure gas turbine despite its heavier fuel consumption and no further development was carried out br br br Comparable engines br Junkers Jumo br Zvezda M br Achates Power br Fairbanks Morse diesel engine br br br br br
