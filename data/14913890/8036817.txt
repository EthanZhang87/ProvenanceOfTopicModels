A Fluidyne engine is an alpha or gamma type Stirling engine with one or more liquid pistons It contains a working gas often air and either two liquid pistons or one liquid piston and a displacer br The engine was invented in The engine was patented in by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority br br br Engine operation br Working gas in the engine is heated and this causes it to expand and push on the water column This expansion cools the air which contracts at the same time being pushed back by the weight of the displaced water column The cycle then repeats br The U tube version has no moving parts in the engine other than the water and air although there are two check valves in the pump This engine operates at a natural resonance cycle that is tuned by adjusting the geometry generally with a tuning tube of water br br br Engine as a pump br In the classic configuration the work produced via the water pistons is integrated with a water pump The simple pump is external to the engine and consists of two check valves one on the intake and one on the outlet In the engine the loop of oscillating liquid can be thought of as acting as a displacer piston The liquid in the single tube extending to the pump acts as the power piston Traditionally the pump is open to the atmosphere and the hydraulic head is small so that the absolute engine pressure is close to atmospheric pressure br br br Demonstration video br br The videos show operation of a U tube type model Fluidyne engine Hot pipe is heated by a heat gun and water column oscillation builds up to a steady state level Second video shows a detail of the actual water displacement br br br See also br Humphrey Pump br br br br br br Further reading br Colin West And Yet It Moves New Scientist ISSN br br br External links br br Fluidyne Engines link broken June br Thermofluidics Engine br Article by Alejandro Romanelli
