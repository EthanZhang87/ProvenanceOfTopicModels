title: Chrysler B engine
id: 861000
The Chrysler B and RB engines are a series of big block V gasoline engines introduced in to replace the Chrysler FirePower first generation Hemi engines The B and RB engines are often referred to as wedge engines because they use wedge shaped combustion chambers this differentiates them from Chrysler s Hemi big block engines that are typically referred to as Hemi or Hemi due to their hemispherical shaped combustion chambers The corporation had been seeking a smaller and lighter replacement for its FirePower engines in part because new styling dictates meant moving the engine forward in the chassis which negatively affected weight distribution br br br Design br Design features of the B and RB engines include capscrews per cylinder head a cylinder block that extends in mm below the crankshaft centerline an intake manifold not exposed to crankcase oil on the underside stamped steel shaft mounted rocker arms race versions used forged steel rockers and a front mounted external oil pump driven by the camshaft In order to provide a lower hood and center of gravity the engine to be mounted lower than before Apart from changing the engine dimensions and engine mount position this also entailed reconsidering the distributor drive and oil pump locations The oil pump could not be allowed to extend below the crank throw to avoid interfering with the steering linkage The engineers moved the distributor to the front of the engine at a degree angle which cleared the heater while allowing the oil pump to be located in front of the block above the bottom of the crank s throw clearing the steering linkage br The B series wedge engine was introduced in with cu in L and cu in L versions The would continue in production until the end of the series albeit only for truck installation The RB raised B arrived one year after the launch of the B series engines in cu in L and cu in L displacements Unlike the previous B engines which had a inch mm stroke the RB engines had a inch mm stroke br For a ram induction system increased the s torque up to lb ft N m on the Chrysler F versions br The last B RB wedge headed engine was produced in August ending the era of Chrysler big block engines br br br B engines br All Low Block B series engines have a in mm stroke a in mm deck height and in mm connecting rods resulting in a rod ratio br br br br The cu in cc B engine was along with the the first production B engine first available in It had a bore of in mm in The is classified as a big block engine All parts except for the pistons are fully compatible with the br Vehicles using the B br br DeSoto Firesweep br Dodge Coronet br Plymouth Fury br br br br The cu in B engine also introduced in was essentially the same as the except with a larger in mm in bore for an actual displacement of cu in cc In the Dodge Polara came standard with a bhp kW version of the that had a four barrel carburetor dual point distributor and dual exhausts Plymouth called their versions of the early B engine the Commando variants of which included the Golden Commando and Sonoramic Commando It produced bhp kW DeSoto s B engine was named Turboflash and produced bhp kW The Dodge standard version was a barrel with bhp kW called the Super Red Ram with an optional variant that was called the D and produced bhp kW br The would last until the end of the series albeit for trucks only In its early years the horsepower was optional on many vehicles and standard on among others the Dodge The had a fuel injected version in only Very few of the fuel injected B engines were made and only a handful remain since most were brought back to the dealer to be fitted with carburetors br br br br br The cu in B engine not to be confused with the RB version was essentially a larger bore version of the and using a in mm bore for a cu in cc displacement This venerable engine was introduced in Dodge s version the D had a cross ram induction manifold and dual four barrel carburetors as options In some Dodge applications this engine was labeled as the Magnum while the Plymouth version was called the Golden Commando Both came with a dual point distributor in high performance versions br The became the standard model Mopar performance engine for the next decade The big bore allowed for larger in mm intake valves and the relatively short stroke helped it to be a free revving and free breathing engine br Producing a maximum of hp kW PS gross and lb ft N m of torque for the model year the beat the Hemi that had reached lb ft N m The engines featured the same basic ram induction system as the Chrysler F s RB engines named Sonoramic Commando when sold in Plymouth form The later Magnum starting in used the Magnum heads camshaft and exhaust manifolds This engine was advertised at hp kW PS br br br br The cu in L B engine was introduced in to replace the venerable and were power rated via the net installed method Chrysler increased the bore size of the to create the Its bore of inch mm was the largest used in any production Chrysler V at the date of its introduction All parts except for the pistons were interchangeable between the and br Crankshafts were made of cast iron Three versions of this engine were available a two barrel single exhaust version producing hp kW PS at rpm and lb ft N m of torque at rpm a four barrel single exhaust version producing hp kW PS at rpm and a high performance four barrel dual exhaust version rated at hp kW PS at rpm and lb ft N m of torque at rpm All three versions used the same compression ratio The was used in car truck and motorhome chassis Horsepower and torque ratings gradually declined through the years because of the addition of more federally mandated emissions controls until all Chrysler passenger vehicle big block production ceased in For its last year of production it only produced hp kW although a heavy duty version was also available br Due to its large factory bore size short compared to RB engines deck height and bottom end strength that is greater than any other production B or RB engine due to extra material added around the main bearing caps B engine blocks have become a popular choice for high performance engine build ups br br br RB engines br The RB engines produced from to are raised block taller versions of the B engines All RB engines have a in mm stroke with the bore being the defining factor in engine size All RB wedge engines share a deck height of in mm and were fitted with in mm long connecting rods resulting in a rod ratio Bore center distance is in mm All RBs are oversquare br br br br br Not to be confused with the B engine the RB had a in mm in bore combined with the long stroke of inch mm for a displacement of cu in cc It was only available in and on the U S built Chrysler Windsors and Saratogas one of Trenton Engine s lines had been converted to the new RB engine to make the and demand for the B engine was too high for the remaining line The solution was to create a RB to fill the gap until the plant figured out how to quickly switch from one block to the other br br br br The cu in L RB was used from to in cars It was also used in medium and heavy trucks including truck tractors such as the C up until It has a bore of inches During that period it powered almost all Chrysler New Yorker and all Imperial models and was also available on the lesser Chryslers Dodge Polara Dodge Monaco and Plymouth Fury as an alternative to the B block and the A block It was also fitted to some European cars such as the later Facel Vega Facel II br In the Chrysler E the wedge was fitted with inline dual four barrel carburetors it was factory rated at bhp kW at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm In a long tube ram induction system was made standard on the Chrysler It continued as standard on the G and remained on the option sheets for Chrysler s through In a special version known as the Max Wedge was made available for drag racing and street use this version produced bhp kW at rpm br br br Wedge br br Not to be confused with the Hemi the cu in L RB was a wedge head RB block with a in mm bore The Wedge served as Chrysler s main performance engine until the introduction of the Hemi It was initially offered as the non catalogued option S in Chryslers the number of such produced is uncertain offered with or hp or kW via a single barrel carburetor or compression ratio respectively or or hp or kW via ram inducted dual four barrel carburetors with the same compression ratios For horsepower ratings would slightly increase see below and it became optional in B bodied Dodges and Plymouths After it would be used only in Dodges and Plymouths br The Max Wedge was a race only version of the Wedge engine offered from the factory Known as the Super Stock Plymouth and Ramcharger Dodge the Max Wedge featured high flow cylinder heads developed through state of the art at the time airflow testing They had in mm exhaust valves which required the cylinder bores to be notched for clearance The blocks were a special severe duty casting with larger oil feed passages than other RB engines and the blocks were stress relieved by the factory Induction came by means of a cross ram intake manifold tuned for peak power above rpm and two Carter AFB SA barrel carburetors The Max Wedge also included high flow cast iron exhaust manifolds that on the later versions resembled steel tube headers The Max Wedge was factory rated at or bhp or kW depending on compression and lb ft N m at rpm br Before the end of the model year Chrysler introduced the Stage II Max Wedge with improved combustion chamber design and an improved camshaft The last performance year for the Max Wedge came in with the Stage III The factory advertised power rating never changed despite the Stage II and III improvements br A Street Wedge block was also available in and It bears little relation to the Max Wedge except for basic architecture and dimensions The Street Wedge was available only in B body cars Plymouth and Dodge and light duty Dodge D Series trucks It was an increased bore version of the standard New Yorker single barrel engine br br br br br The cu in L RB was produced from until making it the last version of the Chrysler RB block It had a light wall construction precision cast iron block with iron heads and a bore of in mm for an overall displacement of cu in L br From to the high performance version was rated at bhp PS kW bhp PS kW in at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm of torque with a single barrel carburetor and from to the highest output version had an intake setup with barrel Holley carburetors Six Pack for Dodge BBL for Plymouth producing bhp PS kW at rpm bhp PS kW in and lb ft N m at rpm of torque br In changes were made to the horsepower ratings of vehicle engines from gross engine only without air cleaner exhaust system alternator or other power consuming components to net with alternator air cleaner mufflers and other vehicle equipment installed The new rating system produced lower more realistic numbers for any given engine At the same time emissions regulations were demanding cleaner exhaust Engines including the were made with reduced compression modified cam timing and other tuning measures to comply with the newly tightened emissions regulations The produced bhp kW gross at rpm the new net rating was hp kW which very closely coincided with period German DIN ratings and T V measurements br The high output barrel mild cam dual exhausts was marketed as the Magnum in Dodges the Super Commando in Plymouths and the TNT in Chryslers From to the engine detuned to run on unleaded gasoline was rated at hp kW net and dropped in horsepower each year until when it was rated at hp kW in police specification and limited to Chrysler New Yorkers Chrysler Newports Dodge Monaco Police Pursuits and Plymouth Fury Police Pursuits It was also available in marine and heavy duty commercial applications until that year br br br Crate engines br Chrysler also offers complete new crate engines through its Mopar parts division in various displacements These engines are
