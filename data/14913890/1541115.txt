title: Pistonless rotary engine
id: 1541115
A pistonless rotary engine is an internal combustion engine that does not use pistons in the way a reciprocating engine does Designs vary widely but typically involve one or more rotors sometimes called rotary pistons Although many different designs have been constructed only the Wankel engine has achieved widespread adoption br The term rotary combustion engine has been used as a name for these engines to distinguish them from early generally up to the early s aircraft engines and motorcycle engines also known as rotary engines However both continue to be called rotary engines and only the context determines which type is meant whereas the pistonless prefix is less ambiguous br br br Pistonless rotary engines br A pistonless rotary engine replaces the linear reciprocating motion of a piston with more complex compression expansion motions with the objective of improving some aspect of the engine s operation such as higher efficiency thermodynamic cycles lower mechanical stress lower vibration higher compression or less mechanical complexity As of the Wankel engine is the only successful pistonless rotary engine but many similar concepts have been proposed and are under various stages of development Examples of rotary engines include br br Production stage br Wankel engine br LiquidPiston engine br Beauchamp Tower s nineteenth century spherical steam engine in actual use as a steam engine but theoretically adaptable to use internal combustion br Development stage br Engineair engine br Hamilton Walker engines br Libralato rotary Atkinson cycle engine br Nutating disc engine br Quasiturbine br RKM engine German RotationsKolbenMaschine br Sarich orbital engine br Swing piston engine Trochilic br Wave disk engine br Conceptual stage br Gerotor engine br Internally Radiating Impulse Structure IRIS engine br br br See also br Range extender vehicle br br br Further reading br Jan P Norbye Rivals to the Wankel A Roundup of Rotary Engines Popular Science Jan pp br Article referencing the October issue of Mechanix Illustrated and the AMC Rambler rotary
