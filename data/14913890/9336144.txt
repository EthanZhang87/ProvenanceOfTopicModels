Marinisation also marinization is design redesign or testing of products for use in a marine environment Most commonly it refers to use and long term survival in harsh highly corrosive salt water conditions Marinisation is done by many manufacturing industries worldwide including many military organisations especially navies br In some instances cost is not a guiding force and items may be designed from scratch with entirely non corrosive components engineered and assembled to resist the effects of vibration and constantly changing attitude In others particularly in marinising an existing product that was not designed specifically for a marine environment for sale in the public marketplace a balance must be found between the competing criteria br There are three main factors that need to be considered for a product to be truly marinised br br Resistance to corrosion br Resistance to vibration br Ability to function properly in conditions of constantly changing attitude an object s orientation about its center of gravity br br br Examples br br br Metals br Marinised metals include some of the following br br Non corrosive alloys that resist or are impervious to salt water corrosion e g marine grade stainless steel brass an alloy of copper and zinc or bronze which contains copper with tin in place of zinc br The adjectival phrase marine grade being used when the above alloys have all impurities removed and are suitable for exposure to a marine environment br Metals electroplated or dipped in a corrosion resistant material e g galvanised steel br Metals painted with special anti rust or anti corrosion coatings br Plastic coated metals br br br Electronics br Marinised electronics use one or more of the following protection methods In most cases more than one method is used br br Coating by a spray or dipping to protect from salt air and water br Full encapsulation in some form of resin or gel br Specialised mounting of internal parts for vibration protection br Use of specialised corrosion resistant solder and corrosion resistant metals br br br Batteries br Marinised batteries are usually gel batteries or sealed maintenance free batteries Not using marinised batteries in salt water can be deadly in an enclosed environment for many reasons br br Sulfuric acid and salt water react to generate dangerous hydrogen chloride gas necessitating the use of valve regulated maintenance free sealed batteries br The battery must have stronger plates and separators to withstand constant vibrations and impacts caused by large waves striking the hull Plate collapse can cause short circuits and electrical fires or explosions br A marine battery must function at any angle due to the changing attitude of the vessel it is mounted in Gel VRLA batteries are best for this purpose br br br See also br Marine electronics br br br
