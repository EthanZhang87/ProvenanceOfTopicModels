A four stroke also four cycle engine is an internal combustion IC engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder in either direction The four separate strokes are termed br br Intake Also known as induction or suction This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center T D C and ends at bottom dead center B D C In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing a partial vacuum negative pressure in the cylinder through its downward motion br Compression This stroke begins at B D C or just at the end of the suction stroke and ends at T D C In this stroke the piston compresses the air fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke below Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage br Combustion Also known as power or ignition This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle At this point the crankshaft has completed a full degree revolution While the piston is at T D C the end of the compression stroke the compressed air fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug in a gasoline engine or by heat generated by high compression diesel engines forcefully returning the piston to B D C This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft br Exhaust Also known as outlet During the exhaust stroke the piston once again returns from B D C to T D C while the exhaust valve is open This action expels the spent air fuel mixture through the exhaust port br Four stroke engines are the most common internal combustion engine design for motorized land transport being used in automobiles trucks diesel trains light aircraft and motorcycles The major alternative design is the two stroke cycle br br br History br br br Otto cycle br br Nikolaus August Otto was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern In his travels he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir In Lenoir successfully created a double acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at efficiency The litre Lenoir Engine produced only horsepower The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal which had been developed in Paris by Philip Lebon br In testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge In Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem with no success br In Otto and Eugen Langen founded the first internal combustion engine production company NA Otto and Cie NA Otto and Company Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year br The factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of Deutz Germany in where the company was renamed to Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company In Gottlieb Daimler was technical director and Wilhelm Maybach was the head of engine design Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine br By Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time br Daimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high speed Otto engine in In they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine The Daimler Reitwagen used a hot tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world s first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine It used a four stroke engine based on Otto s design The following year Karl Benz produced a four stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car br In Otto s company then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz GFD developed electric ignition and the carburetor In Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft Today that company is Daimler Benz br br br Atkinson cycle br br The Atkinson cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by James Atkinson in The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of power density and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications br The original Atkinson cycle piston engine allowed the intake compression power and exhaust strokes of the four stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto cycle engines br Due to the unique crankshaft design of the Atkinson its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke the engine can achieve greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine While Atkinson s original design is no more than a historical curiosity many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke longer power stroke thus realizing the fuel economy improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide br br br Diesel cycle br br The diesel engine is a technical refinement of the Otto cycle engine Where Otto had realized in that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition Rudolf Diesel wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel The Lenoir Otto Atmospheric and Otto Compression engines both and were designed to run on Illuminating Gas coal gas With the same motivation as Otto Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies and like Otto to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply Like Otto it took more than a decade to produce the high compression engine that could self ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine br During initial development one of the engines burst nearly killing Diesel He persisted and finally created a successful engine in The high compression engine which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression is now called the diesel engine whether a four stroke or two stroke design br The four stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy duty applications for many decades It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce The most efficient Otto cycle engines run near thermal efficiency br br br Thermodynamic analysis br br The thermodynamic analysis of the actual four stroke and two stroke cycles is not a simple task However the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions are utilized The resulting cycle which closely resembles the actual operating conditions is the Otto cycle br During normal operation of the engine as the air fuel mixture is being compressed an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture At low rpm this occurs close to TDC Top Dead Centre As engine rpm rises the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs the atmospheric non compression engine operates at efficiency whereas the compressed charge engine has an operating efficiency around br br br Fuel considerations br A problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre ignition If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic it can damage the engine Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points the temperatures at which the fuel may self ignite This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design br The tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature There are several ways to do this As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline which increases the efficiency of the compression engine Higher compression ratios also mean that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater which is called the expansion ratio br The octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel s resistance to self ignition A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre ignition High Octane fuel is also more expensive br Many modern four stroke engines employ gasoline direct injection or GDI In a gasoline direct injected engine the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke when the piston is closer to the top br Diesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre ignition They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility they can be very hard to start when cold Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine the most common being the use of a glow plug br br br Design and engineering principles br br br Power output limitations br br The maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size cylinder volume whether it is a two stroke engine or four stroke design volumetric efficiency losses air to fuel ratio the calorific value of the fuel oxygen content of the air and speed RPM The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication Valves pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces At high engine speed physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur resulting in power loss or even engine destruction Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power If an engine spins too quickly valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves This is commonly referred to as valve float and it can result in piston to valve contact severely damaging the engine At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about m s br br br Intake exhaust port flow br The output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake air fuel mixture and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports typically located in the cylinder head To increase an engine s output power irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths such as casting flaws can be removed and with the aid of an air flow bench the radii of valve port turns and valve seat configuration can be modified to reduce resistance This process is called porting and it can be done by hand or with a CNC machine br br br Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine br An internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only of supplied energy into mechanical work A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant fins etc If somehow waste heat could be captured and turned to mechanical energy the engine s performance and or fuel efficiency could be improved by improving the overall efficiency of the cycle It has been found that even if of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly br Many methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time Use of the Rankine Cycle turbocharging and thermoelectric generation can be very useful as a waste heat recovery system br br br Supercharging br One way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a supercharger which can be powered by the engine crankshaft br Supercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement Most commonly the supercharger is always running but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds relative to engine speed Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage br br br Turbocharging br A turbocharger is a supercharger that is driven by the engine s exhaust gases by means of a turbine A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust It consists of a two piece high speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow br When idling and at low to moderate speeds the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner When much more power output is required the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to spool up the turbocharger s turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold Thus additional power and speed is expelled through the function of this turbine br Turbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be mostly wasted but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster and so forth until steady high power operation is reached Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine br br br Rod and piston to stroke ratio br The rod to stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the connecting rod to the length of the piston stroke A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces increasing engine life It also increases the cost and engine height and weight br A square engine is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an oversquare engine conversely an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine br br br Valve train br The valves are typically operated by a camshaft rotating at half the speed of the crankshaft It has a series of cams along its length each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke A tappet between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve Many engines use one or more camshafts above a row or each row of cylinders as in the illustration in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase in which case each cam usually contacts a push rod which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve or in case of a flathead engine a push rod is not necessary The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve br br br Valve clearance br Valve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes On engines with mechanical valve adjustment excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly This results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves Typically the clearance must be readjusted each miles km with a feeler gauge br Most modern production engines use hydraulic lifters to automatically compensate for valve train component wear Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure br br br Energy balance br Otto engines are about efficient in other words of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine while the remainder being lost due to waste heat friction and engine accessories There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat The use of a turbocharger in diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement The Mack Truck company decades ago developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed back into the engine s transmission In BMW announced the development of the turbosteamer a two stage heat recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by By contrast a six stroke engine may reduce fuel consumption by as much as br Modern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be This is necessary for emission controls such as exhaust gas recirculation and catalytic converters that reduce smog and other atmospheric pollutants Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an engine control unit using lean burn techniques br In the United States the Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of mpg US L km mpg imp compared to the current standard of mpg US L km mpg imp As automakers look to meet these standards by new ways of engineering the traditional internal combustion engine ICE have to be considered Some potential solutions to increase fuel efficiency to meet new mandates include firing after the piston is farthest from the crankshaft known as top dead centre and applying the Miller cycle Together this redesign could significantly reduce fuel consumption and NOx emissions br br br See also br br br br br br General sources br Hardenberg Horst O The Middle Ages of the Internal combustion Engine Society of Automotive Engineers SAE ISBN br
