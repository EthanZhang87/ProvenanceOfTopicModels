Revolutions per minute abbreviated rpm RPM rev min r min or r min is a unit of rotational speed or rotational frequency for rotating machines br One revolution per minute is equivalent to hertz br br br Standards br ISO defines a physical quantity called rotation or number of revolutions dimensionless whose instantaneous rate of change is called rotational frequency or rate of rotation with units of reciprocal seconds s br A related but distinct quantity for describing rotation is angular frequency or angular speed the magnitude of angular velocity for which the SI unit is the radian per second rad s br Although they have the same dimensions reciprocal time and base unit s the hertz Hz and radians per second rad s are special names used to express two different but proportional ISQ quantities frequency and angular frequency respectively The conversions between a frequency f and an angular frequency are br br br br br br br br br f br br br br f br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle omega pi f qquad f frac omega pi br br br Thus a disc rotating at rpm is said to have an angular speed of rad s and a rotation frequency of Hz br The International System of Units SI does not recognize rpm as a unit It defines units of angular frequency and angular velocity as rad s and units of frequency as Hz equal to s br br br Examples br For a wheel a pump or a crank shaft the number of times that it completes one full cycle in one minute is given the unit revolution per minute A revolution is one complete period of motion whether this be circular reciprocating or some other periodic motion br On many kinds of disc recording media the rotational speed of the medium under the read head is a standard given in rpm Phonograph gramophone records for example typically rotate steadily at rpm or rpm or respectively in Hz br Air turbine rotating up to rpm kHz br Modern air turbine dental drills can rotate at over rpm kHz br The second hand of a conventional analog clock rotates at rpm br Audio CD players read their discs at a precise constant rate Mbit s of raw physical data for Mbit s KB s of usable audio data and thus must vary the disc s rotational speed from Hz rpm when reading at the innermost edge to Hz rpm at the outer edge br DVD players also usually read discs at a constant linear rate The disc s rotational speed varies from Hz rpm when reading at the innermost edge to Hz rpm at the outer edge br A washing machine s drum may rotate at rpm to rpm Hz Hz during the spin cycles br A baseball thrown by a Major League Baseball pitcher can rotate at over rpm Hz faster rotation yields more movement on breaking balls br A power generation turbine with a two pole alternator rotates at rpm Hz rpm Hz and over rpm Hz br Modern automobile engines are typically operated around rpm rpm Hz Hz when cruising with a minimum idle speed around rpm rpm Hz Hz and an upper limit anywhere from rpm to up to rpm Hz Hz for a road car very rarely reaching up to rpm for certain cars such as the GMA T or rpm for racing engines such as those in Formula cars during the season with the L N A V engine configuration limited to rpm with the L V turbo hybrid engine configuration The exhaust note of V V and V F cars has a much higher pitch than an I engine because each of the cylinders of a four stroke engine fires once for every two revolutions of the crankshaft Thus an eight cylinder engine turning times per second will have an exhaust note of Hz br A piston aircraft engine typically rotates at a rate between rpm and rpm Hz Hz br Computer hard drives typically rotate at rpm rpm Hz Hz the most common speeds for the ATA or SATA based drives in consumer models High performance drives used in fileservers and enthusiast gaming PCs rotate at rpm rpm Hz Hz usually with higher level SATA SCSI or Fibre Channel interfaces and smaller platters to allow these higher speeds the reduction in storage capacity and ultimate outer edge speed paying off in much quicker access time and average transfer speed thanks to the high spin rate Until recently lower end and power efficient laptop drives could be found with rpm or even rpm spindle speeds Hz or Hz but these have fallen out of favour due to their lower performance improvements in energy efficiency in faster models and the takeup of solid state drives for use in slimline and ultraportable laptops Similar to CD and DVD media the amount of data that can be stored or read for each turn of the disc is greater at the outer edge than near the spindle however hard drives keep a constant rotational speed so the effective data rate is faster at the edge conventionally the start of the disc opposite to a CD or DVD br Floppy disc drives typically ran at a constant rpm or occasionally rpm a relatively slow Hz or Hz with a constant per revolution data density which was simple and inexpensive to implement though inefficient Some designs such as those used with older Apple computers Lisa early Macintosh later II s were more complex and used variable rotational speeds and per track storage density at a constant read record rate to store more data per disc for example between rpm with sectors per track and rpm sectors with Mac s kB double density drive at a constant kB s max versus rpm kB and kB s max for double density drives in other machines br A Zippe type centrifuge for enriching uranium spins at rpm Hz or faster br Gas turbine engines rotate at tens of thousands of rpm JetCat model aircraft turbines are capable of over rpm Hz with the fastest reaching rpm Hz br A Flywheel energy storage system works at rpm rpm kHz kHz range using a passively magnetic levitated flywheel in a vacuum The choice of the flywheel material is not the most dense but the one that pulverises the most safely at surface speeds about times the speed of sound br A typical mm CFM computer fan will spin at rpm rpm Hz Hz on V DC power br A millisecond pulsar can have near rpm Hz br A turbocharger can reach rpm kHz while rpm rpm kHz kHz is common br A supercharger can spin at speeds between or as high as rpm rpm Hz Hz br Molecular microbiology molecular engines The rotation rates of bacterial flagella have been measured to be rpm Hz for Salmonella typhimurium rpm Hz for Escherichia coli and up to rpm Hz for polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus allowing the latter organism to move in simulated natural conditions at a maximum speed of mm h br br br See also br Constant angular velocity CAV used when referring to the speed of gramophone phonograph records br Constant
