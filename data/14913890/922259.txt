title: Flat-six engine
id: 922259
A flat six engine also known as a horizontally opposed six is a six cylinder piston engine with three cylinders on each side of a central crankshaft The most common type of flat six engine is the boxer six engine where each pair of opposed cylinders moves inwards and outwards at the same time An alternative configuration for flat engines is a degree V engine where both cylinders move to the right then the left at the same time br The advantages of the flat six layout are good engine balance for reduced vibration a low center of gravity short length compared with an inline six engine and being well suited to air cooling The disadvantages are a large width which can limit the maximum steering angle when used in a front engined car a large intake manifold being required when a central carburetor is used and duplication of the inlet and outlet connections for water cooled engines br The first production flat six engine was in the Wilson Pilcher HP car The most notable use of flat six engines is the Porsche sports car which has used flat six engines continuously since Several other car manufacturers including Subaru have produced flat six engines at times Flat six engines have also occasionally been used in motorcycles and commonly in general aviation aircraft along with the flat four engine br br br Engine balance br br A boxer style flat six engine is able to have perfect primary and secondary balance As in other six cylinder engines the overlapping of the power strokes of the different cylinders with a firing interval of degrees in a four stroke engine reduces the pulsating of the power delivery relative to that of similar engines with fewer cylinders br In a boxer configuration a flat six engine does not have a rocking couple The symmetry of the arrangement in which one bank of three cylinders is mirrored by the other bank means that there is no net force from any given mirrored cylinder pair along the axis of movement of the pistons So not only is there no net primary or secondary reciprocating effect there is no net turning force moment that would try to rotate the engine back and forth about its engine mountings The moment is not quite zero in practice because each cylinder pair is offset slightly from the other or else they would clash at the crankshaft In this regard the six cylinder boxer engine is the same as a flat four boxer engine which also does not experience any rocking couple br These characteristics result in low vibration for flat six engines as in straight six engines especially when compared with the imbalances that are present in V engines with a degree bank angle br br br Use in aircraft br br Early flat six engines include the Franklin O which began production in and the Lycoming O which began production in Several manufacturers use the letter O in their model codes for flat layout engines as a designation for opposed cylinder layouts The Franklin O was used in the Bell light helicopter br Flat engines largely replaced the historically more popular radial engines in small aircraft after World War II because they were less expensive to manufacture The smaller frontal area compared with a radial engine also results in less drag br Some aircraft have used flat six engines originally designed for cars The Porsche PFM engine produced from to was based on the engine used in the Porsche sports car Several examples of the Pietenpol Air Camper homebuilt monoplane aircraft have used the air cooled engine from the Chevrolet Corvair compact car Compared with the engines used in cars flat six engines used by helicopters have large displacements and are low revving producing more torque and less power br br A notable recent flat six aero engine is the litre side valve Belgian D Motor LF a modular variant of the litre flat four D Motor LF Although the side valve format has long been abandoned for most automotive applications because its combustion chamber is a bar to high engine rpm the massively over square D Motor is a very simple low revving compact reliable lightweight aero engine without the heavy and bulky complication of ohv valve gear br br br Use in automobiles br br br Porsche br br The flat six engine is often associated with the Porsche a rear engined sports car which has used flat six engines exclusively since The engines were air cooled until when Porsche started using water cooled engines br Other Porsche models that use flat six engines are the Porsche mid engine the Porsche rear engine and the Porsche Boxster Cayman mid engine br br br Other manufacturers br br The first car to use a flat six engine was the Wilson Pilcher HP which used an engine based on a flat four engine with two cylinders added The Wilson Pilcher was a front engined car with the crankshaft in line with the chassis and the cylinders between the chassis rails Reports on this car quote it as being remarkably silent and smooth running and almost total absence of vibration br Two American manufacturers briefly produced cars with flat six engines the Tucker water cooled based on the Franklin O and the Chevrolet Corvair air cooled Both are rear engined cars with rear wheel drive Chevrolet produced over million Corvairs of various types and utilized a turbocharger on some models one of the first uses of a turbocharger on a mass produced automobile br Japanese manufacturer Subaru produced water cooled flat engines from and Their first flat engine the Subaru ER was added to the model range of the Subaru XT coupe In the Subaru EG engine was used in the Subaru Alcyone SVX the replacement for the Subaru XT Following a hiatus of flat engine production for four years the Subaru EZ engine was introduced in the Subaru Legacy Outback The Subaru EZ engine was introduced in and was produced until All engines were used in front engine cars with all wheel drive plus the XT and Alcyone SVX were also available with front wheel drive br br br Use in motorcycles br br Most motorcycles use engines with four or fewer cylinders however the Honda Gold Wing touring motorcycle has used a water cooled flat six engine since Initially the engine had a displacement of L cu in until it was enlarged to L cu in in br The Honda Valkyrie F C was a cruiser based on the GL Gold Wing The limited edition Valkyrie Rune was based on the GL br br br See also br Inline six
