A V engine is a sixteen cylinder piston engine where two banks of eight cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft V engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders such as V and V engines Each bank of a V engine can be thought of as a straight eight a design that can be inherently balanced Most V engines have a bank angle br The first use of a V engine was in the Antoinette VII experimental aircraft followed by several cars in the s Today the most common applications for V engines are railroad locomotives marine craft and stationary power generators br br br Automotive applications br br br Production cars br br The first production car to use a V engine was the Cadillac V introduced in January The Cadillac V engine was initially produced with a displacement of cu in L OHV and a V angle of degrees For the Series the engine was revised to a displacement of cu in cm a flathead valvetrain and a V angle of degrees the latter in order to achieve a lower cowl height This cu in version produced as much power as its immediate predecessor while being far less complex had a stiffer crankshaft that aided durability and smoothness and even had an external oil filter a rarity for any car at any price in those days br The Marmon Motor Car Company actually began development of a V engine in earlier than Cadillac Its development program took longer however and the Marmon Sixteen was released in This engine had a V angle of degrees used pressed steel cylinder liners and was constructed mostly of aluminium Only Marmon Sixteens were produced between and br In the Cizeta Moroder V T began production featuring a cylinder engine in a unique configuration Rather than a conventional V layout the engine was actually two separate transversely mounted V engines with gearing between the two providing a single output from the centre of the engine assembly to the transmission Only a few cars were produced before the company ceased operations On June Bugatti unveiled the successor to the Chiron which has a W Engine the Tourbillion which houses a V L cu in hybrid powertrain co developed with Cosworth br br br Prototype cars br br The Peerless Motor Company developed a V engine in the early s yet just a single prototype was built before all automobile production ceased and the company converted its factory into a brewery following the end of Prohibition in the United States br In the late s the BMW Goldfish V L cu in engine was developed based on BMW s then new V engine Prototypes were fitted to a long wheelbase Series and then in the early s to a Bentley Mulsanne At around the same time Mercedes Benz developed a L cu in V engine for the S class limousine Between and approximately prototypes were built br The Cadillac Sixteen concept car was unveiled with a L cu in V engine which was based on the General Motors LS V engines The following year the Rolls Royce EX concept car was unveiled with a L cu in V engine The car featured in the film Johnny English Reborn is powered by this V engine br The Devel Sixteen Prototype used a quad turbo L cu in V engine br br br Racing cars br br The first known use of a V in motor racing was the Maserati Tipo V car used in Grand Prix racing The Tipo V debuted at Monza in and achieved a world speed record of km h mph at an event in Cremona Italy br At the Indianapolis a custom built V engine was fitted to a Cord supercar driven by Shorty Cantlon The car was competitive charging from th on the grid to rd but was slowed by unreliability further exacerbated by having to change all sixteen spark plugs The following year Bryan Saulpaugh qualified the car in third position The car suffered a broken oil line on lap and their race was over Shortly after the race the V was removed and replaced with a conventional Miller four cylinder engine br The mid engined Auto Union Type A Type B and Type C Grand Prix cars of to were powered by supercharged L cu in engines Due to a rule change in these were replaced by a V engine for the Type D racing car Prior to this rule change the Alfa Romeo Tipo competed at the Tripoli Grand Prix powered by a degree V engine and in an unusual degree V engine was installed in the Alfa Romeo Tipo br The only known use of a V engine in the post World War II era is the British Racing Motors BRM V engine used in Formula One racing from to The engine was a L cu in supercharged design which was unsuccessful despite its high power output Officially it produced kW hp but probably delivered around kW hp The car was difficult to drive due to the power band being in a narrow range and at high RPM br br br Marine rail applications br br The V configuration is also used in several large displacement diesel engines that are used as marine engines or in rail locomotives This is due to manufacturers often designing an engine around a fixed displacement per cylinder then adding additional cylinders to the design until the required power output is achieved For example the Electro Motive Diesel engine range uses a displacement of cu in L per cylinder with the cylinder version called the EMD producing over hp MW br GE Transportation produces the FD Series four stroke engines used in marine locomotive and stationary applications which have a displacement of cu in L per cylinder and can produce over hp MW GE also manufactures the GEVO which produces over hp MW br Another V diesel engine is the W rtsil F which produces over hp MW at rpm br In the UK from onwards English Electric s subsidiary English Electric diesel engines developed a V engine for rail and marine use based on its bore x stroke mm x mm K series from the s notably used in British Railways class and locomotives with power output in the range hp kW at speeds ranging from to rpm This engine too derives from a series based on a fixed cylinder size of cu in L per cylinder giving the V a total capacity of cu in L br Another notable maker to offer the V configuration was Detroit Diesel corporation especially in their and series stroke diesel engines with output ranging from around to over bhp kW at speeds over rpm in the smaller ranges Once again these engines were based on common parts the numeric designation is the cylinder size in cubic inches and were used for maritime generator and off road mine truck applications The modular nature of the engines meant that the V configuration was built by putting together two V engine blocks and the stroke cycle offered excellent power to weight with the V being capable of equalling the output of much larger slower running stroke engines br Fairbanks Morse manufactures the following V diesel engines FM ALCO F FM COLT PIELSTICK PA B STC FM COLT PIELSTICK PC STC FM MAN D STC FM MAN CR FM MAN CR and the FM MAN D br br br Aircraft applications br br The version of the Antoinette VII was powered by a V engine and competed in the Gordon Bennett Cup in the United States br The s Hindenburg airships were each powered by four Daimler Benz DB V diesel engines br In the first half of the th century several prototype aircraft used V engines including br br prototype designed by Antoinette engineer L on Levavasseur br Duesenberg developed a V engine for use in military aircraft in the mid s World War I ended prior to the engine being tested in an aircraft br The Chrysler IV inverted V engine began development in when Chrysler was contracted by the United States government to create a new engine for use in fighter aircraft The resulting engine was rated at hp kW however it took until June for the engine to be in a state ready for testing A prototype engine was installed in a P Thunderbolt designated the XP H which achieved a top speed of mph km h World War II ended shortly after the tests therefore development of the engine ceased br br br See also br br Flat sixteen engine br W engine br br br
