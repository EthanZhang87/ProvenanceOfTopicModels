Red Hat Enterprise Linux RHEL is a commercial open source Linux distribution developed by Red Hat for the commercial market Red Hat Enterprise Linux is released in server versions for x Power ISA ARM and IBM Z and a desktop version for x Fedora Linux and CentOS Stream serve as its upstream sources All of Red Hat s official support and training together with the Red Hat Certification Program focuses on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform br The first version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to bear the name originally came onto the market as Red Hat Linux Advanced Server In Red Hat rebranded Red Hat Linux Advanced Server to Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS and added two more variants Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS br Red Hat previously used strict trademark rules to restrict free re distribution of their officially supported versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux but still freely provided its source code Third party derivatives were able to be built and redistributed by stripping away non free components like Red Hat s trademarks Examples include community supported distributions like Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux and commercial ones like Oracle Linux In Red Hat decided to stop making the source code of Red Hat Enterprise Linux available to the public The code is still available to Red Hat customers as well as developers using free accounts though under conditions that forbid redistribution of the source code br br br Variants br Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server subscription is available at no cost for development purposes Developers need to register for the Red Hat Developer Program and agree to license terms forbidding production use and redistribution of the source code This free developer subscription was announced on March br There are also Academic editions of the Desktop and Server variants They are offered to schools and students are less expensive and are provided with Red Hat technical support as an optional extra Web support based on the number of customer contacts can be purchased separately br It is often assumed the branding ES AS and WS stand for Entry level Server Advanced Server and Work Station respectively The reason for this is that the ES product is indeed the company s base enterprise server product while AS is the more advanced product However nowhere on its site or in its literature does Red Hat say what AS ES and WS stand for br In Red Hat Enterprise Linux there are new editions that substitute former Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS ES WS Desktop br br Red Hat Enterprise Linux Advanced Platform

servers br Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS for technical power user enterprise desktops for high performance computing br Red Hat Desktop for multiple deployments of single user desktops for enterprises br br br Relationship with Fedora Linux br The Fedora Project provides the following explanation br br Fedora is a free distribution and community project and upstream for Red Hat Enterprise Linux Fedora is a general purpose system that gives Red Hat and the rest of its contributor community the chance to innovate rapidly with new technologies Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial enterprise operating system and has its own set of test phases including alpha and beta releases which are separate and distinct from Fedora development Originally Red Hat sold boxed versions of Red Hat Linux directly to consumers and business through phone support The Fedora Project began in as a set of community supported packages for Red Hat Linux However the six month release cycle of Red Hat Linux was too disruptive for business users and Red Hat wanted a more reliable revenue stream In Red Hat began releasing Red Hat Enterprise Linux based on Red Hat Linux but with a much more conservative release cycle and a subscription based support program A year later Red Hat discontinued the Red Hat Linux product line merging it with the Fedora community packages and releasing the resulting Fedora distribution for free br Fedora now serves as upstream for future versions of RHEL RHEL trees are forked off the Fedora repository and released after a substantial stabilization and quality assurance effort RHEL source code is also not freely available as those that obtain it are forbidden from redistribution For example RHEL was forked from Fedora at the end of approximately at the time of the Fedora Core release and released more or less together with Fedora By the time RHEL was released many features from Fedora and had already been backported into it The Fedora Project lists the following lineages for older Red Hat Enterprise releases br br Red Hat Linux to Red Hat Linux Enterprise Edition E br Red Hat Linux A to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Red Hat Linux to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora Core to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora Core to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora to CentOS Stream to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Fedora to CentOS Stream to Red Hat Enterprise Linux br In addition the Fedora project publishes a set of packages for RHEL called the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux EPEL EPEL packages can be expected to work in RHEL but it is up to willing community members to maintain the packages and back port any upstream changes As such packages may come and go during the ten year lifespan of the RHEL release and Red Hat support plans do not include resolving issues caused by EPEL packages br br br Derivatives br br Originally Red Hat s enterprise product then known as Red Hat Linux was made freely available to anybody who wished to download it while Red Hat made money from support Red Hat then moved towards splitting its product line into Red Hat Enterprise Linux which was designed to be stable and with long term support for enterprise users and Fedora as the community distribution and project sponsored by Red Hat The use of trademarks prevents verbatim copying of Red Hat Enterprise Linux br Red Hat Enterprise Linux is derived completely from free and open source software Until Red Hat made the source code to its enterprise distribution publicly available through its FTP website Accordingly several groups used the source code to compile their own derivatives typically with changes including the removal of any references to Red Hat s trademarks and pointing the update systems to non Red Hat servers Groups which have undertaken this include AlmaLinux CentOS MIRACLE LINUX Oracle Linux CloudLinux OS Rocky Linux Scientific Linux StartCom Enterprise Linux Pie Box Enterprise Linux X OS Lineox and Bull s XBAS for high performance computing However as of June Red Hat no longer makes the source code freely available while they still provide the source code to customers and developers The GNU GPL forbids terms and conditions that prevent users from redistributing the source code of GPL licensed software including but not limited to the GNU core utilities such as cat ls and rm which is licensed under the GNU GPLv or later as of version and the Linux kernel itself licensed under the GPLv only This led to AlmaLinux one of the RHEL derivative Linux distributions moving away from bug for bug compatibility to application binary interface ABI compatible while Oracle SUSE and CIQ the company behind Rocky Linux collaborated to form the Open Enterprise Linux Association OpenELA in order to provide open and free Enterprise Linux EL source code br Derivatives of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are free but do not get any commercial support or consulting services from Red Hat and lack software hardware or security certifications from Red Hat They also do not get access to Red Hat services like Red Hat Network br br Unusually Red Hat took steps to obfuscate their changes to the Linux kernel for RHEL by not publicly providing the patch files for their changes in the source tarball and only releasing the finished product in source form Speculation suggested that the move was made to affect Oracle s competing rebuild and support services which further modifies the distribution This practice however still complies with the GNU GPL since source code is defined as the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it and the distribution still complies with this definition Red Hat s CTO Brian Stevens later confirmed the change stating that certain information such as patch information would now only be provided to paying customers to make the Red Hat product more competitive against the growing number of companies offering support for products based on RHEL CentOS developers had no objections to the change since they do not make any changes to the kernel beyond what is provided by Red Hat Their competitor Oracle announced in November that they were releasing a RedPatch service which allows public view of the RHEL kernel changes broken down by patch br br br Related products and add ons br br A number of commercial vendors use Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a base for the operating system in their products Two of the best known are the Console Operating System in VMware ESX Server and Oracle Linux br br br Version history and timeline br br br Naming convention br Each release is given a codename which is selected by a vote of the developers The codenames don t have a specific pattern

Product life cycle br The life cycle of Red Hat Enterprise Linux is at least seven years for versions and and spans at least years for versions and The life cycle comprises several phases of varying length with different degrees of support During the first phase Production Red Hat provides full support and updates software and hardware drivers In later phases Production and Production only security and other important fixes are provided and support for new hardware is gradually reduced br In the last years of the support lifecycle after seven years for version and earlier and after years for version and later critical and security related fixes are only provided to customers who pay an additional subscription Extended Lifecycle Support Add On that is available for versions and This covers a limited number of packages Red Hat only supports major version upgrades from version to version and from version to version br br br Kernel backporting br To maintain a stable application binary interface ABI Red Hat does not update the kernel version but instead backports new features to the same kernel version with which a particular version of RHEL has been released New features are backported throughout the Production phase of the RHEL lifecycle Consequently RHEL may use a Linux kernel with a dated version number yet the kernel is up to date regarding not only security fixes but also certain features One specific example is the SO REUSEPORT socket option which was added to Linux kernel and was subsequently backported and became available since RHEL which uses version of the Linux kernel br br br Extended Update Support EUS Z Tree br br The Extended Update Support EUS allows an organization company to choose when they change to a new minor version For the first months of the EUS channel yum repo features may be added but then the channel is locked down so that only bug and security fixes are patched The organization company then has months to move to a new EUS branch EUS allows the organization company to stay on a minor version if required by a third party application which is only tested with a particular minor version of RHEL such as Oracle Database IBM Db IBM Cloud Orchestrator Hortonworks There may also be extra costs associated with using the EUS repos channels depending on the agreement the organization company has with Red Hat For more information on what is Included Excluded from the EUS see br br br Note br The EUS update mechanism for using older minor version branches is not available to CentOS Oracle Linux and Scientific Linux as Red Hat do not publish source packages for rebuilding As such projects clearly state to ensure users run on the latest available minor version within a supported major release br br br
