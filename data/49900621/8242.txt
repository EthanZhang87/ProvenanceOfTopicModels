Debian also known as Debian GNU Linux is a Linux distribution composed of free and open source software and optionally non free firmware or software developed by the community supported Debian Project which was established by Ian Murdock on August The first version of Debian was released on September and its first stable version was released on June The Debian Stable branch is the most popular edition for personal computers and servers br Debian is also the basis for many other distributions that have different purposes like Proxmox for servers Ubuntu or Linux Mint for desktops Kali for penetration testing and Pardus and Astra for government use br Debian is one of the oldest operating systems based on the Linux kernel and as of September the second oldest Linux distribution still in active development only behind Slackware The project is coordinated over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian Project Leader and three foundational documents the Debian Social Contract the Debian Constitution and the Debian Free Software Guidelines New distributions are updated continually and the next candidate is released after a time based freeze br In general Debian has been developed openly and distributed freely according to some of the principles of the GNU Project and Free Software Because of this the Free Software Foundation sponsored the project from November to November However it is no longer endorsed by GNU and the FSF due to the distribution s long term practice of hosting non free software repositories and since its inclusion of non free firmware in its installation media by default On June the Debian Project founded the nonprofit organization Software in the Public Interest to continue financially supporting development br br br History br br br Debian version history br br Debian distribution codenames are based on the names of characters from the Toy Story films Debian s unstable trunk is named after Sid a character who regularly destroyed his toys br br br Founding br First announced on August Debian was founded by Ian Murdock who initially called the system the Debian Linux Release The word Debian was formed as a portmanteau of the first name of his then girlfriend later ex wife Debra Lynn and his own first name Before Debian s release the Softlanding Linux System SLS had been a popular Linux distribution and the basis for Slackware The perceived poor maintenance and prevalence of bugs in SLS motivated Murdock to launch a new distribution br Debian released on September was the first of several internal releases Version was the first public release providing support through mailing lists hosted at Pixar The release included the Debian Linux Manifesto outlining Murdock s view for the new operating system In it he called for the creation of a distribution to be maintained openly in the spirit of Linux and GNU br The Debian project released the x versions in and During this time it was sponsored by the Free Software Foundation for one year Ian Murdock delegated the base system the core packages of Debian to Bruce Perens and Murdock focused on the management of the growing project The first ports to non IA architectures began in and Debian was released in By that time and thanks to Ian Jackson the dpkg package manager was already an essential part of Debian br In Bruce Perens assumed the project leadership Perens was a controversial leader regarded as authoritarian and strongly attached to Debian He drafted a social contract and edited suggestions from a month long discussion into the Debian Social Contract and the Debian Free Software Guidelines After the FSF withdrew their sponsorship in the midst of the free software vs open source debate Perens initiated the creation of the legal umbrella organization Software in the Public Interest instead of seeking renewed involvement with the FSF He led the conversion of the project from a out to ELF He created the BusyBox program to make it possible to run a Debian installer on a single floppy disk and wrote a new installer By the time Debian was released the project had grown to nearly two hundred volunteers Perens left the project in br Ian Jackson became the leader in Debian introduced the second official port m k During this time the first port to a non Linux kernel Debian GNU Hurd was started On December the first Debian Constitution was ratified br br br Leader election br From the project leader was elected yearly The Advanced Packaging Tool was deployed with Debian The number of applicants was overwhelming and the project established the new member process The first Debian derivatives namely Libranet Corel Linux and Stormix s Storm Linux were started in The release in was dedicated to Joel Klecker a developer who died of Duchenne muscular dystrophy br In late the project reorganized the archive with new package pools and created the Testing distribution made up of packages considered stable to reduce the freeze for the next release In the same year developers began holding an annual conference called DebConf with talks and workshops for developers and technical users In May Hewlett Packard announced plans to base its Linux development on Debian br In July the project released version code named Woody the first release to include cryptographic software a free licensed KDE and internationalization During these last release cycles the Debian project drew considerable criticism from the free software community because of the long time between stable releases br Some events disturbed the project while working on Sarge as Debian servers were attacked by fire and hackers One of the most memorable was the Vancouver prospectus After a meeting held in Vancouver release manager Steve Langasek announced a plan to reduce the number of supported ports to four in order to shorten future release cycles There was a large reaction because the proposal looked more like a decision and because such a drop would damage Debian s aim to be the universal operating system br The first version of the Debian based Ubuntu named Warty Warthog was released on October Because it was distributed as a free download it became one of the most popular and successful operating systems with more than million users according to Canonical Ltd However Murdock was critical of the differences between Ubuntu packages and Debian stating that it leads to incompatibilities br br br Sarge and later releases present br br The Sarge release was made in June This release updated of the software and included over new packages A new installer with a modular design Debian Installer allowed installations with RAID XFS and LVM support improved hardware detection made installations easier for novice users and was translated into almost forty languages An installation manual and release notes were in ten and fifteen languages respectively The efforts of Skolelinux Debian Med and Debian Accessibility raised the number of packages that were educational had a medical affiliation and ones made for people with disabilities br br In as a result of a much publicized dispute Mozilla software was rebranded in Debian with Firefox forked as Iceweasel and Thunderbird as Icedove The Mozilla Corporation stated that software with unapproved modifications could not be distributed under the Firefox trademark Two reasons that Debian modified the Firefox software were to change non free artwork and to provide security patches In February it was announced that Mozilla and Debian had reached an agreement and Iceweasel would revert to the name Firefox similar agreement was anticipated for Icedove Thunderbird br A fund raising experiment Dunc Tank was created to solve the release cycle problem and release managers were paid to work full time in response unpaid developers slowed down their work and the release was delayed br Debian Etch was released in April featuring the x port and a graphical installer br Debian Lenny was released in February supporting Marvell s Orion platform and netbooks such as the Asus Eee PC The release was dedicated to Thiemo Seufer a developer who died in a car crash br br In July the policy of time based development freezes on a two year cycle was announced Time based freezes are intended to blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian s policy of feature based releases and to reduce overall freeze time The Squeeze cycle was going to be especially short however this initial schedule was abandoned In September the backports service became official providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release br Debian Squeeze was released in February featuring Debian GNU kFreeBSD as a technology preview along with adding a dependency based boot system and moving problematic firmware to the non free section br Debian Wheezy was released in May featuring multiarch support br Debian Jessie was released in April using systemd as the new init system br Debian Stretch was released in June with nftables as a replacement for iptables support for Flatpak apps and MariaDB as the replacement for MySQL br Debian Buster was released in July adding support for Secure Boot and enabling AppArmor by default br Debian Bullseye was released in August enabling persistency in the system journal adding support for driverless scanning and containing kernel level support for exFAT filesystems br Debian Bookworm was released on June including various improvements and features increasing the supported Linux Kernel to version and leveraging new Emerald artwork br Debian is still in development and new packages are uploaded to unstable every day br Debian used to be released as a very large set of CDs for each architecture but with the release of Debian Stretch in many of the images have been dropped from the archive but remain buildable via jigdo br Throughout Debian s lifetime both the Debian distribution and its website have won various awards from different organizations including Server Distribution of the Year The best Linux distro of and a Best of the Net award for October br On December Microsoft announced that they would offer Debian GNU Linux as an endorsed distribution on the Azure cloud platform Microsoft has also added a user environment to their Windows desktop operating system called Windows Subsystem for Linux that offers a Debian subset br br br Features br br Debian has access to online repositories that contain over packages Debian officially contains only free software but non free software can be downloaded and installed from the Debian repositories Debian includes popular free programs such as LibreOffice Firefox web browser Evolution mail K b disc burner VLC media player GIMP image editor and Evince document viewer Debian is a popular choice for servers for example as the operating system component of a LAMP stack br br br Kernels br Several flavors of the Linux kernel exist for each port For example the i port has flavors for IA PCs supporting Physical Address Extension and real time computing for older PCs and for x PCs The Linux kernel does not officially contain firmware lacking source code although such firmware is available in non free packages and alternative installation media br br br Desktop environments br br Debian offers CD and DVD images specifically built for Xfce GNOME KDE MATE Cinnamon LXDE and LXQt MATE support was added in and Cinnamon support was added with Debian Jessie Less common window managers such as Enlightenment Openbox Fluxbox IceWM Window Maker and others are available br The default desktop environment of version Wheezy was temporarily switched to Xfce because GNOME did not fit on the first CD of the set The default for the version Jessie was changed again to Xfce in November and back to GNOME in September br br br Localization br Several parts of Debian are translated into languages other than American English including package descriptions configuration messages documentation and the website The level of software localization depends on the language ranging from the highly supported German and French to the barely translated Creek and Samoan The Debian installer is available in languages br br br Multimedia support br Multimedia support has been problematic in Debian regarding codecs threatened by possible patent infringements lacking source code or under too restrictive licenses Even though packages with problems related to their distribution could go into the non free area software such as libdvdcss is not hosted at Debian br A notable third party repository exists formerly named Debian multimedia org providing software not present in Debian such as Windows codecs libdvdcss and the Adobe Flash Player Even though this repository is maintained by Christian Marillat a Debian developer it is not part of the project and is not hosted on a Debian server The repository provides packages already included in Debian interfering with the official maintenance Eventually project leader Stefano Zacchiroli asked Marillat to either settle an agreement about the packaging or to stop using the Debian name Marillat chose the latter and renamed the repository to deb multimedia org The repository was so popular that the switchover was announced by the official blog of the Debian project br br br Distribution br Debian offers DVD and CD images for installation that can be downloaded using BitTorrent or jigdo Physical discs can also be bought from retailers The full sets are made up of several discs the amd port consists of DVDs or CDs but only the first disc is required for installation as the installer can retrieve software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories br Debian offers different network installation methods A minimal install of Debian is available via the netinst CD whereby Debian is installed with just a base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet Another option is to boot the installer from the network br The default bootstrap loader is GNU GRUB version though the package name is simply grub while version was renamed to grub legacy This conflicts with distros e g Fedora Linux where grub version is named grub br The default desktop may be chosen from the DVD boot menu among GNOME KDE Plasma Xfce and LXDE and from special disc CDs br Debian releases live install images for CDs DVDs and USB thumb drives for IA and x architectures and with a choice of desktop environments These Debian Live images allow users to boot from removable media and run Debian without affecting the contents of their computer A full install of Debian to the computer s hard drive can be initiated from the live image environment Personalized images can be built with the live build tool for discs USB drives and for network booting purposes Installation images are hybrid on some architectures and can be used to create a bootable USB drive Live USB br br br Packages br Package management operations can be performed with different tools available on Debian from the lowest level command dpkg to graphical front ends like Synaptic The recommended standard for administering packages on a Debian system is the apt toolset br dpkg provides the low level infrastructure for package management The dpkg database contains the list of installed software on the current system The dpkg command tool does not know about repositories The command can work with local deb package files and information from the dpkg database br br br APT tools br br An Advanced Packaging Tool APT allows a Debian system to retrieve and resolve package dependencies from repositories APT tools share dependency information and cached packages br br The apt command itself is intended as an end user interface and enables some options better suited for interactive usage by default compared to more specialized APT like apt get and apt cache explained below br apt get and apt cache are command tools of the standard apt package apt get installs and removes packages and apt cache is used for searching packages and displaying package information br Aptitude is a command line tool that also offers a text based user interface The program comes with enhancements such as better search on package metadata br br br GDebi and other front ends br br GDebi is an APT tool which can be used in command line and on the GUI GDebi can install a local deb file via the command line like the dpkg command but with access to repositories to resolve dependencies Other graphical front ends for APT include Software Center Synaptic and Apper br GNOME Software is a graphical front end for PackageKit which itself can work on top of various software packaging systems br br br Repositories br The Debian Free Software Guidelines DFSG define the distinctive meaning of the word free as in free and open source software Packages that comply with these guidelines usually under the GNU General Public License Modified BSD License or Artistic License are included inside the main area otherwise they are included inside the non free and contrib areas These last two areas are not distributed within the official installation media but they can be adopted manually br Non free includes packages that do not comply with the DFSG such as documentation with invariant sections and proprietary software and legally questionable packages Contrib includes packages which do comply with the DFSG but fail other requirements For example they may depend on packages which are in non free or requires such for building them br Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have criticized the Debian project for hosting the non free repository and because the contrib and non free areas are easily accessible an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non free section has persisted but the last time it came to a vote in the majority decided to keep it br br br Cross distribution package manager br The most popular optional Linux cross distribution package manager are graphical front ends package managers They are available within the official Debian Repository but are not installed by default They are widely popular with both Debian users and Debian software developers who are interested in installing the most recent versions of application or using the cross distribution package manager built in sandbox environment While at the same time remaining in control of the security br Four most popular cross distribution package managers sorted in alphabetical order br br AppImage Linux distribution agnostic binary software deployment br Flatpak software code is owned and maintained by the not for profit Flatpak Team with an open source LGPL or later license br Homebrew software code is owned and maintained by its original author Max Howell with an open source BSD Clause License br Snap software code is owned and maintained by the for profit Canonical Group Limited with an open source GNU General Public License version br br br Branches br br Three branches of Debian also called releases distributions or suites are regularly maintained br br Stable is the current release and targets stable and well tested software needs Stable is made by freezing Testing for a few months where bugs are fixed and packages with too many bugs are removed then the resulting system is released as stable It is updated only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated This branch has an optional backports service that provides more recent versions of some software Stable s CDs and DVDs can be found in the Debian website The current version of Stable is codenamed bookworm br Testing is the preview branch that will eventually become the next major release The packages included in this branch have had some testing in unstable but they may not be fit for release yet It contains newer packages than stable but older than unstable This branch is updated continually until it is frozen Testing s CDs and DVDs can be found on the Debian website The current version of Testing is codenamed trixie br Unstable always codenamed sid is the trunk Packages are accepted without checking the distribution as a whole This branch is usually run by software developers who participate in a project and need the latest libraries available and by those who prefer bleeding edge software Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs but rather a minimal ISO that can be used to install over a network connection Additionally this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from stable or testing br Other branches in Debian br br Oldstable is the prior stable release It is supported by the Debian Security Team until one year after a new stable is released and since the release of Debian for another two years through the Long Term Support project Eventually oldstable is moved to a repository for archived releases Debian is the current Oldstable release since br Oldoldstable is the prior oldstable release It is supported by the Long Term Support community Eventually oldoldstable is moved to a repository for archived releases Debian is the current Oldoldstable release since br Experimental is a temporary staging area of highly experimental software that is likely to break the system It is not a full distribution and missing dependencies are commonly found in unstable where new software without the damage chance is normally uploaded br The snapshot archive provides older versions of the branches They may be used to install a specific older version of some software br br br Numbering scheme br Stable and oldstable get minor updates called point releases as of August the stable release is version released on April and the oldstable release is version br The numbering scheme for the point releases up to Debian was to include the letter r for revision after the main version number and then the number of the point release for example the latest point release of version is r This scheme was chosen because a new dotted version would make the old one look obsolete and vendors would have trouble selling their CDs br From Debian the numbering scheme of point releases was changed conforming to the GNU version numbering standard the first point release of Debian was instead of r The numbering scheme was once again changed for the first Debian update which was version The r scheme is no longer in use but point release announcements include a note about not throwing away old CDs br br br Branding br br Debian has two logos The official logo also known as open use logo contains the well known Debian swirl and best represents the visual identity of the Debian Project A separate restricted use logo also exists for use by the Debian Project and its members only br The Debian swirl logo was designed by Raul Silva in as part of a contest to replace the semi official logo that had been used The winner of the contest received an Debian org email address and a set of Debian install CDs for the architecture of their choice Initially the swirl was magic smoke arising from an also included bottle of an Arabian style genie presented in black profile but shortly after was reduced to the red smoke swirl for situations where space or multiple colours were not an option and before long the bottle version effectively was superseded There has been no official statement from the Debian project on the logo s meaning but at the time of the logo s selection it was suggested that the logo represented the magic smoke or the genie that made computers work br One theory about the origin of the Debian logo is that Buzz Lightyear the chosen character for the first named Debian release has a swirl in his chin Stefano Zacchiroli also suggested that this swirl is the Debian one Buzz Lightyear s swirl is a more likely candidate as the codenames for Debian are names of Toy Story characters The former Debian project leader Bruce Perens used to work for Pixar and is credited as a studio tools engineer on Toy Story br br br Hardware br Hardware requirements are at least those of the kernel and the GNU toolsets Debian s recommended system requirements depend on the level of installation which corresponds to increased numbers of installed components br br The real minimum memory requirements depend on the architecture and may be much less than the numbers listed in this table It is possible to install Debian with MB of RAM for x the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition The installer for z Architecture requires about MB of RAM but relies on network hardware Similarly disk space requirements which depend on the packages to be installed can be reduced by manually selecting the packages needed As of May no Pure Blend exists that would lower the hardware requirements easily br It is possible to run graphical user interfaces on older or low end systems but the installation of window managers instead of desktop environments is recommended as desktop environments are more resource intensive Requirements for individual software vary widely and must be considered with those of the base operating environment br br br Architectures br br As of the upcoming Trixie release the official ports are br br amd x architecture with bit userland and supporting bit software br arm ARMv A architecture br armel Little endian ARM architecture ARMv T instruction set on various embedded systems embedded application binary interface EABI although support has ended after Buster br armhf ARM hard float architecture ARMv

architecture on Amiga Atari Macintosh and various embedded VME systems br powerpc bit PowerPC br ppc PowerPC architecture supporting bit PowerPC CPUs with VMX br sh Hitachi SuperH architecture br sparc Sun SPARC architecture with bit userland br x x ABI userland for x br Debian supports a variety of ARM based NAS devices The NSLU was supported by the installer in Debian and and Martin Michlmayr is providing installation tarballs since version Other supported NAS devices are the Buffalo Kurobox Pro GLAN Tank Thecus N and QNAP Turbo Stations br Devices based on the Kirkwood system on a chip SoC are supported too such as the SheevaPlug plug computer and OpenRD products There are efforts to run Debian on mobile devices but this is not a project goal yet since the Debian Linux kernel maintainers would not apply the needed patches Nevertheless there are packages for resource limited systems br There are efforts to support Debian on wireless access points Debian is known to run on set top boxes Work is ongoing to support the AM x processor which is used in electronic point of service solutions Debian may be customized to run on cash machines br BeagleBoard a low power open source hardware single board computer made by Texas Instruments has switched to Debian Linux preloaded on its Beaglebone Black board s flash br Roqos Core manufactured by Roqos is a x based IPS firewall router running Debian Linux br br br Organization br br Debian s policies and team efforts focus on collaborative software development and testing processes As a result a new major release tends to occur every two years with revision releases that fix security issues and important problems The Debian project is a volunteer organization with three foundational documents br br The Debian Social Contract defines a set of basic principles by which the project and its developers conduct affairs br The Debian Free Software Guidelines define the criteria for free software and thus what software is permissible in the distribution These guidelines have been adopted as the basis of the Open Source Definition Although this document can be considered separate it formally is part of the Social Contract br The Debian Constitution describes the organizational structure for formal decision making within the project and enumerates the powers and responsibilities of the Project Leader the Secretary and other roles br br Debian developers are organized in a web of trust There are at present about one thousand active Debian developers but it is possible to contribute to the project without being an official developer br The project maintains official mailing lists and conferences for communication and coordination between developers For issues with single packages and other tasks a public bug tracking system is used by developers and end users Internet Relay Chat is also used for communication among developers and to provide real time help br Debian is supported by donations made to organizations authorized by the leader The largest supporter is Software in the Public Interest the owner of the Debian trademark manager of the monetary donations and umbrella organization for various other community free software projects br A Project Leader is elected once per year by the developers The leader has special powers but they are not absolute and appoints delegates to perform specialized tasks Delegates make decisions as they think is best taking into account technical criteria and consensus By way of a General Resolution the developers may recall the leader reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions The voting method is based on the Schulze method Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping br br Project leadership is distributed occasionally Branden Robinson was helped by the Project Scud a team of developers that assisted the leader but there were concerns that such leadership would split Debian into two developer classes Anthony Towns created a supplemental position Second In Charge IC that shared some powers of the leader Steve McIntyre was IC and had a IC himself br One important role in Debian s leadership is that of a release manager The release team sets goals for the next release supervises the processes and decides when to release The team is led by the next release managers and stable release managers Release assistants were introduced in br br br Developers br The Debian Project has an influx of applicants wishing to become developers These applicants must undergo a vetting process which establishes their identity motivation understanding of the project s principles and technical competence This process has become much harder throughout the years br Debian developers join the project for many reasons Some that have been cited include br br Debian is their main operating system and they want to promote Debian br To improve the support for their favorite technology br They are involved with a Debian derivative br A desire to contribute back to the free software community br To make their Debian maintenance work easier br Debian developers may resign their positions at any time or when deemed necessary they can be expelled Those who follow the retiring protocol are granted the emeritus status and they may regain their membership through a shortened new member process br br br Development br br Each software package has a maintainer that may be either one person or a team of Debian developers and non developer maintainers The maintainer keeps track of upstream releases and ensures that the package coheres with the rest of the distribution and meets the standards of quality of Debian Packages may include modifications introduced by Debian to achieve compliance with Debian Policy even to fix non Debian specific bugs although coordination with upstream developers is advised br The maintainer releases a new version by uploading the package to the incoming system which verifies the integrity of the packages and their digital signatures If the package is found to be valid it is installed in the package archive into an area called the pool and distributed every day to hundreds of mirrors worldwide The upload must be signed using OpenPGP compatible software All Debian developers have individual cryptographic key pairs Developers are responsible for any package they upload even if the packaging was prepared by another contributor br Initially an accepted package is only available in the unstable branch For a package to become a candidate for the next release it must migrate to the Testing branch by meeting the following br br It has been in unstable for a certain length of time that depends on the urgency of the changes br It does not have release critical bugs except for the ones already present in Testing Release critical bugs are those considered serious enough that they make the package unsuitable for release br There are no outdated versions in unstable for any release ports br The migration does not break any packages in Testing br Its dependencies can be satisfied by packages already in Testing or by packages being migrated at the same time br The migration is not blocked by a freeze br Thus a release critical bug in a new version of a shared library on which many packages depend may prevent those packages from entering Testing because the updated library must meet the requirements too From the branch viewpoint the migration process happens twice per day rendering Testing in perpetual beta br Periodically the release team publishes guidelines to the developers in order to ready the release A new release occurs after a freeze when all important software is reasonably up to date in the Testing branch and any other significant issues are solved At that time all packages in the testing branch become the new stable branch Although freeze dates are time based release dates are not which are announced by the release managers a couple of weeks beforehand br A version of a package can belong to more than one branch usually testing and unstable It is possible for a package to keep the same version between stable releases and be part of oldstable stable testing and unstable at the same time Each branch can be seen as a collection of pointers into the package pool mentioned above br One way to resolve the challenge of a release critical bug in a new application version is the use of optional package managers They allow software developers to use sandbox environments while at the same time remaining in control of security Another benefit of a cross distribution package manager is that they allow application developers to directly provide updates to users without going through distributions and without having to package and test the application separately for each distribution br br br Release cycle br A new stable branch of Debian gets released approximately every years It will receive official support for about years with update for major security or usability fixes Point releases will be available every several months as determined by Stable Release Managers SRM br Debian also launched its Long Term Support LTS project since Debian Debian Squeeze For each Debian release it will receive two years of extra security updates provided by LTS Team after its End Of Life EOL However no point releases will be made Now each Debian release can receive years of security support in total br br br Security br The Debian project handles security through public disclosure Debian security advisories are compatible with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary are usually coordinated with other free software vendors and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public There used to be a security audit project that focused on packages in the stable release looking for security bugs Steve Kemp who started the project retired in but resumed his activities and applied to rejoin in br The stable branch is supported by the Debian security team oldstable is supported for one year Although Squeeze is not officially supported Debian is coordinating an effort to provide long term support LTS until February five years after the initial release but only for the IA and x platforms Testing is supported by the testing security team but does not receive updates in as timely a manner as stable Unstable s security is left for the package maintainers br The Debian project offers documentation and tools to harden a Debian installation both manually and automatically AppArmor support is available and enabled by default since Buster Debian provides an optional hardening wrapper and does not harden all of its software by default using gcc features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection unlike operating systems such as OpenBSD but tries to build as many packages as possible with hardening flags br In May a Debian developer discovered that the OpenSSL package distributed with Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu made a variety of security keys vulnerable to a random number generator attack since only different keys were generated The security weakness was caused by changes made in by another Debian developer in response to memory debugger warnings The complete resolution procedure was cumbersome because patching the security hole was not enough it involved regenerating all affected keys and certificates br br br Value br The cost of developing all of the packages included in Debian Lenny million lines of code has been estimated to be about US billion using one method based on the COCOMO model As of May Black Duck Open Hub estimated that the current codebase million lines of code would cost about US billion to develop using a different method based on the same model br br br Forks and derivatives br A large number of forks and derivatives have been built upon Debian over the years Among the more notable are Ubuntu developed by Canonical Ltd and first released in which has surpassed Debian in popularity with desktop users Knoppix first released in the year and one of the first distributions optimized to boot from external storage and Devuan which gained attention in when it forked in disagreement over Debian s adoption of the systemd software suite and has been mirroring Debian releases since The Linux Mint Debian Edition LMDE uses Debian Stable as the software source base since br br br Derivatives and flavors br br Debian is one of the most popular Linux distributions and many other distributions have been created from the Debian codebase As of DistroWatch lists active Debian derivatives The Debian project provides its derivatives with guidelines for best practices and encourages derivatives to merge their work back into Debian br Debian Pure Blends are subsets of a Debian release configured out of the box for users with particular skills and interests For example Debian Jr is made for children while Debian Science is for researchers and scientists The complete Debian distribution includes all available Debian Pure Blends Debian Blend without Pure is a term for a Debian based distribution that strives to become part of mainstream Debian and have its extra features included in future releases br br br Debian GNU Hurd br br Debian GNU Hurd is a flavor based on the Hurd kernel which in turn runs on the GNU Mach microkernel instead of the Linux kernel Debian GNU Hurd has been in development since and made a formal release in May with of the software packaged for Debian GNU Linux ported to the GNU Hurd Hurd is not yet an official Debian release and is maintained and developed as an unofficial port Debian GNU Hurd is distributed as an installer CD running the official Debian installer or ready to run virtual disk image Live CD Live USB The CD uses the IA architecture making it compatible with IA and x PCs The current version of Debian GNU Hurd is published in June br br br Debian GNU kFreeBSD br br Debian GNU kFreeBSD is a discontinued Debian flavor It used the FreeBSD kernel and GNU userland The majority of software in Debian GNU kFreeBSD was built from the same sources as Debian with some kernel packages from FreeBSD The k in kFreeBSD is an abbreviation for kernel which refers to the FreeBSD kernel Before discontinuing the project Debian maintained i and amd ports The last version of Debian kFreeBSD was Debian Jessie RC Debian GNU kFreeBSD was created in It was included in Debian Squeeze as a technology preview and in Debian Wheezy as an official port Debian GNU kFreeBSD was discontinued as an officially supported platform as of Debian Debian developers cited OSS pf jails NDIS and ZFS as reasons for being interested in the FreeBSD kernel It has not been updated since Debian From July the operating system continues to be maintained unofficially As of July the development of Debian GNU kFreeBSD has officially terminated due to the lack of interest and developers br br br See also br br Armbian br CalyxOS br Comparison of Linux distributions br Comparison of mobile operating systems br Debian version history br List of
