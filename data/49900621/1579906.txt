Xinuos OpenServer previously SCO UNIX and SCO Open Desktop SCO ODT is a closed source computer operating system developed by Santa Cruz Operation SCO later acquired by SCO Group and now owned by Xinuos Early versions of OpenServer were based on UNIX System V while the later OpenServer is based on FreeBSD However OpenServer has not received any updates since and is no longer marketed on Xinuos s website while OpenServer Definitive and Definitive are still supported br br br History br br br SCO UNIX SCO Open Desktop br SCO UNIX was the successor to the Santa Cruz Operation s variant of Microsoft Xenix derived from UNIX System V Release with an infusion of Xenix device drivers and utilities SCO UNIX System V Release was released in as the commercial successor to SCO Xenix The base operating system did not include TCP IP networking or X Window System graphics these were available as optional extra cost add on packages Shortly after the release of this bare OS SCO shipped an integrated product under the name of SCO Open Desktop or ODT saw the release of SCO MPX an add on SMP package br At the same time AT T completed its merge of Xenix BSD SunOS and UNIX System V Release features into UNIX System V Release SCO UNIX remained based on System V Release but eventually added home grown versions of most of the features of Release br The releases of SCO UNIX v and Open Desktop added support for long file names and symbolic links The next major version OpenServer Release released in added support for ELF executables and dynamically linked shared objects and made many kernel structures dynamic br br br SCO OpenServer br SCO OpenServer released in would become SCO s primary product and serve as the basis for products like PizzaNet the first Internet based food delivery system done in partnership with Pizza Hut and SCO Global Access an Internet gateway server based on Open Desktop Lite Due to its large installed base SCO OpenServer continues to be actively maintained by SCO with major updates having occurred as recently as September br SCO OpenServer based on the merging of AT T UNIX System V Release MP and UnixWare was initially released by The SCO Group in It includes support for large files increased memory and multi threaded kernel light weight processes This merged codebase is referred to as UNIX System V Release SVR and was used only by SCO for OpenServer SVR is not used by any other major developer or reseller SCO OpenServer contains the UnixWare s SVR kernel integrated with SCO OpenServer application and binary compatibility OpenServer system administration and OpenServer user environments br SCO OpenServer has primarily been sold into the small and medium business SMB market It is widely used in small offices point of sale POS systems replicated sites and backoffice database server deployments Prominent larger SCO OpenServer customers include McDonald s Taco Bell Big O Tires Pizza Hut Costco pharmacy NASDAQ The Toronto Stock Exchange Banco do Brasil many banks in Russia and China and the railway system of India br br br UnixWare merger br br SCO purchased the right to distribute the UnixWare system and its System V Release code base from Novell in SCO was eventually able to re use some code from that version of UnixWare in later releases of OpenServer Until Release this came primarily in the compilation system and the UDI driver framework and the USB subsystem written to it br By the end of the s there were around value added resellers VARs around the world who provided solutions for customers of SCO s Unix systems br SCO announced on August that it would sell its Server Software and Services Divisions as well as UnixWare and OpenServer technologies to Caldera Systems Inc The purchase was completed in May The remaining part of the SCO company the Tarantella Division changed its name to Tarantella Inc while Caldera Systems became Caldera International and subsequently in the SCO Group br br br Under The SCO Group br br The SCO Group continued the development and maintenance of OpenServer On June OpenServer was released codenamed Legend the first release in the new x branch SCO OpenServer is based on the UNIX System V Release kernel a merged codebase of UNIX System V Release MP and UnixWare OpenServer features multi threading application support for C C and Java applications through the POSIX interface OpenServer features kernel level threading not found in x br Some improvements over OpenServer include improved SMP support support for up to processors support for files over a terabyte on a partition larger network files supported through NFSv better file system performance and support for up to GB of memory br OpenServer maintains backward compatibility for applications developed for Xenix onwards br The SCO Group went bankrupt in after a long series of legal battles br br br UnXis Xinuos present br The rights to OpenServer as well as UnixWare were acquired by UnXis in which was later renamed Xinuos br In June Xinuos announced OpenServer which is based on the FreeBSD operating system Simultaneously Xinuos introduced a migration path for existing customers using older OS products In December Xinuos released definitive versions of OpenServer OpenServer and UnixWare br In December Xinuos released Definitive versions of OpenServer and UnixWare and in October OpenServer Definitive was released The Definitive releases were a commitment by Xinuos to keep the legacy OS s updated and supported protecting the applications that customers need to continue to run The Definitive products contain major updates over the Definitive releases and a soon to be announced updated development kit which will make it easier to compile current packages for the Definitive products br However by OpenServer was no longer listed as a product on Xinuos home page implying that it had been withdrawn from marketing br br br Versions br br br See also br Santa Cruz Operation
