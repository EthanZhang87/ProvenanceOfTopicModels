TOS The Operating System is the operating system of the Atari ST range of computers This range includes the ST and ST their STF M FM and STE variants and the Mega ST STE Later bit machines TT Falcon were developed using a new version of TOS called MultiTOS which allowed multitasking More recently users have further developed TOS into FreeMiNT br br br Details br Atari TOS The Operating System debuted with the Atari ST in TOS combines Digital Research s GEM GUI running on top of the DOS like GEMDOS Features include a flat memory model DOS compatible disk format starting with TOS support for MIDI and a variant of SCSI called ACSI in later versions Atari s TOS is usually run from ROM chips contained in the computer Thus before local hard drives were available in home computers it was an almost instant running OS TOS booted off floppy disks in the very first STs but only about half a year after the ST was introduced all ST models started shipping with the latest version of TOS in ROM br TOS consisted of the following br br Desktop The main interface loaded after bootup br GEM Graphics Environment Manager licensed from Digital Research br AES Application Environment Services br VDI Virtual Device Interface screen drivers only other drivers loaded using GDOS br GEMDOS GEM Disk Operating System br BIOS Basic Input Output System br XBIOS Extended BIOS br Line A Low level high speed graphics calls Obsolete from TOS onwards br The following were extensions to TOS loaded separately br br GDOS Graphics Device Operating System br AHDI Atari Hard Disk Interface hard disk driver br True multitasking was not directly supported but TOS allowed up to six Desk accessories to be loaded into the system MultiTOS was developed to allow TOS to preemptively multitask br br br Desktop br br The TOS desktop uses icons to represent files and devices windows and dialog boxes to display info The desktop file DESKTOP INF was read to determine window settings icon placements and drive icons otherwise the standard default desktop of two floppy icons and the trash icon was used br Later versions use NEWDESK INF for saving and reading the desktop configuration br Executable files are identified by their extensions br br ACC Desktop accessory Automatically loaded br APP Application rarely encountered br PRG Executable program Can be GEM programs br TOS TOS program that doesn t use GEM i e similar to a PC s EXE or COM running in a CLI mode box The desktop clears the screen turns on the text cursor and hides the mouse pointer br TTP TOS takes parameters This opens a dialog box where arguments can be added for the program It converts characters to uppercase br GTP GEM takes parameters This opens a dialog box where arguments can be added for the program It converts characters to uppercase br TOS programs but not GEM programs can auto boot by placing them in a folder named AUTO TOS allows GEM programs to be set to load automatically from the Install Application dialog Programs with TTP extensions and environments can not be used for auto boot Desktop accessories were placed in the root directory of the default drive and loaded automatically br br br File system br Atari TOS is based on GEMDOS which uses a modified FAT or on hard disks FAT file system The major differences are the fact that the boot sector does not need to contain the IBM compatible jump sequence at the beginning typically xE x x or xEB x x the lack before TOS of an OEM identifier compatible with PC based systems and the fact that a checksum is used to mark the boot sector as executable the PC format uses the signature word x xAA instead Executable boot sectors for the Atari platform typically start with an MC K jump opcode e g x C and the last two byte word must sum with the rest of the boot sector in big endian word form to x in order to be bootable br Unlike MS DOS GEMDOS would typically allow disks with unusual sector and track counts so disks with or even sectors per track and over formatted tracks were not uncommon in the Atari community Typically a safe combination such as sectors per track by tracks was used yielding an unformatted capacity of KB but many users pushed the capacity of their double density disks beyond KB using custom formats br GEMDOS disc file systems can be read using DOS or Windows x br br br Versions br br br TOS br br ROM TOS

installer br br br TOS br TT TOS Primarily for TT support only Supports fast TT RAM special TT screen resolutions etc ST hardware compatible Line A API dropped for extended TT functionality forcing programmers to use GEM compliant VDI calls etc and thus encouraging GEM compatible as opposed to ST compatible development br Format chip ROMs KB br br br TOS br br KB Update for Falcon machines only only Adds support for DSP MHz blitter and video overlay New v AES last single tasking version but MiNT MultiTOS multitasking aware supports pop up menus D window and dialog objects later modified to

international localisation configuration V was the last official Atari version of TOS br KB Developed and released by Milan Computersysteme for the Milan a TOS GEM computer br x Never officially released though prototypes were leaked and subsequently shared br TOS was a version of MultiTOS the multitasking version of TOS in a format IMG designed to be written to a ROM chip br TOS ROM contains five user selectable language versions br br br EmuTOS br br EmuTOS is a replacement for TOS the operating system of the Atari ST and its successors released as a free software It runs on Atari and Amiga hardware and various emulators Its compatibility with computer video games for Atari ST is limited br br br See also br br Row of bombs a system used by TOS to display error messages as one or
