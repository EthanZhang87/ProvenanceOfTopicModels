A software calculator is a calculator that has been implemented as a computer program rather than as a physical hardware device br They are among the simpler interactive software tools and as such they provide operations for the user to select one at a time They can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence of steps each of which applies one of these operations and have no purpose other than these processes because the operations are the sole or at least the primary features of the calculator rather than being secondary features that support other functionality that is not normally known simply as calculation br As a calculator rather than a computer they usually have a small set of relatively simple operations perform short processes that are not compute intensive and do not accept large amounts of input data or produce many results though many software calculators can emulate handheld scientific calculator and graphing calculator features such as trigonometric functions approximations of pi and making plots of functions br br br Platforms br br Software calculators are available for many different platforms and they can be br br A program for or included with an operating system br A program implemented as server or client side scripting such as JavaScript within a web page br Embedded in a calculator watch br Also complex software may have calculator like dialogs sometimes with the full calculator functionality to enter data into the system br br br History br br br Early years br Computers as we know them today first emerged in the s and s The software that they ran was naturally used to perform calculations but it was specially designed for a substantial application that was not limited to simple calculations For example the LEO computer was designed to run business application software such as payroll br Software specifically to perform calculations as its main purpose was first written in the s and the first software package for general calculations to obtain widespread use was released in This was VisiCalc and it was called an interactive visible calculator but it was actually a spreadsheet and these are now not normally known simply as calculators br The Unix version released in V Unix contained a command line accessible calculator br br br Simulation of hardware calculators br Calculators have been used since ancient times and until the advent of software they were physical hardware machines The most recent hardware calculators are electronic hand held devices with buttons for digits and operations and a small display for inputs and results br The first software calculators imitated these hardware calculators by implementing the same functionality with mouse operated rather than finger operated buttons Such software calculators first emerged in the s as part of the original Macintosh operating system System and the Windows operating system Windows br Some software calculators directly simulate one of the hardware calculators by presenting an image that looks like the calculator and by providing the same functionality br br br Software calculators on the Internet br br There is now a very wide range of software calculators and searching the Internet produces very large numbers of programs that are called calculators br The results include numerical calculators that apply arithmetic operations or mathematical functions to numbers and that produce numerical results or graphs of numerical functions plus some non numerical tools and games that are also called calculators br Many of the results are calculators that do not imitate or simulate hardware calculators but that take advantage of the greater power of computer software to implement alternative types of calculators Software calculators are provided on the Internet which are customizable to use any conceivable algebraic expression These user customizable software calculators can also be used in conjunction with formula or equation creation capabilities so that the software calculator can now be created to perform all possible mathematical functions No longer limited to a set of trigonometric and simple algebraic expressions versions of the software calculator are now tailored to any and all topical applications br br br Examples br br br Numerical calculators br br Every type of hardware calculator has been implemented in software including conversion financial graphing programmable and scientific calculators br Other numerical calculators that do not imitate traditional hardware calculators include br br Formula calculators br Window based calculators Window based calculators present a dialog box that allows users to enter data rather than data and operations and they have a built in formula that is automatically applied to this data There are many examples of such calculators in finance mathematics science and other disciplines br Specialised calculators There are software calculators that contain operations relevant to a specific application area and profession including automotive construction and electrical engineering br br br Non numerical calculators br Not all software based calculators take numerical data or algebraic expressions as their input Calculators can also take in arbitrary information ranging from lifestyle information to scientific notation Some examples of these types of software calculators include br br Love calculator The input is two names and there is a button to work out the compatibility as a percentage of two people with these names br Formula weight calculator The input is a chemical molecular formula using the periodic table symbols and notation and there is a button to work out the percentages of its constituents br Astronomical calculator The input is a date and one or multiple celestial bodies usually the sun moon planets planetoids or comets The program calculates the position of these bodies to the given date and gives a numerical output of the position usually in right ascension and declination whereby the used equinox may be settable sometimes also from brightness angle diameter and phase Some programs can generate a list of astronomical events of certain types during a period of time e g a year Astronomical calculators can be also a part of a simulation software displaying the sky at a certain time br br br Games br There are also types of software used to help solve games that are sometimes referred to as calculators including br br Sudoku calculators The input is a Sudoku puzzle the operations support solving the puzzle such as selecting a digit as the solution for a cell and the result is a solution of the entire puzzle br Poker calculators A common feature of these is to calculate the odds of winning with a given Poker hand br br br Related software packages br There are many interactive software packages that provide user accessible calculation features but that are not normally called calculators because the calculation features play only a supporting role rather than being an end in themselves These include br br Spreadsheets where user supplied calculations can define a cell s content br Computer algebra systems which can manipulate mathematical expressions including evaluating simple calculations br Databases where user supplied calculations can specify a field s value br Spreadsheets br Spreadsheets are not normally called calculators because their main purpose is to organise data in rows and columns and to automatically update the values of possibly many dependent cells when the value in another cell changes The calculation features are only used in a supporting role to specify the values in some cells br Computer algebra systems br Computer algebra systems are not normally called calculators because their main purpose is to perform symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions that can contain variables and complex operations such as integration However the expressions can be basic calculations that do not use variables and that are simply evaluated as with a calculator br Databases br Databases are not normally called calculators because their main purpose is data entry and storage plus reporting against this data The calculation features are only used in a supporting role to specify the values in some fields br br br See also br Comparison of software calculators br Calculator br Calculator input methods br Formula calculator br Graphing calculator br Programmable calculator br Scientific
