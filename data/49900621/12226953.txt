The SPIN operating system is a research project implemented in the computer programming language Modula and is an open source project It is designed with three goals flexibility safety and performance SPIN was developed at the University of Washington br The kernel can be extended by dynamic loading of modules which implement interfaces that represent domains These domains are defined by Modula INTERFACE All kernel extensions are written in Modula safe subset with metalanguage constructs and type safe casting system The system also issued a special run time extension compiler br One set of kernel extensions provides an application programming interface API that emulates the Digital UNIX system call interface This allows Unix applications to run on SPIN br br br br br br External links br Official website
