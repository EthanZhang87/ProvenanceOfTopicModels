NetSurf is an open source web browser which uses its own layout engine Its design goal is to be lightweight and portable NetSurf provides features including tabbed browsing bookmarks and page thumbnailing br The NetSurf project was started in April in response to a discussion of the deficiencies of the RISC OS platform s existing web browsers Shortly after the project s inception development versions for RISC OS users were made available for download by the project s automated build system NetSurf was voted Best non commercial software four times in Drobe Launchpad s annual RISC OS awards between and br NetSurf supports both mainstream systems e g macOS and Unix like and older or uncommon platforms e g AmigaOS Haiku Atari TOS RISC OS and Redox br The browser was ranked in as number in an article highlighting browsers for Linux published in TechRepublic and ZDNet In it was referred to as a CLI browser superior to w m br br br Features br NetSurf s multi platform core is written in ANSI C and implements most of the HTML and CSS specifications using its own bespoke layout engine As of version NetSurf uses Hubbub an HTML parser that follows the HTML specification As well as rendering GIF JPEG PNG and BMP images the browser also supports formats native to RISC OS including Sprite Draw and ArtWorks files br It was suggested by developer John Mark Bell in that support for JavaScript could be added This feature did not make it into NetSurf v back in nor into NetSurf v of but as of December there are some NetSurf preview builds available which contain early stage JavaScript support later much improved On April NetSurf was released br br br History br br NetSurf began in April as a web browser for the RISC OS platform Work on a GTK port began in June to aid development and debugging It has since gained many of the user interface features present in the RISC OS version The browser is packaged with several distributions including Ubuntu NetBSD and OpenBSD br After five years of development the first stable version of the browser was released on May to coincide with the Wakefield RISC OS show Version was made available for download from the project s web site and the software was sold on CD at the show After the release of NetSurf there were two point releases which largely comprised bug fixes NetSurf was released in August and in March the NetSurf release was made available br NetSurf participated in Google Summer of Code in as a mentoring organisation running four projects These included improving the GTK front end adding paginated PDF export support and developing the project s HTML compliant parsing library Hubbub All NetSurf development builds since August have used Hubbub to parse HTML and it is available for use in other projects under the MIT license br NetSurf was again accepted as a mentoring organisation into Google Summer of Code The projects they ran included the development of LibDOM the project s Document Object Model and improvement of NetSurf s user interface The interface work included moving previously RISC OS only functionality to the multi platform core including bookmarks global history cookie management and page search features A port to the Windows operating system was also started In the NetSurf project did not apply to participate in Google Summer of Code due to the developers having other commitments br br NetSurf was released in April for RISC OS Linux and other Unix like platforms BeOS Haiku and AmigaOS This was the first version to use the project s HTML parsing library Hubbub br In May a maintenance release NetSurf was issued to users It incorporated bug fixes and some improvements to page layout br NetSurf was released in April This was the first release to use the project s library for CSS parsing and selection LibCSS and a new internal cache for fetched content br September saw the release of NetSurf which included a number of fixes and improvements br NetSurf was released in April and added treeview support for features including bookmarking called the Hotlist manager in NetSurf history management and cookie management It was also the first version to be released for Mac OS X br In September NetSurf was released It added support for frames and iframes in the browser s core rendering engine making them available to all front ends The release also included support for MIME type sniffing and improved the performance of loading the images used by a web page br In April NetSurf was released The most significant changes were new multi tasking behaviour optimised URL handling fetcher optimisations cache optimisations and faster CSS selection br In April NetSurf was released The biggest difference was the use of the new Document Object Model library LibDOM This new library is a foundation that paves the way for NetSurf developers to implement a fully dynamic layout engine in the future Other improvements in NetSurf include completely new textarea support ability to fetch and parse CSS in parallel with HTML documents extensive behind the scenes refactoring and a host of smaller changes and fixes br In April NetSurf was released containing many improvements over the previous release The highlights include much faster CSS selection performance faster start up time new look and feel to the treeviews hotlist bookmarks global history and cookie manager improved options handling undo redo support in textareas and general improvement of forms Also included are many other additions optimisations and bug fixes br In July NetSurf was released with support for CSS Media Queries level and improvements to JavaScript handling br In May NetSurf was released with improvements in scaling on the RISC OS version The release also added some HTML updates and updated Duktape to The update also had an overhaul of the GTK version and better authentication handling br In December of NetSurf was released with CSS flex support br br br Ports br br A native BeOS Haiku port has been developed Since the GTK version was built for AmigaOS using Cygnix which provides an X environment a native AmigaOS port has also been developed In January NetSurf was made available on MorphOS an operating system that is API compatible with AmigaOS A Windows port is also available for download br A framebuffer port was created in September Unlike the other ports it does not use any GUI toolkit but instead renders its own mouse pointer scrollbars and other widgets The framebuffer frontend has been used to create a web kiosk on embedded systems br The Plan port is also based on it br In January the NetSurf Developers announced the release of what they expected at the time to be the last release for RISC OS Lead developer John Mark Bell said at the time Realistically the people qualified to maintain the RISC OS port are up to their necks in other stuff Subsequently Steve Fryatt volunteered himself as maintainer br January saw the announcement of a Mac OS X port A port to Atari bit and bit computers was also started in January br An unofficial Nintendo DS port of NetSurf has been developed that includes TLS support br br br
