A Unix architecture is a computer operating system system architecture that embodies the Unix philosophy It may adhere to standards such as the Single UNIX Specification SUS or similar POSIX IEEE standard No single published standard describes all Unix architecture computer operating systems this is in part a legacy of the Unix wars br br br Description br There are many systems which are Unix like in their architecture Notable among these are the Linux distributions The distinctions between Unix and Unix like systems have been the subject of heated legal battles and the holders of the UNIX brand The Open Group object to Unix like and similar terms br For distinctions between SUS branded UNIX architectures and other similar architectures see Unix like br br br Kernel br A Unix kernel the core or key components of the operating system consists of many kernel subsystems like process management scheduling file management device management network management memory management and dealing with interrupts from hardware devices br Each of the subsystems has some features br br Concurrency As Unix is a multiprocessing OS many processes run concurrently to improve the performance of the system br Virtual memory VM Memory management subsystem implements the virtual memory concept and users need not worry about the executable program size and the RAM size br Paging It is a technique to minimize the internal as well as the external fragmentation in the physical memory br Virtual file system VFS A VFS is a file system used to help the user to hide the different file systems complexities A user can use the same standard file system related calls to access different file systems br The kernel provides these and other basic services interrupt and trap handling separation between user and system space system calls scheduling timer and clock handling file descriptor management br br br Features br Some key features of the Unix architecture concept are br br Unix systems use a centralized operating system kernel which manages system and process activities br All non kernel software is organized into separate kernel managed processes br Unix systems are preemptively multitasking multiple processes can run at the same time or within small time slices and nearly at the same time and any process can be interrupted and moved out of execution by the kernel This is known as thread management br Files are stored on disk in a hierarchical file system with a single top location throughout the system root or with both files and directories subdirectories sub subdirectories and so on below it br With few exceptions devices and some types of communications between processes are managed and visible as files or pseudo files within the file system hierarchy This is known as everything is a file However Linus Torvalds states that this is inaccurate and may be better rephrased as everything is a stream of bytes br The UNIX operating system supports the following features and capabilities br br Multitasking and multiuser br Programming interface br Use of files as abstractions of devices and other objects br Built in networking TCP IP is standard br Persistent system service processes called daemons and managed by init or inet br br br Criticism br The UNIX HATERS Handbook covers some of these design features as failures from the user point of view However although some information is quite dated and cannot be applied to modern Unixes or Unix like operating systems such as Linux Eric S Raymond discovered that several issues are still prevailing while others were resolved Raymond concludes that not all concepts behind Unix can be deemed as non functional even though the book s intention may have been to portray Unix as inferior without encouraging discussions with developers to actually fix the issues br br br See also br Architecture of Windows NT br br br
