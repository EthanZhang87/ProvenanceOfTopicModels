Coherent is a clone of the Unix operating system for IBM PC compatibles and other microcomputers developed and sold by the now defunct Mark Williams Company MWC Historically the operating system was a proprietary product but it became open source in released under the BSD Clause license br br br Development br Coherent was not Unix the Mark Williams Company had no rights to either the Unix trademark or the AT T Bell Labs source code In the early years of its existence MWC received a visit from an AT T delegation looking to determine whether MWC was infringing on AT T Unix property The delegation included Dennis Ritchie who concluded that it was very hard to believe that Coherent and its basic applications were not created without considerable study of the OS code and details of its applications However he also stated that br br looking at various corners for peculiarities bugs etc that I knew about in the Unix distributions of the time I couldn t find anything that was copied It might have been that some parts were written with AT T source nearby but at least the effort had been made to rewrite If it came to it I could never honestly testify that what they generated was irreproducible from the manual br Much of the operating system was written by alumni from the University of Waterloo Tom Duff Dave Conroy Randall Howard Johann George and Trevor John Thompson Significant contributions were also made by people such as Nigel Bree from Auckland New Zealand the later author of Ghost br br br Versions br Coherent was originally written for the PDP range of minicomputers in then ported to various early s microcomputer systems including IBM PC compatibles and machines based on the Zilog Z and Motorola Initially sold to OEMs starting it was available on the consumer market from MWC directly At this point Coherent offered roughly the functionality of Version Unix on PC hardware including the nroff formatter but not the BSD extensions offered by competing Unix clone vendors compared to its competitors it was a small system distributed on only seven double sided floppy disks costing only US for a license br BYTE in called Coherent a highly compatible UNIX Version lookalike In it criticized the difficulty of installation but stated that as a UNIX clone Coherent is amazingly complete it should be easy to port programs the price of is a bargain Early s reviews of Coherent pointed out that the system was much smaller than other contemporary Unix offerings as well as less expensive at US but lacking in functionality and software support PC Magazine called Coherent a time capsule that captured the state of Unix in the late s without support for mice LANs or SCSI disks good for learning basic Unix programming but not for business automation A review in the AUUG s newsletter was more positive favorably comparing Coherent to MKS Toolkit Minix and Xenix and suggesting it might fill a niche as a low end training platform br Coherent was able to run on most Intel based PCs with Intel and processors Coherent version for Intel based PCs required at least a Coherent version for Intel based PCs required at least a Like a true Unix Coherent was able to multitask and support multiple users From version released Coherent also had support for X and MGR windowing systems br Later versions of Coherent version and higher supported features common in modern Unix like systems including a version of MicroEMACS access to FAT file systems an optimizing C compiler and a modified version of Taylor UUCP The final releases of Coherent also fully supported the iBCS COFF binary standard which allowed binary compatibility with SCO Unix applications including WordPerfect Lotus and several Microsoft applications including QuickBASIC Microsoft Word and MultiPlan The last versions supported virtual memory but not demand paging br A Zilog Z port of Coherent was also used by the canceled Commodore system br In NCSC a subsidiary of Nixdorf announced a port of Coherent to IBM mainframes in the form of a Unix compatibility subsystem for IBM s DOS VS and DOS VSE and Nixdorf s Edos VS and Edos VSE operating systems known as Programmer Work Station VSE Advanced Functions or PWS VSE AF for short br The Mark Williams Company closed in br On January Coherent sources were released under the BSD Clause license br br br See also br PC IX br Venix br br br br br br External links br br Andrzej Popielewicz s GNU stuff for Coherent website br Coherent history archive br Installation Media for Coherent br Coherent image for qemu br Mark Williams Company Sources br Virtualbox Qemu and PCem VM s with Coherent x x DDK X sources
