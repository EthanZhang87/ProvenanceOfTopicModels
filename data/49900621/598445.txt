id: 598445
Unix System V pronounced System Five is one of the first commercial versions of the Unix operating system It was originally developed by AT T and first released in Four major versions of System V were released numbered and System V Release SVR was commercially the most successful version being the result of an effort marketed as Unix System Unification which solicited the collaboration of the major Unix vendors It was the source of several common commercial Unix features System V is sometimes abbreviated to SysV br As of the AT T derived Unix market is divided between four System V variants IBM s AIX Hewlett Packard Enterprise s HP UX and Oracle s Solaris plus the free software illumos forked from OpenSolaris br br br Overview br br br Introduction br br System V was the successor to s UNIX System III While AT T developed and sold hardware that ran System V most customers ran a version from a reseller based on AT T s reference implementation A standards document called the System V Interface Definition outlined the default features and behavior of implementations br br br AT T support br During the formative years of AT T s computer business the division went through several phases of System V software groups beginning with the Unix Support Group USG followed by Unix System Development Laboratory USDL followed by AT T Information Systems ATTIS and finally Unix System Laboratories USL br br br Rivalry with BSD br br In the s and early s UNIX System V and the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD were the two major versions of UNIX Historically BSD was also commonly called BSD Unix or Berkeley Unix Eric S Raymond summarizes the longstanding relationship and rivalry between System V and BSD during the early period br br In fact for years after divestiture the Unix community was preoccupied with the first phase of the Unix wars an internal dispute the rivalry between System V Unix and BSD Unix The dispute had several levels some technical sockets vs streams BSD tty vs System V termio and some cultural The divide was roughly between longhairs and shorthairs programmers and technical people tended to line up with Berkeley and BSD more business oriented types with AT T and System V br While HP IBM and others chose System V as the basis for their Unix offerings other vendors such as Sun Microsystems and DEC extended BSD Throughout its development though System V was infused with features from BSD while BSD variants such as DEC s Ultrix received System V features AT T and Sun Microsystems worked together to merge System V with BSD based SunOS to produce Solaris one of the primary System V descendants still in use today Since the early s due to standardization efforts such as POSIX and the success of Linux the division between System V and BSD has become less important br br br Releases br br br SVR br System V known inside Bell Labs as Unix succeeded AT T s previous commercial Unix called System III in January br Unix was never released externally which would have been designated as System IV br This first release of System V called System V System V Release or SVR was developed by AT T s UNIX Support Group USG and based on the Bell Labs internal USG UNIX br System V also included features such as the vi editor and curses from BSD developed at the University of California Berkeley it also improved performance by adding buffer and inode caches It also added support for inter process communication using messages semaphores and shared memory developed earlier for the Bell internal CB UNIX br SVR ran on DEC PDP and VAX minicomputers br br br SVR br br AT T s UNIX Support Group USG transformed into the UNIX System Development Laboratory USDL which released System V Release in SVR added shell functions and the SVID SVR added demand paging copy on write shared memory and record and file locking br The concept of the porting base was formalized and the DEC VAX was chosen for this release The porting base is the so called original version of a release from which all porting efforts for other machines emanate br Educational source licenses for SVR were offered by AT T for US for the first CPU and for each additional CPU A commercial source license was offered for with three months of support and a price per additional CPU br Apple Computer s A UX operating system was initially based on this release SCO XENIX also used SVR as its basis The first release of HP UX was also an SVR derivative br Maurice J Bach s book The Design of the UNIX Operating System is the definitive description of the SVR kernel br br br SVR br br AT T s UNIX System Development Laboratory USDL was succeeded by AT T Information Systems ATTIS which distributed UNIX System V Release in SVR included STREAMS Remote File Sharing RFS the File System Switch FSS virtual file system mechanism a restricted form of shared libraries and the Transport Layer Interface TLI network API The final version was Release in which added binary compatibility to Xenix on Intel platforms see Intel Binary Compatibility Standard br User interface improvements included the layers windowing system for the DMD graphics terminal and the SVR curses libraries that offered eight or more color pairs and other at this time important features forms panels menus etc The AT T B became the official porting base br SCO UNIX was based upon SVR as was ISC ix Among the more obscure distributions of SVR for the were ESIX by Everex and System V Release sold by Intel themselves these two shipped plain vanilla AT T s codebase br IBM s AIX operating system is an SVR derivative br br br SVR br br System V Release was announced on October and was incorporated into a variety of commercial Unix products from early onwards A joint project of AT T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems it combined technology from br br SVR br BSD br Xenix br SunOS br New features included br br From BSD br TCP IP support br Sockets br UFS br Support for multiple groups br C shell br From SunOS br Virtual file system interface replacing File System Switch in System V Release br NFS br New virtual memory system including support for memory mapped files br Improved shared library system based on the SunOS x model br OpenWindows GUI environment br External Data Representation XDR and ONC RPC br From Xenix br x device drivers br Binary compatibility with Xenix in the x version of System V br KornShell br ANSI X J C compatibility br Multi National Language Support MNLS br Better internationalization support br An application binary interface ABI based on Executable and Linkable Format ELF br Support for standards such as POSIX and X Open br Many companies licensed SVR and bundled it with computer systems such as workstations and network servers SVR systems vendors included Atari Atari System V Commodore Amiga Unix Data General DG UX Fujitsu UXP DS Hitachi HI UX Hewlett Packard HP UX NCR Unix NS NEC EWS UX UP UX UX SUPER UX OKI OKI System V Pyramid Technology DC OSx SGI IRIX Siemens SINIX Sony NEWS OS Sumitomo Electric Industries SEIUX and Sun Microsystems Solaris with illumos in the s as the only open source platform br Software porting houses also sold enhanced and supported Intel x versions SVR software vendors included Dell Dell UNIX Everex ESIX Micro Station Technology SVR Microport SVR and UHC SVR br The primary platforms for SVR were Intel x and SPARC the SPARC version called Solaris or internally SunOS x was developed by Sun The relationship between Sun and AT T was terminated after the release of SVR meaning that later versions of Solaris did not inherit features of later SVR x releases Sun would in release most of the source code for Solaris SunOS as the open source OpenSolaris project creating with its forks the only open source albeit heavily modified System V implementation available After Oracle took over Sun Solaris was forked into proprietary release but illumos as the continuation project is being developed in open source br A consortium of Intel based resellers including Unisys ICL NCR Corporation and Olivetti developed SVR MP with multiprocessing capability allowing system calls to be processed from any processor but interrupt servicing only from a master processor br Release ES Enhanced Security added security features required for Orange Book B compliance and Access Control Lists and support for dynamic loading of kernel modules br br br SVR UnixWare br In AT T USL engaged in a joint venture with Novell called Univel That year saw the release System V as Univel UnixWare featuring the Veritas File System Other vendors included UHC and Consensys Release MP completed late added support for multiprocessing and it was released as UnixWare in br Eric S Raymond warned prospective buyers about SVR versions as they often did not include on line man pages In his buyers guide he attributes this change in policy to Unix System Laboratories br br br SVR UnixWare br The Santa Cruz Operation SCO owners of Xenix eventually acquired the UnixWare trademark and the distribution rights to the System V Release codebase from Novell while other vendors Sun IBM HP continued to use and extend System V Release Novell transferred ownership of the Unix trademark to The Open Group br System V Release was developed in by the Santa Cruz Operation SCO as a merger of SCO OpenServer an SVR derivative and UnixWare with a focus on large scale servers It was released as SCO UnixWare SCO s successor The SCO Group also based SCO OpenServer on SVR but the codebase is not used by any other major developer or reseller br br br SVR cancelled br System V Release was announced by SCO to be released by the end of but was apparently cancelled It was supposed to support bit systems SCO also introduced Smallfoot in a low resource embeddable variant of UnixWare for dedicated commercial and industrial applications in an attempt that was perceived as a response to the growing popularity of Linux The industry has since coalesced around The Open Group s Single UNIX Specification version UNIX br br br Market position br br br Availability during the s on x platforms br In the s and s a variety of SVR versions of Unix were available commercially for the x PC platform However the market for commercial Unix on PCs declined after Linux and BSD became widely available In late Eric S Raymond discontinued his PC clone UNIX Software Buyer s Guide on USENET stating The reason I am dropping this is that I run Linux now and I no longer find the SVr market interesting or significant br In a confidential memo at Microsoft stated Linux is on track to eventually own the x UNIX market and further predicted I believe that Linux moreso than NT will be the biggest threat to SCO in the near future br An InfoWorld article from characterized SCO UnixWare as having a bleak outlook due to being trounced in the market by Linux and Solaris and IDC predicted that SCO would continue to see a shrinking share of the market br br br Project Monterey br Project Monterey was started in to combine major features of existing commercial Unix platforms as a joint project of Compaq IBM Intel SCO and Sequent Computer Systems The target platform was meant to be Intel s new IA architecture and Itanium line of processors However the project was abruptly canceled in after little progress br br br System V and the Unix market br By several major Unix variants such as SCO UnixWare Compaq Tru UNIX and SGI IRIX were all in decline The three major Unix versions doing well in the market were IBM AIX Hewlett Packard s HP UX and Sun s Solaris br In when SGI declared bankruptcy analysts questioned whether Linux would replace proprietary Unix altogether In a article written for Computerworld by Mark Hall the economics of Linux were cited as a major factor driving the migration from Unix to Linux br br Linux s success in high end scientific and technical computing like Unix s before it preceded its success in your data center Once Linux proved itself by executing the most complex calculations possible IT managers quickly grasped that it could easily serve Web pages and run payroll Naturally it helps to be lucky Free downloadable Linux s star began to rise during one of the longest downturns in IT history With companies doing more with less one thing they could dump was Unix br The article also cites trends in high performance computing applications as evidence of a dramatic shift from Unix to Linux br br A look at the Top list of supercomputers tells the tale best In Unix machines from Sun and SGI combined for of the fastest computers in the world Linux accounted for one In Sun had or four systems and SGI had while of the Top ran Linux br In a November survey of the top supercomputers Unix was used by only all running IBM AIX while Linux was used by the same survey in November reports of them using Linux br System V derivatives continued to be deployed on some proprietary server platforms The principal variants of System V that remain in commercial use are AIX IBM Solaris Oracle and HP UX HP According to a study done by IDC in the worldwide Unix market was divided between IBM Oracle and HP No other commercial Unix vendor had more than of the market Industry analysts generally characterize proprietary Unix as having entered a period of slow but permanent decline br br br OpenSolaris and illumos distributions br br OpenSolaris and its derivatives are the only SVR descendants that are open source software br Core system software continues to be developed as illumos used in illumos distributions such as SmartOS Omniosce OpenIndiana and others br br br System V compatibility br The System V interprocess communication mechanisms are available in Unix like operating systems not derived from System V in particular in Linux a reimplementation of Unix as well as the BSD derivative FreeBSD POSIX specifies a replacement for these interfaces br FreeBSD maintains a binary compatibility layer for the COFF format which allows FreeBSD to execute binaries compiled for some SVR derivatives such as SCO UNIX and Interactive UNIX Modern System V Linux and BSD platforms use the ELF file format for natively compiled binaries br br br br br br External links br PC clone UNIX Software Buyer s Guide by Eric S Raymond posted to USENET in br Unix
