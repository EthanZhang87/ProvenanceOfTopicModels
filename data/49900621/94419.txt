Gentoo Linux pronounced JEN too is a Linux distribution built using the Portage package management system Unlike a binary software distribution the source code is compiled locally according to the user s preferences and is often optimized for the specific type of computer Precompiled binaries are available for some packages Gentoo runs on a wide variety of processor architectures For the full list see table on the right br Gentoo package management is designed to be modular portable easy to maintain and flexible Gentoo describes itself as a meta distribution because of its adaptability in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to the system and the applications they use br Gentoo Linux is named after the gentoo penguin the fastest swimming species of penguin The name was chosen to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine specific optimization which is a major feature of Gentoo br br br History br Gentoo Linux was initially created by Daniel Robbins as the Enoch Linux distribution The goal was to create a distribution without precompiled binaries that was tuned to the hardware and only included required programs At least one version of Enoch was distributed under that name version in December br Daniel Robbins and the other contributors experimented with a fork of GCC known as EGCS developed by Cygnus Solutions At this point Enoch was renamed Gentoo Linux The modifications to EGCS eventually became part of the official GCC version and other Linux distributions experienced similar speed increases br After problems with a bug on his own system Robbins halted Gentoo development and switched to FreeBSD for several months later saying I decided to add several FreeBSD features to make our autobuild system now called Portage a true next generation ports system br Gentoo Linux was released on March In Robbins set up the non profit Gentoo Foundation transferred all copyrights and trademarks to it and stepped down as chief architect of the project br The current board of trustees is composed of five members who were announced following an election on March There is also a seven member Gentoo Council that oversees the technical issues and policies of Gentoo The Gentoo Council members are elected annually for a period of one year by the active Gentoo developers When a member of the Council retires the successor is voted into place by the existing Council members br The Gentoo Foundation is a domestic non profit corporation registered in the State of New Mexico In late the Foundation s charter was revoked but by May the State of New Mexico declared that the Gentoo Foundation Inc had returned to good standing and was free to do business br The creator of Gentoo Daniel Robbins left the project in and because of conflicts with other developers br br br Features br Gentoo appeals to Linux users who want full control of the software that is installed and running on their computer People who are prepared to invest the time required to configure and tune a Gentoo system can build very efficient desktops and servers Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running including the option to choose between systemd or OpenRC as the default init system Memory usage can also be reduced compared to other distributions by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services br Gentoo s package repositories provide a large collection of software Each package contains details of any dependencies so only the minimum set of packages need to be installed Optional features of individual packages such as whether they require LDAP or Qt support can be selected by the user and any resulting package requirements are automatically included in the set of dependencies br Inasmuch as Gentoo does not have a default look and feel installed packages usually appear as their authors intended br br br Portage br br Portage is Gentoo s software distribution and package management system The original design was based on the ports system used by the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD operating systems The Gentoo repository contains over packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system br A single invocation of portage s emerge command can update the local copy of the Gentoo repository search for a package or download compile and install one or more packages and their dependencies The built in features can be set for individual packages or globally with so called USE flags br Pre compiled binaries are provided for some applications with long build times such as LibreOffice and Mozilla Firefox but users lose the ability to customize optional features There are configuration options to reduce compilation times such as by enabling parallel compilation or using pipes instead of temporary files Package compilation may also be distributed over multiple computers Additionally the user may be able to mount a large filesystem in memory to further speed up the process of building packages Some approaches have drawbacks and are not enabled by default When installing the same package on multiple computers with sufficiently similar hardware the package may be compiled once and a binary package created for quick installation on the other computers br On December th it was announced that Gentoo will offer binary packages for download and direct installation For most architectures this will be limited to the core system and weekly updates For amd and arm however the availability of binary packages reaches over GB br br br Portability br As Gentoo is a source based distribution with a repository describing how to build the packages adding instructions to build on different machine architectures is particularly easy br Originally built on the IA architecture Gentoo has since been ported to many others It is officially supported and considered stable on IA x IA PA RISC bit and bit PowerPC bit SPARC DEC Alpha and both and bit ARM architectures It is also officially supported but considered in development state on MIPS PS Cell Processor System Z s Official support for bit SPARC hardware and SuperH have been dropped br Portability towards other operating systems such as those derived from BSD including macOS is under active development by the Gentoo Alt project The Gentoo FreeBSD project already has a working guide based on FreeSBIE while Gentoo NetBSD Gentoo OpenBSD and Gentoo DragonFly are being developed There is also a project to get Portage working on OpenSolaris There was an unofficial project to create a Gentoo port to GNU Hurd but it has been inactive since br It is also possible to install a Gentoo Prefix provided by a project that maintains alternative installation methods for Gentoo in a Cygwin environment on Windows but this configuration is experimental br br br Installation br Gentoo may be installed in several ways The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage tarball explained below As with many Linux distributions Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment such as another Linux distribution s Live CD Live USB or Network Booting using the Gentoo Alternative Install Guide A normal install requires a connection to the Internet but there is also a guide for a network less install br On April it was announced that there would be a new official image with a GUI called the LiveGUI image This can be installed onto installation media such as a USB drive or a dual layer DVD It includes a large selection of software including the KDE Plasma desktop environment image editors office software system administration and installation tools br Previously Gentoo supported installation from stage and stage tarballs however the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them Stage and stage are meant only for Gentoo developers br Following the initial install steps the Gentoo Linux install process in the Gentoo Handbook describes compiling a new Linux kernel This process is generally not required by other Linux distributions Although this is widely regarded as a complex task Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as Genkernel to simplify the process In addition users may also use an existing kernel known to work on their system by simply copying it to the boot directory or installing one of the provided pre compiled kernel packages and updating their bootloader Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum Reddit and IRC br A Live USB of Gentoo Linux can be created manually by using various tools or with dd as described in the handbook br br br Stages br Before October installation could be started from any of three base stages br br Stage begins with only what is necessary to build a toolchain the various compilers linkers and language libraries necessary to compile other software for the target system compiling this target toolchain from another pre existing host system is known as bootstrapping the target system br Stage begins with a self hosting bootstrapped toolchain for the target system which is then used to compile all other core userland software for the target br Stage begins with a minimal set of compiled user software with which the kernel and any other additional software are then configured and compiled br Since October only the stage installations have been officially supported due to the inherent complexities of bootstrapping from earlier stages which requires resolving and then breaking numerous circular dependencies Tarballs for stage and stage were distributed for some time after this although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook and moved into the Gentoo FAQ As of September only the supported stage tarballs are publicly available stage and stage tarballs are only officially generated and used internally by Gentoo development teams However if so desired a user may still rebuild the toolchain or reinstall the base system software during or after a normal stage installation effectively simulating the old bootstrap process br br br Gentoo Reference Platform br From until the Gentoo Reference Platform GRP was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process to give faster access to a fully functional Gentoo installation These packages included KDE X Window System OpenOffice GNOME and Mozilla Once the installation was complete the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built through Portage that would be built using the user s system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP As of the GRP is discontinued the final reference to it appearing in the handbook br br br Versions br Gentoo follows a rolling release model br Like other Linux distributions Gentoo systems have an etc gentoo release file but this contains the version of the installed sys apps baselayout package br In Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically This continued until when it was announced that the Live CD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages and Minimal CDs On December the first weekly builds were published In a special Live DVD was created to celebrate the Gentoo year anniversary br br br Release media version history br br br Special releases br In a special Live DVD was released to celebrate Gentoo s tenth anniversary Initially planned as a one off the Live DVD was updated to the latest package versions in due to its popularity among new users br br br Profiles br Although Gentoo does not have a concept of versioning the entire system it does make use of profiles which define build configuration for all packages in the system Major changes such as changing the layout of how files are installed across the entire system typically involve a profile upgrade and may require rebuilding all installed software These profiles are versioned based on the year they were released and include several variants for each release targeted towards different types of systems such as servers and desktops Profiles formerly tracked the versioning of install media and switched to two digit year naming after the discontinuation of versioned media The following new profile versions have been released after br br br Hardened Gentoo br Hardened Gentoo is a project designed to develop and designate a set of add ons that are useful when a more security focused installation is required Previously the project included patches to produce a hardened kernel but these were discontinued Other parts of the hardened set such as SELinux and userspace hardening remain br br br Incidents br In June the Gentoo GitHub code repository mirror used mainly by developers was hacked after an attacker gained access to an organization administrator s account via deducing the password Gentoo promptly responded by containing the attack and improving security practices No Gentoo cryptography keys or signed packages were compromised and the repository was restored after five days br br br Logo and mascots br The gentoo penguin is thought to be the fastest underwater swimming penguin The name Gentoo Linux acknowledges both the Linux mascot a penguin called Tux and the project s aim to produce a high performance operating system br The official Gentoo logo is a stylized g resembling a silver magatama Unofficial mascots include Larry The Cow and Znurt the Flying Saucer br br br Derived distributions br br There are a number of independently developed variants of Gentoo Linux including ChromiumOS br br br See also br br Arch Linux br Linux From Scratch br T SDE br br br br br br External links br br Official website
