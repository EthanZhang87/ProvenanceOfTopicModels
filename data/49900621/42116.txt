title: Server (computing)
id: 42116
A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called clients on computer network This architecture is called the client server model Servers can provide various functionalities often called services such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client A single server can serve multiple clients and a single client can use multiple servers A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device Typical servers are database servers file servers mail servers print servers web servers game servers and application servers br Client server systems are usually most frequently implemented by and often identified with the request response model a client sends a request to the server which performs some action and sends a response back to the client typically with a result or acknowledgment Designating a computer as server class hardware implies that it is specialized for running servers on it This often implies that it is more powerful and reliable than standard personal computers but alternatively large computing clusters may be composed of many relatively simple replaceable server components br br br History br The use of the word server in computing comes from queueing theory where it dates to the mid th century being notably used in Kendall along with service the paper that introduced Kendall s notation In earlier papers such as the Erlang more concrete terms such as telephone operators are used br In computing server dates at least to RFC one of the earliest documents describing ARPANET the predecessor of Internet and is contrasted with user distinguishing two types of host server host and user host The use of serving also dates to early documents such as RFC contrasting serving host with using host br The Jargon File defines server in the common sense of a process performing service for requests usually remote with the version reading br br SERVER n A kind of DAEMON which performs a service for the requester which often runs on a computer other than the one on which the server runs The average utilization of a server in the early s was to but with the adoption of virtualization this figure started to increase to reduce the number of servers needed br br br Operation br br Strictly speaking the term server refers to a computer program or process running program Through metonymy it refers to a device used for or a device dedicated to running one or several server programs On a network such a device is called a host In addition to server the words serve and service as verb and as noun respectively are frequently used though servicer and servant are not The word service noun may refer to the abstract form of functionality e g Web service Alternatively it may refer to a computer program that turns a computer into a server e g Windows service Originally used as servers serve users and users use servers in the sense of obey today one often says that servers serve data in the same sense as give For instance web servers serve up web pages to users or service their requests br The server is part of the client server model in this model a server serves data for clients The nature of communication between a client and server is request and response This is in contrast with peer to peer model in which the relationship is on demand reciprocation In principle any computerized process that can be used or called by another process particularly remotely particularly to share a resource is a server and the calling process or processes is a client Thus any general purpose computer connected to a network can host servers For example if files on a device are shared by some process that process is a file server Similarly web server software can run on any capable computer and so a laptop or a personal computer can host a web server br While request response is the most common client server design there are others such as the publish subscribe pattern In the publish subscribe pattern clients register with a pub sub server subscribing to specified types of messages this initial registration may be done by request response Thereafter the pub sub server forwards matching messages to the clients without any further requests the server pushes messages to the client rather than the client pulling messages from the server as in request response br br br Purpose br br The role of a server is to share data as well as to share resources and distribute work A server computer can serve its own computer programs as well depending on the scenario this could be part of a quid pro quo transaction or simply a technical possibility The following table shows several scenarios in which a server is used br br Almost the entire structure of the Internet is based upon a client server model High level root nameservers DNS and routers direct the traffic on the internet There are millions of servers connected to the Internet running continuously throughout the world and virtually every action taken by an ordinary Internet user requires one or more interactions with one or more servers There are exceptions that do not use dedicated servers for example peer to peer file sharing and some implementations of telephony e g pre Microsoft Skype br br br Hardware br br Hardware requirement for servers vary widely depending on the server s purpose and its software Servers often are more powerful and expensive than the clients that connect to them br The name server is used both for the hardware and software pieces For the hardware servers it is usually limited to mean the high end machines although software servers can run on a variety of hardwares br Since servers are usually accessed over a network many run unattended without a computer monitor or input device audio hardware and USB interfaces Many servers do not have a graphical user interface GUI They are configured and managed remotely Remote management can be conducted via various methods including Microsoft Management Console MMC PowerShell SSH and browser based out of band management systems such as Dell s iDRAC or HP s iLo br br br Large servers br Large traditional single servers would need to be run for long periods without interruption Availability would have to be very high making hardware reliability and durability extremely important Mission critical enterprise servers would be very fault tolerant and use specialized hardware with low failure rates in order to maximize uptime Uninterruptible power supplies might be incorporated to guard against power failure Servers typically include hardware redundancy such as dual power supplies RAID disk systems and ECC memory along with extensive pre boot memory testing and verification Critical components might be hot swappable allowing technicians to replace them on the running server without shutting it down and to guard against overheating servers might have more powerful fans or use water cooling They will often be able to be configured powered up and down or rebooted remotely using out of band management typically based on IPMI Server casings are usually flat and wide and designed to be rack mounted either on inch racks or on Open Racks br These types of servers are often housed in dedicated data centers These will normally have very stable power and Internet and increased security Noise is also less of a concern but power consumption and heat output can be a serious issue Server rooms are equipped with air conditioning devices br br br Clusters br br A server farm or server cluster is a collection of computer servers maintained by an organization to supply server functionality far beyond the capability of a single device Modern data centers are now often built of very large clusters of much simpler servers and there is a collaborative effort Open Compute Project around this concept br br br Appliances br A class of small specialist servers called network appliances are generally at the low end of the scale often being smaller than common desktop computers br br br Mobile br A mobile server has a portable form factor e g a laptop In contrast to large data centers or rack servers the mobile server is designed for on the road or ad hoc deployment into emergency disaster or temporary environments where traditional servers are not feasible due to their power requirements size and deployment time The main beneficiaries of so called server on the go technology include network managers software or database developers training centers military personnel law enforcement forensics emergency relief groups and service organizations To facilitate portability features such as the keyboard display battery uninterruptible power supply to provide power redundancy in case of failure and mouse are all integrated into the chassis br br br Operating systems br br On the Internet the dominant operating systems among servers are UNIX like open source distributions such as those based on Linux and FreeBSD with Windows Server also having a significant share Proprietary operating systems such as z OS and macOS Server are also deployed but in much smaller numbers Servers that run Linux are commonly used as Webservers or Databanks Windows Servers are used for Networks that are made out of Windows Clients br Specialist server oriented operating systems have traditionally had features such as br br GUI not available or optional br Ability to reconfigure and update both hardware and software to some extent without restart br Advanced backup facilities to permit regular and frequent online backups of critical data br Transparent data transfer between different volumes or devices br Flexible and advanced networking capabilities br Automation capabilities such as daemons in UNIX and services in Windows br Tight system security with advanced user resource data and memory protection br Advanced detection and alerting on conditions such as overheating processor and disk failure br In practice today many desktop and server operating systems share similar code bases differing mostly in configuration br br br Energy consumption br In data centers servers cooling and other electrical infrastructure were responsible for of electrical energy consumption worldwide and in the United States One estimate is that total energy consumption for information and communications technology saves more than times its carbon footprint in the rest of the economy by increasing efficiency br Global energy consumption is increasing due to the increasing demand of data and bandwidth Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC states that data centers used billion kilowatt hours kWh electrical energy in which accounts to of global electricity usage br Environmental groups have placed focus on the carbon emissions of data centers as it accounts to million metric tons of carbon dioxide in a year br br br See also br Peer to peer br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading
