Windows Calculator is a software calculator developed by Microsoft and included in Windows In its Windows incarnation it has four modes standard scientific programmer and a graphing mode The standard mode includes a number pad and buttons for performing arithmetic operations The scientific mode takes this a step further and adds exponents and trigonometric function and programmer mode allows the user to perform operations related to computer programming In a graphing mode was added to the Calculator allowing users to graph equations on a coordinate plane br The Windows Calculator is one of a few applications that have been bundled in all versions of Windows starting with Windows Since then the calculator has been upgraded with various capabilities br In addition the calculator has also been included with Windows Phone and Xbox One The Microsoft Store page proclaims HoloLens support as of February but the Calculator app is not installed on HoloLens by default br br br History br A simple arithmetic calculator was first included with Windows br In Windows a scientific mode was added which included exponents and roots logarithms factorial based functions trigonometry supports radian degree and gradians angles base conversions logic operations statistical functions such as single variable statistics and linear regression br br br Windows x and Windows NT br Until Windows it uses an IEEE double precision floating point and the highest representable number by the calculator is which is slightly above br In Windows and later it uses an arbitrary precision arithmetic library replacing the standard IEEE floating point library It offers bignum precision for basic operations addition subtraction multiplication division and digits of precision for advanced operations square root transcendental functions The largest value that can be represented on the Windows Calculator is currently and the smallest is Also calculates the gamma function which is defined over all real numbers only excluding the negative integers br br br Windows XP and Vista br In Windows digit grouping is added Degree and base settings are added to menu bar br The calculators of Windows XP and Vista were able to calculate using numbers beyond but calculating with these numbers e g does increasingly slow down the calculator and make it unresponsive until the calculation has been completed br These are the last versions of Windows Calculator where calculating with binary decimal hexadecimal octal numbers is included into scientific mode In Windows they were moved to programmer mode which is a new separate mode that co exists with scientific mode br br br Windows br In Windows separate programmer statistics unit conversion date calculation and worksheets modes were added Tooltips were removed Furthermore Calculator s interface was revamped for the first time since its introduction The base conversion functions were moved to the programmer mode and statistics functions were moved to the statistics mode Switching between modes does not preserve the current number clearing it to br The highest number is now limited to again br In every mode except programmer mode one can see the history of calculations The app was redesigned to accommodate multi touch Standard mode behaves as a simple checkbook calculator entering the sequence gives the answer In scientific mode order of operations is followed while doing calculations multiplication and division are done before addition and subtraction which means br In programmer mode inputting a number in decimal has a lower and upper limit depending on the data type and must always be an integer Data type of number in decimal mode is signed n bit integer when converting from number in hexadecimal octal or binary mode br br On the right side of the main Calculator one can add a panel with date calculation unit conversion and worksheets Worksheets allow one to calculate a result of a chosen field based on the values of other fields Pre defined templates include calculating a car s fuel economy mpg and L km a vehicle lease and a mortgage In pre beta versions of Windows Calculator also provided a Wages template br br br Windows br While the traditional Calculator is still included with Windows a Metro style Calculator is also present featuring a full screen interface as well as normal scientific and conversion modes br br br Windows br The Calculator in non LTSC editions of Windows is a Universal Windows Platform app In contrast Windows LTSC which does not include universal Windows apps includes the traditional calculator but which is now named win calc exe Both calculators provide the features of the traditional calculator included with Windows and Windows x such as unit conversions for volume length weight temperature energy area speed time power data pressure and angle and the history list which the user can clear br Both the universal Windows app and LTSC s win calc exe register themselves with the system as handlers of a calculator pseudo protocol This registration is similar to that performed by any other well behaved application when it registers itself as a handler for a filetype e g jpg or protocol e g http br All Windows editions both LTSC and non LTSC continue to have a calc exe which however is just a stub that launches via ShellExecute the handler that is associated with the calculator pseudo protocol As with any other protocol or filetype when there are multiple handlers to choose from users are free to choose which handler they prefer either via the classic control panel Default programs settings or the immersive UI settings Default Apps settings or from the command prompt via OpenWith calculator br In the Windows Fall Creators Update a currency converter mode was added to Calculator br On March Microsoft released the source code for Calculator on GitHub under the MIT License br br br Windows br In Windows the Calculator app s user interface was modified to match the design of Windows and a new settings page is present for users to toggle between the themes of the app without changing the operating system s theme In Microsoft announced it would migrate the codebase of the Calculator app to C in order to welcome more developers to contribute to the app br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Features br By default Calculator runs in standard mode which resembles a four function calculator More advanced functions are available in scientific mode including logarithms numerical base conversions some logical operators operator precedence radian degree and gradians support as well as simple single variable statistical functions It does not provide support for user defined functions complex numbers storage variables for intermediate results other than the classic accumulator memory of pocket calculators automated polar cartesian coordinates conversion or support for two variables statistics br Calculator supports keyboard shortcuts all Calculator features have an associated keyboard shortcut br Calculator in programmer mode cannot accept or display a number larger than a signed QWORD hexadecimal digits bits The largest number it can handle is therefore x FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF decimal Any calculations in programmer mode which exceed this limit will overflow even if those calculations would succeed in other modes In particular scientific notation is not available in this mode br br br Issues br br In Windows and some versions of Windows transcendental function operations such as the square root operator sqrt e would sometimes be calculated incorrectly due to catastrophic cancelation In newer versions this doesn t happen with integers but it still happens when you enter decimal numbers br Older versions of the universal Calculator in non LTSC editions of Windows doesn t use any regional format can be set in Region Control Panel that are different from the app s display language for number formatting the app s language is English United States but Windows s regional format is set to a different format br br br Calculator Plus br Calculator Plus is a separate application for Windows XP and Windows Server users that adds a Conversion mode over the Windows XP version of the Calculator The Conversion mode supports unit conversion and currency conversion Currency exchange rates can be updated using the built in update feature which downloads exchange rates from the European Central Bank br br br See also br br Formula
