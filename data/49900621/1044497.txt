title: Workplace OS
id: 1044497
Workplace OS is IBM s ultimate operating system prototype of the s It is the product of an exploratory research program in which yielded a design called the Grand Unifying Theory of Systems GUTS proposing to unify the world s systems as generalized personalities cohabitating concurrently upon a universally sophisticated platform of object oriented frameworks upon one microkernel Using personalities a single machine would be able to run applications from multiple conventional operating systems like Unix or OS br Developed in collaboration with Taligent and its Pink operating system imported from Apple via the AIM alliance the ambitious Workplace OS was intended to improve software portability and maintenance costs by aggressively recruiting all operating system vendors to convert their products into Workplace OS personalities In IBM reported that Nearly corporations universities and research institutes worldwide have licensed the microkernel laying the foundation for a completely open microkernel standard At the core of IBM s new unified strategic direction for the entire company the project was intended also as a bellwether toward PowerPC hardware platforms to compete with the Wintel duopoly br With protracted development spanning four years and billion or of IBM s revenue for that period the project suffered development hell characterized by workplace politics feature creep and the second system effect Many idealistic key assumptions made by IBM architects about software complexity and system performance were never tested until far too late in development and found to be infeasible In January the first and only commercial preview was billed under the OS family with the name OS Warp Connect PowerPC Edition for limited special order by select IBM customers as a crippled product The entire Workplace OS platform was discontinued in March due to very low market demand including that for enterprise PowerPC hardware br A University of California case study described the Workplace OS project as one of the most significant operating systems software investments of all time and one of the largest operating system failures in modern times br br br Overview br br br Objective br By IBM acknowledged the software industry to be in a state of perpetual crisis This was due to the chaos from the inordinate complexity of software engineering inherited by its legacy of procedural programming practices since the s Large software projects were too difficult fragile expensive and time consuming to create and maintain they required too many programmers who were too busy with fixing bugs and adding incremental features to create new applications Different operating systems were alien to each other each of them running their own proprietary applications IBM envisioned life after maximum entropy through operating systems unification at last and wanted to lay a new worldview for the future of computing br IBM sought a new world view of a unified foundation for computing based upon the efficient reuse of common work It wanted to break the traditional monolithic software development cycle of producing alphas then betas then testing and repeating over the entire operating system instead compartmentalizing the development and quality assurance of individual unit objects This new theory of unifying existing legacy software and the new way of building all new software was nicknamed the Grand Unified Theory of Systems or GUTS br Coincidentally Apple already had a two year old secret prototype of its microkernel based object oriented operating system with application frameworks named Pink The theory of GUTS was expanded by Pink yielding Workplace OS br br br Architecture br IBM described its new microkernel architecture as scalable modular portable client server distributed and open and fully licensable both in binary and source code forms This microkernel based unified architecture was intended to allow all software to become scalable both upward into supercomputing space and downward into mobile and embedded space br Leveraged upon a single microkernel IBM wanted to achieve its grand goal of unification by simplifying complex development models into reusable objects and frameworks and all while retaining complete backward compatibility with legacy and heritage systems Multiple library support would allow developers to progressively migrate select source code objects to bit mode with side by side selectable bit and bit modes IBM s book on Workplace OS says Maybe we can get to a bit operating system in our lifetime IBM intended shareable objects to eventually reduce the footprint of each personality scaling them down to a handheld computing profile br At the base of Workplace OS is a fork of the Mach microkernel release mk originally developed by Carnegie Mellon University and heavily modified by the Open Software Foundation s Research Institute Officially named IBM Microkernel it provides five core features IPC virtual memory support processes and threads host and processor sets and I O and interrupt support br On top of the IBM Microkernel is a layer of shared services originally called Personality Neutral Services or PNS to cater to some or all of the personalities above them Shared services are endian neutral have no user interface and can serve other shared services Byte summarizes that shared services can include not only low level file system and device driver services but also higher level networking and even database services Workplace OS s lead architect Paul Giangarra believes that locating such application oriented services close to the microkernel will improve their efficiency by reducing the number of function calls and enabling the service to integrate its own device drivers This layer contains the file systems the scheduler network services and security services IBM first attempted a device driver model completely based in userspace to maximize its dynamic configuration but later found the need to blend it between userspace and kernelspace while keeping as much as possible in userspace The Adaptive Driver Architecture ADD was designed for the creation of layered device drivers which are easily portable to other hardware and operating system platforms beyond Workplace OS and which consist of about lines of device specific code each Some shared services are common only to select personalities such as MMPM serving multimedia only to Windows and OS personalities and which is alien or redundant to other markets br Atop the shared services another layer of userspace servers called personalities provide DOS Windows OS Workplace OS and UNIX WPIX environments The further hope was to support OS AIX Taligent OS and MacOS personalities Personalities provide environment subsystems to applications Any one personality can be made dominant for a given version of the OS providing the desktop user with a single GUI environment to accommodate the secondary personalities In IBM intended one release version to be based upon the OS Workplace Shell and another to be based upon the UNIX Common Desktop Environment CDE br IBM explained the branding Workplace OS is the codename for a collection of operating system components including among others the IBM Microkernel and the OS personality Workplace OS is the specific codename for the OS personality Workplace OS will operate with the IBM Microkernel and can be considered OS for the PowerPC For the final preview release IBM continued When we stopped using the name Workplace and started calling the product OS for the PowerPC you might have thought that the Workplace was dead But the Workplace is far from dead It has simply been renamed for prime time Workplace OS was intended to define the future of OS as a bit clean platform and free of internal legacy with perfect compatibility for source code of OS applications and drivers IBM originally wanted to prove new development models on Workplace OS and backport them into OS for x until the two platforms were unified especially the IBM Microkernel a new graphics subsystem fully bit system code with a flat memory model Taligent and OpenDoc br IBM intended for Workplace OS to run on several processor architectures including PowerPC ARM and x which would range in size from handheld PDAs to workstations to large bit servers and supercomputers IBM saw the easy portability of the Workplace OS as creating a simple migration path to move its existing x DOS and OS customer base onto a new wave of standard reference PowerPC based systems such as the PC Power Series and the Power Macintosh Creating a unique but open and industry standard reference platform of open source microkernel IBM hedged its company wide operating system strategy by aggressively attempting to recruit other computer companies to adopt its microkernel as a basis for their own operating systems br br br History br br br Development br br br GUTS br In January there was an internal presentation to the IBM Management Committee of a new strategy for operating system products This included a chart called the Grand Unification Theory of Operating Systems GUTS which outlined how a single microkernel underlying common subsystems could provide a single unifying architecture for the world s many existing and future operating systems It was initially based in a procedural programming model not object oriented The design elements of this plan had already been implemented on IBM s RS platform via the System Object Model SOM a model which had already been delivered as integral to the OS operating system br Sometime later in as a result of the Apple IBM business partnership a small exploratory IBM team first visited the Taligent team who demonstrated a relatively mature prototype operating system and programming model based entirely on Apple s Pink project from There GUTS s goals were greatly impacted and expanded by exposure to these similar goals especially advanced in the areas of aggressive object orientation and of software frameworks upon a microkernel IBM s optimistic team saw the Pink platform as being the current state of the art of operating system architecture IBM wanted to adopt Pink s more object oriented programming model and framework based system design and add compatibility with legacy procedural programming along with the major concept of multiple personalities of operating systems to create the ultimate possible GUTS model br br Through the historic Apple IBM partnership Apple s CEO John Sculley said that the already volume shipping OS and MacOS would become unified upon the common PowerPC hardware platform to bring a renaissance to the industry br In late a small team from Boca Raton and Austin began implementing the GUTS project with the goal of proving the GUTS concept by first converting the monolithic OS system to the Mach microkernel and yielding a demo To gain shared access to key personnel currently working on the existing OS they disguised the project as the Joint Design Task Force and brought a significant number of personnel from Boca Austin with LANs and performance Raleigh with SNA and other transport services IBM Research with operating systems and performance and Rochester with the bit object oriented worldview from AS Pleased with the robust long term mentality of the microkernel technology and with the progress of the project the team produced a prototype in mid The initial internal development prototypes ran on x based hardware and provided a BSD Unix derived personality and a DOS personality br br br Demos and business reorganization br At Comdex in late the team flew in and assembled a private demonstration based on last minute downloads to replace corrupted files and one hour of sleep The presentation was so well received that the prototype was put on the trade show floor on Thursday as the first public demonstration of the IBM Microkernel based system running OS DOS bit Windows and UNIX applications In IBM ordered Taligent to migrate the Taligent OS from its internally developed microkernel named Opus onto the IBM Microkernel xiii Ostensibly this would have allowed Taligent s operating system implemented as a Workplace OS personality to execute side by side with DOS and OS operating system personalities br In InfoWorld reported that Jim Cannavino has gone around the company and developer support for a plan to merge all of the company s computing platforms ES AS RS and PS around a single set of technologies namely the PowerPC microprocessor the Workplace OS operating system and the Taligent object model along with a series of open standards for cross platform development network interoperability etc On June a presentation was given at the Boca Programming Center by Larry Loucks IBM Fellow and VP of Software Architecture of the Personal Software Products PSP Division br br By IBM reportedly planned two packages of Workplace OS based on personality dominance one based on the OS Workplace Shell and another based upon the UNIX Common Desktop Environment CDE IBM and Apple were speaking about the possibility of a Mac OS personality br By January the IBM Power Personal Systems Division had still not yet begun testing its PowerPC hardware with any of its three intended launch operating systems definitely AIX and Windows NT and hopefully also Workplace OS Software demonstrations showed limited personality support with the dominant one being the OS Workplace Shell desktop and the DOS and UNIX personalities achieving only fullscreen text mode support with crude hotkey switching between the environments Byte reported that the multiple personality support promised in Workplace OS s conceptual ambitions was more straightforward foundational and robust than that of the already shipping Windows NT The magazine said IBM is pursuing multiple personalities while Microsoft appears to be discarding them while conceding that it s easier to create a robust plan than a working operating system with robust implementations of multiple personalities br In the industry was reportedly shifting away from monolithic development and even application suites toward object oriented component based crossplatform application frameworks br By Workplace OS was becoming notable for its many and repeated launch delays with IBM described as being inconsistent and wishy washy with dates This left IBM s own PowerPC hardware products without a mainstream operating system forcing the company to at least consider the rival Windows NT In April Byte reported that under lead architect Paul Giangarra IBM had staffed more than people working to bring Workplace OS up on Power Personal hardware br In May the RISC Systems software division publicly announced the company s first attempt to even study the feasibility of converting AIX into a Workplace OS personality which the company had been publicly promising since the beginning One IBM Research Fellow led a team of fewer than ten to identify and address the problem which was the fundamentally incompatible byte ordering between the big endian AIX and the little endian Workplace OS This problem is endemic because though the PowerPC CPU and Workplace OS can perform in either mode endianness is a systemwide configuration set once at boot time only and Workplace OS favors OS which comes from the little endian Intel x architecture After seven months of silence on the issue IBM announced in January that the intractable endianness problem had resulted in the total abandonment of the flagship plan for an AIX personality br In late as Workplace OS approached its first beta version IBM referred to the beta product as OS for the PowerPC As the project s first deliverable product this first beta was released to select developers on the Power Series in December There was a second beta release in By IBM had shipped two different releases of an application sampler CD for use with the beta OS releases br br br Preview launch br In mid IBM officially named its planned initial Workplace OS release OS Warp Connect PowerPC Edition with the code name Falcon In October IBM announced the upcoming first release though still a developer preview The announcement predicted it to have version of the IBM Microkernel with the OS personality and a new UNIX personality on PowerPC Having been part of the earliest demonstrations the UNIX personality was now intended to be offered to customers as a holdover due to the nonexistence of a long awaited AIX personality but the UNIX personality was also abandoned prior to release br This developer release is the first ever publication of Workplace OS and of the IBM Microkernel at version which IBM s internal developers had been running privately on Intel and PowerPC hardware The gold master was produced on December with availability on January only to existing Power Series hardware customers who paid for a special product request through their IBM representative who then relayed the request to the Austin research laboratory The software essentially appears to the user as the visually identical and source compatible PowerPC equivalent of the mainstream OS for Intel Packaged as two CDs with no box its accompanying overview paper booklet calls it the final edition but it is still a very incomplete product intended only for developers Its installer only supports two computer models the IBM PC Power Series and which have PowerPC CPUs of MHz MB of RAM and IDE drives Contrary to the product s Connect name the installed operating system has no networking support However full networking functionality is described within the installed documentation files and in the related book IBM s Official OS Warp Connect PowerPC Edition Operating in the New Frontier all of which the product s paper booklet warns the user to disregard The kernel dumps debugging data to the serial console The system hosts no compiler so developers are required to cross compile applications on the source compatible OS for Intel system using MetaWare s High C compiler or VisualAge C and manually copy the files via relocatable medium to run them br With an officially concessionary attitude IBM had no official plans for a general release packaged for OEMs or retail beyond this developer preview available only via special order from the development lab Upon its launch Joe Stunkard spokesman for IBM s Personal Systems Products division said When and if the Power market increases we ll increase the operating system s presence as required On January an Internet forum statement is made by John Soyring IBM s Vice President of Personal Software Products We are not planning additional releases of the OS Warp family on the PowerPC platform during as we just released in late December the OS Warp PowerPC Edition product We have just not announced future releases on the PowerPC platform In no way should our announcement imply that we are backing away from the PowerPC br br br Roadmap br On November IBM s developer newsletter said Another focus of the product strategy will be the IBM Microkernel and microkernel based versions of OS Warp Nearly corporations universities and research institutes worldwide have licensed the microkernel laying the foundation for a completely open microkernel standard IBM planned a second feature parity release for x and PowerPC in and version of the microkernel was distributed to microkernel adopters early that year This version was described as final with support for x and ARM processors IBM reportedly tested OS on the never released x compatible PowerPC br At this point the several year future roadmap of Workplace OS included IBM Microkernel and was intended to subsume the fully converged future of the OS platform starting after the future release of OS version including ports to Pentium Pentium Pro MIPS ARM and Alpha CPUs br br br Discontinuation br The Workplace OS project was finally canceled in March due to myriad factors inadequate performance low acceptance of the PowerPC Reference Platform poor quality of the PowerPC launch extensive cost overruns lack of AIX Windows or OS personalities and the overall low customer demand The only mainstream desktop operating system running on PowerPC was Windows NT which also lacked supply and demand Industry analysts said that the industry may have passed by the PowerPC In IBM also closed the Power Personal Division responsible for personal PowerPC systems IBM stopped developing new operating systems and instead committed heavily to Linux Java and some Windows In IBM described Linux as the universal platform in a way that happens to coincide with many of the essential design objectives of GUTS br br br Reception br br br Industrial reception br Reception was enthusiastically but skeptically mixed as the young IT industry was already constantly grappling with the second system effect and was now presented with Workplace OS and PowerPC hardware as the ultimate second system duo to unify all preceding and future systems On November InfoWorld s concerns resembled the Osborne effect Now IBM needs to talk about this transition without also telling its customers to stop buying all the products it is already selling Tough problem Very little of the new platform that IBM is developing will be ready for mission critical deployment until or So the company has to dance hard for two and maybe three years to keep already disaffected customers on board br In an extensive analysis by Byte reported that the multiple personality concept in Workplace OS s beta design was more straightforward foundational and robust than that of the already shipping Windows NT It said IBM is pursuing multiple personalities while Microsoft appears to be discarding them and conceded that it s easier to create a robust plan than a working operating system with robust implementations of multiple personalities br Upon the January developer final release InfoWorld relayed the industry s dismay that the preceding two years of delays had made the platform too little too late stillborn and effectively immediately discontinued An analyst was quoted The customer base would not accept OS and the PowerPC at the same time because by the time IBM would eventually ship a final retail package of OS on PowerPC machines the power price ratio of the PowerPC processor just wasn t good enough to make customers accept all of the other drawbacks of migrating to a new operating system alone br In Ars Technica retrospectively characterized the years of hype surrounding Workplace OS as supposedly being the ultimate operating system the OS to end all OSes It would run on every processor architecture under the sun but it would mostly showcase the power of POWER It would be all singing and all dancing br br br Internal analysis br In January four years after the conception and one year before the cancellation of Workplace OS IBM announced the results of a very late stage analysis of the project s initial assumptions This concluded that it is impossible to unify the inherent disparity in endianness between different proposed personalities of legacy systems resulting in the total abandonment of the flagship plan for an AIX personality br In May one year after its cancellation one of its architects reflected back on the intractable problems of the project s software design and the limits of available hardware br br There is no good way to factor multiple existing systems into a set of functional servers without making them excessively large and complex In addition the message passing nature of the microkernel turns out to be a poor match for the characteristics of modern processors causing performance problems Finally the use of fine grained objects complicated the design and further reduced the performance of the system Based on this experience I believe that more modest more targeted operating systems consume fewer resources offer better performance and can provide the desired semantics with fewer compromises br br br Academic analysis br In September a case study of the history of the development of Workplace OS was published by the University of California with key details having been verified by IBM personnel These researchers concluded that IBM had relied throughout the project s history upon multiple false assumptions and overly grandiose ambitions and had failed to apprehend the inherent difficulty of implementing a kernel with multiple personalities IBM considered the system mainly as its constituent components and not as a whole in terms of system performance system design and corporate personnel organization IBM had not properly researched and proven the concept of generalizing all these operating system personalities before starting the project or at any responsible timeframe during it especially its own flagship AIX IBM assumed that all the resultant performance issues would be mitigated by eventual deployment upon PowerPC hardware The Workplace OS product suffered the second system effect including feature creep with thousands of global contributing engineers across many disparate business units nationwide The Workplace OS project had spent four years and billion or of IBM s revenue for that period which the report described as one of the most significant operating systems software investments of all time
