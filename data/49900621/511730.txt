many of the technologies which had been developed from to for Apple s overly ambitious OS named Copland Mac OS helped modernize the Mac OS while Apple developed its next generation operating system Mac OS X renamed in to OS X and then in to macOS br Mac OS is one of Apple s most commercially successful software releases selling over million copies in the first two weeks As it came at a difficult

operating system which it originally envisioned to be System was codenamed Copland It was announced in March alongside the introduction of the first PowerPC Macs Apple intended Copland as a fully modern system including native PowerPC code intelligent agents a microkernel a customizable interface named Appearance Manager a hardware abstraction layer and a relational database integrated into the Finder Copland was to be followed by Gershwin which promised memory protection spaces and full preemptive multitasking The system was intended to be a full rewrite of the Mac OS and Apple hoped to beat Microsoft Windows to market with a development cycle of only one year br The Copland development was hampered by many missed deadlines The release date was first pushed back to the end of then to mid late and finally to the end of With a dedicated team of software engineers and an annual budget of million Apple executives began to grow impatient with the project continually falling behind schedule In August Apple chief technology officer Ellen Hancock froze development of Copland and Apple began a search for an operating system developed outside the company This ultimately led to Apple buying NeXT and developing Rhapsody which would eventually evolve into Mac OS X in now named macOS br At the Worldwide Developers Conference in January Apple chief executive officer CEO Gil Amelio announced that rather than release Copland as one monolithic release Copland features would be phased into the Mac OS following a six month release cycle These updates began with Mac OS released during WWDC Mac OS released six months later continued to integrate Copland technologies into the Mac OS br br br Mac OS br Developed with the codename Tempo Mac OS was announced on July and released on July The early beta releases of the product which were circulated to developers and Apple internal audiences were branded as Mac OS superseding the then current release Mac OS The software was

execution and system startup times br Faster desktop rebuilding br br br Mac OS br Released on January Mac OS was the last version of the Mac OS to run on Macs with Motorola series processors It addressed performance and reliability improvements It introduced a new file system named HFS also named Mac OS Extended which supported large file sizes and made more efficient use of larger hard drives via using a smaller block size To upgrade users must reformat the hard drive which deletes the entire contents of the drive Some third party utilities later appeared that preserved the user s data while upgrading to HFS The systems do not support booting from HFS disks the boot drive must be HFS br Mac OS was the first system to have a Universal Disk Format UDF driver allowing for DVD support on the Mac for the first time It also shipped with the new Java runtime JDK br Mac OS also included an enhanced version of PC Exchange allowing Macintosh users to see the long file names up to characters on files that were created on PCs running Microsoft Windows and supporting FAT br Mac OS is the earliest version of the Mac OS that can run Carbon applications Carbon support requires a PowerPC processor and installation of the CarbonLib software from Apple s website it is not a standard component of Mac OS Applications needing later versions of CarbonLib will not run on Mac OS More recent versions of CarbonLib require Mac OS br As part of Apple s agreement with Microsoft included Internet Explorer initially but soon switched to Internet Explorer as its default browser br Mac OS was free for Mac OS owners and was available in February via the apple com website br br br Mac OS br Released October Mac OS was the first version of the Mac OS to run solely on Macs equipped with a PowerPC processor If Mac OS is installed on a k system the Sad Mac error screen will appear As such it replaced some but not all of the x code with PowerPC code improving system performance by relying less on x emulation br It introduced the Sherlock search utility This allowed users to search the contents of documents on hard drives if the user had let it index the drive or extend a search to the Internet Sherlock plug ins started appearing at this time these allowed users to search the contents of other websites br Mac OS includes several performance improvements Copying files over a network was faster than prior versions and Apple advertised it as being faster than Windows NT AppleScript was also rewritten to use only PowerPC code which improved AppleScript execution speed significantly br Font Smoothing system wide antialiasing for type was also introduced The HTML format for online help first adopted by the Finder s Info Center in Mac OS was now used throughout This made it easier for software companies to write online help systems The PPP control panel was removed and replaced with Remote Access which provides the same functionality but also allows connections to AppleTalk Remote Access ARA servers br The installation process was simplified considerably in Mac OS In earlier versions the installer worked in segments and often required a user to click to continue in between stages of the installation This was a holdover from the days when the OS was distributed on multiple floppy disks disk swapping promoting a natural segmentation model The Mac OS installer generally required very little user interaction once it was started Customisation options were also much more detailed yet simpler to manage br From Mac OS onward MacLinkPlus document translation software is no longer bundled as part of the Mac OS br Mac OS was the first version of the Mac OS to support themes or skins which could change the default Apple Platinum look of the Mac OS to Gizmo

them with the OS The Appearance control panel was also updated to support proportional scroll bars and added the option for both scroll arrows to be placed at the bottom of a scroll bar br Along with themes support was the first version to support bit icons Icons now had bit color million colors and an bit alpha channel allowing for transparency translucency effects br The application palette made its debut with the application menu at the right side of the menu bar could be resized to show the active application s name or torn off into a palette of buttons This palette could be customized in many ways by removing the window frame and changing the size and layout of the buttons Apple provided no user interface to set these options instead making them available via AppleScript and Apple Events and relying on third parties to provide a user interface for the task By setting it to display horizontally and turning off the window border the palette s look and function could be configured to resemble the Windows task bar br br br Mac OS br Mac OS released December was a minor update to Mac OS that fixes several bugs that caused crashes and data corruption br br br Mac OS br Mac OS was released on May as a free update for Mac users running and It added support to the Mac OS nanokernel to handle preemptive tasks via the Multiprocessing Services x and later developer API Mac OS improved PowerBook battery life added Sherlock and is faster and much more stable than either version of x It is the first version of Mac OS to display the version number as part of the startup screen However there is no process separation the system still uses cooperative multitasking between processes and even a process that is Multiprocessing Services aware still has a portion that runs in the blue task which also runs all programs that are unaware of it and was the only task that can run k code br br br Reception br While CNET s initial review of Mac OS was more circumspect its editorial
