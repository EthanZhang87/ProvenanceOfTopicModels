Windows Notepad is a simple text editor for Windows it creates and edits plain text documents First released in to commercialize the computer mouse in MS DOS Notepad has been part of every version of Windows ever since br br br History br In May at the COMDEX computer expo in Atlanta Microsoft introduced the Multi Tool Notepad a mouse based text editor Richard Brodie had created as a stripped down version of Multi Tool Word Notepad had the ability to bold underline or italicise text removed All these programs were to support the release of the Microsoft Mouse with the mouse coming with Notepad or Word sometimes both depending on the date Most visitors had never heard of a computer mouse before The mouse began shipping in July Initial sales were modest because it had no use other than running the programs included in the box a tutorial a Doodle drawing app a musical piano app Multi Tool Notepad and or Multi tool Word br The Multi Tool product line began with expert systems for the Multiplan spreadsheet On the suggestion of Rowland Hanson Microsoft dropped the Multi Tool brand name Hanson s rationale was that the brand is the hero and people wouldn t automatically associate Multi Tool with Microsoft As a result the Multi Tool Notepad and the Multi Tool Word became Windows Notepad and Microsoft Word respectively Hanson also convinced Bill Gates to rename Interface Manager to Windows before the release of Windows br Since then Notepad has been part of Microsoft Windows br br br Change in development model br Since the introduction of Microsoft Store in Microsoft has converted some of the built in Windows apps into Microsoft Store apps e g Sticky Notes so that they could be updated independent of Windows releases Within three years Notepad has appeared on Microsoft Store thrice The first time was in August it vanished shortly thereafter This version required Windows preview build During this short lived presence on the Store technology news blogs speculated that Microsoft intended to de couple Notepad s life cycle from that of Windows and update it more frequently through Microsoft Store Notepad appeared on Microsoft Store for a second time in April this time sporting a new logo It runs on the preview versions of Windows build number or later On February Microsoft started rolling out a new and redesigned version of Notepad to all Windows users This version had Dark Mode added and a new Find and Replace flyout with the same functionality Notepad is now available in the Microsoft Store in both Windows and On March Microsoft announced that it is adding spellcheck and autocorrect to Notepad for Windows The new features are available to Windows Insider members in the Canary and Dev Channels and will be available to all Windows users at a later time br br br Features br Notepad is a text editor i e an app specialized in editing plain text It can edit text files bearing the txt filename extension and compatible formats such as batch files INI files and log files br Notepad offers only the most basic text manipulation functions such as finding and replacing text Until Windows ME there were almost no keyboard shortcuts and no line counting feature Starting with Windows shortcuts for common commands like New Open and Save were added as well as a status bar with a line counter available only when word wrap is disabled Before Windows version Notepad could not properly interpret either Unix style or Mac style newline characters Windows version also introduced the Ctrl Backspace keyboard shortcut deletes the previous word zoom functionality the ability to zoom in and out and the Search with Bing function br Improving performance has been the main focus of Notepad s development As part of this effort Notepad is capable of reading text files even when other apps have acquired a range based lock on the file br On Windows and earlier Notepad renders text files in the Fixedsys font Starting with Windows NT and Windows it allows users to choose their own font to display the text They cannot however select individual parts of the text and change their fonts Its default font changed to Lucida Console on Windows and Consolas on Windows br Notepad can print files It allows customizing headers footers and margins before printing The date file name and other information can be placed in the headers and footers with various codes consisting of an ampersand followed by a letter br Notepad accepts text from the Windows clipboard but only in the CF TEXT format It strips the pasted text of any embedded font and style information One could temporarily paste formatted text into Notepad then immediately copy it again to obtain the raw text br Notepad has a simple logging function Each time it opens a file with LOG on its first line the app inserts a timestamp on the file s last line br br br Encoding support br The supported character encoding includes br br ANSI locale dependent codepage br Unicode br UCS Windows NT or later br UTF Windows or later br UTF Windows or later br byte order mask selection Windows or later br Starting with Windows Insider build it supports processing of line ending types Unix LF Mac OS CR DOS Windows CRLF br Opening and editing in left to right and right to left based languages are done via RichEdit controls and input method editors available in versions for Windows XP or later br br br Limitations br Notepad used a built in window class named EDIT The maximum file size Notepad can open depends on operating system limitations on the size of the EDIT window class with a different limit in each version of Windows Because of this limitation on Windows Windows and Windows Notepad could not open files larger than KB Microsoft recommended using another text editor for opening files larger than KB This limit was extended to KB in Windows with users now directed to WordPad for larger files On Windows XP Notepad was limited to MB and declined to open bigger files On Windows Notepad uses the RichEdit control The size limit was raised to about GB and attempting to open any file larger than that shows a dialog box suggesting that the user open it with a different text editor br br br Unicode detection br br On the Windows NT family of operating systems including Windows and Windows XP Notepad can detect Unicode files even when they lack a byte order mark To do this it calls the IsTextUnicode function of the Windows API Until Windows Vista this function was imperfect incorrectly identifying some all lowercase ASCII text as UTF As a result Notepad interpreted a file containing a phrase like aaaa aaa aaa aaaaa as a two byte encoded Unicode text file If a font with support for Chinese was installed nine Chinese characters would display Otherwise it would display square substitute characters instead of Chinese characters This issue was resolved on Windows Vista and newer br br br Competing software br br Notepad lacks many basic features available in other text editors such as block selection and MDI There are many third party replacements for Notepad with additional functionality such as AkelPad Metapad Notepad Notepad and TED Notepad which include features such as br br syntax coloring br code folding br regular expressions br macros br manual code page selection br themes br sorting br case changes br external change detection br
