Fiwix is an operating system kernel based on the UNIX architecture and fully focused on being POSIX compatible It is designed and developed mainly as a hobbyist operating system but it also serves for educational purposes It runs on the i hardware platform and is compatible with a good base of existing GNU applications It follows the UNIX System V application binary interface and is also mostly Linux system call ABI compatible br The FiwixOS operating system is a Fiwix distribution It uses the Fiwix kernel includes the GNU toolchain GCC Binutils Make it uses Newlib v as its C standard library and Ext as its primary file system br br br Features br Features according to the official website include br br Written in ANSI C language Assembly used only in the needed parts br GRUB Multiboot Specification v compliant br Full bit protected mode non preemptive kernel br POSIX compliant mostly br For i processors and higher br Process groups sessions and job control br Interprocess communication with pipes and signals br UNIX System V IPC semaphores message queues and shared memory br BSD file locking mechanism POSIX restricted to whole file and advisory only br Virtual memory splits user kernel GB GB and GB GB br Linux ABI system calls compatibility mostly br ELF executable format support statically and dynamically linked br Round Robin based scheduler algorithm no priorities yet br VFS abstraction layer br Kexec support br Ext filesystem support with KB KB and KB block sizes br Minix v and v filesystem support br Linux like Proc filesystem support read only br ISO filesystem support with Rock Ridge extensions br RAMdisk device support br Initial RAMdisk initrd image support br SVGALib based applications support br PCI local bus support br Virtual consoles support up to br Keyboard driver with Linux keymaps support br Frame buffer device support for VESA VBE compliant graphic cards br Framebuffer console fbcon support br Serial port RS driver support br Remote serial console support br QEMU Bochs style debug console support br Basic implementation of a Pseudo Random Number Generator br Floppy disk device driver and DMA management br IDE ATA hard disk device driver br IDE ATA ATAPI CD ROM device driver br br br br br br Further reading br Sanfeliu Jordi The GNU Fiwix Operating System osnews com br Fiwix Unix like kernel for the i architecture Hacker News br br br External links br Official website
