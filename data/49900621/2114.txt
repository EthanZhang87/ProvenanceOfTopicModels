AIX Advanced Interactive eXecutive pronounced ay eye EKS is a series of proprietary Unix operating systems developed and sold by IBM for several of its computer platforms br br br Background br Originally released for the IBM RT PC RISC workstation in AIX has supported a wide variety of hardware platforms including the IBM RS series and later Power and PowerPC based systems IBM System i System mainframes PS personal computers and the Apple Network Server It is currently supported on IBM Power Systems alongside IBM i and Linux br AIX is based on UNIX System V with BSD compatible extensions It is certified to the UNIX and UNIX V marks of the Single UNIX Specification beginning with AIX versions and TL respectively Older versions were previously certified to the UNIX and UNIX marks br AIX was the first operating system to have a journaling file system and IBM has continuously enhanced the software with features such as processor disk and network virtualization dynamic hardware resource allocation including fractional processor units and reliability engineering ported from its mainframe designs br br br History br br Unix started life at AT T s Bell Labs research center in the early s running on DEC minicomputers By the operating system was in use at various academic institutions including Princeton where Tom Lyon and others ported it to the S to run as a guest OS under VM This port would later grow out to become UTS a mainframe Unix offering by IBM s competitor Amdahl Corporation br IBM s own involvement in Unix can be dated to when it assisted Bell Labs in doing its own Unix port to the to be used as a build host for the ESS switch s software In the process IBM made modifications to the TSS Resident Supervisor to better support Unix br It took until for IBM to offer its own Unix on the S platform VM IX which was developed by Interactive Systems Corporation using Unix System III as its base VM IX and the modified version of VM it required was not a General Availability product it was only obtainable as a PRPQ In VM IX was replaced by IBM IX which was a GA product intended by IBM to compete with Amdahl UTS IX which was based on AT T s Unix th Edition port which only ran on TSS as a time share application was updated to Unix System and modified by IBM to run as a VM guest OS The IX operating system offered special facilities for interoperating with PC IX Interactive IBM s version of Unix for IBM PC compatible hardware and was licensed at per sixteen concurrent users br AIX Version introduced in for the IBM RT PC workstation was based on UNIX System V Releases and In developing AIX IBM and Interactive Systems Corporation whom IBM contracted also incorporated source code from and BSD UNIX br Among other variants IBM later produced AIX Version also known as AIX based on AIX Version for their POWER based RS platform Since AIX has served as the primary operating system for the RS series later renamed IBM eServer pSeries then IBM System p and now IBM Power Systems br AIX Version introduced in for the PS and VM systems developed by Locus Computing Corporation added the Transparent Computing Facility AIX Version introduced in added symmetric multiprocessing with the introduction of the first RS SMP servers and continued to evolve through the s culminating with AIX in Version in a slightly modified form was also the standard operating system for the Apple Network Server systems sold by Apple Computer to complement the Macintosh line br In the late s under Project Monterey IBM and the Santa Cruz Operation planned to integrate AIX and UnixWare into a single bit bit multiplatform UNIX with particular emphasis on running on Intel IA Itanium architecture CPUs A beta test version of AIX L for IA systems was released but according to documents released in the SCO v IBM lawsuit less than forty licenses for the finished Monterey Unix were ever sold before the project was terminated in In the SCO Group alleged that among other infractions IBM had misappropriated licensed source code from UNIX System V Release for incorporation into AIX SCO subsequently withdrew IBM s license to develop and distribute AIX IBM maintains that their license was irrevocable and continued to sell and support the product until the litigation was adjudicated br AIX was a component of the SCO v IBM lawsuit in which the SCO Group filed a lawsuit against IBM alleging IBM contributed SCO s intellectual property to the Linux codebase The SCO Group who argued they were the rightful owners of the copyrights covering the Unix operating system attempted to revoke IBM s license to sell or distribute the AIX operating system In March a jury returned a verdict finding that Novell not the SCO Group owns the rights to Unix br br AIX was announced in May and it ran as an open beta from June until the general availability GA of AIX on November Major new features in AIX included full role based access control workload partitions which enable application mobility enhanced security Addition of AES encryption type for NFS v and v and Live Partition Mobility on the POWER hardware br AIX was announced in April and an open beta ran until general availability of AIX in September Several new features including better scalability enhanced clustering and management capabilities were added AIX includes a new built in clustering capability called Cluster Aware AIX AIX is able to organize multiple LPARs through the multipath communications channel to neighboring CPUs enabling very high speed communication between processors This enables multi terabyte memory address range and page table access to support global petabyte shared memory space for AIX POWER clusters so that software developers can program a cluster as if it were a single system without using message passing i e semaphore controlled Inter process Communication AIX administrators can use this new capability to cluster a pool of AIX nodes By default AIX V pins kernel memory and includes support to allow applications to pin their kernel stack Pinning kernel memory and the kernel stack for applications with real time requirements can provide performance improvements by ensuring that the kernel memory and kernel stack for an application is not paged out br AIX was announced in October and released in December The principal feature of AIX is the Live Kernel Update capability which allows OS fixes to replace the entire AIX kernel with no impact to applications by live migrating workloads to a temporary surrogate AIX OS partition while the original OS partition is patched AIX was also restructured to remove obsolete components The networking component bos net tcp client was repackaged to allow additional installation flexibility Unlike AIX AIX is only supported on systems based on POWER or later processors br In January IBM moved development of AIX to its Indian subsidiary br br br Supported hardware platforms br br br IBM RT PC br The original AIX sometimes called AIX RT was developed for the IBM RT PC workstation by IBM in conjunction with Interactive Systems Corporation who had previously ported UNIX System III to the IBM PC for IBM as PC IX According to its developers the AIX source for this initial version consisted of one million lines of code Installation media consisted of eight M floppy disks The RT was based on the IBM ROMP microprocessor the first commercial RISC chip This was based on a design pioneered at IBM Research the IBM br One of the novel aspects of the RT design was the use of a microkernel called Virtual Resource Manager VRM The keyboard mouse display disk drives and network were all controlled by a microkernel One could hotkey from one operating system to the next using the Alt Tab key combination Each OS in turn would get possession of the keyboard mouse and display Besides AIX v the PICK OS also included this microkernel br Much of the AIX v kernel was written in the PL programming language which proved troublesome during the migration to AIX v AIX v included full TCP IP networking as well as SNA and two networking file systems NFS licensed from Sun Microsystems and Distributed Services DS DS had the distinction of being built on top of SNA and thereby being fully compatible with DS on IBM mainframe systems and on midrange systems running OS through IBM i For the graphical user interfaces AIX v came with the X R and later the X R and X versions of the X Window System from MIT together with the Athena widget set Compilers for Fortran and C were available br br br IBM PS series br br AIX PS also known as AIX was developed by Locus Computing Corporation under contract to IBM AIX PS first released in October ran on IBM PS personal computers with Intel and compatible processors br br The product was announced in September with a baseline tag price of although some utilities such as UUCP were included in a separate Extension package priced at nroff and troff for AIX were also sold separately in a Text Formatting System package priced at The TCP IP stack for AIX PS retailed for another The X Window System package was priced at and featured a graphical environment called the AIXwindows Desktop based on IXI s X desktop The C and FORTRAN compilers each had a price tag of Locus also made available their DOS Merge virtual machine environment for AIX which could run MS DOS applications inside AIX DOS Merge was sold separately for another IBM also offered a AIX PS DOS Server Program which provided file server and print server services for client computers running PC DOS br The last version of PS AIX is It was released in and announced to add support for non IBM non microchannel computers as well Support for PS AIX ended in March br br br IBM mainframes br In IBM announced AIX also developed by Locus Computing AIX was IBM s fourth attempt to offer Unix like functionality for their mainframe line specifically the System the prior versions were a TSS based Unix system developed jointly with AT T c a VM based system named VM IX developed jointly with Interactive Systems Corporation c and a VM based version of TSS named IX which was upgraded to be compatible with UNIX System V AIX was released in with functional equivalence to System V Release and BSD as well as IBM enhancements With the introduction of the ESA architecture AIX was replaced by AIX ESA in which was based on OSF and also ran on the System platform This development effort was made partly to allow IBM to compete with Amdahl UTS Unlike AIX AIX ESA ran both natively as the host operating system and as a guest under VM AIX ESA while technically advanced had little commercial success partially because UNIX functionality was added as an option to the existing mainframe operating system MVS as MVS ESA SP Version Release OpenEdition in and continued as an integral part of MVS ESA SP Version OS and z OS with the name eventually changing from OpenEdition to Unix System Services IBM also provided OpenEdition in VM ESA Version through z VM br br br IA systems br As part of Project Monterey IBM released a beta test version of AIX L for the IA Itanium architecture in but this never became an official product due to lack of interest br br br Apple Network Servers br The Apple Network Server ANS systems were PowerPC based systems designed by Apple Computer to have numerous high end features that standard Apple hardware did not have including swappable hard drives redundant power supplies and external monitoring capability These systems were more or less based on the Power Macintosh hardware available at the time but were designed to use AIX versions or as their native operating system in a specialized version specific to the ANS called AIX for Apple Network Servers br AIX was only compatible with the Network Servers and was not ported to standard Power Macintosh hardware It should not be confused with A UX Apple s earlier version of Unix for k based Macintoshes br br br POWER ISA PowerPC Power ISA based systems br br The release of AIX version sometimes called AIX coincided with the announcement of the first POWER based IBM RS models in br AIX v innovated in several ways on the software side It was the first operating system to introduce the idea of a journaling file system JFS which allowed for fast boot times by avoiding the need to ensure the consistency of the file systems on disks see fsck on every reboot Another innovation was shared libraries which avoid the need for static linking from an application to the libraries it used The resulting smaller binaries used less of the hardware RAM to run and used less disk space to install Besides improving performance it was a boon to developers executable binaries could be in the tens of kilobytes instead of a megabyte for an executable statically linked to the C library AIX v also scrapped the microkernel of AIX v a contentious move that resulted in v containing no PL code and being somewhat more pure than v br Other notable subsystems included br br IRIS GL a D rendering library the progenitor of OpenGL IRIS GL was licensed by IBM from SGI in then still a fairly small company which had sold only a few thousand machines at the time SGI also provided the low end graphics card for the RS capable of drawing gouraud shaded triangles per second The high end graphics card was designed by IBM a follow on to the mainframe attached IBM capable of rendering vectors per second br PHIGS another D rendering API popular in automotive CAD CAM circles and at the core of CATIA br Full implementation of version of the X Window System together with Motif as the recommended widget toolkit and window manager br Network file systems NFS from Sun AFS the Andrew File System and DFS the Distributed File System br NCS the Network Computing System licensed from Apollo Computer later acquired by HP br DPS on screen display system This was notable as a plan B in case the X Motif combination failed in the marketplace However it was highly proprietary supported only by Sun NeXT and IBM This cemented its failure in the marketplace in the face of the open systems challenge of X Motif and its lack of D capability br In addition AIX applications can run in the PASE subsystem under IBM i br br br Source code br IBM formerly made the AIX for RS source code available to customers for an additional fee in IBM customers could order the AIX source code for a one time charge of US subsequently IBM released the AIX source code in and AIX in These source code distributions excluded certain files authored by third parties which IBM did not have rights to redistribute and also excluded layered products such as the MS DOS emulator and the C compiler Furthermore in order to be able to license the AIX source code the customer first had to procure source code license agreements with AT T and

br The Common Desktop Environment CDE is AIX s default graphical user interface As part of Linux Affinity and the free AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications ATLA open source KDE Plasma Workspaces and GNOME desktop are also available br br br System Management Interface Tool br br SMIT is the System Management Interface Tool for AIX It allows a user to navigate a menu hierarchy of commands rather than using the command line Invocation is typically achieved with the command smit Experienced system administrators make use of the F function key which generates the command line that SMIT will invoke to complete it br SMIT also generates a log of commands that are performed in the smit script file The smit script file automatically records the commands with the command flags and parameters used The smit script file can be used as an executable shell script to rerun system configuration tasks SMIT also creates the smit log file which contains additional detailed information that can be used by programmers in extending the SMIT system br smit and smitty refer to the same program though smitty invokes the text based version while smit will invoke an X Window System based interface if possible however if smit determines that X Window System capabilities are not present it will present the text based version instead of failing Determination of X Window System capabilities is typically performed by checking for the existence of the DISPLAY variable br br br Database br Object Data Manager ODM is a database of system information integrated into AIX analogous to the registry in Microsoft Windows A good understanding of the ODM is essential for managing AIX systems br Data managed in ODM is stored and maintained as objects with associated attributes Interaction with ODM is possible via application programming interface API library for programs and command line utilities such as odmshow odmget odmadd odmchange and odmdelete for shell scripts and users SMIT and its associated AIX commands can also be used to query and modify information in the ODM ODM is stored on disk using Berkeley DB files br Example of information stored in the ODM database are br br Network configuration br Logical volume management configuration br Installed software information br Information for logical devices or software drivers br List of all AIX supported devices br Physical
