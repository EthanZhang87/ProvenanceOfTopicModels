SerenityOS is a free and open source desktop operating system that has been in continuous development since Initially a one man project of Swedish programmer Andreas Kling SerenityOS is now developed by a community of hobbyists The system supports the x instruction set though work is currently at the early stages to support AArch and RISC V features a preemptive kernel and hosts multiple complex applications including its own web browser and integrated development environment IDE br br br History br br Andreas Kling previously worked at Nokia and later at Apple on the WebKit team He began developing the project in part to aid his recovery from addiction and as such the name of the project derives from the Serenity Prayer Starting in Kling began working full time on SerenityOS supported by community donations On June rd he stepped down from the project to work on the Ladybird browser br br br Features br SerenityOS aims to be a modern Unix like operating system with a look and feel that emulates s operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS Incorporating third party code into the system is discouraged The web browser for instance does not use a pre existing web engine such as WebKit instead using its own known as LibWeb There is a collection of ported software such as GCC Git and Doom with varying levels of functionality br Development does not adhere to a release cycle as such there are no releases Additionally no binary distributions are provided and prospects are expected to build the system from source The system is written in what the authors call Serenity C a variant of C that lacks exceptions and features its own standard library br The relative popularity of SerenityOS compared to other hobbyist systems is in part due to the modest success of Kling s YouTube channel where he uploads videos of himself developing parts of the system alongside demos and monthly progress updates br br br Web browser br SerenityOS includes a version of the Ladybird web browser built from the ground up using its internal libraries LibWeb LibJS and LibWasm Andreas Kling develops it alongside paid and volunteer contributors On June rd Kling announced his plans to fork Ladybird and begin development on the browser as a separate project On July in collaboration with Chris Wanstrath Kling announced the founding of the Ladybird Browser Initiative a c nonprofit to support the development of the browser br As of July development of Ladybird mostly occurs in its own repository with changes actively synced to the SerenityOS version br br br Reception br Jim Salter of Ars Technica regarded the use of the ext file system as his least favorite feature of the operating system Compared to TempleOS another operating system well known in the hobbyist community he considered it more accessible For less technical users that are looking for a mid to late s reminiscent visual style the Xfce Chicago theme or the Redmond Project has been recommended instead br br br br br br External links br br Project Homepage br Source Repository br Ladybird Homepage
