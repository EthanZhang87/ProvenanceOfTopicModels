A desktop computer often abbreviated desktop is a personal computer designed for regular use at a stationary location on or near a desk as opposed to a portable computer due to its size and power requirements The most common configuration has a case that houses the power supply motherboard a printed circuit board with a microprocessor as the central processing unit memory bus certain peripherals and other electronic components disk storage usually one or more hard disk drives solid state drives optical disc drives and in early models floppy disk drives a keyboard and mouse for input and a monitor speakers and often a printer for output The case may be oriented horizontally or vertically and placed either underneath beside or on top of a desk br Desktop computers with their cases oriented vertically are referred to as towers As the majority of cases offered since the mid s are in this form factor the term desktop has been retronymically used to refer to modern cases offered in the traditional horizontal orientation br br br History br br br Origins br br Prior to the widespread use of microprocessors a computer that could fit on a desk was considered remarkably small the type of computers most commonly used were minicomputers which despite the name were rather large and were mini only compared to the so called big iron Early computers and later the general purpose high throughput mainframes took up the space of a whole room Minicomputers on the contrary generally fit into one or a few refrigerator sized racks or for the few smaller ones built into a fairly large desk not put on top of it br It was not until the s when fully programmable computers appeared that could fit entirely on top of a desk saw the introduction of the Datapoint a smart computer terminal complete with keyboard and monitor was designed to connect with a mainframe computer but that did not stop owners from using its built in computational abilities as a stand alone desktop computer The HP series which started out as programmable calculators in but was programmable in BASIC by used a smaller version of a minicomputer design based on ROM memory and had small one line LED alphanumeric displays and displayed graphics with a plotter The Wang of had a full size cathode ray tube CRT and cassette tape storage The IBM in had a small CRT display and could be programmed in BASIC and APL These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses br br br Growth and development br br Apple II TRS and Commodore PET were first generation personal home computers launched in which were aimed at the consumer market rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists Byte magazine referred to these three as the Trinity of personal computing Throughout the s and s desktop computers became the predominant type the most popular being the IBM PC and its clones followed by the Apple Macintosh with the third placed Commodore Amiga having some success in the mid s but declining by the early s br br Early personal computers like the original IBM Personal Computer were enclosed in a desktop case horizontally oriented to have the display screen placed on top thus saving space on the user s actual desk although these cases had to be sturdy enough to support the weight of CRT displays that were widespread at the time Over the course of the s desktop cases gradually became less common than the more accessible tower cases that may be located on the floor under or beside a desk rather than on a desk Not only do these tower cases have more room for expansion they have also freed up desk space for monitors which were becoming larger every year Desktop cases particularly the compact form factors remain popular for corporate computing environments and kiosks Some computer cases can be interchangeably positioned either horizontally desktop or upright mini tower br Influential games such as Doom and Quake during the s had pushed gamers and enthusiasts to frequently upgrade to the latest CPUs and graphics cards dfx ATI and Nvidia for their desktops usually a tower case in order to run these applications though this has slowed since the late s as the growing popularity of Intel integrated graphics forced game developers to scale back Creative Technology s Sound Blaster series were a de facto standard for sound cards in desktop PCs during the s until the early s when they were reduced to a niche product as OEM desktop PCs came with sound boards integrated directly onto the motherboard br br br Decline br br While desktops have long been the most common configuration for PCs by the mid s the growth shifted from desktops to laptops Notably while desktops were mainly produced in the United States laptops had long been produced by contract manufacturers based in Asia such as Foxconn This shift led to the closure of the many desktop assembly plants in the United States by Another trend around this time was the increasing proportion of inexpensive base configuration desktops being sold hurting PC manufacturers such as Dell whose build to order customization of desktops relied on upselling added features to buyers br Battery powered portable computers had just a worldwide market share in However laptops have become increasingly popular both for business and personal use br Around million notebook PCs shipped worldwide in a growth of compared to br In it was estimated that million notebooks were sold and that the number would grow in to million The third quarter of was the first time when worldwide notebook PC shipments exceeded desktops with million units versus million units br The sales breakdown of the Apple Macintosh has seen sales of desktop Macs staying mostly constant while being surpassed by that of Mac notebooks whose sales rate has grown considerably seven out of ten Macs sold were laptops in a ratio projected to rise to three out of four by The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable G to upscale G model and subsequent releases are considered premium all in ones By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini albeit without a monitor and keyboard and the MacBooks are the top selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today br The decades of development mean that most people already own desktop computers that meet their needs and have no need of buying a new one merely to keep pace with advancing technology Notably the successive release of new versions of Windows Windows XP Vista and so on had been drivers for the replacement of PCs in the s but this slowed in the s due to the poor reception of Windows Vista over Windows XP IDC analyst Jay Chou suggested that Windows actually hurt sales of PCs in as businesses decided to stick with Windows rather than upgrade Some suggested that Microsoft had acknowledged implicitly ringing the desktop PC death knell as Windows offered little upgrade in desktop PC functionality over Windows instead Windows s innovations were mostly on the mobile side br The post PC trend saw a decline in the sales of desktop and laptop PCs The decline was attributed to increased power and applications of alternative computing devices namely smartphones and tablet computers Although most people exclusively use their smartphones and tablets for more basic tasks such as social media and casual gaming these devices have in many instances replaced a second or third PC in the household that would have performed these tasks though most families still retain a powerful PC for serious work br Among PC form factors desktops remain a staple in the enterprise market but lost popularity among home buyers PC makers and electronics retailers responded by investing their engineering and marketing resources towards laptops initially netbooks in the late s and then the higher performance Ultrabooks from onwards which manufacturers believed had more potential to revive the PC market than desktops br In April StatCounter declared a Milestone in technology history and end of an era with the mobile Android operating system becoming more popular than Windows the operating system that made desktops dominant over mainframe computers Windows is still most popular on desktops and laptops while smartphones and tablets use Android or iOS br br br Resurgence br br Towards the middle of the s media sources began to question the existence of the post PC trend at least as conventionally defined stating that the so called post PC devices are just other portable forms of PCs joining traditional desktop PCs which still have their own operation areas and evolve br Although for casual use traditional desktops and laptops have seen a decline in sales in global PC sales experienced a resurgence driven by the business market Desktops remain a solid fixture in the commercial and educational sectors According to the International Data Corporation IDC PC sales shot up between and and desktop market grew faster than the laptop market in the second quarter of Total PC shipments during reached million units up from This represents the highest level of shipments the PC market has seen since In addition gaming desktops have seen a global revenue increase of annually For gaming the global market of gaming desktops laptops and monitors is expected to grow to million shipments by the end of up from million with desktops growing from million shipments to million PC gaming as a whole now accounts for of the total gaming market as of This is partially due to the increasing affordability of desktop PCs br br br Types br br br By size br br br Full size br Full sized desktops are characterized by separate display and processing components These components are connected to each other by cables or wireless connections They often come in a tower form factor These computers are easy to customize and upgrade per user requirements e g by expansion card br Early extended size significantly larger than mainstream ATX case tower computers sometimes were labeled as deskside computers but currently this naming being quite rare br br br Compact br br Compact desktops are reduced in physical proportions compared to full sized desktops They are typically small sized inexpensive low power computers designed for basic tasks such as web browsing accessing web based applications document processing and audio video playback Hardware specifications and processing power are usually reduced and hence make them less appropriate for running complex or resource intensive applications A nettop is a notable example of a compact desktop A laptop without a screen can functionally be used as a compact desktop sometimes called a slabtop br br br Form factor br br br All in one br br An all in one AIO desktop computer integrates the system s internal components into the same case as the display thus occupying a smaller footprint with fewer cables than desktops that incorporate a tower The All in one systems are rarely labeled as desktop computers br br br Tower br br In personal computing a tower is a form factor of desktop computer case whose height is much greater than its width thus having the appearance of an upstanding tower block br br br Pizza box form factor br br In computing a pizza box enclosure is a design for desktop computers Pizza box cases tend to be wide and flat resembling pizza delivery boxes and thus the name br br br Cube br br Cube Workstations have a cube case enclosure to house the motherboard PCI E expansion cards GPU CPU DRAM DIMM slots computer cooling equipment chipsets I O ports hard disk drives and solid state drives br br br By usage br br br Gaming computer br br Gaming computers are desktop computers with high performance CPU GPU and RAM optimized for playing video games at high resolution and frame rates Gaming computer peripheries usually include mechanical keyboards for faster response time and a gaming computer mouse which can track higher dots per inch movement br br br Home theater br br These desktops are connected to home entertainment systems and typically used for amusement purpose They come with high definition display video graphics surround sound and TV tuner systems to complement typical PC features br br br Thin client Internet appliance br br Over time some traditional desktop computers have been replaced with thin clients utilizing off site computing solutions like the cloud As more services and applications are served over the internet from off site servers local computing needs decrease this drives desktop computers to be smaller cheaper and need less powerful hardware More applications and in some cases entire virtual desktops are moved off site and the desktop computer runs only an operating system or a shell application while the actual content is served from a server Thin client computers may do almost all of their computing on a virtual machine in another site Internal hosted virtual desktops can offer users a completely consistent experience from anywhere br br br Workstation br br Workstations are advanced class of personal computers designed for a user and more powerful than a regular PC but less powerful than a server in regular computing They are capable of high resolution and three dimensional interfaces and typically used to perform scientific and engineering work Like server computers they are often connected with other workstations The main form factor for this class is a Tower case but most vendors produce compact or all in one low end workstations Most tower workstations can be converted to a rack mount version br br br Desktop server br Oriented for small business class of servers typically entry level server machines with similar to workstation gaming PC computing powers and with some mainstream servers features but with only basic graphic abilities and some desktop servers can be converted to workstations br br br Non common types br br br Quantum technology br On January Shenzhen SpinQ Technology announced that they will release the first ever desktop quantum computer This will be a miniaturized version of their previous quantum computer based on the same technology nuclear magnetic resonance and will be qubit device Applications will mostly be educational for high school and college students The company claims SpinQ will be released to the public by the fourth quarter of br br br Comparison with laptops br br Desktops have an advantage over laptops in that the spare parts and extensions tend to be standardized resulting in lower prices and greater availability For example the size and mounting of the motherboard are standardized into ATX microATX BTX or other form factors Desktops have several standardized expansion slots like conventional PCI or PCI Express while laptops tend to have only one mini PCI slot and one PC Card slot or ExpressCard slot Procedures for assembly and disassembly of desktops tend to be simple and standardized as well This tends not to be the case for laptops though adding or replacing some parts like the optical drive hard disk or adding an extra memory module is often quite simple This means that a desktop computer configuration usually a tower case can be customized and upgraded to a greater extent than laptops This customization has kept tower cases popular among gamers and enthusiasts br Another advantage of the desktop is that apart from environmental concerns power consumption is not as critical as in laptop computers because the desktop is exclusively powered from the wall socket Desktop computers also provide more space for cooling fans and vents to dissipate heat allowing enthusiasts to overclock with less risk The two large microprocessor manufacturers Intel and AMD have developed special CPUs for mobile computers i e laptops that consume less power and lower heat but with lower performance levels br Laptop computers conversely offer portability that desktop systems including small form factor and all in one desktops cannot due to their compact size and clamshell design The laptop s all in one design provides a built in keyboard and a pointing device such as a touchpad for its user and can draw on power supplied by a rechargeable battery Laptops also commonly integrate wireless technologies like Wi Fi Bluetooth and G giving them a broader range of options for connecting to the internet though this trend is changing as newer desktop computers come integrated with one or more of these technologies br A desktop computer needs a UPS to handle electrical disturbances like short interruptions blackouts and spikes achieving an on battery time of more than minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS A laptop with a sufficiently charged battery can continue to be used for hours in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts br A desktop computer often has the advantage over a comparable laptop in computational capacity Overclocking is often more feasible on a desktop than on a laptop similarly hardware add ons such as discrete graphics co processors may be possible to install only in a desktop br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Computer Tour of major
