HP UX from Hewlett Packard Unix is Hewlett Packard Enterprise s proprietary implementation of the Unix operating system based on Unix System V initially System III and first released in Current versions support HPE Integrity Servers based on Intel s Itanium architecture br Earlier versions of HP UX supported the HP Integral PC and HP Series and computer systems based on the Motorola series of processors the HP Series computers based on HP s proprietary FOCUS architecture and later HP Series models based on HP s PA RISC instruction set architecture br HP UX was the first Unix to offer access control lists for file access permissions as an alternative to the standard Unix permissions system HP UX was also among the first Unix systems to include a built in logical volume manager HP has had a long partnership with Veritas Software and uses VxFS as the primary file system br It is one of three commercial operating systems that have versions certified to The Open Group s UNIX standard The others are macOS and AIX br br br Characteristics br br HP UX i offers a common shared disks for its clustered file system HP Serviceguard is the cluster solution for HP UX HP Global Workload Management adjusts workloads to optimize performance and integrates with Instant Capacity on Demand so installed resources can be paid for in minute increments as needed for peak workload demands br HP UX offers operating system level virtualization features such as hardware partitions isolated OS virtual partitions on cell based servers and HP Integrity Virtual Machines HPVM on all Integrity servers HPVM supports guests running on HP UX i v hosts guests can run Linux Windows Server OpenVMS or HP UX HP supports online VM guest migration where encryption can secure the guest contents during migration br HP UX i v scales as follows on a SuperDome with Intel Itanium processors br br processor cores br TB main memory br TB maximum file system br TB maximum file size br million ZB million logical units each up to ZB br br br Security br The i v release introduced kernel based intrusion detection strong random number generation stack buffer overflow protection security partitioning role based access management and various open source security tools br HP classifies the operating system s security features into three categories data system and identity br br br Context dependent files br Release x together with x introduced the context dependent files CDF feature a method of allowing a fileserver to serve different configurations and binaries and even architectures to different client machines in a heterogeneous environment A directory containing such files had its suid bit set and was made hidden from both ordinary and root processes under normal use Such a scheme was sometimes exploited by intruders to hide malicious programs or data CDFs and the CDF filesystem were dropped with release br br br Supported hardware platforms br br HP UX operating systems supports a variety of PA RISC systems The added support for Integrity based servers for the transition from PA RISC to Itanium HP UX i v is the first version that supported Itanium On the introduction of HP UX i v the operating system supported both of these architectures br br br BL series br HP UX i supports HPE Integrity Servers of HP BL server blade family These servers use the Intel Itanium architecture br br br CX series br HP UX i v and i v support HP s CX series servers CX stands for carrier grade and is used mainly for telco industry with V DC support and is NEBS certified Both of these systems contain Itanium Mad M processors and are discontinued br br br RX series br HP UX supports HP s RX series of servers br br br Release history br Prior to the release of HP UX version HP used a decimal version numbering scheme with the first number giving the major release and the number following the decimal showing the minor release With HP made a marketing decision to name their releases i followed by a v decimal number for the version The i was intended to indicate the OS is Internet enabled but the effective result was a dual version numbering scheme br br br Version history br br br Versions br br First release for HP Series HP UX for Series was substantially different from HP UX for any other HP machines as it was layered atop a Series specific operating system called SUNOS unrelated to Sun Microsystems SunOS br br AT T System III based Support for the HP Integral PC HP A The kernel runs from ROM other commands are disk based br br First release for HP s early Motorola based workstations HP U HP U HP U br br AT T System V based Distinct versions were available for the Integral PC the Series and the Series Introduced the proprietary Starbase graphics API for the Series and The Series x releases included a proprietary windowing system built on top of Starbase named HP Windows which was also available as an optional extra for Series hardware br x br HP Series only Note x x for Series were developed in parallel with x x for Series so for example x was really contemporary with x The two lines were united at HP UX x br x br Support for HP Series only Introduced sockets from BSD This version together with x also introduced the above discussed context dependent files CDF which were removed in release because of their security risks The release added X superseding HP Windows and X allowed Starbase programs to run alongside X programs br x br Support for HP Series in HP systems Provided OSF Motif Final version to include the HP Windows windowing system br x January br Support for HP Series systems Shared libraries introduced br x July br Series Series Series only Series only These provided support for the HP Series and systems Introduced System Administration Manager SAM The Logical Volume Manager LVM was presented in for the Series Adopted the Visual User Environment desktop br br This major release saw a convergence of the operating system between the HP Series workstation and Series server systems dropping support for previous lines There was also a significant change in the layout in the system files and directories based on the AT T UNIX System V Release standard Applications were removed from usr and moved under opt startup configuration files were placed under etc rc config d users were moved to home from users Software for HP UX was now packaged shipped installed and removed via the Software Distributor SD tools LVM was also made available for Series br br Introduced the Common Desktop Environment UNIX compliance br br This release included support for bit PA RISC processors Pluggable Authentication Modules PAM were introduced for use within CDE The root file system could be configured to use the Veritas File System VxFS For legacy as well as technical reasons the file system used for the boot kernel remained Hi Performance FileSystem HFS a variant of UFS until version also supported bit user and group identifiers The prior limit was or bit This and earlier releases of HP UX are now effectively obsolete and support by HP ended on June br br This is a Virtual Vault release of HP UX providing enhanced security features Virtual Vault is a compartmentalised operating system in which each file is assigned a compartment and processes only have access to files in the appropriate compartment and unlike most other UNIX systems the superuser or root does not have complete access to the system without following correct procedures br br This was primarily a developer release with various incremental enhancements It provided the first support for kernel threads with a thread model each user thread is bound to one kernel thread br br The first HP UX release to also support bit addressing It could still run bit applications on a bit system It supported symmetric multiprocessing Fibre Channel and NFS PV It also included tools and documentation to convert bit code to bit br br Virtual Vault release br br This was a limited release to support the HP V SCA Scalable Computing Architecture and V SCA servers It also added JFS AutoFS a new ftpd and support for up to CPUs It was not available separately br i v br This release of HP UX introduced the concept of Operating Environments It was released in December These are bundled groups of layered applications intended for use with a general category of usage The available types were the Mission Critical Enterprise Internet Technical Computing and Minimal Technical OEs The last two were intended for HP workstations The main enhancements with this release were support for hard partitions Gigabit Ethernet NFS over TCP IP loadable kernel modules dynamic kernel tunable parameters kernel event Notifications and protected stacks br i v br This release of HP UX was the first to support the new line of Itanium based IA systems It was not intended for mission critical computing environments and did not support HP s ServiceGuard cluster software It provided support for running PA RISC compiled applications on Itanium systems and for Veritas Volume Manager br i v br An incremental release of the Itanium version of HP UX This version achieved way scalability m n threads added more dynamic kernel tunable parameters and supported HP s Logical Volume Manager on Itanium It was built from the i v source code stream br i v br The original release of this version was in September to support the Itanium based systems In September the OS was updated to provide support for both Itanium and PA RISC systems Besides running on Itanium systems this release includes support for ccNUMA web based kernel and device configuration IPv and stronger random number generation br i v br This release supports both PA RISC and Itanium It was released on February Major new features include native multipathing support a unified file cache NFSv Veritas ClusterFS multi volume VxFS and integrated virtualization Hyperthreading is supported on Itanium systems with Montecito and Tukwila processors HP UX i v conforms to The Open Group s UNIX standard Updates for i v have been released every months
