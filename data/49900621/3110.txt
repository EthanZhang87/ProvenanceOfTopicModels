Andrew Stuart Tanenbaum born March sometimes referred to by the handle ast is an American computer scientist and professor emeritus of computer science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands br He is the author of MINIX a free Unix like operating system for teaching purposes and has written multiple computer science textbooks regarded as standard texts in the field He regards his teaching job as his most important work Since he has operated Electoral vote com a website dedicated to analysis of polling data in federal elections in the United States br br br Biography br Tanenbaum was born in New York City and grew up in suburban White Plains New York where he attended the White Plains High School His paternal grandfather was born in Khorostkiv in the Austro Hungarian empire br He received his Bachelor of Science degree in physics from MIT in and his PhD degree in astrophysics from the University of California Berkeley in br He moved to the Netherlands to live with his wife who is Dutch but he retains his United States citizenship He taught courses on Computer Organization and Operating Systems and supervised the work of PhD candidates at the VU University Amsterdam On July he announced his retirement br br br Teaching br br br Books br Tanenbaum s textbooks on computer science include br br Structured computer organization Upper Saddle River NJ Pearson Prentice Hall ISBN br Computer networks Upper Saddle River NJ Pearson Prentice Hall ISBN with David J Wetherall and Nickolas Feamster br Operating Systems Design and Implementation co authored with Albert Woodhull br Modern Operating Systems br Distributed operating systems Englewood Cliffs N J Prentice Hall ISBN br Distributed systems principles and paradigms Upper Saddle River NJ Pearson Prentice Hall ISBN with Maarten van Steen br His book Operating Systems Design and Implementation and MINIX were Linus Torvalds inspiration for the Linux kernel In his autobiography Just for Fun Torvalds describes it as the book that launched me to new heights br br br Doctoral students br Tanenbaum has had a number of PhD students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers br These include br br Henri Bal professor at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam br Frans Kaashoek professor at MIT br Werner Vogels Chief Technology Officer at Amazon com br br br Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging br In the early s the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities These schools were intended to bring professors and PhD students from different Dutch and later foreign universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research br Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging ASCI This school initially consisted of nearly faculty members and PhD students from the Vrije Universiteit University of Amsterdam Delft University of Technology and Leiden University They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing br Tanenbaum remained dean for years until when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences at which time he became a full time research professor br br br Projects br br br Amsterdam Compiler Kit br The Amsterdam Compiler Kit is a toolkit for producing portable compilers It was started sometime before and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version br br br MINIX br In Tanenbaum wrote a clone of UNIX called MINIX MINi unIX for the IBM PC It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked Consequently he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks Within three months a Usenet newsgroup comp os minix had sprung up with over subscribers discussing and improving the system One of these subscribers was Linus Torvalds who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs On October Torvalds announced his own POSIX like kernel called Linux which originally used the MINIX file system but is not based on MINIX code br br br Electoral vote com br In Tanenbaum created Electoral vote com a web site analyzing opinion polls for the U S Presidential Election using them to project the outcome in the Electoral College He stated that he created the site as an American who knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy not the land of arrogance and blind revenge I want to be proud of America again The site provided a color coded map updated each day with projections for each state s electoral votes Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret referring to himself as the Votemaster and acknowledging only that he personally preferred John Kerry Mentioning that he supported the Democrats he revealed his identity on November the day before the election and also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website br Through the site he also covered the midterm elections correctly predicting the winner of all Senate races that year br For the elections he got every state right except for Indiana which he said McCain would win by Obama won by and Missouri which he said was too close to call McCain won by He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota where he predicted a win by Norm Coleman over Al Franken After months of legal battling and recounts Franken won by votes br In he correctly projected out of Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website The exceptions were Colorado and Nevada br Electoral vote com incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton would win the United States presidential election The website incorrectly predicted Clinton would win Wisconsin Michigan Pennsylvania North Carolina and Florida Electoral vote com did not predict a winner for Nevada which Clinton would win The website predicted the winners of the remaining states and the District of Columbia correctly br br br Tanenbaum Torvalds debate br The Tanenbaum Torvalds debate was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on Usenet in br br br Awards br Fellow of the ACM br Fellow of the IEEE for outstanding contributions to research and education in computer networks and operating systems br Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences br Winner of the TAA McGuffey award for classic textbooks for Modern Operating Systems br Winner of the IEEE James H Mulligan Jr Education Medal br br br Honorary doctorates br br On May Tanenbaum received an honorary doctorate from Universitatea Politehnica din Bucure ti br On October Universitatea Petru Maior din T rgu Mure Petru Maior University of T rgu Mure granted Tanenbaum the Doctor Honoris Causa honorary doctorate title
