id: 19193
The MIT License is a permissive software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT in the late s As a permissive license it puts very few restrictions on reuse and therefore has high license compatibility br Unlike copyleft software licenses the MIT License also permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the software or its substantial portions include a copy of the terms of the MIT License and also a copyright notice In the MIT License was the most popular software license on GitHub br Notable projects that use the MIT License include the X Window System Ruby on Rails Node js Lua jQuery NET Angular and React br br br License terms br The MIT License has the identifier MIT in the SPDX License List It is also known as the Expat License It has the following terms br br Copyright c year copyright holders br br Permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files

MIT license most known for its usage by the X Consortium It has the identifier X in the SPDX License List br It differs from the MIT License mainly by an additional clause restricting use of the copyright holders name for advertisement br It has the following terms br br Copyright C date copyright holders br br Permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this

Attribution License a variation of the MIT License has the identifier MIT in the SPDX License List A request for legacy approval to the Open Source Initiative was filed on May which led to a formal approval on August By doing so it forms a public domain equivalent license the same way as BSD Zero Clause It has the following terms br br MIT No Attribution br br Copyright YEAR COPYRIGHT HOLDER br

SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE br br br Other variations br The SPDX License List contains extra MIT license variations Examples include br br MIT advertising a variation with an additional advertising clause br There is also the Anti Capitalist Software License ACSL built off of the MIT license It is not Open Source since it limits the permissions granted to individuals and organizations that do not operate under capitalist structures like non profits and cooperatives br br br Ambiguity and variants br The name MIT License is potentially ambiguous The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has used many licenses for software since its creation for example MIT offers four licensing options for the FFTW C source code library one of which is the GPL v and the other three of which are not open source The term MIT License has also been used to refer to the Expat License used for the XML parsing library Expat and to the X License also called MIT X Consortium License used for X Window System by the MIT X Consortium Furthermore the MIT License as published by the Open Source Initiative is the same as the Expat License Due to this differing use of terms some prefer to avoid the name MIT License The Free Software Foundation argues that the term is misleading and ambiguous and recommends against its use br The X Consortium was dissolved late in and its assets transferred to The Open Group which released X R initially under the same license The X License and the X R MIT License chosen for ncurses by the Free Software Foundation both include the following clause absent in the Expat License br br Except as contained in this notice the name s of the above copyright holders shall not be used in advertising or otherwise to promote the sale use or other dealings in this Software without prior written authorization br As of the successor to the X Window System is the X Org Server which is licensed under what is effectively the common MIT license according to the X org licensing page br br The X Org Foundation has chosen the following format of the MIT License as the preferred format for code included in the X Window System distribution This is a slight variant of the common MIT license form published by the Open Source Initiative br The slight variant is the addition of the phrase including the next paragraph to the second paragraph of the license text resulting in The above copyright notice and this permission notice including the next paragraph shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software This inclusion clarifies that the liability paragraph must also be included for the conditions of the license to be met br The license management features at popular source code repository GitHub as well as its Choose a License service do not differentiate between MIT Expat license variants The text of the Expat variant is presented as simply the MIT License represented by the metadata tag mit br br br Comparison to other licenses br br br BSD br The original BSD license also includes a clause requiring all advertising of the software to display a notice crediting its authors This advertising clause since disavowed by UC Berkeley is present in the modified MIT License used by XFree br The University of Illinois NCSA Open Source License combines text from both the MIT and BSD licenses the license grant and disclaimer are taken from the MIT License br The ISC license contains similarities to both the MIT and simplified BSD licenses the biggest difference being that language deemed unnecessary by the Berne Convention is omitted br br br GNU General Public License br The GPL is explicit about the patent rights an owner grants when the code or derivative work is distributed the MIT license does not discuss patents Moreover the GPL license impacts derivative works but the MIT license does not br br br Relation to patents br Like the BSD license the MIT license does not include an express patent license although some commentators state that the grant of rights covers all potential restrictions including patents Both the BSD and the MIT licenses were drafted before the patentability of software was generally recognized under US law The Apache License version is a similarly permissive license that includes an explicit contributor s patent license br Of specific relevance to US jurisdictions the MIT license uses the terms sell and use that are also used in defining the rights of a patent holder in Title of the United States Code section This has been construed by some commentators as an unconventional but implicit license in the US to use any underlying patents br br br Origins br One of the originators of the MIT license computer scientist Jerry Saltzer has published his recollections of its early development along with documentary evidence br br br Reception br As of according to WhiteSource Software the MIT license was used in of four million open source packages As of according to Black Duck Software and a blog from GitHub the MIT license was the most popular open source license with the GNU GPLv coming second in their sample of repositories
