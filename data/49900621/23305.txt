The Portable Operating System Interface POSIX IPA is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems POSIX defines both the system and user level application programming interfaces APIs along with command line shells and utility interfaces for software compatibility portability with variants of Unix and other operating systems POSIX is also a trademark of the IEEE POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system developers br br br Name br Originally the name POSIX referred to IEEE Std released in The family of POSIX standards is formally designated as IEEE and the ISO IEC standard number is ISO IEC br The standards emerged from a project that began in building on work from related activity in the usr group association Richard Stallman suggested the name POSIX to the IEEE instead of the former IEEE IX The committee found it more easily pronounceable and memorable and thus adopted it br br br Overview br Unix was selected as the basis for a standard system interface partly because it was manufacturer neutral However several major versions of Unix existed so there was a need to develop a common denominator system The POSIX specifications for Unix like operating systems originally consisted of a single document for the core programming interface but eventually grew to separate documents POSIX POSIX etc The standardized user command line and scripting interface were based on the UNIX System V shell Many user level programs services and utilities including awk echo ed were also standardized along with required program level services including basic I O file terminal and network POSIX also defines a standard threading library API which is supported by most modern operating systems In most parts of POSIX were combined into a single standard IEEE Std also known as POSIX br As of POSIX documentation is divided into two parts br br POSIX Edition POSIX Base Definitions System Interfaces and Commands and Utilities which include POSIX extensions for POSIX Real time Services Threads Interface Real time Extensions Security Interface Network File Access and Network Process to Process Communications User Portability Extensions Corrections and Extensions Protection and Control Utilities and Batch System Utilities This is POSIX with Technical Corrigendum br POSIX Conformance Testing A test suite for POSIX accompanies the standard VSX PCTS or the VSX POSIX Conformance Test Suite br The development of the POSIX standard takes place in the Austin Group a joint working group among the IEEE The Open Group and the ISO IEC JTC SC WG br br br Versions br br br Parts before br Before POSIX comprised several standards br br POSIX Core Services incorporates Standard ANSI C IEEE Std br Process Creation and Control br Signals br Floating Point Exceptions br Segmentation Memory Violations br Illegal Instructions br Bus Errors br Timers br File and Directory Operations br Pipes br C

and Cleanup br Thread Scheduling br Thread Synchronization br Signal Handling br POSIX Shell and Utilities IEEE Std br Command Interpreter br Utility Programs br br br Versions after br After the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO br br br POSIX with two TCs br POSIX or IEEE Std equates to the Single UNIX Specification version minus X Open Curses br This standard consisted of br br the Base Definitions Issue br the System Interfaces and Headers Issue br the Commands and Utilities Issue br IEEE Std involved a minor update of POSIX It incorporated two minor updates or errata referred to as Technical Corrigenda TCs Its contents are available on the web br br br POSIX with two TCs br Base Specifications Issue or IEEE Std Edition is similar to the current version as of July br This standard consists of br br the Base Definitions Issue br the System Interfaces and Headers Issue br the Commands and Utilities Issue br the Rationale volume br br br POSIX br IEEE Std Revision of IEEE Std IEEE Standard for Information Technology Portable Operating System Interface POSIX R Base Specifications Issue is available from either The Open Group or IEEE It is technically identical to POSIX with Technical Corrigenda and applied Its contents is available on the web br br br POSIX br IEEE Std IEEE Standard for Information Technology Portable Operating System Interface POSIX R Base Specifications Issue was published on June Its contents is available on the web br br br Controversies br br br vs byte blocks br POSIX mandates byte default block sizes for the df and du utilities reflecting the typical size of blocks on disks When Richard Stallman and the GNU team were implementing POSIX for the GNU operating system they objected to this on the grounds that most people think in terms of byte or KiB blocks The environment variable POSIX ME HARDER was introduced to allow the user to force the standards compliant behaviour The variable name was later changed to POSIXLY CORRECT This variable is now also used for a number of other behaviour quirks br br br POSIX oriented operating systems br Depending upon the degree of compliance with the standards one can classify operating systems as fully or partly POSIX compatible br br br POSIX certified br Current versions of the following operating systems have been certified to conform to one or more of the various POSIX standards This means that they passed the automated conformance tests and their certification has not expired and the operating system has not been discontinued br br br Formerly POSIX certified br Some versions of the following operating systems had been certified to conform to one or more of the various POSIX standards This means that they passed the automated conformance tests The certification has expired and some of the operating systems have been discontinued br br br Mostly POSIX compliant br The following are not certified as POSIX compliant yet comply in large part br br br POSIX for Microsoft Windows br Cygwin provides a largely POSIX compliant development and run time environment for Microsoft Windows br MinGW a fork of Cygwin provides a less POSIX compliant development environment and supports compatible C programmed applications via Msvcrt Microsoft s old Visual C runtime library br libunistd a largely POSIX compliant development library originally created to build the Linux based C C source code of CinePaint as is in Microsoft Visual Studio A lightweight implementation that has POSIX compatible header files that map POSIX APIs to call their Windows API counterparts br Microsoft POSIX subsystem an optional Windows subsystem included in Windows NT based operating systems up to Windows It supported POSIX as it stood in the revision without threads or sockets br Interix originally OpenNT by Softway Systems Inc is an upgrade and replacement for Microsoft POSIX subsystem that was purchased by Microsoft in It was initially marketed as a stand alone add on product and then later included as a component in Windows Services for UNIX SFU and finally incorporated as a component in Windows Server R and later Windows OS releases under the name Subsystem for UNIX based Applications SUA later made deprecated in Windows and dropped in R It enables full POSIX compliance for certain Microsoft Windows products br Windows Subsystem for Linux also known as WSL is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows and using a Linux image such as Ubuntu Debian or OpenSUSE among others acting as an upgrade and replacement for Windows Services for UNIX It was released in beta in April The first distribution available was Ubuntu br UWIN from AT T Research implements a POSIX layer on top of the Win APIs br MKS Toolkit originally created for MS DOS is a software package produced and maintained by MKS Inc that provides a Unix like environment for scripting connectivity and porting Unix and Linux software to both and bit Microsoft Windows systems A subset of it was included in the first release of Windows Services for UNIX SFU in br Windows C Runtime Library and Windows Sockets API implement commonly used POSIX API functions for file time environment and socket access although the support remains largely incomplete and not fully interoperable with POSIX compliant implementations br br br POSIX for OS br Mostly POSIX compliant environments for OS br br emx gcc largely POSIX compliant br br br POSIX for DOS br Partially POSIX compliant environments for DOS include br br emx gcc largely POSIX compliant br DJGPP partially POSIX compliant br DR DOS multitasking

large part to the standards by implementing POSIX support via some sort of compatibility feature usually translation libraries or a layer atop the kernel Without these features they are usually non compliant br br AmigaOS through the ixemul library or vbcc PosixLib br eCos POSIX is part of the standard distribution and used by many applications external links section below has more information
