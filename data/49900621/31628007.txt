Phantom OS is an orthogonally persistent managed code general purpose operating system It is based on a concept of persistent virtual memory and executes bytecode in a virtual machine It is one of a few OSes not based on classic concepts of Unix like systems Phantom is based on the principle that Everything is an object in contrast to the Unix like approach of Everything is a file br br br Overview br Phantom has been founded by Dmitry Zavalishin and is being developed by mostly Russian programmers It is free and open source software FOSS released under a GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL br br br Basics br Managed code Memory protection on object level rather than process level absence of pointer arithmetic in managed code avoids many problems that exist and occur in unmanaged code br Global address space Inexpensive inter process communication IPC Single flat address space allows transfer of objects from one process application to another by transferring links to that object Security is achieved via absence of pointer arithmetic and the inability of an application to get linked to an object other than by calling a public method br Persistence Application code does not see OS restarts and could live forever this does not use the concept of a file and any variable or data structure could be stored forever and at the same time be available directly through a pointer Differently from hibernation that is done in other OSs persistence lies in the very core principles of the Phantom OS core The implementation creates snapshots continuously and transparently to the applications maintaining consistent internal state without pausing applications br br br Compatibility br Two ways to migrate code are offered br br Converter from Java virtual machine JVM bytecode supposed to allow import of bytecode from Java and other programming languages that target the JVM br The Portable Operating System Interface POSIX subsystem allows porting application code from Unix and Linux although important features of Phantom OS such as persistence become unavailable br br br Status br As of October the system exists in alpha version for x IA processors Porting to ARM architecture is underway currently being tested not yet ready for use and porting to MIPS architecture and x AMD has begun Kernel operation has been demonstrated at the biggest Russian IT conferences RIT ADD CC and br A Genode based fork is being developed since br br br See also br br IBM i br EROS microkernel br Singularity operating system br br br br br br Sources br Source codes of Phantom OS Digital Zone Retrieved April br Phantom OS Internals book br Phantom OS on OpenHUB br br br External links br Official website br Phantomuserland on GitHub br Genode port on GitHub
