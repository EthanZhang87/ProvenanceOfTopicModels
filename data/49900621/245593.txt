ARX was an unreleased Mach like operating system written in Modula developed by Acorn Computers Ltd in the Acorn Research Centre ARC United Kingdom UK and later by Olivetti which purchased Acorn for Acorn s new Archimedes personal computers based on the ARM architecture reduced instruction set computer RISC central processing unit CPUs br br br Overview br According to the project Application Manager Richard Cownie during the project while Acorn was developing the kernel it used the C and Acorn Modula Execution Library CAMEL in the Acorn Extended Modula AEM compiler ported from Modula ETH Zurich ETH using Econet hardware Though never released externally CAMEL was ported to use on Sun Microsystems Unix computers In an effort to port Sun s workstations Sun NeWS to the Archimedes David Chase developed a compiler based on AEM for the programming language Modula br ARX was a preemptive multitasking multithreading multi user operating system Much of the OS ran in user mode and as a result suffered performance problems due to switches into kernel mode to perform mutexes which led to the introduction of the SWP instruction to the instruction set of the ARMv a version of the ARM processor It had support of a file system for optical write once read many WORM disks and featured a window system a window toolkit and a direct manipulation user interface UI editor and an Interscript based text editor for enriched documents written in Interpress a HTML precursor The OS had to be fitted in a KB read only memory ROM ROM image This suggests that ARX had a microkernel type design br It was not finished in time to be used in the Acorn Archimedes range of computers which shipped in with an operating system named Arthur later renamed RISC OS derived from the earlier Machine Operating System MOS from Acorn s earlier bit BBC Micro range Confusion persisted about the nature of ARX amongst the wider public and press with some believing that ARX was Acorn s own Unix variant with this view being refined in time to accommodate ARX as Acorn s own attempt to deliver a UNIX look alike whose development had been abandoned in favour of a traditional Unix version for the Archimedes which ultimately emerged as RISC iX br The Acorn Research Centre was acquired by Olivetti br br br See also br RISC iX br br br br br br External links br ARX features br History of the addition of the SWP instruction to the ARM instruction set
