Nucleus RTOS is a real time operating system RTOS produced by the Embedded Software Division of Mentor Graphics a Siemens Business supporting and bit embedded system platforms The operating system OS is designed for real time embedded systems for medical industrial consumer aerospace and Internet of things IoT uses Nucleus was released first in The latest version is x and includes features such as power management process model bit support safety certification and support for heterogeneous computing multi core system on a chip SOCs processors br Nucleus process model adds space domain partitioning for task and module isolation on SOCs with either a memory management unit MMU or memory protection unit MPU such as those based on ARMv Cortex A R M cores br br br Supported platforms br Nucleus supports many embedded processors including leading ARMv Cortex A R and M devices Recent releases support ARMv bit devices The official website has a full list of supported devices It includes bit MCUs and MPUs configurable devices and bit and bit multi core processors br br br History br Nucleus x was released first in by Accelerated Technology ATI as Nucleus PLUS It soon became one of the most commonly used RTOSs in the embedded market Following its early success there ATI added support for networking graphics and file systems which accelerated adoption br Mentor Graphics acquired ATI in March which was soon followed by the second generation of Nucleus RTOS Version x was released in improving its portability across different architectures and tool sets New components like IPv Flash memory file system and Universal Serial Bus USB were added Mentor replaced the legacy Codelab debugger with EDGE development tools which included compiler tools debugger simulator and profiler br Mentor Graphics introduced the rd generation Nucleus in Version x was intended for both high end microprocessor units MPUs microcontroller units MCUs digital signal processors DSPs and field programmable gate arrays FPGAs For devices with limited memory resources Nucleus was designed to scale down to a memory size of kilobytes KBs for both code and data br Nucleus x introduced support for symmetric multiprocessing SMP and asymmetric multiprocessing AMP both unsupervised uAMP and supervised sAMP using Mentor Embedded Hypervisor Other additions in Nucleus x br br Integrated power management support for kernel and middleware components includes support for DVFS tick suppression and sleep modes including hibernation br Process model for memory partitioning to support dynamic loading and unloading of application modules Loadable processes are supported on both high end MPUs and low end MCUs with or without hardware memory management support br Wireless support br IoT protocols br Safety certification for aerospace medical industrial and automotive br Support for ARM TrustZone br Mentor embedded multi core framework for IPC and processor life cycle management for AMP designs both supervised sAMP and unsupervised uAMP br Runtime tracing support with host side analysis tools br In addition to the new features in version x Nucleus moved business model from a la carte to one unified package br Mentor acquired CodeSourcery in Dec to replace the EDGE development tools with the Sourcery CodeBench Sourcery CodeBench comprises a compiler tool chain debugger and trace analysis tools The compiler tool chain is based on GNU tool chain The debugger and integrated development environment IDE are based on Eclipse Sourcery CodeBench supports ARM IA MIPS and PPC architectures with built in workflows and OS awareness for Nucleus RTOS and Mentor Embedded Linux br Nucleus x introduced a unified build and configuration system with which the Kernel is configured through a single file and builds as a single library Like menuconfig in Linux a user interface UI based configuration tool integrated with CodeBench provides the user with graphically selectable components to customize the kernel at build time The Nucleus configuration system allows for user customization to integrate new tool chains architecture support and build properties br br br Major

PCI PCI X and PCIe br Controller Area Network CAN and CANopen br Secure Digital SDIO br SPI QSPI br Inter Integrated Circuit I C br br br File system br Unlike Windows and Unix like operating systems Nucleus does not need a file system to work However for complex uses needing local storage Nucleus supports several file systems including FAT SAFE fault tolerant and LWEXT br br br Multiple simultaneous file systems br File Allocation Table FAT br SAFE high reliability power fail safe br LWEXT br Install able third party file systems br br br Multiple media support br CD ROM br Hard drive br RAM disk br NOR and NAND flash br USB drive br SD MMC br Nucleus provides support for different file systems and storage media through a virtual file system application programming interface API that allows access to the supported file systems and storage devices using the same functions calls regardless of the underlying storage format br br br Networking br The Nucleus networking stack is a dual IPv and IPv stack that supports over networking protocols Nucleus networking stack supports POSIX and provides an easy to use socket based application interface A brief list of the supported protocols include br br Internet protocol suite UDP TCP IP br Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP network address translation NAT br Point to Point Protocol PPP and Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet PPPoE br File Transfer Protocol FTP Telnet Secure Shell SSH br Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP Network Time Protocol NTP br Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP and HTTPS br JSON XML WebSockets br br br Security br Nucleus supports a wide variety of encryption options for secure communications to protect data at rest or in transit Nucleus ships with OpenSSL and an OpenSSL like package wolfSSL formerly CyaSSL that is far smaller than OpenSSL for designs needing encryption but limited in memory capacity Security protocols to protect data in

SMP mode for leading and bit heterogeneous multi core SoCs Nucleus is also capable of running as a GOS with Mentor Embedded Hypervisor br When operating in AMP mode Nucleus RTOS can coexist with other instances of Nucleus Linux and or bare machine metal programs distributed on the other processors In this mode each processor is running independently and behaves as a separate system within the SoC Mentor Embedded Multicore Framework provides interprocess communication between operating systems on the various cores and processor life cycle management SMP operation entails having a instantiation of Nucleus RTOS manage multiple cores simultaneously Nucleus can distribute its operations across all cores on a multi core device or any subset of cores For this purpose Nucleus offers runtime API
