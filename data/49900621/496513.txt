The V operating system sometimes written V System is a discontinued microkernel distributed operating system that was developed by faculty and students in the Distributed Systems Group at Stanford University from to led by Professors David Cheriton and Keith A Lantz V was the successor to the Thoth operating system and Verex kernel that Cheriton had developed in the s Despite similar names and close development dates it is unrelated to UNIX System V br br br Features br The key concepts in V are multithreading and synchronous message passing The original V terminology uses process for what is now commonly called a thread and team for what is now commonly called a process consisting of multiple threads sharing an address space Communication between threads in V uses synchronous message passing with short fixed length messages that can include access rights for the receiver to read or write part of the sender s address space before replying The same message passing interface is used both between threads within one process between threads of different processes within one machine and between threads on different machines connected by a local Ethernet A thread receiving a message is not required to reply to it before receiving other messages this distinguished the model from Ada rendezvous br One common pattern for using the messaging facility is for clients to send messages to a server requesting some form of service From the client side this looks much like a remote procedure call RPC The convenience of an automatic stub generator was lacking but in contrast the client can pass one parameter by reference which is not possible with other RPC implementations From the server side the model differs more from RPC since by default all client requests are multiplexed onto one server thread The server is free to explicitly fork threads to handle client requests in parallel however if this is done the server side model is much like RPC too br V was never an end in itself for the Stanford group rather it was used as a vehicle for many different research projects in distributed operating systems and networking Much like other operating system efforts of its day such as Sprite V was a complete system that was mostly self hosting Many students ran V as the only operating system on their diskless SUN workstations or MicroVAX workstations Compiles could be done either on V or on VAX Unix machines that provided file service in a more stable environment than the ever changing research system br V did have some notable impacts After the initial implementation on one computer the Versatile Message Transaction Protocol VMTP was developed to extend the send receive reply system call semantics over a local area network br The protocol included multicast support developed by Steve Deering as a graduate student in the group The Internet Protocol layer to support this evolved into the IP multicast standard br The V System was used for graphical user interface GUI research The Virtual Graphics Terminal Service VGTS provided a modular windowing system for both local and remote applications The little known W Window System got its name because it was first hosted on the V operating system and the better known X Window System in turn got its name because its first version was based partly on W br V also spawned another pure microkernel effort at Apple Computer known as Vanguard which added a number of improvements to the basic system Vanguard later disappeared in a reorganization br The Tektronix VM television measurement instrument was developed in a networked V environment in the late s and ran a lightly modified version of the V operating system this device was manufactured and sold for many years br Ridge Computers Ridge Operating System ROS was a commercial system based on Stanford s V System br br br Commands br The following is a list of workstation commands that are supported by the V operating system version command line interface br br br br br br External links br V System documentation at Bitsavers org
