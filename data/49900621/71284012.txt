OpenAtom OpenHarmony or abbreviated as OpenHarmony OHOS is a family of open source distributed operating systems based on HarmonyOS derived from LiteOS donated the L L branch source code by Huawei to the OpenAtom Foundation Similar to HarmonyOS the open source distributed operating system is designed with a layered architecture which consists of four layers from the bottom to the top i e the kernel layer system service layer framework layer and application layer It is also an extensive collection of free software which can be used as an operating system or can be used in parts with other operating systems via Kernel Abstraction Layer subsystems br OpenHarmony supports various devices running a mini system such as printers speakers smartwatches and any other smart device with memory as small as KB or running a standard system with memory greater than MB br The system contains the basic and some advanced capabilities of HarmonyOS such as DSoftBus technology with distributed device virtualization platform that is a departure from traditional virtualised guest OS for connected devices br The operating system is oriented towards the Internet of things IoT and embedded devices market with a diverse range of device support including smartphones tablets smart TVs smart watches personal computers and other smart devices br br br History br The first version of OpenHarmony was launched by the OpenAtom Foundation on September after receiving a donation of the open source code from Huawei br In December the OpenAtom Foundation and Runhe Software officially launched OpenHarmony open source project with seven units including Huawei and Software Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences br The OpenHarmony Canary version was launched in June supporting a variety of smart terminal devices br Based on its earlier version OpenAtom Foundation launched OpenHarmony on September and brought substantial improvements over the past version to optimize the operating system br A release of OpenHarmony supporting devices with up to GB RAM was made available in April br OpenAtom Foundation added a UniProton kernel a hardware based real time operating system into its repo as part of the Kernel subsystem of the OpenHarmony operating system as an add on on August br br br Development br The primary IDE known as DevEco Studio to build OpenHarmony applications with OpenHarmony SDK full development kit that includes a comprehensive set of development tools including a debugger tester system via DevEco Testing a repository with software libraries for software development an embedded device emulator previewer documentation sample code and tutorials br Applications for OpenHarmony are mostly built using components of ArkUI a Declarative User Interface framework ArkUI elements are adaptable to various custom open source hardware and industry hardware devices and include new interface rules with automatic updates along with HarmonyOS updates br Hardware development is developed using DevEco Studio via DevEco Device tool for building on OpenHarmony also creating distros with operating system development with toolchains provided including verification certification processes for the platform as well as customising the operating system as an open source variant compared to original closed distro variant HarmonyOS that primarily focus on HarmonyOS Connect partners with Huawei br OpenHarmony Application Binary Interface ABI ensures compatibility across various OpenHarmony powered devices with diverse set of chipset instruction set platforms br HDC OpenHarmony Device Connector is a command line tool tailored for developers working with OpenHarmony devices The BM command tool component of HDC tool is used to facilitate debugging by developers After entering in the HDC shell command the BM tool can be utilised br Like HarmonyOS OpenHarmony uses App Pack files suffixed with app also known as APP files on AppGallery and third party distribution application stores on OpenHarmony based and non OpenHarmony operating systems such as Linux based Unity Operating System which is beneficial for interoperability and compatibility Each App Pack has one or more HarmonyOS Ability Packages HAP containing code for their abilities resources libraries and a JSON file with configuration information br While incorporating the OpenHarmony layer for running the APP files developed based on HarmonyOS APIs the operating system utilizes the main Linux kernel for bigger memory devices as well as the RTOS based LiteOS kernel for smaller memory constrained devices as well as add ons custom kernels in distros in the Kernel Abstract Layer KAL subsystem that is not kernel dependent nor instruction set dependent For webview applications it incorporates ArkWeb software engine as of API release at system level for security enhancing Chromium Embedded Framework nweb software engine that facilitated Blink based Chromium in API br Unlike with open source Android operating system with countless third party dependency packages repeatedly built into the apps at a disadvantage when it comes to fragmentation The OpenHarmony central repositories with the Special Interest Group at OpenAtom governance provides commonly used third party public repositories for developers in the open source environment which brings greater interoperability and compatibility with OpenHarmony based operating systems Apps does not require repeated built in third party dependencies such as Chromium Unity and Unreal Engine This can greatly reduce the system ROM volume br Harmony Distributed File System HMDFS is a distributed file system designed for large scale data storage and processing that is also used in openEuler It is inspired by the Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS The file system suitable for scenarios where large scale data storage and processing are essential such as IoT applications edge computing and cloud services On Orange Pi OS OHOS the native file system shows LOCAL and shared disk via OpenHarmony s Distributed File System HMDFS br File path root folder for the file system uses instead of traditional in Unix Linux Unix like and on Windows with its DLL Dynamic link library system br Access token manager is an essential component in OpenHarmony based operating systems responsible for unified app permission management based on access tokens Access tokens serve as identifiers for apps containing information such as app ID user ID app privilege level APL and app permissions By default apps can access limited system resources ATM ensures controlled access to sensitive functionalities br OpenHarmony kernel abstract layer employs the third party musl libc library and native APIs providing support for the Portable Operating System Interface POSIX for Linux syscalls within the Linux kernel side and LiteOS kernel that is the inherent part of the original LiteOS design in POSIX API compatibility within multi kernel Kernel Abstract Layer architecture Developers and vendors can create components and applications that work on the kernel based on POSIX standards br OpenHarmony NDK is a toolset that enables developers to incorporate C and C code into their applications Specifically in the case of OpenHarmony the NDK serves as a bridge between the native world C C and the OpenHarmony ecosystem br This NAPI method is a vital importance of open source community of individual developers companies and non profit organisations of stakeholders in manufacturers creating third party libraries for interoperability and compatibility on the operating system native open source and commercial applications development from third party developers between southbound and northbound interface development of richer APIs e g third party Node js Simple DirectMedia Layer Qt framework LLVM compiler FFmpeg etc br br br Timeline br September Initial release of OpenHarmony with support for devices with KB MB RAM br April OpenHarmony release with support for smartphones and other devices with MB GB RAM br October OpenHarmony release with support for additional devices with GB RAM br
