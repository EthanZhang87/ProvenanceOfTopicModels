title: Terminal emulator
id: 53540
A terminal emulator or terminal application is a computer program that emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture Though typically synonymous with a shell or text terminal the term terminal covers all remote terminals including graphical interfaces A terminal emulator inside a graphical user interface is often called a terminal window br A terminal window allows the user access to a text terminal and all its applications such as command line interfaces CLI and text user interface TUI applications These may be running either on the same machine or on a different one via telnet ssh dial up or over a direct serial connection On Unix like operating systems it is common to have one or more terminal windows connected to the local machine br Terminals usually support a set of escape sequences for controlling color cursor position etc Examples include the family of terminal control sequence standards known as ECMA ANSI X or ISO IEC br br br Background br In the early days of computing with the advent of interactive computing the prevailing model involved a central computer connected to multiple terminals This configuration known as the centralized or mainframe model featured a powerful central computer that performed all the processing tasks while terminals served as input output devices for users to interact with the system These systems were initially character based br br br Character oriented terminals br br br Emulators br When personal computers became ubiquitous in the s they offered the option of running software on the user s personal computer providing an opportunity to replace the expensive and space consuming hardware terminals with something that had additional functions Immediately software became available that could emulate the functions of the hardware terminals on a PC Examples of such software for DOS were Telix or Telemate which was published in and could emulate a DEC VT terminal br Workstations usually running versions of Unix also became common in the s Unix systems usually provided access to the command line with locally attached or dial up terminals Unix workstations were designed to be used primarily through a graphical user interface GUI to provide access to the command line the GUI included terminal emulator applications that behaved like locally attached terminals br During the s new operating systems like Windows and OS arrived providing the technical background for more terminal emulators like Telix for Windows ZOC for OS or PuTTY which was initially released for Windows in and which together with its derivates is still one a very popular choice to this day br Through the success of Linux especially running on data centers and cloud servers the necessity of accessing remote computers through character based terminals remains This is evident in the fact that today lists of terminal emulators that could serve as alternative to the aforementioned PuTTY offers over alternatives br br br Examples of terminals emulated br Many terminal emulators have been developed for terminals such as VT VT VT VT IBM E IBM IBM G Data General D Hewlett Packard HP Sperry Unisys series UTS Burroughs Unisys A series T TD ET ADDS ViewPoint Sun console QNX AT SCO ANSI SNI Televideo and Wyse Additionally programs have been developed to emulate other terminal emulators such as xterm and assorted console terminals e g for Linux Finally some emulators simply refer to a standard such as ANSI Such programs are available on many platforms ranging from DOS and Unix to Windows and macOS to embedded operating systems found in cellphones and industrial hardware br br br Implementation details br br br Unix like systems br In the past Unix and Unix like systems used serial port devices such as RS ports and provided dev device files for them br With terminal emulators those device files are emulated by using a pair of pseudoterminal devices This pair is used to emulate a physical port connection to the host computing endpoint computer s hardware provided by operating system APIs some other software like rlogin telnet or SSH or else For example in Linux systems these would be dev ptyp for the master side and dev ttyp for the slave side pseudoterminal devices respectively br There are also special virtual console files like dev console In text mode writing to the file displays text on the virtual console and reading from the file returns text the user writes to the virtual console As with other text terminals there are also special escape sequences control characters and functions that a program can use most easily via a library such as ncurses For more complex operations the programs can use console and terminal special ioctl system calls One can compare devices using the patterns vcs virtual console screen and vcsa virtual console screen with attributes such as dev vcs and dev vcsa br Some terminal emulators also include escape sequences for configuring the behavior of the terminal to facilitate good interoperation between the terminal and programs running inside of it for example to configure paste bracketing br The virtual consoles can be configured in the file etc inittab read by init typically it starts the text mode login process getty for several virtual consoles X Window System can be configured in etc inittab or by an X display manager A number of Linux distributions use systemd instead of init which also allows virtual console configuration br br br CLI tools br Typical Linux system programs used to access the virtual consoles include br br chvt to switch the current virtual console br openvt to run a program on a new virtual console br deallocvt to close a currently unused virtual console br br br Local echo br br Terminal emulators may implement a local echo function which may erroneously be named half duplex or still slightly incorrectly echoplex which is formally an error detection mechanism rather than an input display option br br br Line at a time mode Local editing br br Terminal emulators may implement local editing also known as line at a time mode This is also mistakenly referred to as half duplex In this mode the terminal emulator only sends complete lines of input to the host system The user enters and edits a line but it is held locally within the terminal emulator as it is being edited It is not transmitted until the user signals its completion usually with the Enter key on the keyboard or a send button of some sort in the user interface At that point the entire line is transmitted Line at a time mode implies local echo since otherwise the user will not be able to see the line as it is being edited and constructed However line at a time mode is independent of echo mode and does not require local echo When entering a password for example line at a time entry with local editing is possible but local echo is turned off otherwise the password would be displayed br The complexities of line at a time mode are exemplified by the line at a time mode option in the telnet protocol To implement it correctly the Network Virtual Terminal implementation provided by the terminal emulator program must be capable of recognizing and properly dealing with interrupt and abort events that arrive in the middle of locally editing a line br br br Synchronous terminals br br In asynchronous terminals data can flow in any direction at any time In synchronous terminals a protocol controls who may send data when IBM based terminals used with IBM mainframe computers are an example of synchronous terminals They operate in an essentially screen at a time mode also known as block mode Users can make numerous changes to a page before submitting the updated screen to the remote machine as a single action br Terminal emulators that simulate the protocol are available for most operating systems for use both by those administering systems such as the z as well as those using the corresponding applications such as CICS br Other examples of synchronous terminals include the IBM ICL Honeywell Bull VIP and Hewlett Packard br br br Virtual consoles br br Virtual consoles also called virtual terminals are emulated text terminals using the keyboard and monitor of a personal computer or workstation The word text is key since virtual consoles are not GUI terminals and they do not run inside a graphical interface Virtual consoles are found on most Unix like systems They are primarily used to access and interact with servers without using a graphical desktop
