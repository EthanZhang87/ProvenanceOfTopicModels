Ultrix officially all caps ULTRIX is the brand name of Digital Equipment Corporation s DEC discontinued native Unix operating systems for the PDP VAX MicroVAX and DECstations br br br History br The initial development of Unix occurred on DEC equipment notably DEC PDP and PDP Programmable Data Processor systems Later DEC computers such as their VAX also offered Unix The first port to VAX UNIX V was finished in not long after the October announcement of the VAX for which at that time DEC only supplied its own proprietary operating system VMS br DEC s Unix Engineering Group UEG was started by Bill Munson with Jerry Brenner and Fred Canter both from DEC s Customer Service Engineering group Bill Shannon from Case Western Reserve University and Armando Stettner from Bell Labs Other later members of UEG included Joel Magid Bill Doll and Jim Barclay recruited from DEC s marketing and product management groups br Under Canter s direction UEG released V M a modified version of Unix th Edition q v br In The New York Times reported that Ultrix was POSIX compliant br br br BSD br Shannon and Stettner worked on low level CPU and device driver support initially on UNIX V but quickly moved to concentrate on working with the University of California Berkeley s BSD Berkeley s Bill Joy came to New Hampshire to work with Shannon and Stettner to wrap up a new BSD release UEG s machine was the first to run the new Unix labeled BSD as was the tape Bill Joy took with him The thinking was that BSD would be the next version university lawyers thought it would be better to call it BSD After the completion of BSD Bill Joy left Berkeley to work at Sun Microsystems Shannon later moved from New Hampshire to join him Stettner stayed at DEC and later conceived of and started the Ultrix project br Shortly after IBM announced plans for a native UNIX product Stettner and Bill Doll presented plans for DEC to make a native VAX Unix product available to its customers DEC founder Ken Olsen agreed br br br V m br DEC s first native UNIX product was V M for modified or V M for the PDP and was based on Version Unix from Bell Labs V M was developed by DEC s original Unix Engineering Group UEG work was done primarily by Fred Canter and Jerry Brenner with their teammates Stettner Bill Burns Mary Anne Cacciola and Bill Munson V M contained many fixes to the kernel including support for separate instruction and data spaces significant work for hardware error recovery and many device drivers Much work was put into producing a release that would reliably bootstrap from many tape drives or disk drives V M was well respected in the Unix community UEG evolved into the group that later developed Ultrix br br br First release of Ultrix br The first native VAX UNIX product from DEC was Ultrix based on BSD with some non kernel features from System V and was released in June Ultrix was primarily the brainchild of Armando Stettner It provided a Berkley based native VAX Unix on a broad array of hardware configurations without the need to access kernel sources A further goal was to enable better support by DEC s field software and systems support engineers through better hardware support system messages and documentation It also incorporated several modifications and scripts from Usenet UUCP experience Later Ultrix incorporated support for DECnet and other proprietary DEC protocols such as LAT It did not support VAXclustering Given Western Electric AT T Unix licensing DEC and others were restricted to selling binary only licenses A significant part of the engineering work was in making the systems relatively flexible and configurable despite their binary only nature br DEC provided Ultrix on three platforms PDP minicomputers where Ultrix was one of many available operating systems from DEC VAX based computers where Ultrix was one of two primary OS choices and the Ultrix only DECstation workstations and DECsystem servers Note that the DECstation and the later DECsystem products as opposed to DEC s original DECsystem line used MIPS processors and predate the much later Alpha based systems br br br Later releases of Ultrix br The V m product was later renamed to Ultrix to establish the family with Ultrix but as the PDP faded from view Ultrix became known simply as Ultrix When the MIPS versions of Ultrix was released the VAX and MIPS versions were referred to as VAX ULTRIX and RISC ULTRIX respectively Much engineering emphasis was placed on supportability and reliable operations including continued work on CPU and device driver support which was for the most part also sent to UC Berkeley hardware failure support and recovery with enhancement to error message text documentation and general work at both the kernel and systems program levels Later Ultrix incorporated some features from BSD and optionally included DECnet and SNA in addition to the standard TCP IP and both the SMTP and DEC s Mail protocols br Notably Ultrix implemented the inter process communication IPC facilities found in System V named pipes messages semaphores and shared memory While the converged Unix from the Sun and AT T alliance that spawned the Open Software Foundation or OSF released late put BSD features into System V DEC as described in Stettner s original Ultrix plans took the best from System V and added it to a BSD base br Originally on the VAX workstations Ultrix had a desktop environment called UWS Ultrix Worksystem Software which was based on X and the Ultrix Window Manager Later the widespread version of the X Window System X was added using a window manager and widget toolkit named XUI X User Interface which was also used on VMS releases of the time Eventually Ultrix also provided the Motif toolkit and Motif Window Manager br Ultrix ran on multiprocessor systems from both the VAX and DECsystem families Ultrix supported SCSI disks and tapes and also proprietary Digital Storage Systems Interconnect and CI peripherals employing DEC s Mass Storage Control Protocol although lacking the OpenVMS distributed lock manager it did not support concurrent access from multiple Ultrix systems DEC also released a combination hardware and software product named Prestoserv which accelerated NFS file serving to allow better performance for diskless workstations to communicate to a file serving Ultrix host The kernel supported symmetric multiprocessing while not being fully multithreaded based upon pre Ultrix work by Armando Stettner and earlier work by George H Goble at Purdue University As such there was liberal use of locking and some tasks could only be done by particular CPUs e g the processing of interrupts This was not uncommon in other SMP implementations of that time e g SunOS Also Ultrix was slow to support many then new or emerging Unix system capabilities found on competing Unix systems e g it never supported shared libraries or dynamically linked executables and a delay in implementing bind BSD system calls and libraries The absence of memory mapped file support was regarded as a particular deficiency with Ultrix in comparison to its competitors in the early s br br br Last release br As part of its commitment to the OSF Armando Stettner went to DEC s Cambridge Research Labs to work on the port of OSF to DEC s RISC based DECstation workstation This was released in with a Mach based kernel for the MIPS architecture A port of Ultrix to Alpha was carried out during the initial development of the Alpha architecture but was never released as a product Later DEC replaced Ultrix with OSF on Alpha ending Unix development on the MIPS and VAX platforms br The last major release of Ultrix was version in which supported all previously supported DECstations and VAXen There were some subsequent Y K patches br br br Application software br WordMARC a scientifically oriented word processor was among the application packages available for Ultrix br The following shells were provided
