Versatile Real Time Executive VRTX is a real time operating system RTOS developed and marketed by the company Mentor Graphics VRTX is suitable for both traditional board based embedded systems and system on a chip SoC architectures It has been superseded by the Nucleus RTOS br br br History br The VRTX operating system began as a product of Hunter Ready a company founded by James Ready and Colin Hunter in which later became Ready Systems This firm later merged with Microtec Research in and went public in This firm was then acquired by Mentor Graphics in and VRTX became a Mentor product br The VRTX operating system was released in September br Since the s the chief rival to VRTX has been VxWorks a Wind River Systems product VxWorks had its start in the mid s as compiler and assembly language tools to supplement VRTX named VRTX works or VxWorks Later Wind River created their own real time kernel offering similar to VRTX br br br VRTX br VRTX comes in several flavors br br VRTX bit VRTX for Z etc br VRTX bit VRTX for M K AMD K etc br MPV Multiprocessor VRTX for distributed applications such as distributed across VME backplanes br VRTX mc Micro Controller VRTX for small systems needing minimal memory use br VRTX oc On chip VRTX freeware community source code for personal and academic use license required for commercial use br VRTX sa Scalable Architecture VRTX for full operating system features Loosely based on Carnegie Mellon University s Mach microkernel principles br SPECTRA Virtual machine VM implementation for running a VRTX VM on Unix like hosts Also includes an open integrated development environment allowing third party tools open access to cross development resources br Most companies developing software with VRTX use reduced instruction set computer RISC microprocessors including ARM MIPS PowerPC or others br br br Implementations br VRTX runs the Hubble Space Telescope br VRTX runs the Wide Area Augmentation System br VRTX was the first operating system ported to the AMD Am br VRTX is used as a core for the Motorola proprietary P K operating system which runs on most company devices since the Motorola V and T i up to the Motorola RAZR V x It runs on several hardware platforms including LTE Motorola V V V E RAZR V and others featuring the ARM processor LTE Motorola L and upcoming devices with x screen resolution Rainbow POG G phones featuring an MCORE processor from Motorola E to RAZR V x Argon all new G phones with MHz ARM processor since Motorola RAZR MAXX V and V xx and others br br br See also br List of telescope parts and construction br Xenomai is a real time development software framework cooperating with the Linux kernel It could be used to port the VRTX based system to Linux although not all features are supported br VRTX has reached end of life an automated porting tool named OS Changer is available to reuse the code on a modern OS br br br br br br External links br Official website Mentor Graphics
