UNICOS is a range of Unix and later Linux operating system OS variants developed by Cray for its supercomputers UNICOS is the successor of the Cray Operating System COS It provides network clustering and source code compatibility layers for some other Unixes UNICOS was originally introduced in with the Cray system and later ported to other Cray models The original UNICOS was based on UNIX System V Release and had many Berkeley Software Distribution BSD features e g computer networking and file system enhancements added to it br br br Development br CX OS was the original name given to what is now UNICOS This was a prototype system which ran on a Cray X MP in before the Cray port It was used to demonstrate the feasibility of using Unix on a supercomputer system before Cray hardware was available br The operating system revamp was part of a larger movement inside Cray Research to modernize their corporate software including rewriting their most important Fortran compiler cft to cft in a higher level language Pascal with more modern optimizations and vectorizations br As a migration path for existing COS customers wishing to transition to UNICOS a Guest Operating System GOS capability was introduced into COS The only guest OS that was ever supported was UNICOS A COS batch job would be submitted to start up UNICOS which would then run as a subsystem under COS using a subset of the systems CPUs memory and peripheral devices The UNICOS that ran under GOS was exactly the same as when it ran stand alone the difference was that the kernel would make certain low level hardware requests through the COS GOS hook rather than directly to the hardware br One of the sites that ran very early versions of UNICOS was Bell Labs where Unix pioneers including Dennis Ritchie ported parts of their Eighth Edition Unix including STREAMS input output I O to UNICOS They also experimented with a guest facility within UNICOS allowing the stand alone version of the OS to host itself br br br Releases br Cray released several different OSs under the name UNICOS including br br UNICOS the original Cray Unix based on System V Used on the Cray Cray X MP Y MP C etc br UNICOS MAX a Mach based microkernel used on the T D s processing elements together with UNICOS on the host Y MP or C system br UNICOS mk a serverized version of UNICOS using the Chorus microkernel to make a distributed operating system Used on the T E This was the last Cray OS really based on UNICOS sources as the following products were based on different sources and simply used the UNICOS name br UNICOS mp not derived from UNICOS but based on IRIX Used on the X br UNICOS lc not derived from UNICOS but based on SUSE Linux Used on the XT XT and XT UNICOS lc x comprises a combination of br the compute elements run the Catamount microkernel which itself is based on Cougaar br the service elements run SUSE Linux br Cray Linux Environment CLE from release onward UNICOS lc is now called Cray Linux Environment br the compute elements run Compute Node Linux CNL which is a customized Linux kernel br the service elements run SUSE Linux Enterprise Server br br br See also br br Scientific Linux a Linux distribution by Fermilab and CERN br Rocks Cluster Distribution a Linux distribution for supercomputers br br br br br UNICOS Release Overview Cray Inc Archived from the original on Retrieved br UNICOS mk Release Overview Cray Inc Archived from the original on Retrieved br UNICOS mp Release Overview Cray Inc Archived from the original on Retrieved br Cray XT System Software Release Overview Cray Inc Archived from the original on Retrieved br Gannett Fred Cray Supercomputer FAQ and other documents br Ritchie Dennis September Experiences with the Cray X MP Archived from the original on
