id: 49900621
Redox is a Unix like microkernel operating system written in the programming language Rust which has a focus on safety stability and performance Redox aims to be secure usable and free Redox is inspired by prior kernels and operating systems such as SeL MINIX Plan and BSD It is free and open source software distributed under an MIT License br Redox gets its name from the reduction oxidation reactions in chemistry one redox reaction is the corrosion of iron also called rust br br br Design br The Redox operating system is designed to be secure This is reflected in two design decisions br br Using the programming language Rust for implementation br Using a microkernel design similar to MINIX br br br Components br Redox provides packages memory allocator file system display manager core utilities etc that together make up a functional operating system Redox relies on an ecosystem of software written in Rust by members of the project br br Redox kernel derives from the concept of microkernels with inspiration from MINIX br Ralloc memory allocator br RedoxFS file system inspired by the ZFS file system br Ion shell the underlying library for shells and command execution in Redox and the default shell br pkgutils package manager br Orbital windowing system display and window manager sets up the orbital scheme manages the display and handles requests for window creation redraws and event polling br relibc C standard library br br br Command line applications br Redox supports command line interface CLI programs including br br Sodium vi like editor that provides syntax highlighting br br br Graphical applications br Redox supports graphical user interface GUI programs including br br NetSurf a lightweight web browser which uses its own layout engine br Calculator a software calculator which provides functions similar to the Windows Calculator program br Editor simple text editor similar to Microsoft Notepad br File Browser a file manager that displays icons names sizes and details for files uses the launcher command to open files when they are clicked br Image Viewer Image viewer for simple file types br Pixelcannon D renderer can be used to benchmark the Orbital desktop br Orbterm ANSI type terminal emulator br br br History br Redox was created by Jeremy Soller and was first published on April on GitHub As of July the Redox repository had a total of contributors br br br br br br External links br Official website br Official GitLab instance br Redox on GitHub br Redox at Open Hub
