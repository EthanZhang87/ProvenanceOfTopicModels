id: 2361143
Eclipse ThreadX formerly named Azure RTOS and ThreadX is a highly deterministic embedded real time operating system RTOS programmed mostly in the language C br br br Overview br ThreadX was initially developed and marketed by Express Logic of San Diego California United States The author of ThreadX is William Lamie who was also the original author of the Nucleus RTOS in William Lamie was President and CEO of Express Logic br Express Logic was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Microsoft on April and renamed it to Azure RTOS On November Microsoft announced Azure RTOS would be transitioning to an open source model under the stewardship of the Eclipse Foundation and making the project available under the permissive MIT License With Eclipse Foundation as the new home Azure RTOS was renamed to Eclipse ThreadX or ThreadX in its short form br The name ThreadX is derived from the threads that are used as the executable elements and the letter X represents context switching i e it switches threads ThreadX provides priority based preemptive scheduling fast interrupt response memory management interthread communication mutual exclusion event notification and thread synchronization features Major distinguishing technology characteristics of ThreadX include preemption threshold priority inheritance efficient timer management fast software timers picokernel design event chaining and small size minimal size on an ARM architecture processor is about KB br ThreadX supports multi core processor environments via either asymmetric multiprocessing AMP or symmetric multiprocessing SMP Application thread isolation with memory management unit MMU or memory protection unit MPU memory protection is available with ThreadX Modules br ThreadX has extensive safety certifications from Technischer berwachungsverein T V English Technical Inspection Association and UL formerly Underwriters Laboratories and is Motor Industry Software Reliability Association MISRA C compliant br ThreadX is the foundation of Express Logic s X Ware Internet of things IoT platform which also includes embedded file system support FileX embedded UI support GUIX embedded Internet protocol suite TCP IP and cloud connectivity NetX NetX Duo and Universal Serial Bus USB support USBX ThreadX has won high appraisal from developers and is a very popular RTOS As of according to marketing research firm VDC Research the ThreadX RTOS has become one of the most popular RTOSes in the world having been deployed in over billion devices including consumer electronics medical devices data networking applications and SoCs br br br Supported platforms br br br History br ThreadX was first introduced in ThreadX was introduced in ThreadX was introduced in and is the latest version as of br FileX the embedded file system for ThreadX was introduced in br NetX the embedded TCP IP networking stack for ThreadX was introduced in br USBX the embedded USB support for ThreadX was introduced in br ThreadX SMP for SMP multi core environments was introduced in br ThreadX Modules was introduced in br ThreadX achieved safety certifications for T V IEC in and UL in br GUIX the embedded UI for ThreadX was introduced in br Express Logic was purchased for an undisclosed sum by Microsoft on April br br br Technology br ThreadX implements a priority based preemptive scheduling algorithm with a proprietary feature called preemption threshold The latter has been shown to provide greater granularity within critical sections reduce context switches and has been the subject of academic research on guaranteeing scheduling br ThreadX provides a unique construct called event chaining where the application can register a callback function on all application programming interfaces APIs that can signal an external event This helps applications chain together various public objects in ThreadX such that one thread can effectively block on multiple objects br ThreadX also provides counting semaphores mutexes with optional priority inheritance event flags message queues software timers fixed sized block memory and variable sized block memory All APIs in ThreadX that block on resources also have an optional timeout br ThreadX offers multi core processor support via either AMP or SMP Application code isolation is available through ThreadX Modules component br br br Major components br ThreadX RTOS components include br br Embedded file system br Embedded graphical user interface br Embedded networking br Embedded USB br Safety certification br Packaging br br br Embedded file system br FileX is the embedded file system for ThreadX FileX supports FAT and exFAT formats The latter extends FAT file sizes beyond GB which is especially useful for video files and it requires license directly from Microsoft for use FileX also offers fault tolerance and supports direct NOR and NAND flash memory media through a flash wear leveling product called LevelX br br br Embedded graphical user interface br GUIX is the embedded graphical user interface GUI for ThreadX GUIX provides a D runtime system environment for embedded applications running ThreadX GUIX supports multiple display devices with a variety of screen resolutions and color depths Many predefined graphical widgets are available A Windows WYSIWYG host tool called GUIX Studio automatically generates C code for GUIX to execute at runtime br br br Embedded networking br NetX Duo is the embedded TCP IP system for ThreadX NetX Duo supports both IPv and IPv networking along with protocols such as ARP Auto IP DHCP DNS DNS SD FTP HTTP ICMP IGMP mDNS POP PPP PPPoE RARP TFTP SNTP SMTP SNMP and TELNET IP layer network security is provided by IPsec TCP and UDP socket layer security is provided by TLS and DTLS respectively IoT Cloud protocol support includes CoAP MQTT and LWM M NetX Duo also supports Thread and LoWPAN In ThreadX and NetX Duo became a Thread Certified Product br br br Embedded USB br USBX is the embedded Universal Serial Bus USB system for ThreadX USBX supports both host and device Host controller support includes EHCI OHCI and proprietary USB host controllers USBX also supports OTG USBX class support includes Audio Asix CDC ACM CDC ECM DFU GSER HID PIMA Printer Prolific RNDIS and Storage br br br Safety certification br ThreadX and FileX and NetX Duo have been precertified by SGS T V Saar to the following safety standards br IEC SIL IEC Class C ISO ASIL D and EN SW SIL br ThreadX and FileX and NetX Duo have been precertified by UL to the following safety standards br UL IEC UL IEC UL br ThreadX has also been certified to DO standards by various military and aerospace companies It is supported by popular Transport Layer Security SSL TLS libraries such as wolfSSL br br br Packaging br As of ThreadX is packaged as part of X Ware IoT Platform in full source code and with no runtime royalty payment br br br Products using it br Some high profile products using ThreadX range from small wearable devices to Hewlett Packard printers and even NASA s Deep Impact space probe br The Raspberry Pi line of single board computers runs ThreadX as a binary blob on the graphics processing unit GPU This controls initial booting which in turn is used to boot secondary operating systems such as Linux and continues to operate in a more privileged role even after the boot process
