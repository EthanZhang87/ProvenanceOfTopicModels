PikeOS is a commercial hard real time operating system RTOS which features a separation kernel based hypervisor This hypervisor supports multiple logical partition types for various operating systems OS and applications each referred to as a GuestOS PikeOS is engineered to support the creation of certifiable smart devices for the Internet of Things IoT ensuring compliance with industry standards for quality safety and security across various sectors In instances where memory management units MMU are not present but memory protection units MPU are available on controller based systems PikeOS for MPU is designed for critical real time applications and provides up to standard safety and security br br br Overview br PikeOS was introduced in and combines a real time operating system RTOS with a virtualization platform and Eclipse based integrated development environment IDE for embedded systems It is a commercial clone of the L microkernel family PikeOS has been developed for safety and security critical applications with certification needs in the fields of aerospace defense automotive transport industrial automation medical network infrastructures and consumer electronics The PikeOS separation kernel v is certified against Common Criteria at EAL br One of the key features of PikeOS is its ability to safely execute applications with different safety and security levels concurrently on the same computing platform This is done by strict spatial and temporal segregation of these applications via software partitions A software partition can be seen as a container with pre allocated privileges that can have access to memory central processing unit CPU time input output I O and a predefined list of OS services With PikeOS the term application refers to an executable linked against the PikeOS application programming interface API library and running as a process inside a partition The nature of the PikeOS application programming interface API allows applications to range from simple control loops up to full paravirtualized guest operating systems like Linux or hardware virtualized guests br br Software partitions are also called virtual machines VMs because it is possible to implement a complete guest operating system inside a partition which executes independently from other partitions and thus can address use cases with mixed criticality PikeOS can be seen as a Type hypervisor br br br Supported toolchain IDE CODEO br The Eclipse based IDE CODEO supports system architects with graphical configuration tools providing all the components that software engineers will need to develop embedded applications as well as including comprehensive wizards to help embedded project development in a time saving and cost efficient way br br Guided configuration br Remote debugging down to the hardware instruction level br Target monitoring br Remote application software deployment br Timing analysis br Several dedicated graphical editing views support the system integrator to always keep the overview on important aspects of the PikeOS system configuration showing partition types scheduling communication channels shared memory and IO device configuration within partitions br Projects can be easily defined with the help of reusable templates and distributed to the development groups Users can configure predefined components for their project and can also define and add other components during the development process br br br Main benefits br Real time operating system including Type hypervisor defined for flexible configuration br Supports fast or secure boot br Supporting mixed criticality via separation kernel in one system br Configuration of partitions with time and hardware resources br Kernel driver and user space drivers supported br Hardware independence between processor types and families br Easy migration processes and high portability on single and multi core br Developed to support certification according to multiple safety and security standards br Reduced time to market via standard development and verification tools br No export restriction European solution br br br Certification standards br Safety
