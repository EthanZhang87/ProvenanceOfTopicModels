OpenSolaris is a discontinued open source computer operating system based on Solaris and created by Sun Microsystems It was also perhaps confusingly the name of a project initiated by Sun to build a developer and user community around the eponymous operating system software br OpenSolaris is a descendant of the UNIX System V Release SVR code base developed by Sun and AT T in the late s and is the only version of the System V variant of UNIX available as open source OpenSolaris was developed as a combination of several software consolidations that were open sourced starting with Solaris It includes a variety of free software including popular desktop and server software br After Oracle s acquisition of Sun Microsystems in Oracle discontinued development of OpenSolaris in house pivoting to focus exclusively on the development of the proprietary Solaris Express now Oracle Solaris br Prior to Oracle s close sourcing Solaris a group of former OpenSolaris developers began efforts to fork the core software under the name OpenIndiana The illumos Foundation founded in the wake of the discontinuation of OpenSolaris continues to develop and maintain the kernel and userland of OpenIndiana together renamed illumos while the OpenIndiana Project now under the auspices of the illumos Foundation continues to maintain and develop the illumos based OpenIndiana distribution including its installer and build system as the direct descendant of OpenIndiana Since then additional illumos distributions both commercial and non commercial have appeared and are under active development combining the illumos kernel and userland with custom installers packaging and build systems and other distribution specific utilities and tooling br br br History br br OpenSolaris was based on Solaris which was originally released by Sun in Solaris is a version of UNIX System V Release SVR jointly developed by Sun and AT T to merge features from several existing Unix systems It was licensed by Sun from Novell to replace SunOS br Planning for OpenSolaris started in early A pilot program was formed in September with non Sun community members and ran for months growing to external participants Sun submitted the CDDL Common Development and Distribution License to the OSI which approved it on January br The first part of the Solaris code base to be open sourced was the Solaris Dynamic Tracing facility commonly known as DTrace a tool that aids in the analysis debugging and tuning of applications and systems DTrace was released under the CDDL on January on the newly launched opensolaris org website The bulk of the Solaris system code was released on June There remains some system code that is not open source and is available only as pre compiled binary files br To direct the newly fledged project a Community Advisory Board was announced on April two were elected by the pilot community two were employees appointed by Sun and one was appointed from the broader free software community by Sun The members were Roy Fielding Al Hopper Rich Teer Casper Dik and Simon Phipps On February Sun approved The OpenSolaris Charter which reestablished this body as the independent OpenSolaris Governing Board The task of creating a governance document or constitution for this organization was given to the OGB and three invited members Stephen Hahn and Keith Wesolowski developers in Sun s Solaris organization and Ben Rockwood a prominent OpenSolaris community member The former next generation Solaris OS version under development by Sun to eventually succeed Solaris was codenamed Nevada and was derived from what was the OpenSolaris codebase and this new code was then pulled into new OpenSolaris Nevada snapshot builds While under Sun Microsystems control there were bi weekly snapshots of Solaris Nevada the codename for the next generation Solaris OS to eventually succeed Solaris and this new code was then pulled into new OpenSolaris preview snapshots available at Genunix org The stable releases of OpenSolaris are based on these Nevada builds br Initially Sun s Solaris Express program provided a distribution based on the OpenSolaris code in combination with software found only in Solaris releases The first independent distribution was released on June and many others have emerged since br On March Sun announced that it had hired Ian Murdock founder of Debian to head Project Indiana an effort to produce a complete OpenSolaris distribution with GNOME and userland tools from GNU plus a network based package management system The new distribution was planned to refresh the user experience and would become the successor to Solaris Express as the basis for future releases of Solaris br On May OpenSolaris was released in a format that could be booted as a Live CD or installed directly It uses the GNOME desktop environment as the primary user interface The later OpenSolaris release included a GUI for ZFS snapshotting capabilities known as Time Slider that provides functionality similar to macOS s Time Machine br In December Sun Microsystems and Toshiba America Information Systems announced plans to distribute Toshiba laptops pre installed with OpenSolaris On April the Tecra M and Port g R came preinstalled with OpenSolaris release and several supplemental software packages br On June OpenSolaris was released with support for the SPARC platform br On January it was announced that the Solaris Express program would be closed while an OpenSolaris binary release was scheduled to be released on March The OpenSolaris release never appeared br On August Oracle was rumored to have discontinued the OpenSolaris binary distribution to focus on the Solaris Express binary distribution program Source code would continue to be accepted from the community and Oracle source code would continue to be released into Open Source but Oracle code releases would occur only after binary releases The internal email was released by an OpenSolaris kernel developer but was unconfirmed by Oracle br There was a post confirming the leak posted to the OpenSolaris Forums on August Upstream contributions will continue through a new Oracle website downstream source code publishing will continue and binary distribution will continue under the old Solaris Express model the but release of source code will occur after binary cuts and binary cuts will become less frequent br On September OpenIndiana was formally launched at the JISC Centre in London While OpenIndiana is a fork in the technical sense it is a continuation of OpenSolaris in spirit the project intends to deliver a System V family operating system that is binary compatible with the Oracle products Solaris and Solaris Express However rather than being based around the OS Net consolidation like OpenSolaris was OpenIndiana became a distribution based on illumos the first release is still based around OS Net The project uses the same IPS package management system as OpenSolaris br On November a final build of OpenSolaris b was published by Oracle to the release repository to serve as an upgrade path to Solaris Express br Oracle Solaris Express a preview of Solaris and the first release of the post OpenSolaris distribution from Oracle was released on November br br br Version history br br br Release model br br OpenSolaris was offered as both development unstable and production stable releases br br Development releases were built from the latest OpenSolaris codebase consolidations and included newer technologies security updates and bug fixes and more applications but may not have undergone extensive testing br Production releases were branched from a snapshot of the development codebase following a code freeze and underwent a QA process that includes backporting security updates and bug fixes br OpenSolaris can be installed from CD ROM USB drives or over a network with the Automated Installer CD USB and network install images are made available for both types of releases br br br Repositories br OpenSolaris uses a network aware package management system called the Image Packaging System also known as pkg to add remove and manage installed software and to update to newer releases br Packages for development releases of OpenSolaris were published by Oracle typically every two weeks to the dev repository Production releases use the release repository which does not receive updates until the next production release Only Sun customers with paid support contracts have access to updates for production releases br Paid support for production releases which allows access to security updates and bug fixes was offered by Sun through the support repository on pkg sun com br br br Documentation br A hardware compatibility list HCL for OpenSolaris can be consulted when choosing hardware for OpenSolaris deployment br Extensive OpenSolaris administration usage and development documentation is available online including community contributed information br br br License br br Sun released most of the Solaris source code under the Common Development and Distribution License CDDL which is based on the Mozilla Public License MPL version The CDDL was approved as an open source license by the Open Source Initiative OSI in January Files licensed under the CDDL can be combined with files licensed under other licenses whether open source or proprietary br During Sun s announcement of Java s release under the GNU General Public License GPL Jonathan Schwartz and Rich Green both hinted at the possibility of releasing Solaris under the GPL with Green saying he was certainly not averse to relicensing under the GPL When Schwartz pressed him jokingly Green said Sun would take a very close look at it In January eWeek reported that anonymous sources at Sun had told them OpenSolaris would be dual licensed under CDDL and GPLv Green responded in his blog the next day that the article was incorrect saying that although Sun is giving very serious consideration to such a dual licensing arrangement it would be subject to agreement by the rest of the OpenSolaris community br br br Conferences br The first annual OpenSolaris Developer Conference abbreviated as OSDevCon was organized by the German Unix User Group GUUG and took place from February to March at the Freie Universit t Berlin in Germany The OSDevCon was a joint effort of the GUUG and the Czech OpenSolaris User Group CZOSUG and look place June in Prague Czech Republic The OSDevCon look place October in Dresden Germany br In Sun Microsystems organized the first OpenSolaris Developer Summit which was held on the weekend of October at the University of California Santa Cruz in the United States The OpenSolaris Developer Summit returned to UCSC on May and took place immediately prior to the launch of Sun s new OpenSolaris distribution on May at the CommunityOne conference in San Francisco California br The first OpenSolaris Storage Summit was organized by Sun and held September preceding the SNIA Storage Developer Conference SDC in Santa Clara California The second OpenSolaris Storage Summit preceded the USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies FAST on February in San Francisco United States br On November a Solaris OpenSolaris Security Summit was held by Sun in the Inner Harbor area of Baltimore Maryland preceding the Large Installation System Administration Conference LISA br br br Ports br PowerPC Port Project Polaris experimental PowerPC port based on the previous
