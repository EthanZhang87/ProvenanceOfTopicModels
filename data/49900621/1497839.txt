Firebrand in which became the basis of Interix br The Interix interoperability suite developed by Softway Systems Inc included substantial code from OpenBSD Microsoft acquired Interix in br Microsoft continued to distribute Interix as a standalone product until br Interix release was released as component of Windows Services for Unix SFU in Interix release was released as component of SFU in January br Interix became integrated as a component of the regular Windows OS distribution as a component of Windows Server R in December at release and was a component of the Windows Vista release as release RTM November Windows Server had release Windows and Windows Server R included SUA br Microsoft announced in that Interix would not be included in Windows versions after Windows and customers
