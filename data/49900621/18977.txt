MINIX from mini Unix is a Unix like operating system based on a microkernel architecture Since version it has been POSIX compliant br Early versions of MINIX were created by Andrew S Tanenbaum for educational purposes Starting with MINIX the primary aim of development shifted from education to the creation of a highly reliable and self healing microkernel OS MINIX was developed as open source software br MINIX was first released in with its complete source code made available to universities for study in courses and research It has been free and open source software since it was relicensed under the BSD Clause license in April br br br Implementation br br br MINIX br Andrew S Tanenbaum created MINIX at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam to exemplify the principles conveyed in his textbook Operating Systems Design and Implementation Despite sharing a name it has no relation to the older MINIX from Digital Systems House Inc based on AT T Unix code br An abridged lines of the C source code of the kernel memory manager and file system of MINIX are printed in the book Prentice Hall also released MINIX source code and binaries on floppy disk with a reference manual MINIX was system call compatible with Seventh Edition Unix br Tanenbaum originally developed MINIX for compatibility with the IBM PC and IBM PC AT microcomputers available at the time br br br MINIX br MINIX released in included support for MicroChannel IBM PS systems and was also ported to the Motorola and SPARC architectures supporting the Atari ST Amiga Macintosh and Sun SPARCstation computer platforms There were also unofficial ports to Intel PC compatibles in bit protected mode National Semiconductor NS ARM and Inmos transputer processors Meiko Scientific used an early version of MINIX as the basis for the MeikOS operating system for its transputer based Computing Surface parallel computers br br br MINIX br br Demand for the k architectures waned however and MINIX released in was only available for the x and Solaris hosted SPARC architectures It was the subject of the second edition of Tanenbaum s textbook cowritten with Albert Woodhull and was distributed on a CD ROM included with the book MINIX added POSIX compliance support for and later processors in bit mode and replaced the Amoeba network protocols included in MINIX with a TCP IP stack A version of MINIX running as a user process under SunOS and Solaris was also available a simulator named SMX operating system or just SMX for short br Version was released in May It was the first version after MINIX had been relicensed under the BSD Clause license which was retroactively applied to all previous versions br br br Minix vmd br Minix vmd is a variant of MINIX for Intel IA compatible processors created by two Vrije Universiteit researchers which adds virtual memory and support for the X Window System br br br MINIX br br MINIX was publicly announced on October by Tanenbaum during his keynote speech at the Association for Computing Machinery ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles SOSP Although it still serves as an example for the new edition of Tanenbaum s textbook coauthored by Albert S Woodhull it is comprehensively redesigned to be usable as a serious system on resource limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability br MINIX currently supports IA and ARM architecture systems It is available in a live CD format that allows it to be used on a computer without installing it on the hard drive and in versions compatible with hardware emulating and virtualizing systems including Bochs QEMU VMware Workstation and Fusion VirtualBox and Microsoft Virtual PC br Version was released on April It was the first version after MINIX had been relicensed under the BSD Clause license with a new fourth clause br Version was released on November It contains X emacs vi cc gcc perl python ash bash zsh ftp ssh telnet pine and over other common Unix utility programs With the addition of X this version marks the transition away from a text only system In many cases it can automatically restart a crashed driver without affecting running processes In this way MINIX is self healing and can be used in applications demanding high reliability MINIX also has support for virtual memory management making it suitable for desktop OS use Desktop applications such as Firefox and OpenOffice org are not yet available for MINIX however br As of version the userland was mostly replaced by that of NetBSD and support from pkgsrc became possible increasing the available software applications that MINIX can use Clang replaced the prior compiler with GCC now having to be manually compiled and GDB the GNU debugger was ported br MINIX released in September brought ARM support br MINIX RC Release Candidates became available in January However a stable release of MINIX is yet to be announced and MINIX development has been dormant since br MINIX supports many programming languages including C C FORTRAN Modula Pascal Perl Python and Tcl br Over people attended MINIXCon a conference to discuss the history and future of MINIX br All Intel chipsets post are running MINIX internally as the software component of the Intel Management Engine br br br Relationship with Linux br br br Early influence br Linus Torvalds used and appreciated MINIX but his design deviated from the MINIX architecture in significant ways most notably by employing a monolithic kernel instead of a microkernel This was disapproved of by Tanenbaum in the Tanenbaum Torvalds debate Tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in May br Early Linux kernel development was done on a MINIX host system which led to Linux inheriting various features from MINIX such as the MINIX file system Eric Raymond claimed that Linus hasn t actually written Linux from scratch but rather reused source code of MINIX itself to have working codebase As the development progressed MINIX code was gradually phased out completely br br br Samizdat claims br In May Kenneth Brown of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution made the accusation that major parts of the Linux kernel had been copied from the MINIX codebase in a book named Samizdat These accusations were rebutted universally most prominently by Tanenbaum who strongly criticised Brown and published a long rebuttal on his own personal Web site also claiming that Brown was funded by Microsoft br br br Licensing br At the time of MINIX s original development its license was relatively liberal Its licensing fee was very small relative to those of other operating systems Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as accessible as possible to students but his publisher was unwilling to offer material such as the source code that could be copied freely so a restrictive license requiring a nominal fee included in the price of Tanenbaum s book was applied as a compromise This prevented the use of MINIX as the basis for a freely distributed software system br When free and open source Unix like operating systems such as Linux and BSD became available in the early s many volunteer software developers abandoned MINIX in favor of these In April MINIX became free and open source software under the BSD Clause license which was retroactively applied to all previous versions However by this time other operating systems had surpassed its capabilities and it remained primarily an operating system for students and hobbyists In late MINIX was relicensed with a fourth clause added to the BSD Clause
