Tru UNIX is a discontinued bit UNIX operating system for the Alpha instruction set architecture ISA currently owned by Hewlett Packard HP Previously Tru UNIX was a product of Compaq and before that Digital Equipment Corporation DEC where it was known as Digital UNIX originally DEC OSF AXP br As its original name suggests Tru UNIX is based on the OSF operating system DEC s previous UNIX product was known as Ultrix and was based on BSD br It is unusual among commercial UNIX implementations as it is built on top of the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University Other UNIX and UNIX like implementations built on top of the Mach kernel are GNU Hurd NeXTSTEP MkLinux macOS and Apple iOS br Tru UNIX required the SRM boot firmware found on Alpha based computer systems br br br DEC OSF AXP br In Digital Equipment Corporation DEC joined with IBM Hewlett Packard and others to form the Open Software Foundation OSF A primary aim was to develop a version of Unix named OSF to compete with System V Release from AT T Corporation and Sun Microsystems After DEC s first release OSF Release in January for their line of MIPS based DECstation workstations DEC ported OSF to their new Alpha AXP platform as DEC OSF AXP and this was the first version Release of what is most commonly referred to as OSF DEC OSF AXP Release was shipped in March OSF AXP was a full bit operating system and the native UNIX implementation for the Alpha architecture After OSF AXP V onwards UNIX System V compatibility was also integrated into the system br br br Digital UNIX br br In starting with release DEC renamed OSF AXP to Digital UNIX to reflect its conformance with the X Open Single UNIX Specification br br br Tru UNIX br After Compaq s purchase of DEC in early with the release of version F Digital UNIX was renamed to Tru UNIX to emphasise its bit clean nature and de emphasise the Digital brand br In April Compaq announced that Tru UNIX successfully ran on Intel s IA simulator However this port was cancelled a few months later br A Chinese version of Tru UNIX named COSIX was jointly developed by Compaq and China National Computer Software Technology Service Corporation CS S It was released in br br br TruCluster Server br From release V Tru UNIX offered a clustering facility named TruCluster Server TruCluster utilised a cluster wide filesystem visible to each cluster member plus member specific storage and an optional quorum disk Member specific files paths were enhanced symbolic links incorporating the member id of the owning member Each member had one or zero votes which combined with a possible quorum disk implemented a cluster formation algorithm similar to that found in OpenVMS br br br End of Life br With their purchase of Compaq in HP announced their intention to migrate many of Tru UNIX s more innovative features including its AdvFS TruCluster and LSM to HP UX In December HP announced a change of plan they would instead use the Veritas File System and abandon the Tru advanced features In the process many of the remaining Tru developers were laid off br The last maintenance release B was released in October br In October HP stated that they would continue to support Tru UNIX until December br In HP contributed the AdvFS filesystem to the open source community br br br Versions br These versions were released for Alpha AXP platforms br br br br br br External links br br Tru UNIX HP s official Tru UNIX site br Tru FAQ from UNIXguide net br comp unix tru Newsgroup on running owning and administering Tru UNIX web accessible via Google Groups br comp unix osf osf Newsgroup on running owning and administering OSF web accessible via Google Groups br HP Tru Unix man pages and shell accounts provided by Polarhome
