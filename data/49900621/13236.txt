GNU Hurd is a collection of microkernel servers written as part of GNU for the GNU Mach microkernel It has been under development since by the GNU Project of the Free Software Foundation designed as a replacement for the Unix kernel and released as free software under the GNU General Public License When the Linux kernel proved to be a viable solution development of GNU Hurd slowed at times alternating between stasis and renewed activity and interest br The Hurd s design consists of a set of protocols and server processes or daemons in Unix terminology that run on the GNU Mach microkernel The Hurd aims to surpass the Unix kernel in functionality security and stability while remaining largely compatible with it The GNU Project chose the multiserver microkernel for the operating system due to perceived advantages over the traditional Unix monolithic kernel architecture a view that had been advocated by some developers in the s br br br Name and logo br In December the primary architect of the Hurd described the name as a mutually recursive acronym br br It s time to explain the meaning of Hurd Hurd stands for Hird of Unix Replacing Daemons And then Hird stands for Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth We have here to my knowledge the first software to be named by a pair of mutually recursive acronyms br As both hurd and hird are homophones of the English word herd the full name GNU Hurd is also a play on the words herd of gnus reflecting how the kernel works br The logo is called the Hurd boxes and it also reflects on architecture The logo is a graph where nodes represent the Hurd kernel s servers and directed edges are IPC messages br br br Development history br Richard Stallman founded the GNU Project in September with an aim to create a free GNU operating system Initially the components required for kernel development were written editors shell compiler debugger etc By the GPL came into being and the only major component missing was the kernel br Development on the Hurd began in after an abandoned kernel attempt in based on the research TRIX operating system developed by Professor Steve Ward and his group at MIT s Laboratory for Computer Science LCS According to Thomas Bushnell the initial Hurd architect their early plan was to adapt the BSD Lite kernel and in hindsight It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today In Richard Stallman proposed using the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon University Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license br With the release of the Linux kernel in the primary user of GNU s userland components soon became operating systems based on the Linux kernel Linux distributions prompting the coining of the term GNU Linux br Development of the Hurd has proceeded slowly Despite an optimistic announcement by Stallman in predicting a release of GNU Hurd later that year the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments Development in general has not met expectations and there are still a significant number of bugs and missing features This has resulted in a poorer product than many including Stallman had expected In after twenty years under development Stallman said that he was not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd It makes some progress but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems but added that finishing it is not crucial for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed Linux and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a free operating system device support br The Debian project among others have worked on the Hurd project to produce binary distributions of Hurd based GNU operating systems for IBM PC compatible systems br After years of stagnation development picked up again in and with four releases during these two years but no more since then br On August amid the Google Summer of Code it was announced that GNU Guix had been ported to GNU Hurd br br br Architecture br br Unlike most Unix like kernels the Hurd uses a server client architecture built on a microkernel that is responsible for providing the most basic kernel services coordinating access to the hardware the CPU through process management and scheduling RAM via memory management and other various input output devices via I O scheduling for sound graphics mass storage etc In theory the microkernel design would allow for all device drivers to be built as servers working in user space but today most drivers of this kind are still contained in the GNU Mach kernel space br According to Hurd developers the main advantage of microkernel based design is the ability to extend the system developing a new module would not require in depth knowledge of the rest of the kernel and a bug in one module would not crash the entire system Hurd provides a concept of translators a framework of modules used to extend a file system functionality br From early on the Hurd was developed to use GNU Mach as the microkernel This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman who thought it would speed up the work by saving a large part of it He has admitted that he was wrong about that Other Unix like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF Lites and MkLinux macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach br br br Other microkernels br From onward various efforts were launched to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels The L microkernel was the original choice in but progress slowed to a halt Nevertheless during Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L Hurd port and Marcus Brinkmann ported essential parts of glibc namely getting the process startup code working allowing programs to run thus allowing the first user programs trivial ones such as the hello world program in C to run br Since Brinkmann and Walfield started researching Coyotos as a new kernel for HURD In Brinkmann met with Jonathan Shapiro a primary architect of the Coyotos Operating System to aid in and discuss the use of the Coyotos kernel for GNU Hurd In further discussion HURD developers realised that Coyotos as well as other similar kernels are not suitable for HURD br In Hurd developers Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann gave a critique of the Hurd architecture known as the critique and a proposal for how a future system may be designed known as the position paper In Neal Walfield began working on the Viengoos microkernel as a modern native kernel for HURD As of development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it br In the meantime others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd br br br Unix extensions br br A number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd br Under Unix every running program has an associated user id which normally corresponds to the user that started the process This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program No outside process can change the user id of a running program A Hurd process on the other hand runs under a set of user ids which can contain multiple ids one or none A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process For example there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password br Regarding the file system a suitable program can be designated as a translator for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy Every access to the translated file or files below a hierarchy in the second case is in fact handled by the program For example a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file like a Unix symbolic link The effect of Unix mounting is achieved by setting up a filesystem translator using the settrans command Translators can also be used to provide services to the user For example the ftpfs translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory Then standard tools such as ls cp and rm can be used to manipulate files on the remote system Even more powerful translators are ones such as UnionFS which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one thus listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the directories br The Hurd requires a multiboot compliant boot loader such as GRUB br br br Architecture of the servers br According to the Debian documentation there are servers core servers and file system servers named as follows br br br Core servers br auth authentication server Receives requests and passwords from programs and gives them an ID which changes the privileges of the program br crash crash server Handles all fatal errors br eieio translation server TODO br exec execution server Translates an executable image currently ELF and a out are supported to a runnable image in memory br fifo FIFO translator Implements named pipes br new fifo new FIFO server An alternate server for named pipes br firmlink the firmlink translator Implements firmlinks half way between a symbolic link and a hard link br fwd forward server Forwards requests to other servers used by fifo and symlink servers br hostmux host multiplexer server br ifsock server for sockets interface Helps with UNIX domain socket addresses br init init server Basic system booting and configuration br magic magic server Signals that a name lookup must be resolved internally by a process when the result involves the process s state br null null server Implements dev null and dev zero br pfinet pfinet server Implements the PF INET protocol family br pflocal pflocal server Implements UNIX domain sockets br proc process server Assigns PIDs and manages process level actions br symlink symbolic link translator Implements symbolic links for filesystems that do not support them br term terminal server A POSIX terminal br usermux user multiplexer server Invokes user specific translators br br br Filesystem servers br ext fs br The ext filesystem translator It receives disk blocks from the microkernel and gives files and directories to the applications br isofs br The translator for the ISO filesystem Translates blocks of a CD or DVD to files and directories for the applications br nfs br See Network File System br ftpfs br File transfer protocol filesystem translator br storeio br The storage translator br The servers collectively implement the POSIX API with each server implementing a part of the interface For instance the various filesystem servers each implement the filesystem calls The storage server will work as a wrapping layer similar to the block layer of Linux The equivalent of VFS of Linux is achieved by libdiskfs and libpager libraries br br br GNU distributions running Hurd br br Hurd based GNU distributions include br br Arch Hurd br Bee
