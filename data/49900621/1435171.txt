title: X display manager
id: 1435171
In the X Window System an X display manager is a graphical login manager which starts a login session on an X server from the same or another computer br br A display manager presents the user with a login screen A session starts when a user successfully enters a valid combination of username and password br When the display manager runs on the user s computer it starts the X server before presenting the user the login screen optionally repeating when the user logs out In this condition the DM realizes in the X Window System the functionality of getty and login on character mode terminals When the display manager runs on a remote computer it acts like a telnet server requesting username and password and starting a remote session br X Release introduced display managers in October with the aim of supporting the standalone X terminals just coming onto the market Various display managers continue in routine use to provide a graphical login prompt on standalone computer workstations running X X R introduced the X Display Manager Control Protocol XDMCP in December to fix problems in the X R implementation br br br History br XDM the X Window Display Manager originated in X R This first version written by Keith Packard of the MIT X Consortium had several limitations the most notable of which was that it could not detect when users switched X terminals off and on In X R XDM only knew about an X terminal from its entry in the Xservers file but XDM only consulted this file when it started Thus every time a user switched a terminal off and on the system administrator had to send a SIGHUP signal to XDM to instruct it to rescan Xservers br XDMCP arrived with the introduction of X R December With XDMCP the X server must actively request a display manager connection from the host An X server using XDMCP therefore no longer requires an entry in Xservers br br br Local and remote display management br A display manager can run on the same computer where the user sits starting one or more X servers displaying the login screen at the beginning and optionally every time the user logs out or on a remote one working according to the XDMCP protocol br br The XDMCP protocol mandates that the X server starts autonomously and connects to the display manager In the X Window System paradigm the server runs on the computer providing the display and input devices A server can connect using the XDMCP protocol to a display manager running on another computer requesting it to start the session In this case the X server acts as a graphical telnet client while the display manager acts like a telnet server users start programs from the computer running the display manager while their input and output take place on the computer where the server and the user sits br An administrator can typically configure an XDMCP Chooser program running on the local computer or X terminal to connect to a specific host s X display manager or to display a list of suitable hosts that the user can choose from Most implementations enable such a list to contain br br a predefined set of hosts and their respective network addresses and or br a set of hosts on the local TCP IP subnet that the XDMCP Chooser determines by a network broadcast to the available display managers br When the user selects a host from the list the XDMCP Chooser running on the local machine will send a message to the selected remote computer s display manager and instruct it to connect the X server on the local computer or terminal br br br X Display Manager Control Protocol br br The X Display Manager Control Protocol XDMCP uses UDP port An X server requests that a display manager start a session by sending a Query packet If the display manager allows access for that X server it responds by sending a Willing packet back to the X server The X server can also send BroadcastQuery or IndirectQuery packets to start a session this mechanism for requesting a session resembles using DHCP to request an IP address br The display manager must authenticate itself to the server To do this the X server sends a Request packet to the display manager which returns an Accept packet If the Accept packet contains the response the X server expects the display manager is authenticated Producing the correct response might require the display manager to have access to a secret key for example If authentication succeeds the X server sends a Manage packet to inform the display manager Then the display manager displays its login screen by connecting to the X server as a regular X client br During the session the server can send KeepAlive packets to the display manager at intervals If the display manager fails to respond with an Alive packet within a certain time the X server presumes that the display manager has ceased running and can terminate the connection br br br Security br One problem with XDMCP is that similarly to telnet the authentication takes place unencrypted If snooping is possible this leaves the system vulnerable to attack It is more secure to use an ssh tunnel for X traffic br br br Implementations br The X Window System supplies XDM as its standard display manager br Programmers have developed other X display managers both commercial and free offering additional functionality over the basic display management
