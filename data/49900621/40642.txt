id: 40642
NeXTSTEP is a discontinued object oriented multitasking operating system based on the Mach kernel and the UNIX derived BSD It was developed by NeXT Computer founded by Steve Jobs in the late s and early s and was initially used for its range of proprietary workstation computers such as the NeXTcube It was later ported to several other computer architectures br Although relatively unsuccessful at the time it attracted interest from computer scientists and researchers It hosted the original development of the Electronic AppWrapper the first commercial electronic software distribution catalog to collectively manage encryption and provide digital rights for application software and digital media a forerunner of the modern app store concept It is the platform on which Tim Berners Lee created the first web browser and on which id Software developed the video games Doom and Quake br In Apple Computer acquired NeXT Apple needed a successor to the classic Mac OS and merged NeXTSTEP and OpenStep with the Macintosh user environment to create Mac OS X All of Apple s subsequent platforms since iPhone OS were then based on Mac OS X later renamed macOS br br br Overview br NeXTSTEP also stylized as NeXTstep NeXTStep and NEXTSTEP is a combination of several parts br br a Unix operating system based on the Mach kernel plus BSD br Display PostScript and a proprietary windowing engine br the Objective C language and runtime br an object oriented OO application layer including several kits br development tools for the OO layers br NeXTSTEP is a preeminent implementation of the last three items The toolkits are the canonical development system for all of the software on the system br It introduced the idea of the Dock carried through OpenStep and into macOS and the Shelf NeXTSTEP originated or innovated a large number of other GUI concepts which became common in other operating systems D chiseled widgets large full color icons system wide drag and drop of a wide range of objects beyond file icons system wide piped services real time scrolling and window dragging properties dialog boxes called inspectors and window modification notices such as the saved status of a file The system is among the first general purpose user interfaces to handle publishing color standards transparency sophisticated sound and music processing through a Motorola DSP advanced graphics primitives internationalization and modern typography in a consistent manner across all applications br Additional kits were added to the product line These include Portable Distributed Objects PDO which allow easy remote invocation and Enterprise Objects Framework an object relational database system The kits made the system particularly interesting to custom application programmers and NeXTSTEP had a long history in the financial programming community br br br History br NeXTSTEP was built upon Mach and BSD initially BSD Tahoe A preview release of NeXTSTEP version was shown with the launch of the NeXT Computer on October The first full release NeXTSTEP shipped on September It was updated to BSD Reno in NeXTSTEP The last version was released in early for the Motorola family based NeXT computers Intel x Sun SPARC and HP PA RISC based systems br NeXT separated the underlying operating system from the application frameworks producing OpenStep OpenStep and its applications can run on multiple underlying operating systems including OPENSTEP Windows NT and Solaris In it was updated to BSD while assimilated into Apple s development of Rhapsody for x and PowerPC NeXTSTEP s direct descendant is Apple s macOS which then yielded iPhone OS iOS iPadOS watchOS and tvOS br br br Legacy br The first web browser WorldWideWeb and the first app store were all invented on the NeXTSTEP platform br br CERN A Joint proposal for a hypertext system is presented to the management Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation and gives it to Tim Berners Lee Tim s prototype implementation on NeXTSTEP is made in the space of a few months thanks to the qualities of the NeXTSTEP software development system This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing authoring Current Web browsers used in surfing the Internet are mere passive windows depriving the user of the possibility to contribute During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology Tim proposes World Wide Web I like this very much except that it is difficult to pronounce in French br Some features and keyboard shortcuts now common to web browsers originated in NeXTSTEP conventions The basic layout options of HTML and are attributable to those features of NeXT s Text class br Lighthouse Design Ltd developed Diagram a drawing tool originally called BLT for Box and Line Tool in which objects boxes are connected together using smart links lines to construct diagrams such a flow charts This basic design can be enhanced by the simple addition of new links and new documents located anywhere in the local area network that foreshadowed Tim Berners Lee s initial prototype that was written on NeXTSTEP in October December br In the s the pioneering PC games Doom Doom II Quake and their respective level editors were developed by id Software on NeXT machines Other games based on the Doom engine such as Heretic and its sequel Hexen by Raven Software and Strife by Rogue Entertainment were developed on NeXT hardware using id s tools br Altsys made the NeXTSTEP application Virtuoso version of which was ported to Mac OS and Windows to become Macromedia FreeHand version The modern Notebook interface for Mathematica and the advanced spreadsheet Lotus Improv were developed using NeXTSTEP The software that controlled MCI s Friends and Family calling plan program was developed using NeXTSTEP br About the time of the release of NeXTSTEP NeXT partnered with Sun Microsystems to develop OpenStep It is the product of an effort to separate the underlying operating system from the higher level object libraries to create a cross platform object oriented API standard derived from NeXTSTEP OpenStep was released for Sun s Solaris Windows NT and NeXT s Mach kernel based operating system NeXT s implementation is called OPENSTEP for Mach and its first release superseded NeXTSTEP on NeXT Sun and Intel IA systems br Following an announcement on December Apple Computer acquired NeXT on February for million Based upon the OPENSTEP for Mach operating system and developing the OpenStep API to become Cocoa Apple created the basis of Mac OS X and eventually of iOS iPadOS watchOS and tvOS br GNUstep is a free software implementation of the OpenStep standard br br br Release
