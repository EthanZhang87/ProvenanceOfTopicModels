management br Prior to watchOS different actions and options appeared depending on whether the user taps or deep presses which an Apple Watch detects with its pressure sensitive Force Touch Display Force Touch was completely removed in watchOS and all actions requiring the feature were moved to specific options in the Settings app or to long press actions With the launch of watchOS Force Touch technology was phased out This feature was replaced by additional options in the Settings app and extended press gestures to accommodate all necessary interactions This change streamlined the interaction model making it more consistent with other Apple devices that do not support Force Touch br As of watchOS the interface has been further refined to enhance user accessibility and

Jony Ive Apple s former chief designer in an interview He said that health was a crucial element in the Apple Watch since the day of its inception and that the developmental trajectory of the hardware and the watchOS were geared towards health based capabilities Ive pointed out that one of the primary apps that shipped with the first watchOS allowed users to track and communicate as well as encourage them to move exercise and stand He said Many of us have our phones with us all the time but they aren t connected to you Imagine having something this powerful with you at all times and what opportunities that might present to the user The opportunity is phenomenal Particularly when you don t understand just where we are today in terms of technology and capability but where we are headed Applications have been developed for watchOS that not only keep users active but also diagnose illnesses For example the app called DeepHeart a deep learning network that can detect atrial fibrillation hypertension sleep apnea and diabetes It taps into the HealthKit platform to collect data particularly those collected by the Apple Watch s heart sensor br br br Version history br br br
