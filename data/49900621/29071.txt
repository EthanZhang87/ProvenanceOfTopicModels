SunOS is a Unix branded operating system developed by Sun Microsystems for their workstation and server computer systems The SunOS name is usually only used to refer to versions to which were based on BSD while versions and later are based on UNIX System V Release and are marketed under the brand name Solaris br br br History br br SunOS only supported the Sun series systems including Sun systems upgraded with Sun CPU boards SunOS supported Sun and Sun series systems SunOS supported Sun until release Sun until Sun i and only and Sun SPARC architectures Although SunOS was intended to be the first release to fully support Sun s new SPARC processor there was also a SunOS release with preliminary support for Sun systems br SunOS introduced support for Sun s first sun m architecture multiprocessor machines the SPARCserver MP series since it had only a single lock for the kernel only one CPU at a time could execute in the kernel br The last release of SunOS was Solaris in The sun sun c and sun m architectures were supported in sun d was not supported br Sun continued to ship SunOS and until December they were supported until September br br br SunOS and Solaris br br In AT T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix flavors on the market at that time BSD including many of the features then unique to SunOS System V and Xenix This would become System V Release SVR br On September Sun announced that its next major OS release would switch from its BSD derived source base to one based on SVR Although the internal designation of this release would be SunOS from this point Sun began using the marketing name Solaris The justification for this new overbrand was that it encompassed not only SunOS but also the OpenWindows desktop environment and Open Network Computing ONC functionality br Even though the new SVR based OS was not expected to ship in volume until the following year Sun immediately began using the new Solaris name to refer to the currently shipping SunOS release also including OpenWindows Thus SunOS was rebranded Solaris SunOS would be considered a part of Solaris SunOS x micro versions continued to be released through and each of these was also given a Solaris x equivalent name In practice these were often still referred to by customers and even Sun personnel by their SunOS release names Matching the version numbers was not straightforward br br Today SunOS is universally known as Solaris although the SunOS name is still visible within the OS itself in the startup banner the output of the uname command and man page footers among other places br Matching a SunOS x release to its corresponding Solaris marketing name is simple each Solaris release name includes its corresponding SunOS minor version number For example Solaris incorporated SunOS There is one small twist after Solaris the was dropped from the Solaris name and the SunOS minor number appears by itself The latest Solaris release is named Solaris and incorporates SunOS br br br User interface br Beginning with SunOS the Sun Window System provided a GUI called Suntools layered on top of lower level windowing and bitmap libraries this was renamed SunView in SunOS Sun then developed a novel window system called NeWS that used and extended the PostScript language and graphics model In Sun released OpenWindows an OPEN LOOK compliant X based environment which also supported SunView and NeWS applications This became the default SunOS GUI in SunOS br br br See also br Comparison of BSD operating systems br Comparison of operating systems br Illumos br OpenSolaris br OpenIndiana br Solaris operating system br Unix wars br br br br br br External links br The Sun Hardware Reference Overview br SunOS Solaris Version History at the Wayback Machine archived June br An Introduction to Solaris a sample chapter from Solaris Internals Core Kernel Architecture by Jim Mauro Richard McDougall Prentice Hall PDF br Info on SunOS from OSdata last updated February br Initial Solaris announcement
