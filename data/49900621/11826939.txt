GeckOS is a multitasking operating system for MOS and compatible processors such as the MOS The GeckOS operating system is one of the few successful attempts to implement a Unix like operating system on the architecture br br br Overview br The system offers some Unix like functionality including pre emptive multitasking multithreading semaphores signals binary relocation TCP IP networking via SLIP and a standard library br GeckOS includes native support for the Commodore PET KB and KB models Commodore and the CS A homebrew system Due to the platform independent nature of the kernel code GeckOS is advertised as an extremely easy OS to port to alternative platforms br Binary compatibility with the LUnix operating system can be attained when the lib shared library is used br Due to the small fixed location stack of the and because an external MMU is rarely provided multitasking is somewhat limited The OS supports a maximum of four tasks when a shared stack space is used This can be increased to sixteen tasks when stack snapshotting is enabled although this is done at the expense of some system speed br A webserver is integrated into the SLIP daemon br br br Unix on architecture br While early versions of Unix ran on for example early model PDP computers that were comparable to Commodore in terms of memory and processor performance there were architecture differences in terms of lack of a kernel mode only bit registers versus eight bit general registers and a fixed stack These architectural limitations make implementing a Unix like operating system on the challenging br The possible non exhaustive list of other viable Unix like implementations on are LUnix Asterix Chris Baird and ACE Chris Polar Baird GeckOS arguably is more complete in some respects with ACE being stronger in terms of standard Unix utilities but weaker in the operating system area br br br br br br Footnotes br br br Sources br We ling Holger Das Bastler Handbuch f r den THEC Mini in German Andrews UK Limited OCLC br Fachat Andr October GeckOS A V org Retrieved May br Holmer Glenn September a GeckOS a Unix like operating system Vintage computer Festival Midwest Archived from the original on December Retrieved May via YouTube br Holmer Glenn December b Hacking GeckOS Speech World of Commodore Toronto Canada Retrieved May br Holmer Glenn December c Hacking GeckOS PDF Retrieved May br br br External links br Analysis building instructions
