Unix security refers to the means of securing a Unix or Unix like operating system br br br Design concepts br br br Permissions br br A core security feature in these systems is the file system permissions All files in a typical Unix filesystem have permissions set enabling different access to a file Unix permissions permit different users access to a file with different privilege e g reading writing execution Like users different user groups have different permissions on a file br br br User groups br Many Unix implementations add an additional layer of security by requiring that a user be a member of the wheel user privileges group in order to access the su command br br br Root access br br Most Unix and Unix like systems have an account or group which enables a user to exact complete control over the system often known as a root account If access to this account is gained by an unwanted user this results in a complete breach of the system A root account however is necessary for administrative purposes and for the above security reasons the root account is seldom used for day to day purposes the sudo program is more commonly used so usage of the root account can be more closely monitored br br br User and administrative techniques br br br Passwords br Selecting strong passwords and guarding them properly are important for Unix security br On many UNIX systems user and password information if stored locally can be found in the etc passwd and etc shadow file pair br br br Software maintenance br br br Patching br Operating systems like all software may contain bugs in need of fixing or may be enhanced with the addition of new features many UNIX systems come with a package manager for this Patching the operating system in a secure manner requires that the software come from a trustworthy source and not have been altered since it was packaged Common methods for verifying that operating system patches have not been altered include the use of the digital signature of a cryptographic hash such as a SHA based checksum or the use of read only media br br br Viruses and virus scanners br There are viruses and worms that target Unix like operating systems In fact the first computer worm the Morris worm targeted Unix systems br There are virus scanners for UNIX like systems from multiple vendors br br br Firewalls br Network firewall protects systems and networks from network threats which exist on the opposite side of the firewall Firewalls can block access to strictly internal services unwanted users and in some cases filter network traffic by content br br br iptables br br iptables is the current user interface for interacting with Linux kernel netfilter functionality It replaced ipchains Other Unix like operating systems may provide their own native functionality and other open source firewall products exist br br br br br br General br Practical UNIX and Internet Security Simson Garfinkel and Gene Spafford O Reilly Associates br br br External links br br The Unix Security Model for web server administration Archived at the Wayback Machine Robert K Moniot br An Architectural Overview of UNIX Network Security Robert B Reinhardt br Unix security papers
