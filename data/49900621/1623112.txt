Jochen Liedtke May June was a German computer scientist noted for his work on microkernel operating systems especially in creating the L microkernel family br br br Career br br br Education br In the mid s Liedtke studied for a diploma degree in mathematics at the Bielefeld University His thesis project was to build a compiler for the programming language ELAN which had been launched for teaching programming in German schools The compiler was written in ELAN br br br Post grad br After his graduation in he remained at Bielefeld and worked on an Elan environment for the Zilog Z microprocessor This required a runtime system environment which he named Eumel Extendable Multiuser Microprocessor ELAN System but also a colloquial north German term for a likeable fool Eumel grew into a complete multi tasking multi user operating system supporting orthogonal persistence which started shipping by whom to whom in and was later ported to Zilog Z Motorola and Intel processors As these processors lacked memory protection Eumel implemented a virtual machine which added the features missing from the hardware More than Eumel systems shipped mostly to schools and some to legal practices as a text processing platform br In he joined the Gesellschaft f r Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung GMD the German National Research Center for Computer Science which is now a part of the Fraunhofer Society There he continued his work on Eumel In when microprocessors supporting virtual memory became widely available in the form of the Intel Liedtke started to design a new operating system to succeed Eumel which he called L Liedtke s rd system after Eumel and the ALGOL interpreter he had written in high school L was designed to achieve better performance by using the latest hardware features and was implemented from scratch It was mostly backward compatible with Eumel thus benefiting from the existing Eumel ecosystem L started to ship in with total deployment of at least br Both Eumel and L were microkernel systems a popular design in the s However by the early s microkernels had received a bad reputation as systems built on top were performing poorly culminating in the billion dollar failure of the IBM Workplace OS The reason was claimed to be inherent in the operating system structure imposed by microkernels Liedtke however observed that the message passing operation IPC which is fundamentally important for microkernel performance was slow in all existing microkernels including his own L system His conclusion was that radical redesign was needed He did this by re implementing L from scratch dramatically simplifying the kernel resulting in an order of magnitude decrease in IPC cost br The resulting kernel was later renamed L Conceptually the main novelty of L was its complete reliance on external pagers page fault handlers and the recursive construction of address spaces br This led to a complete family of microkernels with many independent implementations of the same principles br Liedtke also worked on computer architecture inventing guarded page tables as a means to implement a sparsely mapped bit address space In Liedtke completed a PhD on guarded page tables at Technische Universit t Berlin br In the same year he joined the Thomas J Watson Research Center where he continued to work on L referred to as Lava Nucleus LN to avoid negative connotations with previously unsuccessful microkernels such as the one used in Workplace OS The main project during his IBM time was the Saw Mill project which attempted to turn Linux into an L based multi server OS br In April he took up the System Architecture Chair at the University of Karlsruhe There he continued to collaborate with IBM on Saw Mill but at the same time worked on a new generation of L version Several experimental kernels were developed during that time including Hazelnut the first L kernel that was ported in contrast to re implemented to a different architecture from x to ARM Work on the new version was completed after his death by Liedtke s students Volkmar Uhlig Uwe Dannowski and Espen Skoglund It was released under the name Pistachio in br On Sunday June he died unexpectedly at Frankfurt Airport while returning from SOSP program committee meeting in Chateau Lake Louise having been ill earlier in the year and undergone two surgeries the conference proceedings were dedicated to his memory He is survived by his wife Adelheid br br br br br br External links br In Memoriam Jochen Liedtke br List of Liedtke s publications related to microkernels
