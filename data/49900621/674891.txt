title: Arch Linux
id: 674891
Arch Linux is an independently developed x general purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling release model The default installation is intentionally minimal so that users can add only the packages they require br pacman a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux is used to install remove and update software packages br Arch Linux uses a rolling release model meaning it has no major releases An Arch Linux installation is kept up to date by regularly updating the individual pieces of software that it comprises The only releases are up to date snapshots of main system components released monthly br Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation in the form of a community run wiki known as the ArchWiki br br br History br Inspired by CRUX another minimalist distribution Judd Vinet started the Arch Linux project in March The name was chosen because Vinet liked the word s meaning of the principal as in arch enemy br Originally only for bit x CPUs the first x installation ISO was released in April br Vinet led Arch Linux until October when he stepped down due to lack of time transferring control of the project to Aaron Griffin br The migration to systemd as its init system started in August and it became the default on new installations in October It replaced the SysV style init system used since the distribution s inception br The end of i support was announced in January with the February ISO being the last one including i and making the architecture unsupported in November Since then the community derivative Arch Linux can be used for i hardware br On February Aaron Griffin announced that due to his limited involvement with the project he would after a voting period transfer control of the project to Levente Polyak This change also led to a new year term period being added to the Project Leader position br In March Arch Linux developers were thinking of porting Arch Linux packages to x v roughly correlating to the Intel Haswell era of processors br In April Arch Linux installation images began including a guided installation script by default br In late the Arch Linux developers released Pacman which enabled parallel downloads br In February the Arch Linux developers began offering debug packages br br br Repository security br Until pacman version Arch Linux s package manager lacked support for signed packages Packages and metadata were not verified for authenticity by Pacman during the download install process Without package authentication checking tampered with or malicious repository mirrors could compromise the integrity of a system Pacman allowed verification of the package database and packages but it was disabled by default In November package signing became mandatory for new package builds and as of March every official package is signed In June package signing verification became official and is now enabled by default in the installation process br br br Design and principles br Arch is largely based on binary packages Packages target x microprocessors to assist performance on modern hardware A ports ebuild like system is also provided for automated source compilation known as the Arch build system br Arch Linux focuses on simplicity of design meaning that the main focus involves creating an environment that is straightforward and relatively easy for the user to understand directly rather than providing polished point and click style management tools the package manager for example does not have an official graphical front end This is largely achieved by encouraging the use of succinctly commented clean configuration files that are arranged for quick access and editing This has earned it a reputation as a distribution for advanced users who are willing to use the command line interface br br Relying on complex tools to manage and build your system is going to hurt the end users If you try to hide the complexity of the system you ll end up with a more complex system Layers of abstraction that serve to hide internals are never a good thing Instead the internals should be designed in a way such that they NEED no hiding br br br Installation br br The Arch Linux website supplies ISO images that can be run from CD or USB After a user partitions and formats their drive a simple command line script pacstrap is used to install the base system The installation of additional packages which are not part of the base system for example desktop environments can be done with either pacstrap or Pacman after booting or chrooting into the new installation br br An alternative to using CD or USB images for installation is to use the static version of the package manager Pacman from within another Linux based operating system The user can mount their newly formatted drive partition and use pacstrap or Pacman with the appropriate command line switch to install base and additional packages with the mountpoint of the destination device as the root for its operations This method is useful when installing Arch Linux onto USB flash drives or onto a temporarily mounted device which belongs to another system br Regardless of the selected installation type further actions need to be taken before the new system is ready for use most notably by installing a bootloader and configuring the new system with a system name network connection language settings and graphical user interface br Arch Linux does not schedule releases for specific dates but uses a rolling release system where new packages are provided throughout the day Its package management allows users to easily keep systems updated br Occasionally manual interventions are required for certain updates with instructions posted on the news section of the Arch Linux website br br br Guided automated install script br An experimental guided installer named archinstall is included in all Arch ISO images released since It allows users to easily install and configure Arch Linux including drivers disk partitioning network configuration accounts setup and installation of desktop environments br br br Package management br br br pacman br br All packages are managed using Pacman a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux Pacman handles package installation upgrades downgrades removal and features automatic dependency resolution The packages for Arch Linux are obtained from the Arch Linux package tree and are compiled for the x architecture br Pacman typically uses binary packages with a tar zst extension br for zstd compression with pkg placed before this to indicate that it is a Pacman package giving pkg tar zst br though other compression formats are also valid such as pkg tar xz br For example packages can be installed via pacman S package name and pacman Syu can be used to perform a full system upgrade br As well as Arch Linux Pacman is also used for installing packages under MSYS a fork of Cygwin on Windows br br br Repositories br The following official binary repositories exist br br core which contains all the packages needed to set up a base system Packages in this repository include kernel packages and shell languages br extra which holds packages not required for the base system including desktop environments and programs br multilib a centralized repository for x users to more readily support bit applications in a bit environment Packages in this repository include Steam and Wine br Additionally there are testing repositories which include binary package candidates for other repositories Currently the following testing repositories exist br br core testing with packages for core br extra testing with packages for extra br multilib testing with packages for multilib br The core staging and extra staging repositories are used for some rebuilds to avoid broken packages in testing The developers recommend not using these repositories for any reason stating that any system updating from them will unquestionably break br There are also two other repositories that include the newest version of certain desktop environments br br gnome unstable which contains packages of a new version of the software from GNOME before being released into testing br kde unstable which contains packages of a new version of KDE software before being released into testing br The unstable repository was dropped in July and most of the packages moved to other repositories The community repository was merged with extra and the testing and staging repositories were split in May In addition to the official repositories there are a number of unofficial user repositories br The most well known unofficial repository is the Arch User Repository or AUR hosted on the Arch Linux site The AUR does not host binary packages but instead a collection of build scripts known as PKGBUILDs PKGBUILD scripts are executed by the makepkg command which downloads the necessary files from the software s repository and builds them using the Arch build system br The Arch Linux repositories contain both libre and nonfree software and the default Arch Linux kernel contains nonfree proprietary blobs hence the distribution is not endorsed by the GNU project The linux libre kernel can be installed from the AUR or by enabling Parabola s repositories br br br Arch build system ABS br The Arch build system ABS is a ports like source packaging system that compiles source tarballs into binary packages which are installed via Pacman The Arch build system provides a directory tree of shell scripts called PKGBUILDs that enable any and all official Arch packages to be customized and compiled Rebuilding the entire system using modified compiler flags is also supported by the Arch build system The Arch build system makepkg tool can be used to create custom pkg tar zst packages from third party sources The resulting packages are also installable and trackable via Pacman br br br Arch User Repository AUR br In addition to the repositories the Arch User Repository AUR provides user made PKGBUILD scripts for packages not included in the repositories These PKGBUILD scripts simplify building from source by explicitly listing and checking for dependencies and configuring the install to match the Arch architecture Arch User Repository helper programs can further streamline the downloading of PKGBUILD scripts and associated building process However this comes at the cost of executing PKGBUILDs not validated by a trusted person as a result Arch developers have stated that the utilities for automatic finding downloading and executing of PKGBUILDs will never be included in the official repositories br Users can create packages compatible with Pacman using the Arch build system and custom PKGBUILD scripts This functionality has helped support the Arch User Repository which consists of user contributed packages to supplement the official repositories br The Arch User Repository provides the community with packages that are not included in the repositories Reasons include br br Licensing issues software that cannot be redistributed but is free to use can be included in the Arch User Repository since all that is hosted by the Arch Linux website is a shell script that downloads the actual software from elsewhere Examples include proprietary freeware such as Google Earth and RealPlayer br Modified official packages the Arch User Repository also contains many variations on the official packaging as well as beta versions of software that is contained within the repositories as stable releases br Popularity of the software rarely used programs have not been added to the official repositories yet br Betas or nightly versions of the software which are very new and thus unstable Examples include the firefox nightly package which gives new daily builds of the Firefox web browser br PKGBUILDs for any software can be contributed by ordinary users Any PKGBUILD that has or more votes or more than usage from pkgstats can be promoted into the extra repository br br br Reproducible builds br Arch Linux is working on making all official packages reproducible This means that when a package is rebuilt in a different environment it should be bit by bit identical This allows users and researchers to verify the integrity of the packages found in the official repository The status of this effort can be monitored on the dedicated status page br br br Derivatives br br There are several projects working on porting the Arch Linux ideas and tools to other kernels including PacBSD formerly ArchBSD and Arch Hurd which are based on the FreeBSD and GNU Hurd kernels respectively There is also the Arch Linux ARM project which aims to port Arch Linux to ARM based devices including the Raspberry Pi as well as the Arch Linux project which continued support for systems with bit only CPUs after the mainline Arch Linux project dropped support for the architecture in November br Various distributions are focused on providing an Arch base with an easier install process such as EndeavourOS CachyOS Manjaro and Garuda Linux br SteamOS the version of SteamOS used in the Steam Deck by Valve is based on Arch Linux br br br Logo br The current Arch Linux logo was designed by Thayer Williams in as part of a contest to replace the previous logo br br br Reception br OSNews reviewed Arch Linux in OSNews also has five later reviews about Arch Linux br LWN net wrote a review about Arch Linux in LWN net also has two later reviews about Arch Linux br Tux Machines reviewed Arch Linux in br Chris Smart from DistroWatch Weekly wrote a review about Arch Linux in January DistroWatch Weekly reviewed Arch Linux again in September and in December br The Linux kernel developer and maintainer Greg Kroah Hartman GKH has stated that he uses Arch Linux and that it works really really well He has also praised the Arch Wiki the distribution s rolling release model and the feedback loop with the community br In a DistroWatch poll about half of the responders maintained that they were running either Arch or an Arch derivative As of Arch also enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on DistroWatch with a rating of br br br See also br br Comparison of Linux distributions br List of Linux
