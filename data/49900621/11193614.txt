AROS Research Operating System AROS pronounced AR OS is a free and open source multi media centric implementation of the AmigaOS application programming interface API which is designed to be portable and flexible As of ports are available for personal computers PCs based on x and PowerPC in native and hosted flavors with other architectures in development In a show of full circle development AROS has been ported to the Motorola series m k based Amiga and there is also an ARM port for the Raspberry Pi series br br br Name and identity br br AROS originally stood for Amiga Research Operating System but to avoid any trademark issues with the Amiga name it was changed to the recursive acronym AROS Research Operating System br The mascot of AROS is an anthropomorphic cat named Kitty created by Eric Schwartz and officially adopted by the AROS Team in December br Used in the core AROS About and installer tools it was also adopted by several AROS community sites and early distributions br Other AROS identifiable symbols and logos are based around the cat shape such as the Icaros logo which is a stylised cat s eye or AFA Aros For Amiga br br br Current status br br The project begun in has over the years become an almost feature complete implementation of AmigaOS which as of May only lacks a few areas of functionality This was achieved by the efforts of a small team of developers br It can be installed on most IBM PC compatibles and features native graphics drivers for video cards such as the GeForce range made by Nvidia As of May USB keyboards and mice are also supported AROS has been ported to the Sam ep PowerPC board and a first test version for the Efika was released in br While the OS is still lacking in applications a few have been ported including E UAE an emulation program that allows m k native AmigaOS applications to run Some AROS specific applications have also been written AROS has TCP IP networking support and has available an experimental version of AMosaic web browser for test purposes among other Internet related applications The Poseidon USB stack has been ported to AROS br AROS is designed to be source compatible with AmigaOS On m k Amiga hardware it is also binary compatible so binaries already compiled for AmigaOS can be run on AROS On x IA bit platforms Janus UAE an enhanced E UAE integrates Amiga emulation directly into AROS to run AmigaOS m k binaries nearly transparent to the user As of August original AmigaOS operating system files are needed for the emulation br The aim of AROS is to remain aloof of the legal and political spats that have plagued other AmigaOS implementations by being independent of hardware and of any central control The de facto motto of AROS No schedule and rocking both lampoons the infamous words On Schedule and Rockin from Amiga Inc CEO Bill McEwen and declares a lack of the formal deadlines br A workable AmigaOS Kickstart clone for the Motorola processor was released on March as part of a programming bounty The memory requirement is MB Chip RAM and MB Fast RAM This software is a complete free open source alternative to AmigaOS br br br Distributions br The main AROS system files can be downloaded in many flavors from the project website These files are compiled straight from the SVN source tree at night time and are available as nightly builds Nightlies also include some third party applications to allow people using the system to perform some very basic tasks br For final average user like Linux there are several distributions available br br br Icaros Desktop br Since April the name VMWAros has been changed into Icaros Desktop to avoid ambiguities with any existing copyrighted Virtual Machine of any kind Amiga K emulation integration D acceleration for Nvidia cards and latest updates of applications can be found there The latest version of Icaros Desktop is version released December br br br Broadway br Broadway is a distribution of AROS begun late The goal is to provide an easy to use and complete AROS experience AROS Broadway contains some commercial software such as a media center a cloud storage service and an app store The latest version is preview released April br br br AspireOS br AspireOS is a distribution begun in by Nikos Tomatsidis which is focused on Dell Latitude D and Acer Aspire One computers Latest version is codenamed Obitus released November br br br AROS Vision br AROS Vision is a native m k distribution which can run on both real hardware or in emulators like UAE br br br Apollo OS br ApolloOS is an active m k distribution crafted specially for the Vampire V Standalone FPGA based system br br br Influence on AmigaOS and MorphOS br Haage Partner used small pieces of the AROS source code for AmigaOS and br Large parts of MorphOS AmigaDOS Intuition and more have been ported from AROS br br br System requirements br br br x br CPU newer than Intel recommended minimum clockspeed of MHz for desktops and GHz
