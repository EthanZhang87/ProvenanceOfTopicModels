 BSD also known as Jolix is a discontinued operating system based on the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD that was developed by couple Lynne and William Jolitz Released on March it was the first fully operational Unix operating system to be completely free and open source br BSD ran on PC compatible computer systems based on the bit Intel i microprocessor thus marking the first Unix on affordable home class hardware Its innovations included role based security ring buffers self ordered configuration and modular kernel design Although BSD was short lived it served as the base for FreeBSD and NetBSD which began shortly afterwards br br br History br br BSD was written mainly by Berkeley alumni Lynne Jolitz and William Jolitz William had considerable experience with prior BSD releases while at the University of California Berkeley and BSD and both contributed code developed at Symmetric Computer Systems during the s to Berkeley William worked at Berkeley on porting BSD Reno and later BSD Net to the Intel for the university BSD Net was an incomplete non operational release with portions withheld by the University of California as encumbered i e subject to an AT T UNIX source code license br The port began in and the first incomplete traces of the port can be found in BSD Net of The port was made possible as Keith Bostic partly influenced by Richard Stallman had started to remove proprietary AT T out of BSD in The port was first released to the public in March version based on portions of the BSD Net release coupled with additional code see Missing Pieces I and II Dr Dobb s Journal May June and in a much more usable version on July version br BSD proved popular with it receiving downloads from the FTP server it was hosted on It was helped partly by the porting process with code being extensively documented in a part series written by Lynne and William in Dr Dobb s Journal beginning in January br br br FreeBSD and NetBSD br After the release of BSD a group of users began collecting bug fixes and enhancements releasing them as an unofficial patchkit Due to differences of opinion between the Jolitzes and the patchkit maintainers over the future direction and release schedule of BSD the maintainers of the patchkit founded the FreeBSD project in to continue their work Around the same time the NetBSD project was founded by a different group of BSD users with the aim of unifying BSD with other strands of BSD development into one multi platform system Both projects continue to this day br br br Lawsuit br Due to a lawsuit UNIX System Laboratories Inc v Berkeley Software Design Inc some potentially so called encumbered source was agreed to have been distributed within the Berkeley Software Distribution Net from the University of California and a subsequent release BSD Lite was made by the university to correct this issue However BSD Dr Dobb s Journal and the Jolitzes were never parties to these or subsequent lawsuits or settlements arising from this dispute with the University of California and continued to publish and work on the BSD code base before during and after these lawsuits without limitation There has never been any legal filings or claims from the university USL or other responsible parties with respect to BSD Finally no code developed for BSD done by William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz was at issue in any of these lawsuits br br br Release br In late a finished version BSD Release was distributed by Dr Dobb s Journal on CDROM only due to the immense size MB of the release the BSD Reference CD ROM and was a best selling CDROM for three years BSD Release contained a completely new kernel design and implementation and began the process to incorporate recommendations made by earlier Berkeley designers that had never been attempted in BSD br br br Release br On August an update was pushed to the BSD GitHub repository by developer Ben Jolitz named version According to the official website Release built upon the modular framework to create self healing components However as of March almost all of the documentation remains the same as version and a changelog was not available br br br Copyright and use of the code br All rights with respect to BSD and JOLIX are now held exclusively by William and Lynne Jolitz BSD public releases ended in since code is now available from the many BSD derived operating systems today along with several derivatives thereof such as FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD Portions of BSD may be found in other open systems such as OpenSolaris br br br Relationship with BSD br BSD is often confused with BSD which was a different project developed by BSDi a Berkeley spinout starting in BSD used the same BSD code contributed to the University of California on BSD NET Although Jolitz worked briefly for UUNET which later spun out BSDi in the work he did for them diverged from that contributed to the University of California and did not appear in BSD Instead William Jolitz gave regular code updates to Donn Seeley of BSDi for packaging and testing and returned all materials when William left the company following fundamental disagreements on company direction and
