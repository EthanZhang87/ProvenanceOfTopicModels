title: RIOT (operating system)
id: 42792244
RIOT is a small operating system for networked memory constrained systems with a focus on low power wireless Internet of things IoT devices It is open source software released under the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL br br br Background br It was initially developed by Free University of Berlin FU Berlin French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation INRIA and the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences HAW Hamburg RIOT s kernel is mostly inherited from FireKernel which was originally developed for sensor networks In one of the co developers Matthias W hlisch was awarded the Young Scientist Award of the Forum for Excellent Young Scientists for the contributions of his team to the open source operating system RIOT In the ED STIC Doctoral Prize of the University of Paris Saclay was awarded to another co founder Oliver Hahm for his contribution to the project br br br Technical aspects br RIOT is based on a microkernel architecture In contrast to other operating systems with similarly low memory use such as TinyOS or Contiki RIOT allows application software programming with the programming languages C and C and Rust also by an experimental application programming interface API It has full multithreading and real time abilities Secure Sockets Layer SSL and successor Transport Layer Security TLS are supported by popular libraries such as wolfSSL br RIOT runs on processors of bits such as AVR Atmega bits such as TI MSP and bits such as ARM Cortex A native port also enables RIOT to run as a Linux or macOS process enabling use of standard developing and debugging tools such as GNU Compiler Collection GCC GNU Debugger Valgrind Wireshark etc RIOT is partly Portable Operating System Interface POSIX compliant br RIOT provides multiple network stacks including IPv LoWPAN or content centric networking and standard protocols such as RPL User Datagram Protocol UDP Transmission Control Protocol TCP and CoAP br br br Source code br RIOT source code is available on GitHub and developed by an international community of open source developers br br br See also br Contiki br TinyOS br FreeRTOS br Nano RK br Zephyr br Comparison of real time operating systems br br br br br br External links br Official website
