A web browser is an application for accessing websites When a user requests a web page from a particular website the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user s screen Browsers are used on a range of devices including desktops laptops tablets and smartphones In an estimated billion people have used a browser The most used browser is Google Chrome with a global market share on all devices followed by Safari with br A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine though the two are often confused A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites However to connect to a website s server and display its web pages a user must have a web browser installed In some technical contexts browsers are referred to as user agents br br br Function br br The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the Web or local storage and display it on the user s device This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator URL such as https en wikipedia org into the browser Virtually all URLs on the Web start with either http or https which means they are retrieved with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP For secure mode HTTPS the connection between the browser and web server is encrypted providing a secure and private data transfer br Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources Each link contains a URL and when it is clicked or tapped the browser navigates to the new resource Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page The cache can store many items such as large images so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages br br br Privacy br br During the course of browsing cookies received from various websites are stored by the browser Some of them contain login credentials or site preferences However others are used for tracking user behavior over long periods of time so browsers typically provide a section in the menu for deleting cookies Finer grained management of cookies usually requires a browser extension br br br History br br The first web browser called WorldWideWeb was created in by Sir Tim Berners Lee He then recruited Nicola Pellow to write the Line Mode Browser which displayed web pages on dumb terminals The Mosaic web browser was released in April and was later credited as the first web browser to find mainstream popularity Its innovative graphical user interface made the World Wide Web easy to navigate and thus more accessible to the average person This in turn sparked the Internet boom of the s when the Web grew at a very rapid rate The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation which released the Mosaic influenced Netscape Navigator in Navigator quickly became the most popular browser br Microsoft debuted Internet Explorer in leading to a browser war with Netscape Within a few years Microsoft gained a dominant position in the browser market for two reasons it bundled Internet Explorer with its popular Windows operating system and did so as freeware with no restrictions on usage The market share of Internet Explorer peaked at over in the early s In Netscape launched what would become the Mozilla Foundation to create a new browser using the open source software model This work evolved into the Firefox browser first released by Mozilla in Firefox s market share peaked at in Apple released its Safari browser in it remains the dominant browser on Apple devices though it did not become popular elsewhere br Google debuted its Chrome browser in which steadily took market share from Internet Explorer and became the most popular browser in Chrome has remained dominant ever since By Microsoft replaced Internet Explorer with Edge for the Windows release br Since the early s browsers have greatly expanded their HTML CSS JavaScript and multimedia capabilities One reason has been to enable more sophisticated websites such as web apps Another factor is the significant increase of broadband connectivity in many parts of the world enabling people to access data intensive content such as streaming HD video on YouTube that was not possible during the era of dial up modems br br br Browser market br br Google Chrome has been the dominant browser since the mid s and currently has a global market share on all devices The vast majority of its source code comes from Google s open source Chromium project this code is also the basis for many other browsers including Microsoft Edge currently in third place with about a share and Opera and Samsung Internet in fifth and sixth place with over each br The other two browsers in the top four are made from different codebases Safari based on Apple s WebKit code is dominant on Apple devices resulting in a global share Firefox with about a share is based on Mozilla s code Both of these codebases are open source so a number of small niche browsers are also made from them br br br Features br The most popular browsers share many features in common They automatically log users browsing history unless the users turn off their browsing history or use the non logging private mode They also allow users to set bookmarks customize the browser with extensions and can manage user passwords Some provide a sync service and web accessibility features br br Common user interface UI features br br Allowing the user to have multiple pages open at the same time either in different browser windows or in different tabs of the same window br Back and forward buttons to go back to the previous page visited or forward to the next one br A refresh or reload and a stop button to reload and cancel loading the current page In most browsers the stop button is merged with the reload button br A home button to return to the user s home page br An address bar to input the URL of a page and display it and a search bar to input queries into a search engine In most browsers the search bar is merged with the address bar br While mobile browsers have similar UI features as desktop versions the limitations of touch screens require mobile UIs to be simpler The difference is significant for users accustomed to keyboard shortcuts The most popular desktop browsers also have sophisticated web development tools br br br Security br br Web browsers are popular targets for hackers who exploit security holes to steal information destroy files and other malicious activities Browser vendors regularly patch these security holes so users are strongly encouraged to keep their browser software updated Other protection measures are antivirus software and being aware of scams br br br See also br br Comparison of web browsers br History of the World Wide Web br Timeline of web browsers br br br br br br External links br br Media
