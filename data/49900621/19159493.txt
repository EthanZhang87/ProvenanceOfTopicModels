Microsoft POSIX subsystem is one of four subsystems shipped with the first versions of Windows NT the other three being the Win subsystem which provided the primary API for Windows NT plus the OS and security subsystems br This subsystem implements only the POSIX standard also known as IEEE Std or ISO IEC primarily covering the kernel and C library programming interfaces which allowed a program written for other POSIX compliant operating systems to be compiled and run under Windows NT The Windows NT POSIX subsystem did not provide the interactive user environment parts of POSIX originally standardized as POSIX That is Windows NT did not provide a POSIX shell nor any Unix commands out of the box except for pax The NT POSIX subsystem also did not provide any of the POSIX extensions that postdated the creation of Windows NT such as those for POSIX Threads or POSIX IPC br br The NT POSIX subsystem was included with the first versions of Windows NT because of s US federal government requirements listed in Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS Briefly these documents required that certain types of government purchases be POSIX compliant so that if Windows NT had not included this subsystem computing systems based on it would not have been eligible for some government contracts Windows NT versions and were certified as compliant with FIPS br The runtime environment of the subsystem is provided by two files psxss exe and psxdll dll A POSIX application uses psxdll dll to communicate with the subsystem while communicating with posix exe to provide display capabilities on the Windows desktop br The POSIX subsystem was replaced in Windows XP and Windows Server by Windows Services for UNIX SFU which is based in part on OpenBSD code and other technology developed by Interix a company later purchased by Microsoft SFU was removed from later versions of Windows and Windows Server SFU is logically though not formally replaced by the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL in the Windows Anniversary Update and Windows Server Version respectively br br br See also br MKS Toolkit br UWIN br Cygwin br UnxUtils br Windows Subsystem for Linux br br br br br br Further reading br Russinovich Mark David Solomon December Microsoft Windows Internals Fourth Edition ed Microsoft Press ISBN br Compiling Executables for the Classic POSIX Subsystem on Windows a guide by Markus Gaasedelen
