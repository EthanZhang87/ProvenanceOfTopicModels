title: PowerUP (accelerator)
id: 28356751
PowerUP boards were dual processor accelerator boards designed by Phase Digital Products for Amiga computers They had two different processors a Motorola series k and a PowerPC working in parallel sharing the complete address space of the Amiga computer system br br br History br In Amiga Technologies GmbH announced they were going to port AmigaOS to PowerPC As part of their Power Amiga plan Amiga Technologies was going to launch new Power Amiga models using the PowerPC e reduced instruction set computer RISC CPU and in cooperation with Amiga Technologies Phase would release AmigaOS compatible PowerPC accelerator boards for old Amiga Amiga and Amiga models However in Amiga Technologies parent company ESCOM entered into deep financial problems and could not support Amiga development Due to a lack of resources the PowerPC project at Amiga Technologies stalled and Phase had to launch accelerators without a PowerPC native AmigaOS As a stopgap solution a new PowerUP kernel was created allowing new PPC native software run parallel with k Amiga OS To complicate things even further former Commodore International chief engineer Dave Haynie questioned Phase s plans to develop PowerPC boards without Amiga Technologies Their approach on the software front is kind of a hack and on the hardware front it s just too much like the old Commodore at best they ll wind up with interesting non standard and overpriced machines that can t keep up with the rapid changes in the industry br Nevertheless Phase had decided to go their own way and develop a PowerPC based AmigaOS compatible computer without Amiga Technologies They also announced plans to write a new Amiga OS compatible operating system Wolf Dietrich managing director of phase earlier commented that we found that Amiga Technologies offers us no sort of outlook or basis for developing into the future br There is no detailed information about how many PowerPC accelerator boards Phase and later DCE sold According to Ralph Schmidt in an AmigActive article featuring MorphOS there were about people using Phase PowerPC accelerator boards The unofficial PowerUP support page estimates similar figures br br br PowerUP software br PowerUP kernel is a multitasking kernel developed by Ralph Schmidt for Phase PowerPC accelerator boards The kernel ran alongside the AmigaOS where PPC and k native software could run parallel br The PowerUP kernel used Executable and Linkable Format ELF as the executable format and supported runtime linking relocations and custom sections it used GNU Compiler Collection GCC as its default compiler This caused controversy in the Amiga community when developers thought that phase was bringing too Unixish stuff to Amiga br It was feared that PowerUP kernel introducing shared objects and dynamic linking would replace the original shared library model and shared objects were indeed adapted into AmigaOS br Another controversy was caused by different designs and purposes of Blizzard PPC and Cyberstorm PPC boards The Blizzard PPC was designed to fit Amiga as a standalone device which would not need installing additional software but utilised Amiga s unique Autoconfig feature This caused problems to some rd party developers who developed their own PPC kernels for PowerUP cards since they could not work on Amiga without removing the PowerUP kernel first br A few hundred titles were released for PowerUP including TurboPrint PPC Amiga datatypes MP and MPEG players games Quake and Doom video games to mention few and various plugins including Flash Video plugin for Voyager web browser br br br PowerUP hardware br br br Blizzard e br On May Phase announced PowerUP accelerator board for the Amiga line of computers The card never
