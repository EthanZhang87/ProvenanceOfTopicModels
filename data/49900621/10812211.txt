JX is a free open source microkernel operating system developed by the University of Erlangen with both the kernel and applications implemented using the Java programming language br br br Overview br JX is implemented as an extended Java virtual machine the JX Core adding support to the Java system for features such as protection domains and hardware access along with several components written in Java that provide kernel facilities to applications running on the computer Because Java is a type safe language JX can provide isolation between running applications without needing to use hardware memory protection This technique known as language based protection means that system calls and inter process communication in JX does not cause an address space switch an operation which is slow on most computers JX runs on standard PCs supporting a limited range of common hardware elements br The primary benefits of JX include br br Based on a small trusted computing base TCB security system br Lack of address space switching br It is a highly flexible operating system with different configuration possibilities br br br See also br br JavaOS br br br br br br External links br Project home page br The JX Operating System br The Structure of a Type Safe Operating System br A Java Operating System as the Foundation of a Secure Network Operating System
