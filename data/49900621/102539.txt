Meiko Scientific Ltd was a British supercomputer company based in Bristol founded by members of the design team working on the Inmos transputer microprocessor br br br History br In when Inmos management suggested the release of the transputer be delayed Miles Chesney David Alden Eric Barton Roy Bottomley James Cownie and Gerry Talbot resigned and formed Meiko Japanese for well engineered to start work on massively parallel machines based on the processor Nine weeks later in July they demonstrated a transputer system based on experimental bit transputers at the SIGGRAPH in San Francisco br In a system based on bit T transputers was launched as the Meiko Computing Surface By Meiko had sold more than systems and grown to employees In Meiko launched the second generation Meiko CS system but the company ran into financial difficulties in the mid s The technical team and technology was transferred to a joint venture company named Quadrics Supercomputers World Ltd QSW formed by Alenia Spazio of Italy in mid At Quadrics the CS interconnect technology was developed into QsNet br As of a vestigial Meiko website still exists br br br Computing Surface br The Meiko Computing Surface sometimes retrospectively referred to as the CS was a massively parallel supercomputer The system was based on the Inmos transputer microprocessor later also using SPARC and Intel i processors br The Computing Surface architecture comprised multiple boards containing transputers connected together by their communications links via Meiko designed link switch chips A variety of different boards were produced with different transputer variants random access memory RAM capacities and peripherals br The initial software environments provided for the Computing Surface was Occam Programming System OPS Meiko s version of Inmos s D Transputer Development System This was soon superseded by a multi user version MultiOPS Later Meiko introduced Meiko Multiple Virtual Computing Surfaces M VCS a multi user resource management system let the processors of a Computing Surface be partitioned into several domains of different sizes These domains were allocated by M VCS to individual users thus allowing several simultaneous users access to their own virtual Computing Surfaces M VCS was used in conjunction with either OPS or MeikOS a Unix like single processor operating system br In Meiko launched the In Sun Computing Surface which repackaged the Computing Surface into VMEbus boards designated the MK series suitable for installation in larger Sun or Sun systems The Sun acted as front end host system for managing the transputers running development tools and providing mass storage A version of M VCS running as a SunOS daemon named Sun Virtual Computing Surfaces SVCS provided access between the transputer network and the Sun host br As the performance of the transputer became less competitive toward the end of the s the follow on T transputer being beset with delays Meiko added the ability to supplement the transputers with Intel i processors Each i board MK or MK contained two i s with up to MB of RAM each and two T s providing inter processor communication Sometimes known as the Concerto or simply the i Computing Surface these systems had limited success br Meiko also produced a SPARC processor board the MK which allowed the integration of the SunOS operating system into the Computing Surface architecture similarly to the In Sun Computing Surface These were usually used as front end host processors for transputer or i Computing Surfaces SVCS or an improved version called simply VCS was used to manage the transputer resources Computing Surface configurations with multiple MK boards were also possible br A major drawback of the Computing Surface architecture was poor I O bandwidth for general data shuffling Although aggregate bandwidth for special case data shuffling could be very high the general case has very poor performance relative to the compute bandwidth This made the Meiko Computing Surface uneconomic for many applications br br br MeikOS br br MeikOS also written as Meikos or MEiKOS is a Unix like transputer operating system developed for the Computing Surface during the late s br MeikOS was derived from an early version of Minix extensively modified for the Computing Surface architecture Unlike HeliOS another Unix like transputer operating system MeikOS is essentially a single processor operating system with a distributed file system MeikOS was intended for use with the Meiko Multiple Virtual Computing Surfaces M VCS resource management software which partitions the processors of a Computing Surface into domains manages user access to these domains and provides inter domain communication br MeikOS has diskless and fileserver variants the former running on the seat processor of an M VCS domain providing a command line user interface for a given user the latter running on processors with attached SCSI hard disks providing a remote file service named Surface File System SFS to instances of diskless MeikOS The two can communicate via M VCS br MeikOS was made obsolete by the introduction of the In Sun Computing Surface and the Meiko MK SPARC processor board which allow SunOS and Sun Virtual Computing Surfaces SVCS later developed as VCS to take over the roles of MeikOS and M VCS respectively The last MeikOS release was MeikOS in early br br br CS Interconnect br This was based on the transputer link protocol Meiko developed its own switch silicon on and European Silicon Systems ES gate array This application specific integrated circuit ASIC provided static connectivity and limited dynamic connectivity and was designed by Moray McLaren br br br CS br The CS was launched in and was Meiko s second generation system architecture superseding the earlier Computing Surface br The CS was an all new modular architecture based around SuperSPARC or hyperSPARC processors and optionally Fujitsu VP vector processors These implemented an instruction set similar to the Fujitsu VP vector supercomputer and had a nominal performance of megaflops on double precision arithmetic and double that on single precision The SuperSPARC processors ran at MHz initially later increased to MHz Subsequently hyperSPARC processors were introduced at or MHz The CS was intended to scale up to processors The largest CS system built was a processor system installed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory br The CS ran a customized version of Sun s operating system Solaris initially Solaris later and br br br Elan Elite Interconnect br The processors in a CS were connected by a Meiko designed multi stage packet switched fat tree network implemented in custom silicon br This project codenamed Elan Elite was started in as a speculative project to compete with the T Transputer from Inmos which Meiko intended to use as an interconnect technology The T began to suffer massive delays such that the internal project became the only viable interconnect choice for the CS br This interconnect comprised two devices code named Elan adapter and Elite switch Each processing element included an Elan chip a communications co processor based on the SPARC architecture accessed via a Sun MBus cache coherent interface and providing two MB s bi directional links The Elite chip was an way link crossbar switch used to form the packet switched network The switch had limited adaption based on load and priority br Both ASICs were fabbed in complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS gate arrays by GEC Plessey in their Roborough Plymouth semi conductor fab in br After the Meiko technology was acquired by Quadrics the Elan Elite interconnect technology was developed into QsNet br br br Meiko SPARC FPU br Meiko had hired Fred Mark Homewood and Moray McLaren both of whom had been instrumental in the design of the T Together they designed and developed an improved higher performance FPU core owned by Meiko This was initially targeted at the Intel instruction set An ongoing legal battle between Intel AMD and others over the made it clear this project was a commercial non starter A chance discussion between McLaren and Andy Bechtolsheim while visiting Sun Microsystems to discuss licensing Solaris caused Meiko to re target the design for SPARC Meiko was able to turn around the core FPU design in a short time and LSI Logic fabbed a device for the SPARCstation br A major difference over the T FPU was that it fully implemented the IEEE standard for computer arithmetic This including all rounding modes denormalised numbers and square root in hardware without taking any hardware exceptions to complete computation br A SPARCstation design was also developed together with a combined part targeting the SPARCstation ASIC pinout LSI fabbed and manufactured the separate FPU L as part of their SparKIT chipset br The Meiko design was eventually fully licensed to Sun which went on to use it in the MicroSPARC family of ASICs for several generations in return for a one off payment and full Solaris source license br br br br br br External links br
