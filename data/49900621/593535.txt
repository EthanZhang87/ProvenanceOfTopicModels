z OS UNIX System Services z OS UNIX or informally USS is a base element of z OS z OS UNIX is a certified UNIX operating system implementation XPG UNIX optimized for mainframe architecture It is the first UNIX to not be derived from the AT T source code Through integration with the rest of z OS additional Time Sharing Option TSO commands are available alongside the usual UNIX services making it possible to process UNIX files using ISPF Extensions in JCL make it possible to use these files in batch processing br br br Overview br UNIX System Services allows UNIX applications from other platforms to run on IBM System z mainframes running z OS In many cases only a recompile is necessary although additional effort may be advisable for z OS integration such as SMP E installation support While z OS UNIX supports ASCII and Unicode and there s no technical requirement to modify ASCII and Unicode UNIX applications many z OS users often prefer EBCDIC support in their applications including those running in z OS UNIX Consequently z OS UNIX provides application and administrator services for converting to from EBCDIC Programs running under z OS UNIX have full secure access to the other internal functions of z OS Database access Db via Call Attach is one example of how z OS UNIX can access services found elsewhere in z OS Naturally such programs cannot be ported to non mainframe platforms without rewriting if they use these z OS specific services Conversely if a program adheres to UNIX standards such as POSIX and ANSI C it will be easier to move it between different UNIX operating systems including z OS UNIX br The file systems for z OS UNIX the older HFS with DFSMS MVS Version Release and the now preferred zFS which support UNIX style long filenames appear as datasets to the rest of z OS Numerous core z OS subsystems and applications rely on UNIX System Services including the z OS Management Facility XML parsing and generation services OpenSSH the IBM HTTP Server for z OS the z OS SDK for Java and some z OS PKI services as examples z OS UNIX also provides a shell environment OMVS br z OS UNIX s predecessor was an operating system component called OpenEdition MVS first implemented in MVS ESA SP and enhanced in MVS ESA OpenEdition MVS initially only supported the POSIX standards but X OPEN the predecessor to The Open Group certified MVS ESA SP V br IBM continues to enhance UNIX System Services Typically every release of z OS includes enhancements to z OS UNIX br br br See also br Linux on IBM Z br OpenSolaris for System z br UTS Mainframe UNIX br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br UNIX System Services
