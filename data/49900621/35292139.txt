BareMetal is an exokernel based single address space operating system OS created by Return Infinity br It is written in assembly to achieve high performance computing with minimal footprint with a just enough operating system JeOS approach The operating system is primarily targeted towards virtualized environments for cloud computing or HPCs due to its design as a lightweight kernel LWK It could be used as a unikernel br It was inspired by another OS written in assembly MikeOS and it is a recent example of an operating system that is not written in C or C nor based on Unix like kernels br br br Overview br br br Hardware requirements br AMD Intel based bit computer br Memory MB plus MB for every additional core br Hard Disk MB br br br One task per core br Multitasking on BareMetal is unusual for modern operating systems BareMetal uses an internal work queue that all CPU cores poll A task added to the work queue will be processed by any available CPU core in the system and will execute until completion which results in no context switch overhead br br br Programming br br br API br An API is documented but in line with its philosophy the OS does not enforce entry points for system calls e g no call gates or other safety mechanisms br br br C br BareMetal OS has a build script to pull the latest code make the needed changes and then compile C code using the Newlib C standard library br br br C br A mostly complete C Standard Library was designed and developed for working in ring The main goal of such library is providing on a library level an alternative to hardware memory protection used in classical OSes with help of carefully designed classes br br br Rust br A Rust program demonstration was added to the programs in November demonstrating the ability to write Rust programs for BareMetal OS br br br Networking br br br TCP IP stack br A TCP IP stack was the feature request A port of lwIP written in C was announced in October br minIP a minimalist IP stack in ANSI C able to provide enough functionalities to serve a simple static webpage is being developed as a proof of concept to learn the fundamentals in preparation for an x assembly re write planned for the future br br br br br br External links br ReturnInfinity on GitHub br BareMetal OS Google Group discussion forum
