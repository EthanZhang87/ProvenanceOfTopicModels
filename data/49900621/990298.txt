Ubuntu uu BUUN too is a Linux distribution derived from Debian and composed mostly of free and open source software Ubuntu is officially released in multiple editions Desktop Server and Core for Internet of things devices and robots The operating system is developed by the British company Canonical and a community of other developers under a meritocratic governance model As of April the most recent long term support release is Noble Numbat br As with other Linux distributions all of the editions can run on a computer alone or in a virtual machine An upgrade to Ubuntu is released every six months with long term support LTS releases every two years Canonical provides security updates and support for each Ubuntu release starting from the release date until the release reaches its designated end of life EOL date Canonical generates revenue through the sale of premium services related to Ubuntu and donations from those who download the Ubuntu software br br Ubuntu is named after the Nguni philosophy of ubuntu humanity to others with a connotation of I am what I am because of who we all are Since the release of the first version in Ubuntu has become one of the most popular Linux distributions for general purposes and is backed by large online communities like Ask Ubuntu Numerous community editions of Ubuntu also exist It is also popular for cloud computing with support for OpenStack br br br Background br br Ubuntu is built on Debian s architecture and infrastructure and comprises Linux server desktop and discontinued phone and tablet operating system versions Ubuntu releases updated versions predictably every six months and each release receives free support for nine months eighteen months prior to with security fixes high impact bug fixes and conservative substantially beneficial low risk bug fixes The first release was in October br Current long term support LTS releases are supported for five years and are released every two years Since the release of Ubuntu every fourth release receives long term support Long term support includes updates for new hardware security patches and updates to the Ubuntu stack cloud computing infrastructure The first LTS releases were supported for three years on the desktop and five years on the server since Ubuntu LTS desktop support for LTS releases was increased to five years as well LTS releases get regular point releases with support for new hardware and integration of all the updates published in that series to date br Ubuntu packages are based on Debian s unstable branch which are synchronized every six months Both distributions use Debian s deb package format and package management tools e g APT and Ubuntu Software Debian and Ubuntu packages are not necessarily binary compatible with each other however so packages may need to be rebuilt from source to be used in Ubuntu Many Ubuntu developers are also maintainers of key packages within Debian Ubuntu cooperates with Debian by pushing changes back to Debian although there has been criticism that this does not happen often enough Ian Murdock the founder of Debian had expressed concern about Ubuntu packages potentially diverging too far from Debian to remain compatible Before release packages are imported from Debian unstable continuously and merged with Ubuntu specific modifications At some point during the release process the Debian Import Freeze is implemented This prevents the automatic import of packages from Debian without an explicit request from a developer In combination with other freezes this helps packagers ensure that frozen features interoperate well together br Ubuntu is currently funded by Canonical Ltd On July Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical announced the creation of the Ubuntu Foundation and provided initial funding of US million The purpose of the foundation is to ensure the support and development for all future versions of Ubuntu Mark Shuttleworth describes the foundation goal as to ensure the continuity of the Ubuntu project br On March Ubuntu announced developer support for third party cloud management platforms such as those used at Amazon EC br bit x processors were supported up to Ubuntu It was decided to support legacy software i e select bit i packages for Ubuntu since out of support and LTS br br br Features br A default installation of Ubuntu as of version contains a minimal selection of software namely a web browser Firefox and basic GNOME utilities Many additional software packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software previously Ubuntu Software Center as well as any other APT based package management tools Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by default such as Evolution GIMP Pidgin and Synaptic are still accessible in the repositories and installable by the main tool or by any other APT based package management tool Cross distribution snap packages and Flatpaks are also available that both allow installing software such as some of Microsoft s software in most of the major Linux operating systems such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and in Fedora The default file manager is GNOME Files formerly called Nautilus br All of the application software installed by default is free software In addition Ubuntu redistributes some hardware drivers that are available only in binary format but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component br Ubuntu s default desktop changed back from the in house Unity to GNOME after nearly years in upon the release of version br br br Security br Ubuntu aims to be secure by default User programs run with low privileges and cannot corrupt the operating system or other users files For increased security the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes Polkit is also being widely implemented into the desktop br Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking A built in firewall allows end users who install network servers to control access A GUI GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall is available to configure it Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its software These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of in bit br Ubuntu also supports full disk encryption as well as encryption of the home and private directories br br br Installation br The system requirements vary among Ubuntu products For the Ubuntu desktop release LTS a PC with at least GHz dual core processor GB of RAM and GB of free disk space is recommended For less powerful computers there are other Ubuntu distributions such as Lubuntu and Xubuntu Ubuntu also supports the ARM architecture It is also available on Power ISA while older PowerPC architecture was at one point unofficially supported and now newer Power ISA CPUs POWER are supported The x AMD architecture is also officially supported br Live images are the typical way for users to assess and subsequently install Ubuntu These can be downloaded as a disk image iso and subsequently burnt to a DVD or USB flash drive and then booted Other methods include running the live version via UNetbootin Universal USB Installer or Startup Disk Creator a pre installed tool on Ubuntu available on machines already running the OS directly from a USB drive making respectively a live DVD or live USB medium Running Ubuntu in this way is slower than running it from a hard drive but does not alter the computer unless specifically instructed by the user If the user chooses to boot the live image rather than execute an installer at boot time there is still the option to then use the Ubuntu Desktop Installer once booted into the live environment The Ubuntu Desktop Installer replaced the former Ubiquity installer since Ubuntu Disk images of all current and past versions are available for download at the Ubuntu web site br Additionally USB flash drive installations can be used to boot Ubuntu and Kubuntu in a way that allows permanent saving of user settings and portability of the USB installed system between physical machines however the computers BIOS must support booting from USB In newer versions of Ubuntu the Ubuntu Live USB creator can be used to install Ubuntu on a USB drive with or without a live CD or DVD Creating a bootable USB drive with persistence is as simple as dragging a slider to determine how much space to reserve for persistence for this Ubuntu employs casper br br br Package classification and support br Ubuntu divides most software into four domains to reflect differences in licensing and the degree of support available Some unsupported applications receive updates from community members known as Masters of the Universe MOTU but not from Canonical Ltd br br Free software includes software that has met the Ubuntu licensing requirements which roughly correspond to the Debian Free Software Guidelines Exceptions however include firmware in the Main category because although some firmware is not allowed to be modified its distribution is still permitted br Non free software is usually unsupported Multiverse but some exceptions Restricted are made for important non free software Supported non free software includes device drivers that can be used to run Ubuntu on some current hardware such as binary only graphics card drivers The level of support in the Restricted category is more limited than that of Main because the developers may not have access to the source code It is intended that Main and Restricted should contain all software needed for a complete desktop environment br In addition to the above in which the software does not receive new features after an initial release Ubuntu Backports is an officially recognised repository for backporting newer software from later versions of Ubuntu br The updates repository provides stable release updates SRU of Ubuntu and are generally installed through update manager Each release is given its own updates repository e g intrepid updates The repository is supported by Canonical Ltd for packages in main and restricted and by the community for packages in universe and multiverse All updates to the repository must meet certain requirements and go through the proposed repository before being made available to the public Updates are scheduled to be available until the end of life for the release br In addition to the updates repository the unstable proposed repository contains uploads that must be confirmed before being copied into updates All updates must go through this process to ensure that the patch does truly fix the bug and there is no risk of regression Updates in proposed are confirmed by either Canonical or members of the community br Canonical previously hosted a partner repository that let vendors of proprietary software deliver their products to Ubuntu users at no cost through the same familiar tools for installing and upgrading software The software in the partner repository was officially supported with security and other important updates by its respective vendors Canonical supported the packaging of the software for Ubuntu and provided guidance to vendors However in anticipation for the release of Ubuntu LTS Canonical closed the partner repository as the only package still hosted in it was Adobe Flash which would not be released with Ubuntu developer Steve Langasek said in a development mailing list that he felt the Snap Store has matured to the point that I believe it supersedes the partner archive br br br Package Archives br A Personal Package Archive PPA is a software repository for uploading source packages to be built and published as an Advanced Packaging Tool APT repository by Launchpad While the term is used exclusively within Ubuntu Launchpad s host Canonical envisions adoption beyond the Ubuntu community br br br Third party software br Some third party software that does not limit distribution is included in Ubuntu s multiverse component The package ubuntu restricted extras additionally contains software that may be legally restricted including support for DVD playback Microsoft TrueType core fonts many common audio video codecs and unrar an unarchiver for files compressed in the RAR file format br Additionally third party application suites are available for download via Ubuntu Software and the Snap store including many games such as Braid Minecraft and Oil Rush software for DVD playback and media codecs br br br Releases br br Each Ubuntu release has a version number that consists of the year and month number of the release For example the first release was Ubuntu as it was released on October br Ubuntu releases are also given alliterative code names using an adjective and an animal e g Xenial Xerus With the exception of the first two releases code names are in alphabetical order allowing a quick determination of which release is newer at least until restarting the cycle with the release of Artful Aardvark in October Commonly Ubuntu releases are referred to using only the adjective portion of the code name for example the LTS release is commonly known as Bionic Releases are timed to be approximately one month after GNOME releases br Upgrades from one LTS release to the next LTS release e g Ubuntu LTS to Ubuntu LTS etc are supported while upgrades from non LTS have only supported upgrade to the next release regardless of its LTS status e g Ubuntu to Ubuntu LTS However it is possible to skip an LTS upgrade going straight from LTS to LTS by waiting for a point release that supports such updating br LTS releases have optional extended security maintenance ESM support available including e g Bionic that is otherwise out of public support adding support for that version up to giving a total of years br Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat was released on October This departed from the traditional schedule of releasing at the end of October in order to get the perfect and makes a playful reference to The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy books since in binary equals decimal the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything within the series br Ubuntu since requires a GB or larger installation medium However there is an option to install it with a Minimal CD br br br Variants br br Ubuntu Desktop formally named as Ubuntu Desktop Edition and simply called Ubuntu is the variant officially recommended for most users It is designed for desktop and laptop PCs and is officially supported by Canonical A number of variants are distinguished simply by each featuring a different desktop environment or in the case of Ubuntu Server no desktop LXQt and Xfce are often recommended for use with older PCs that may have less memory and processing power available br br br Official distributions br Most Ubuntu editions and flavours simply install a different set of default packages compared to the standard Ubuntu Desktop Since they share the same package repositories all of the same software is available for each of them Ubuntu Core is the sole exception as it only has access to packages in the Snap Store br br Ubuntu had some official distributions that have been discontinued such as Gobuntu including some previously supported by Canonical like Ubuntu Touch that is now maintained by volunteers UBports Community br br br Unofficial distributions br Alongside the official flavours are those that are unofficial These are still in the process of becoming recognised as official flavours by Canonical br br br Cloud computing br Ubuntu offers Ubuntu Cloud Images which are pre installed disk images that have been customised by Ubuntu engineering to run on cloud platforms such as Amazon EC OpenStack Microsoft Azure and LXC Ubuntu is also prevalent on VPS platforms such as DigitalOcean br br Ubuntu has support for OpenStack with Eucalyptus to OpenStack migration tools added by Canonical Ubuntu added focus on OpenStack as the Ubuntu s preferred IaaS offering though Eucalyptus is also supported Another major focus is Canonical Juju for provisioning deploying hosting managing and orchestrating enterprise data center infrastructure services by with and for the Ubuntu Server br br br Adoption and reception br br br Installed base br As Ubuntu is distributed freely and historically there was no registration process still optional Ubuntu usage can only be roughly estimated In Canonical s Ubuntu Insights page stated Ubuntu now has over million desktop users and counting br W Techs Web Technology Surveys estimated in November that br br Ubuntu is by far the most popular Linux distribution for running web servers of the websites they analyze it is used by of all the websites who use Linux and Ubuntu alone powers more websites than Microsoft Windows which powers of all websites or of the share Unix has which includes Linux and thus Ubuntu All Linux Unix distributions in total power well over twice the number of hosts as Windows for websites based on W Techs numbers Ubuntu and Debian only which Ubuntu is based on with the same package manager and thus administered the same way make up of all Linux distributions for web serving use the usage of Ubuntu surpassed Debian for such server use in May br Ubuntu is the most popular Linux distribution among the top sites and gains around of the top million websites per day br W Techs analyses the top million websites only br Wikimedia Foundation data based on user agent for September shows that Ubuntu generated the most page requests to Wikimedia sites including Wikipedia among recognizable Linux distributions br As of June Ubuntu is used in Microsoft NDv a Microsofts Azure cloud computer its fastest one of Azure supercomputers all running on Ubuntu currently rd fastest supercomputer on the TOP list only beaten by the only two exaflop computers is itself half an exaflop only the top are that powerful Other supercomputers running Ubuntu rank also high on the list e g NVIDIA s Selene supercomputer still ranks highly and was fifth fastest one in the world in November after an upgrade from seventh place where it entered the list in June Another Nvidia based supercomputer using Ubuntu previously topped the Green list it and the next one was also Ubuntu based a list which is a reordering of former list ordered by power efficiency On the TOP list that supercomputer was ranked nd and many Ubuntu based rank higher than that br br br Large scale deployments br The public sector has also adopted Ubuntu As of January the Ministry of Education and Science of North Macedonia deployed more than Ubuntu based classroom desktops and has encouraged every student in the country to use Ubuntu powered computer workstations the Spanish school system has Ubuntu desktops The French police having already started using open source software in by replacing Microsoft Office with OpenOffice org decided to transition to Ubuntu from Windows XP after the release of Windows Vista in By March the Gendarmerie Nationale had already switched workstations to Ubuntu Based on the success of that transition it planned to switch more over by the end of and to have switched all workstations over by GendBuntu project Lt Colonel Guimard announced that the move was very easy and allowed for a saving on the IT budget without having to reduce its capabilities In Ubuntu was adopted by the Indian justice system br In the city of Munich Germany started the LiMux project and later forked Kubuntu LTS for use on the city s computers After originally planning to migrate desktop computers to LiMux it was announced in December that the project had completed successfully with the migration of out of desktop computers but still keeping about Windows clients for unported applications In February the majority coalition decided against heavy protest from the opposition to evaluate the migration back to Windows after Microsoft had decided to move its company headquarters to Munich Governing Mayor Dieter Reiter cited lack of compatibility with systems outside of the administrative sector such as requiring a governmental mail server to send e mails to his personal smartphone as reasons for the return but has been criticised for evaluating administrative IT based on private and business standards In May the recently elected Alliance The Greens party and the Social Democrat party negotiated a new coalition agreement stating Where it is technologically and financially possible the city will put emphasis on open standards and free open source licensed software br In March the government of Iceland launched a project to get all public institutions using free and open source software Already several government agencies and schools have adopted Ubuntu The government cited cost savings as a big factor for the decision and also stated that open source software avoids vendor lock in A month project was launched to migrate the biggest public institutions in Iceland to using open source software and help ease the migration for others US president Barack Obama s successful campaign for re election in used Ubuntu in its IT department In August the city of Turin Italy announced its migration from Windows XP to Ubuntu for the desktop computers used by the municipality becoming the first city in Italy to adopt Ubuntu br Starting in the Wikimedia Foundation the non profit organization behind Wikipedia switched from multiple different Linux operating systems to Ubuntu br br br Reception br Ubuntu was awarded the Reader Award for best Linux distribution at the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in London received favorable reviews in online and print publications and has won InfoWorld s Bossie Award for Best Open Source Client OS In early PC World named Ubuntu the best all around Linux distribution available today though it criticized the lack of an integrated desktop effects manager Chris DiBona the program manager for open source software at Google said I think Ubuntu has captured people s imaginations around the Linux desktop and If there is a hope for the Linux desktop it would be them As of January almost half of Google s employees used Goobuntu a slightly modified version of Ubuntu In ZDNet reported that Ubuntu was still Google s desktop of choice In March Matt Hartley picked a list of best Linux distributions for Datamation he chose Ubuntu as number one br In Jamie Hyneman co host of the American television series MythBusters advocated Linux giving the example of Ubuntu as a solution to software bloat Other celebrity users of Ubuntu include science fiction writer Cory Doctorow and actor Stephen Fry br In January the UK s authority for computer security CESG reported that Ubuntu LTS was the only operating system that passes as many as out of requirements without any significant risks though it was unclear if any other Linux distributions were tested br br br bit deprecation controversy br In June Canonical announced that they would be deprecating support for bit applications and libraries in Ubuntu br Because Steam s Linux client depends on these bit libraries Valve announced that they would no longer be supporting Ubuntu After uproar from the Linux gaming community Canonical backtracked on this decision and decided to support select bit libraries As a result Valve decided that Steam would support Ubuntu again br Wine needs most of the same bit library packages that the Steam package depends on and more to enable its version of WoW to run bit Windows applications The parts of Wine that would continue to function without bit libraries would be limited to the subset of Windows applications that have a bit version removing decades of Windows compatibility In Canonical s statement on bringing back the libraries they mentioned using container technology in the future to make sure that Wine continues to function br br br Conformity with European data privacy law br Soon after being introduced in doubts emerged on the conformance of the shopping lens a feature that displays Amazon suggestions in the searching tool Unity Dash with the European Data Protection Directive A petition was later signed and delivered to Canonical demanding various modifications to the feature in order to clearly frame it within European law Canonical did not reply br In a formal complaint on the shopping lens was filed with the Information Commissioner s Office ICO the UK data privacy office Almost one year later the ICO ruled in favor of Canonical considering the various improvements introduced to the feature in the meantime to render it conformable with the Data Protection Directive According to European rules this ruling is automatically effective in the entirety of the European Union However the ruling also made clear that at the time of introduction the feature was not legal among other things since it was missing a privacy policy statement br br br System terminal advertising controversies br Ubuntu has integrated increasing quantities of advertising into the operating system s terminal leading to multiple controversies with its user base br In Canonical placed a message regarding HBO s Silicon Valley in the MOTD file causing the message to be shown whenever a terminal session started Over the following years more messages would be placed into the MOTD br In ads for Ubuntu s premium service Ubuntu Advantage were introduced into the apt system update utility This move caused controversy in the user community with some users considering advertising a fair business model to support development while other users found the inclusion inappropriate and annoying br br br Local communities LoCos br br In an effort to reach out to users who are less technical and to foster a sense of community around the distribution Local Communities better known as LoCos have been established throughout the world Originally each country had one LoCo Team However in some areas most notably the United States and Canada each state or province may establish a team A LoCo Council approves teams based upon their efforts to aid in either the development or the promotion of Ubuntu br br br Hardware vendor support br Ubuntu works closely with OEMs to jointly make Ubuntu available on a wide range of devices A number of vendors offer computers with Ubuntu pre installed including Dell Hasee Sharp Corporation and Cirrus Specifically Dell offers the XPS laptop Developer Edition with Ubuntu pre installed Together Dell Lenovo HP and Acer offer over desktop and over laptop PCs preloaded with Ubuntu System computers are also sold with Ubuntu Dell and System customers are able to choose between day three month and yearly Ubuntu support plans through Canonical Dell computers running Ubuntu include extra support for ATI AMD Video Graphics Dell Wireless fingerprint readers HDMI Bluetooth DVD playback using LinDVD and MP WMA WMV Asus also sold some Eee PCs with Ubuntu pre installed and announced many more models running Ubuntu for Vodafone has made available a notebook for the South African market called Webbook br Dell sells computers initially Inspiron R and R laptops pre loaded with Ubuntu in India and China with and retail outlets respectively Starting in Alienware began offering its X model gaming desktop pre installed with Ubuntu at a lower price than if it were pre installed with Windows br While Linux already works on IBM s mainframe system Linux on IBM Z IBM in collaboration with Canonical and SUSE Linux Foundation will form a new Open Mainframe Project announced Ubuntu support for their z Architecture for the first time IBM claimed their system IBM zEnterprise System version z the most powerful computer in the world in it was then the largest computer by transistor count again claimed fastest in with IBM z at the time of their biggest code drop LinuxOne in Linux history br In early Intel launched the Intel Compute Stick small form factor computer available preloaded with Ubuntu or Windows operating systems br br br Windows interoperability br Many Windows applications can be run on Ubuntu much like in other Linux distributions using the Wine compatibility layer which can be managed via frontends such as Bottles br Multiple Windows virtual machines can also be installed by KVM QEMU and Virt Manager Graphics settings are easiest in QXL SPICE mode For D accelerated graphics performance there is a third party VirGL driver or GPU Full Passthrough mode br In a networked environment file sharing between Ubuntu Linux and Windows is possible by Samba client server software Host Ubuntu Linux and the guest Windows virtual machines are also virtually networked in KVM so file sharing between the host and virtual guest machines can also be done by the Samba in the KVM environment br RDP server of GNOME Remote Desktop and Remmina client software is used for remote desktop connection between Ubuntu Linux and the other OSs br In March Microsoft announced that it would support the Ubuntu userland on top of the Windows kernel by implementing the Linux system calls as a subsystem At the time it was focused on command line tools like Bash and was aimed at software developers WSL was made available with Windows version As of other Linux distributions are also supported br In Microsoft announced the new WSL subsystem that includes a Linux kernel that Canonical announced will have full support for Ubuntu By this time it was possible to run graphical Linux apps on Windows In Microsoft went on to add out of the box support for graphical Linux apps through the WSLg project br In May Microsoft extended its Threat and Vulnerability Management solution which was a Windows only solution thus far to support Ubuntu RHEL and CentOS Starting with version PowerShell runs on Ubuntu and can manage both Windows and Ubuntu computers remotely from either platforms br br br See also br Comparison of Linux distributions br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Ubuntu at DistroWatch
