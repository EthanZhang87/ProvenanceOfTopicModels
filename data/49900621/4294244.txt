HelenOS is an operating system based on a multiserver microkernel design The source code of HelenOS is written in C and published under the BSD Clause license br The system is described as a research development open source operating system br br br Technical overview br The microkernel handles multitasking memory management and inter process communication It also provides kernel based threads and supports symmetric multiprocessing br Typical to microkernel design file systems networking device drivers and graphical user interface are isolated from each other into a collection of user space components that communicate via a message bus br Each process called task can contain several threads preemptively scheduled by the kernel which in turn can contain several fibers scheduled cooperatively in user space Device and file system drivers as well as other system services are implemented by a collection of user space tasks servers creating thus the multiserver nature of HelenOS br Tasks communicate via HelenOS IPC which is connection oriented and asynchronous It can be used to send small fixed size messages blocks of bytes or to negotiate sharing of memory Messages can be forwarded without copying bulk data or mapping memory to the address space of middle men tasks br br br Development br HelenOS development is community driven The developer community consists of a small core team mainly staff and former and contemporary students of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in Prague and a number of contributors around the world In and HelenOS participated in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization In the project was a mentoring organization in the ESA Summer of Code in Space program br The source code of HelenOS is published under the BSD Clause license while some third party components are available under the GNU General Public License Both of these licences are free software licenses making HelenOS free software br br br Hardware support br HelenOS runs on several different CPU architectures including ARM x IA IA Itanium MIPS PowerPC bit only SPARC V and RISC V At some point in time various versions of HelenOS ran on real hardware from each architecture as opposed to running only in a simulator of that architecture br HelenOS supports PATA SATA USB mass storage USB HID an Atheros USB WiFi dongle several Ethernet network cards SoundBlaster and Intel HDA audio devices serial ports keyboards mice and framebuffers br br br Research and academic use br HelenOS is being used for research in the area of software components and verification by the Department of Distributed and Dependable Systems Charles University Prague Besides that HelenOS has been used by students as a platform for software projects and master theses br br br br br br External links br br HelenOS home page br HelenOS theses papers and documentation br HelenOS on GitHub
