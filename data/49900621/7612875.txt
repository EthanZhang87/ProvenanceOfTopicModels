SUSE Linux SOO s SOO z German zu z is a computer operating system developed by SUSE It is built on top of the free and open source Linux kernel and is distributed with system and application software from other open source projects SUSE Linux is of German origin its name being an acronym of Software und System Entwicklung software and systems development and it was mainly developed in Europe The first version appeared in early making SUSE one of the oldest existing commercial distributions It is known for its YaST configuration tool br Novell bought the SUSE then SuSE brands and trademarks in Novell one of the founding members of the Open Invention Network decided to make the community an important part of their development process by opening widely the distribution development to outside contributors in creating the openSUSE distribution and the openSUSE Project Novell employed more than developers working on SUSE in On April Novell and SUSE were acquired by The Attachmate Group which made SUSE an independent business unit Later in October the entire Attachmate Group including SUSE was acquired by the British firm Micro Focus International SUSE continues to operate as an independent business unit On July it was announced that Micro Focus would sell SUSE to Blitz GmbH a subsidiary of EQT AB for billion The acquisition was completed on March br br br History br br br The developer br The developing Gesellschaft f r Software und System Entwicklung mbH Lit Company for Software and System Development was founded on September in Nuremberg Germany by Roland Dyroff Thomas Fehr Burchard Steinbild and Hubert Mantel Three of the founders were still mathematics students at a university Fehr had already graduated and was working as a software engineer br The original idea was that the company would develop software and function as an advisory UNIX group According to Mantel the group decided to distribute Linux offering support br Their name at founding was S u S E Software und System Entwicklung Software and systems development however the full name has never been used S u S E was shortened to SuSE in October and restylized to SUSE in br br The official logo and current mascot of the distribution is a veiled chameleon officially named GEEKO a portmanteau of gecko and geek As with the company s name the GEEKO logo has evolved to reflect company name changes br br br Origins br The company started as a service provider regularly releasing software packages that included Softlanding Linux System SLS now defunct and Slackware and printing UNIX and Linux manuals and offering technical assistance br These third party products SUSE initially used had those characteristics and were managed by SUSE in different fashions br br In mid Peter MacDonald created the comprehensive Linux distribution known as SLS which offered elements such as X and TCP IP This was distributed to people who wanted to get Linux via floppy disks br In Patrick Volkerding cleaned up the SLS Linux distribution releasing a newer version as Slackware br In with help from Patrick Volkerding Slackware scripts were translated into German which was marked as the first release of S u S E Linux distribution It was available first on floppies and then on CDs br To build its own Linux distribution S u S E used SLS in and jurix in as starting point This was created by Florian La Roche who joined the S u S E team He began to develop YaST the installer and configuration tool that would become the central point of the distribution br In the first distribution under the name S u S E Linux was published as S u S E Linux a reference to the answer to The Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything from the Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy YaST s first version number was a similar reference br br br Expansion br br Over time SuSE Linux incorporated many aspects of Red Hat Linux such as its RPM Package Manager and its file structure br S u S E became the largest Linux distributor in Germany In SuSE LLC was established under the direction of president and managing partner James Gray in Oakland California which enabled the company to develop Linux markets in the Americas and Asia While Red Hat was ubiquitous in the United States SuSE Linux continued to grow in Germany as well as in Nordic countries such as Finland and Sweden In October the name was changed officially to SuSE without dots Linus Torvalds the creator of the Linux kernel used it fairly often SuSE entered the UK in br In the company was forced to reduce its staff significantly in order to survive br br br Novell br br On November Novell announced it would acquire SuSE Linux AG for million The acquisition was finalized in January br In a move to reach its business audience more effectively SuSE introduced the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server in and a few months before Novell s purchase changed the company name to SUSE Linux SUSE is now a name not an acronym br According to J Philips Novell s corporate technology strategist for the Asia Pacific region Novell would not in the medium term alter the way in which SUSE was developed At Novell s annual BrainShare conference in for the first time all of their computers were run with SUSE Linux and it was announced that the proprietary SUSE administration program YaST would be released under the GPL license br br br The openSUSE Project br On August Novell announced that the SUSE Professional series would become more open with the launch of the openSUSE Project community The software always had been open source but openSUSE opened the development process allowing developers and users to test and develop it Previously all development work had been accomplished in house by SUSE Version was the first version that offered public beta testing br SUSE Linux included both open source and proprietary applications and retail boxed set editions As part of the change YaST Online Update server access became free for all SUSE Linux users and also for the first time the GNOME desktop was upgraded to equal status with the traditional KDE br In November SUSE founder Hubert Mantel announced his resignation from the company He stated that Novell s acquisition had changed SUSE beyond his expectations and that he did not believe it was the same company that he had founded years earlier The resignation apparently stemmed from a dispute over the implementation of Ximian products in the GNOME based default desktop environment for the Linux distribution br He re joined only a year later br br br Microsoft agreement br On November renewed July Novell signed an agreement with Microsoft covering improvement of SUSE s ability to interoperate with Microsoft Windows cross promotion marketing of both products and patent cross licensing The agreement is considered controversial by some in the Free Software community br br br The Attachmate Group takeover br On November Novell announced that it had agreed to acquisition by The Attachmate Group for billion The Attachmate Group plans to operate Novell as two units with SUSE becoming a stand alone business and it anticipates no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project as a result of this transaction br The U S Department of Justice announced that in order to proceed with the first phase of their acquisition of certain patents and patent applications from Novell Inc CPTN Holdings LLC and its owners would have to alter their original agreements to address the department s antitrust concerns The department said that as originally proposed the deal would jeopardize the ability of open source software such as Linux to continue to innovate and compete in the development and distribution of server desktop and mobile operating systems as well as middleware and virtualization products br Stipulations regarding the licensing the patents were br br All of the Novell patents will be acquired subject to the GNU General Public License Version a widely adopted open source license and the Open Invention Network OIN License a significant license for the Linux System br CPTN does not have the right to limit which of the patents if any are available under the OIN license and br Neither CPTN nor its owners will make any statement or take any action with the purpose of influencing or encouraging either Novell or Attachmate to modify which of the patents are available under the OIN license br The acquisition was completed on April Subsequently on July The Attachmate Group launched a new website for the SUSE business br br br Micro Focus merger br On November the Attachmate Group merged with Micro Focus to form the Micro Focus Group SUSE is operated as a separate business unit with a dedicated product portfolio br br br EQT AB acquisition br On July it was announced that Micro Focus would sell its SUSE business segment to EQT AB for billion The acquisition was completed on March br br br

a freely available community project that releases versions on a comparatively frequent basis and generally uses the latest versions of the various open source projects that it includes br SUSE Linux Enterprise is SUSE s commercial edition which SUSE releases much less frequently enabling it to offer support more effectively for enterprise and production deployments It is certified for a wide variety of enterprise applications and offers a number of special enterprise features including High Availability and Point of Sale extensions SUSE historically uses a heavily tested subset of packages from openSUSE Linux as the basis for SUSE Linux Enterprise Starting with openSUSE SUSE made its Leap variant directly upgradable to SUSE Linux Enterprise br br br SUSE Linux Enterprise Server vs Desktop br SUSE offers SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop Each focuses on packages that fit its specific purpose For example SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop does not include the Apache Web Server and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server does not include Xgl Compiz br In contrast openSUSE does not have separate distributions for server desktop and tablets Rather its repositories contain the needed software and use installation patterns to accomplish the same br br br openSUSE Linux br br openSUSE is driven by the openSUSE Project community and sponsored by SUSE to develop and maintain SUSE Linux components It is the equivalent of the historic SuSE Linux Professional After their acquisition of SUSE Linux Novell now SUSE decided to make the community central to their development process br It has a theoretical development cycle of months and a lifetime duration of the critical updates of months from the date of release It is fully and freely available for immediate download br openSUSE was the ninth most popular Linux distribution in on DistroWatch br br br SUSE Linux Enterprise br br SUSE develops multiple products for its enterprise business line These business products target corporate environments with a higher life cycle years extendable to a longer development cycle to months a guarantee of stability at the potential expense of development speed technical support and certification by independent hardware and software vendors SUSE Linux Enterprise products are only available for sale updates fees br SUSE Linux Enterprise has fewer packages than the openSUSE distribution Most of the differences are desktop applications that are more suited to consumers than to business The enterprise products are br br SUSE Linux Enterprise Server SLES is a server oriented operating system targeted at corporate environments br SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time is a modified version of SLES supporting low latency operations where the time factor is critical br SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop SLED is a desktop oriented operating system targeted at corporate environments br SUSE Linux Enterprise Thin Client SLETC is a modified version of SLED targeted at thin client terminals br When installed using a Linux kernel Novell Open Enterprise Server OES uses SUSE Linux Enterprise Server as a platform This product is also known as OES Linux
