id: 263521
MorphOS is an AmigaOS like computer operating system OS It is a mixed proprietary and open source OS produced for the Pegasos PowerPC PPC processor based computer PowerUP accelerator equipped Amiga computers and a series of Freescale development boards that use the Genesi firmware including the Efika and mobileGT Since MorphOS Apple s Mac mini G is supported as well and with the release of MorphOS and MorphOS the eMac and Power Mac G models are respectively supported The release of MorphOS added limited support for Power Mac G The core based on the Quark microkernel is proprietary although several libraries and other parts are open source such as the Ambient desktop br br br Characteristics and versions br Developed for PowerPC CPUs from Freescale and IBM it also supports the original AmigaOS Motorola series k MC x applications via proprietary task based emulation and most AmigaOS PPC applications via API wrappers It is API compatible with AmigaOS and has a GUI based on the Magic User Interface MUI br Besides the Pegasos version of MorphOS there is a version for Amiga computers equipped with PowerUP accelerator cards produced by Phase This version is free as is registration If unregistered it slows down after each two hour session PowerUP MorphOS was most recently updated on February however it does not exceed the feature set or advancement of the Pegasos release br A version of MorphOS for the Efika a very small mainboard based on the ultra low power MPC B processor from Freescale has been shown at exhibitions and user gatherings in Germany Current since release of MorphOS supports the Efika br br br Components br br br ABox br ABox is an emulation sandbox featuring a PPC native AmigaOS API clone that is binary compatible with both k Amiga applications and both PowerUP and WarpOS formats of Amiga PPC executables ABox is based in part on AROS Research Operating System ABox includes Trance JIT code translator for k native Amiga applications br br br Other br AHI audio interface br Ambient the default MorphOS desktop inspired by Workbench and Directory Opus br CyberGraphX graphics interface originally developed for Amiga computers br Magic User Interface primary graphical user interface GUI toolkit br Poseidon the Amiga USB stack developed by Chris Hodges br TurboPrint the printing system br TinyGL OpenGL implementation and Warp D compatibility is featured via Rendering Acceleration Virtual Engine RAVE low level API V br Quark manages the low level systems and hosts the A Box currently br br br Ambient br br Ambient is the build in MUI based desktop environment for MorphOS the development was started in by David Gerber Its main goals were that it should be fully asynchronous simple and fast Ambient remotely resembles Workbench and Directory Opus Magellan trying to mix the best of both worlds br br br Features br Ambient does not strictly follow the Amiga Workbench interface paradigm but there are still many similarities while programs are called tools program attributes are called tooltypes data files are projects and directories are drawers br br support for ARexx scripting language br default icon library for hundreds of fileformats br fully asynchronous multi threaded design br fast asynchronous file I O functions and file notifications br support for PNG and other Amiga icon formats br built in icon workbench and wbstart libraries br built in applications like disk formatting and commodities manager br panels which are used as program launchers br Ambient is localised for various languages and while it is an intrinsic part of MorphOS it is also available separately There are various visual effects in Ambient that take advantage of hardware accelerated visual effects within MorphOS br br br Desktop icons br The native icon format in Ambient is PNG but there is built in support for other Amiga icon formats Ambient introduced a special icon format called DataType Icons where the icon is simply any image file renamed to include the info extension Those icons are read using the Amiga DataType system br br br Development status br In David Gerber released Ambient source code under GPL and it is now developed by the Ambient development team br br br See also br br Amiga Workbench br Scalos br br br MorphOS software br MorphOS can run any system friendly Amiga software written for k processors Also it is possible to use k libraries or datatypes on PPC applications and vice versa It also provides compatibility layer for PowerUP and WarpUP software written for PowerUP accelerator cards The largest repository is Aminet with over packages online with packages from all Amiga flavors including music sound and artwork MorphOS only software repositories are hosted at MorphOS software MorphOS files and MorphOS Storage br br br Bundled applications br br MorphOS is delivered with several desktop applications in the form of pre installed software br br br

Eon Technology br AmigaOne X mainboard br br br History br br The project began in based on the Quark microkernel The earliest versions of MorphOS ran only via PPC accelerator cards on the Amiga computers and required portions of AmigaOS to fully function A collaborative effort between the companies bPlan of which the lead MorphOS developer is a partner and Thendic France in resulted in the first regular non prototype production of bPlan engineered Pegasos computers capable of running MorphOS or Linux Thendic France had financial problems and folded however the collaboration continued under the new banner of Genesi A busy promotional year followed in with appearances at conventions and exhibitions in several places around the world including the Consumer Electronics Show CES in Las Vegas br After some bitter disagreements within the MorphOS development team in and culminating with accusations by a MorphOS developer that he and others had not been paid the Ambient desktop interface was released under GPL and is now actively developed by the Ambient development team Subject to GPL rules Ambient continues to be included in the commercial MorphOS product An alternative MorphOS desktop system is Scalos br On April the MorphOS team announced that MorphOS would be released within Q This promise was only kept by a few seconds with the release of MorphOS occurring on June CET MorphOS is commercially available at a price of per machine for the Efika PPC or Sam boards A fully functional demo of MorphOS is available but without a keyfile its speed is decreased significantly after minutes of use per session rebooting the system allows for another minutes of use br br br Release history of x x series br br br Release history of x x series br br MorphOS includes a native TCP IP stack Netstack and a Web browser Sputnik or Origyn Web Browser Sputnik was begun under a user community bounty system that also resulted in MOSNet a free separate TCP IP stack for MorphOS users Sputnik is a port of the KHTML rendering engine on which WebKit is also based Sputnik is no longer being developed and was removed from later MorphOS releases br br br See also br br
