MQX Message Queue eXecutive is a real time operating system RTOS developed by Precise Software Technologies Inc and currently sold by Synopsys Embedded Access Inc and NXP Semiconductors br Like most RTOSs MQX includes a multitasking kernel with pre emptive scheduling and fast interrupt response extensive inter process communication and synchronization facilities and a file system br Its configurable size conserves computer memory space using a minimum of KB of read only memory ROM including its kernel interrupts semaphores queues and a memory manager br MQX includes an Internet protocol suite TCP IP stack RTCS embedded File Allocation Table based DOS file system MFS Universal Serial Bus USB host device stack and design debugging task aware TAD and remote and performance analysis tools It is supported by popular libraries for Secure Sockets Layer SSL and Transport Layer Security TLS such as wolfSSL for increased security measures br MQX is generally used in embedded systems MQX development occurs on a host machine running Unix or Windows and cross compiles target software to run on various target central processing unit CPU architectures br MQX has been ported to many platforms and now runs on most modern CPUs used in the embedded market including Kinetis ColdFire PowerPC ARC ARM StrongARM xScale br All new Kinetis ARM Cortex M i MX RT ARM Cortex M and ColdFire devices will be enabled with complementary Freescale MQX RTOS Freescale plans to expand the availability of this complementary integrated enablement software to include many embedded processors in its broad portfolio br br br History br MQX had its origins at Dy Systems Inc a company based in Ottawa Canada In a small team of software engineers there consisting of Jeremy James Mati Sauks and Craig Honegger started researching novel applications for embedded multiprocessors This work led to the use of a real time operating system in writing firmware for Dy single board computers In James and Sauks commercialized the Harmony RTOS with the name MPX which was developed for portable multiprocessor real time computing systems by the National Research Council Canada and created a company named Precise Software Technologies Inc br This effort led to developing the Precise Real Time Executive technology that was the basis of a product named MQX and MQX m which were real time executives for single processor and multiprocessor applications The unique asynchronous message passing paradigm delivered by MQX when it was introduced in and the royalty free licensing model were accepted immediately in the embedded real time market Since the introduction of MQX Precise continually added functions to the MQX RTOS through its various iterations and versions br Precise Software Technologies was acquired by ARC International in March and continued to develop license and sell MQX on many new processor architectures including Freescale ColdFire IBM Freescale PowerPC and ARM In Embedded Access assumed distribution and support of the MQX RTOS on non ARC processor architectures In Freescale began shipping the MQX RTOS complimentary with selected ColdFire MCUs br MQX has been used in thousands of embedded projects by over companies who have shipped millions of products running it Today firms such as ABB Agilent ATI Technologies Baoruh Electronic Bausch and Lomb General Dynamics Daewoo Exabyte General Electric B F Goodrich Liebert Matrox Mitel Networks Philips Porsche QLogic SICK Sony Tyco and Xerox use MQX in applications such as industrial control networking storage and consumer electronics br br br br br br External links br Official website NXP Semiconductors br Embedded Access
