PowerPC with the backronym Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC Performance Computing sometimes abbreviated as PPC is a reduced instruction set computer RISC instruction set architecture ISA created by the Apple IBM Motorola alliance known as AIM PowerPC as an evolving instruction set has been named Power ISA since while the old name lives on as a trademark for some implementations of Power Architecture based processors br Originally intended for personal computers the architecture is well known for being used by Apple s desktop and laptop lines from until and in several videogame consoles including Microsoft s Xbox Sony s PlayStation and Nintendo s GameCube Wii and Wii U PowerPC was also used for the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers on Mars and a variety of satellites It has since become a niche architecture for personal computers particularly with AmigaOS implementations but remains popular for embedded systems br PowerPC was the cornerstone of AIM s PReP and Common Hardware Reference Platform CHRP initiatives in the s It is largely based on the earlier IBM POWER architecture and retains a high level of compatibility with it the architectures have remained close enough that the same programs and operating systems will run on both if some care is taken in preparation newer chips in the Power series use the Power ISA br br br History br The history of RISC began with IBM s research project on which John Cocke was the lead developer where he developed the concepts of RISC in based microprocessors were used in a number of IBM embedded products eventually becoming the register IBM ROMP processor used in the IBM RT PC The RT PC was a rapid design implementing the RISC architecture Between the years of and IBM started a project to build the fastest microprocessor on the market this new bit architecture became referred to as the America Project throughout its development cycle which lasted for approximately years The result is the POWER instruction set architecture introduced with the RISC System in early br The original POWER microprocessor one of the first superscalar RISC implementations is a high performance multi chip design IBM soon realized that a single chip microprocessor was needed in order to scale its RS line from lower end to high end machines Work began on a one chip POWER microprocessor designated the RSC RISC Single Chip In early IBM realized its design could potentially become a high volume microprocessor used across the industry br br br Apple and Motorola involvement br Apple had already realized the limitations and risks of its dependency upon a single CPU vendor at a time when Motorola was falling behind on delivering the CPU Furthermore Apple had conducted its own research and made an experimental quad core CPU design called Aquarius which convinced the company s technology leadership that the future of computing was in the RISC methodology IBM approached Apple with the goal of collaborating on the development of a family of single chip microprocessors based on the POWER architecture Soon after Apple being one of Motorola s largest customers of desktop class microprocessors asked Motorola to join the discussions due to their long relationship Motorola having had more extensive experience with manufacturing high volume microprocessors than IBM and to form a second source for the microprocessors This three way collaboration between Apple IBM and Motorola became known as the AIM alliance br In the PowerPC was just one facet of a larger alliance among these three companies At the time most of the personal computer industry was shipping systems based on the Intel and chips which have a complex instruction set computer CISC architecture and development of the Pentium processor was well underway The PowerPC chip was one of several joint ventures involving the three alliance members in their efforts to counter the growing Microsoft Intel dominance of personal computing br For Motorola POWER looked like an unbelievable deal It allowed the company to sell a widely tested and powerful RISC CPU for little design cash on its own part It also maintained ties with an important customer Apple and seemed to offer the possibility of adding IBM too which might buy smaller versions from Motorola instead of making its own br At this point Motorola already had its own RISC design in the form of the which was doing poorly in the market Motorola was doing well with its family and the majority of the funding was focused on this The effort was somewhat starved for resources br The was already in production however Data General was shipping machines and Apple already had prototype machines running The had also achieved a number of embedded design wins in telecom applications If the new POWER one chip version could be made bus compatible at a hardware level with the that would allow both Apple and Motorola to bring machines to market far faster since they would not have to redesign their board architecture br The result of these various requirements is the PowerPC performance computing specification The differences between the earlier POWER instruction set and that of PowerPC is outlined in Appendix E of the manual for PowerPC ISA v br br br Operating systems br Since IBM had a long standing desire for a unifying operating system that would simultaneously host all existing operating systems as personalities upon one microkernel From to the company designed and aggressively evangelized what would become Workplace OS primarily targeting PowerPC br When the first PowerPC products reached the market they were met with enthusiasm In addition to Apple both IBM and the Motorola Computer Group offered systems built around the processors Microsoft released Windows NT for the architecture which was used in Motorola s PowerPC servers and Sun Microsystems offered a version of its Solaris OS IBM ported its AIX Unix Workplace OS featured a new port of OS with Intel emulation for application compatibility pending a successful launch of the PowerPC Throughout the mid s PowerPC processors achieved benchmark test scores that matched or exceeded those of the fastest x CPUs br Ultimately demand for the new architecture on the desktop never truly materialized Windows OS and Sun customers faced with the lack of application software for the PowerPC almost universally ignored the chip IBM s Workplace OS platform and thus OS for PowerPC was summarily canceled upon its first developers release in December due to the simultaneous buggy launch of the PowerPC The PowerPC versions of Solaris and Windows were discontinued after only a brief period on the market Only on the Macintosh due to Apple s persistence did the PowerPC gain traction To Apple the performance of the PowerPC was a bright spot in the face of increased competition from Windows and Windows NT based PCs br With the cancellation of Workplace OS the general PowerPC platform especially AIM s Common Hardware Reference Platform was instead seen as a hardware only compromise to run many operating systems one at a time upon a single unifying vendor neutral hardware platform br In parallel with the alliance between IBM and Motorola both companies had development efforts underway internally The PowerQUICC line was the result of this work inside Motorola The xx series of embedded processors was underway inside IBM The IBM embedded processor business grew to nearly US million in revenue and attracted hundreds of customers br br The development of the PowerPC is centered at an Austin Texas facility called the Somerset Design Center The building is named after the site in Arthurian legend where warring forces put aside their swords and members of the three teams that staff the building say the spirit that inspired the name has been a key factor in the project s success thus far br Part of the culture here is not to have an IBM or Motorola or Apple culture but to have our own br br br Breakup of AIM br br Toward the close of the decade manufacturing issues began plaguing the AIM alliance in much the same way they did Motorola which consistently pushed back deployments of new processors for Apple and other vendors first from Motorola in the s with the PowerPC xx and xx processors and IBM with the bit PowerPC processor in In Motorola exited the chip manufacturing business by spinning off its semiconductor business as an independent company called Freescale Semiconductor Around the same time IBM exited the bit embedded processor market by selling its line of PowerPC products to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation AMCC and focusing on bit chip designs while maintaining its commitment of PowerPC CPUs toward game console makers such as Nintendo s GameCube Wii and Wii U Sony s PlayStation and Microsoft s Xbox of which the latter two both use bit processors In Apple announced they would no longer use PowerPC processors in their Apple Macintosh computers favoring Intel produced processors instead citing the performance limitations of the chip for future personal computer hardware specifically related to heat generation and energy usage as well as the inability of IBM to move the processor to the GHz range The IBM Freescale alliance was replaced by an open standards body called Power org Power org operates under the governance of the IEEE with IBM continuing to use and evolve the PowerPC processor on game consoles and Freescale Semiconductor focusing solely on embedded devices br IBM continues to develop PowerPC microprocessor cores for use in their application specific integrated circuit ASIC offerings Many high volume applications embed PowerPC cores br The PowerPC specification is now handled by Power org where IBM Freescale and AMCC are members PowerPC Cell and POWER processors are now jointly marketed as the Power Architecture Power org released a unified ISA combining POWER and PowerPC ISAs into the new Power ISA v specification and a new reference platform for servers called PAPR Power Architecture Platform Reference br br br Generations br Many PowerPC designs are named and labeled by their apparent technology generation That began with the G which was an internal project name inside AIM for the development of what would become the PowerPC family Apple popularized the term G when they introduced Power Mac G and PowerBook G at an event at November Motorola and Apple liked the moniker and used the term G for the family introduced in and the Power Mac G in br At the time the G was launched Motorola categorized all their PowerPC models former current and future according to what generation they adhered to even renaming the older e core G Motorola had a G project that never came to fruition and Apple later used the name when the family launched in though it was designed and built by IBM br br PowerPC generations according to Motorola c br G The and family processors br G The and families br G The and families br G The and families br G The and families Motorola abandoned the G name after Apple applied it to the br G The br These designs didn t become real products br br br Design features br br The PowerPC is designed along RISC principles and allows for a superscalar implementation Versions of the design exist in both bit and bit implementations Starting with the basic POWER specification the PowerPC added br br Support for operation in both big endian and little endian modes the PowerPC can switch from one mode to the other at run time see below This feature is not supported in the PowerPC br Single precision forms of some floating point instructions in addition to double precision forms br Additional floating point instructions at the behest of Apple br A complete bit specification that is backward compatible with the bit mode br A fused multiply add br A paged memory management architecture that is used extensively in server and PC systems br Addition of a new memory management architecture called Book E replacing the conventional paged memory management architecture for embedded applications Book E is application software compatible with existing PowerPC implementations but needs minor changes to the operating system br Some instructions present in the POWER instruction set were deemed too complex and were removed in the PowerPC architecture Some removed instructions could be emulated by the operating system if necessary The removed instructions are br br Conditional moves br Load and store instructions for the quad precision floating point data type br String instructions br br br Endian modes br Most PowerPC chips switch endianness via a bit in the MSR machine state register with a second bit provided to allow the OS to run with a different endianness Accesses to the inverted page table a hash table that functions as a TLB with off chip storage are always done in big endian mode The processor starts in big endian mode br In little endian mode the three lowest order bits of the effective address are exclusive ORed with a three bit value selected by the length of the operand This is enough to appear fully little endian to normal software An operating system will see a warped view of the world when it accesses external chips such as video and network hardware Fixing this warped view requires that the motherboard perform an unconditional bit byte swap on all data entering or leaving the processor Endianness thus becomes a property of the motherboard An OS that operates in little endian mode on a big endian motherboard must both swap bytes and undo the exclusive OR when accessing little endian chips br AltiVec operations despite being bit are treated as if they were bit This allows for compatibility with little endian motherboards that were designed prior to AltiVec br An interesting side effect of this implementation is that a program can store a bit value the longest operand format to memory while in one endian mode switch modes and read back the same bit value without seeing a change of byte order This will not be the case if the motherboard is switched at the same time br Mercury Systems and Matrox ran the PowerPC in little endian mode This was done so that PowerPC devices serving as co processors on PCI boards could share data structures with host computers based on x Both PCI and x are little endian OS and Windows NT for PowerPC ran the processor in little endian mode while Solaris AIX and Linux ran in big endian br Some of IBM s embedded PowerPC chips use a per page endianness bit None of the previous applies to them br br br Implementations br br The first implementation of the architecture was the PowerPC released in based on the RSC implementing a hybrid of the POWER and PowerPC instructions This allowed the chip to be used by IBM in their existing POWER based platforms although it also meant some slight pain when switching to the nd generation pure PowerPC designs Apple continued work on a new line of Macintosh computers based on the chip and eventually released them as the based Power Macintosh on March br Accelerator cards based on the first generation PowerPC chips were created for the Amiga in anticipation for a move to a possible new Amiga platform designed around the PowerPC The accelerator cards also included either a Motorola or CPU in order to maintain backwards compatibility as very few apps at the time could run natively on the PPC chips However the new machines never materialized and Commodore subsequently declared bankruptcy Over a decade later AmigaOS would be released which would put the platform permanently on the architecture OS is compatible with those first generation accelerators as well as several custom motherboards created for a new incarnation of the Amiga platform br IBM also had a full line of PowerPC based desktops built and ready to ship unfortunately the operating system that IBM had intended to run on these desktops Microsoft Windows NT was not complete by early when the machines were ready for marketing Accordingly and further because IBM had developed animosity toward Microsoft IBM decided to port OS to the PowerPC in the form of Workplace OS This new software platform spent three years to in development and was canceled with the December developer release because of the disappointing launch of the PowerPC For this reason the IBM PowerPC desktops did not ship although the reference design codenamed Sandalbow based on the PowerPC CPU was released as an RS model Byte s April issue included an extensive article about the Apple and IBM PowerPC desktops br Apple which also lacked a PowerPC based OS took a different route Utilizing the portability platform yielded by the secret Star Trek project the company ported the essential pieces of their Mac OS operating system to the PowerPC architecture and further wrote a k emulator that could run k based applications and the parts of the OS that had not been rewritten br The second generation was pure and includes the low end PowerPC and high end PowerPC The is notable due to its very low cost and power consumption This was a deliberate design goal on Motorola s part who used the project to build the basic core for all future generations of PPC chips Apple tried to use the in a new laptop design but was unable due to the small KB level cache The emulator in the Mac OS could not fit in KB and thus slowed the computer drastically The e solved this problem by having a KB L cache which allowed the emulator to run efficiently br In developers at IBM s Essex Junction Burlington Vermont facility started to work on a version of the PowerPC that would support the Intel x instruction set directly on the CPU While this was just one of several concurrent power architecture projects that IBM was working on this chip began to be known inside IBM and by the media as the PowerPC Profitability concerns and rumors of performance issues in the switching between the x and native PowerPC instruction sets resulted in the project being canceled in after only a limited number of chips were produced for in house testing Aside the rumors the switching process took only cycles or the amount of time needed for the processor to empty its instruction pipeline Microsoft also aided the processor s demise by refusing to support the PowerPC mode br The first bit implementation is the PowerPC but it appears to have seen little use because Apple didn t want to buy it and because with its large die area it was too costly for the embedded market It was later and slower than promised and IBM used their own POWER design instead offering no bit small version until the late introduction of the PowerPC The is a bit processor derived from the POWER server processor To create it the POWER core was modified to be backward compatible with bit PowerPC processors and a vector unit similar to the AltiVec extensions in Motorola s xx series was added br IBM s RS processors are a family of chips implementing the Amazon variant of the PowerPC architecture These processors are used in the RS and IBM AS computer families the Amazon architecture includes proprietary extensions used by AS The POWER and later POWER processors implement the Amazon architecture and replaced the RS chips in the RS and AS families br IBM developed a separate product line called the xx line focused on the embedded market These designs included the and In IBM sold their xx product line to Applied Micro Circuits Corporation AMCC AMCC continues to develop new high performance products partly based on IBM s technology along with technology that was developed within AMCC These products focus on a variety of applications including networking wireless storage printing imaging and industrial automation br Numerically the PowerPC is mostly found in controllers in cars For the automotive market Freescale Semiconductor initially offered many variations called the MPC xx family such as the MPC built on a variation of the core called the xx and designed in Israel by MSIL Motorola Silicon Israel Limited The core is single issue meaning it can only issue one instruction in a clock cycle To this they add various bits of custom hardware to allow for I O on the one chip In the next generation four digit xx devices were launched for the automotive market These use the newer e series of PowerPC cores br Networking is another area where embedded PowerPC processors are found in large numbers MSIL took the QUICC engine from the MC and made the PowerQUICC MPC This was a very famous processor used in many Cisco edge routers in the late s Variants of the PowerQUICC include the MPC and the MPC MPC e All variants include a separate RISC microengine called the CPM that offloads communications processing tasks from the central processor and has functions for DMA The follow on chip from this family the MPC has a e based core and a different CPM br Honda also uses PowerPC processors for its ASIMO robot br In BAE Systems Platform Solutions delivered the Vehicle Management
