Gernot Heiser born is a Scientia Professor and the John Lions Chair for operating systems at UNSW Sydney where he leads the Trustworthy Systems group TS br br br Life br In Heiser joined the School of Computer Science and Engineering of UNSW Sydney originally as a lecturer reaching the rank of full professor in a position he retains to date br Also in he joined the newly created research organisation NICTA as one of its initial Program Leaders in charge of the Embedded Real Time and Operating Systems ERTOS program After a re organisation in ERTOS became the Software Systems Research Group SSRG which he led When NICTA was absorbed into CSIRO in Heiser stepped back from management of the group which was then called Trustworthy Systems TS In CSIRO abandoned TS at which time Heiser took the group back to UNSW and re assumed its leadership br Since April Heiser serves as the Founding Chairman of the seL Foundation br br br Research br Heiser s research focuses on microkernels microkernel based systems and virtual machines and emphasizes performance and reliability br His group produced Mungi a single address space operating system br for clusters of bit computers and implementations of the L microkernel with very fast inter process communication br His Gelato UNSW team was a founding member of the Gelato Federation and focused on performance and scalability of Linux on Itanium They established theoretical and practical performance limits of message passing inter process communication IPC on Itanium br After joining NICTA at its creation in his research shifted away from high end computing platforms and toward embedded systems with the aim of improving security safety and reliability via use of microkernel technology br This led to the development of a new microkernel called seL and its formal verification claimed to be the first ever complete proof of the functional correctness of a general purpose OS kernel br His work on virtualization was motivated by the need to provide a complete OS environment on his microkernels His Wombat project followed the approach taken with the L Linux project at Dresden but was a multi architecture paravirtualized Linux running on x ARM and MIPS hardware The Wombat work later formed the basis for the OKL hypervisor of his company Open Kernel Labs OK Labs br The desire to reduce the engineering effort of paravirtualization led to the development of the soft layering approach of automated paravirtulization which was demonstrated on x and Itanium hardware br His work on virtual non uniform memory access vNUMA demonstrated a hypervisor which presents a distributed system as a shared memory multiprocessor as a possible model for many core chips with large numbers of processor cores br Device drivers are another focus of his work including the first demonstration of user mode drivers with a performance overhead of less than br an approach to driver development that eliminates most typical driver bugs by design br device drivers produced from device test benches br and a demonstration of the feasibility of generating device drivers automatically from formal specifications br He also conducted research on operating system level energy management br Since leaving OK Labs in he focussed almost exclusively on seL and high assurance seL based systems both in research and in technology transfer Notable research achievements include sound and complete worst case execution time WCET analysis of seL claimed to be the first ever such analysis for a protected mode OS kernel br His work on extending seL s functionality to support mixed criticality systems MCS led to making time a first class resource in seL s capability system br Focussing on microarchitectural timing channels he demonstrated in the first practical cross core timing side channel attack br This led to work on the systematic prevention of timing channel leakage and the proposal of a set of mechanisms for achieving this collectively referred as time protection br In the past he also worked on semiconductor device simulation where he pioneered use of multi dimensional modeling to optimize silicon based solar cells br br br Awards and honours br German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina Leopoldina Member br The Royal Society of New South Wales RSN Fellow br Association for Computing
