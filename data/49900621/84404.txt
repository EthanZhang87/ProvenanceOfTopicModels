Xenix is a discontinued version of the Unix operating system for various microcomputer platforms licensed by Microsoft from AT T Corporation in the late s The Santa Cruz Operation SCO later acquired exclusive rights to the software and eventually replaced it with SCO UNIX now known as Xinuos OpenServer br In the mid to late s Xenix was the most common Unix variant measured according to the number of machines on which it was installed br Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said at Unix Expo in that for a long time Microsoft had the highest volume AT T Unix license br br br History br Bell Labs the developer of Unix was part of the regulated Bell System and could not sell Unix directly to most end users academic and research institutions excepted it could however license it to software vendors who would then resell it to end users or their own resellers combined with their own added features Microsoft which expected that Unix would be its operating system of the future when personal computers became powerful enough purchased a license for Version Unix from AT T in and announced on August that it would make the software available for the bit microcomputer market Because Microsoft was not able to license the Unix name itself the company gave it an original name br Microsoft called Xenix a universal operating environment It did not sell Xenix directly to end users but licensed the software to OEMs such as IBM Intel Management Systems Development Tandy Altos Computer SCO and Siemens SINIX which then ported it to their own proprietary computer architectures br br In Microsoft said the first version of Xenix was very close to the original Unix version source on the PDP and later versions were to incorporate its own fixes and improvements The company stated that it intended to port the operating system to the Zilog Z series Digital LSI Intel and Motorola and possibly numerous other processors and provide Microsoft s full line of system software products including BASIC and other languages The first port was for the Z bit processor the first customer ship was January for Central Data Corporation of Illinois followed in March by Paradyne Corporation s Z product br The first port was for the Altos Computer Systems non PC compatible series computers first customer ship date Q br Intel sold complete computers with Xenix under their Intel System brand with specific models such as or X they also offered the individual boards that made these computers under their iSBC brand This included processor boards like iSBC and also MMU boards such as the iSBC The first Intel Xenix systems shipped in July Tandy more than doubled the Xenix installed base when it made TRS Xenix the default operating system for its TRS Model based computer in early and was the largest Unix vendor in Seattle Computer Products also made PC incompatible computers bundled with Xenix like their Gazelle II which used the S bus and was available in late or early There was also a port for IBM System br SCO had initially worked on its own PDP port of V called Dynix but then struck an agreement with Microsoft for joint development and technology exchange on Xenix in Microsoft and SCO then further engaged Human Computing Resources Corporation HCR in Canada and a software products group within Logica plc in the United Kingdom as part of making further improvements to Xenix and porting Xenix to other platforms In doing so Microsoft gave HCR and Logica the rights to do Xenix ports and to license Xenix binary distributions in those territories br In a port to the based Apple Lisa was jointly developed by SCO and Microsoft and it was the first shrink wrapped binary product sold by SCO The Multiplan spreadsheet was released for it br In its OEM directory Microsoft said the difficulty in porting to the various and Z based machines had been the lack of a standardized memory management unit and protection facilities Hardware manufacturers compensated by designing their own hardware but the ensuing complexity made it extremely difficult if not impossible for the very small manufacturer to develop a computer capable of supporting a system such as Xenix from scratch and the Xenix kernel must be custom tailored to each new hardware environment Introduction br A generally available port to the unmapped Intel architecture was done by The Santa Cruz Operation around SCO Xenix for the PC XT shipped sometime in and contained some enhancement from BSD it also supported the Micnet local area networking br The later version of Xenix used the integrated MMU present on this chip by running in protected mode The Xenix was accompanied by new hardware from Xenix OEMs For example the Sperry PC IT an IBM PC AT clone was advertised as capable of supporting eight simultaneous dumb terminal users under this version br While Xenix was still based on Version Unix version was upgraded to a Unix System III code base a Intel manual for Xenix noted that the Xenix kernel had about lines at this time It was followed by a System V R codebase in Xenix a k a Xenix System V br Microsoft hopes that Xenix will become the preferred choice for software production and exchange the company stated in Microsoft referred to its own MS DOS as its single user single tasking operating system and advised customers who wanted multiuser or multitasking support to buy Xenix It planned over time to improve MS DOS so it would be almost indistinguishable from single user Xenix or XEDOS which would also run on the Z and LSI they would be upwardly compatible with Xenix which Byte in described as the multi user MS DOS of the future Microsoft s Chris Larson described MS DOS s Xenix compatibility as the second most important feature His company advertised DOS and Xenix together describing MS DOS its single user OS as sharing features and system calls with Xenix the multi user multi tasking Unix derived operating system and promising easy porting between them br After the breakup of the Bell System in AT T started selling System V Microsoft believing that it could not compete with Unix s developer decided to abandon Xenix The decision was not immediately transparent which led to the term vaporware It agreed with IBM to develop OS and the Xenix team together with the best MS DOS developers was assigned to that project In Microsoft transferred ownership of Xenix to SCO in an agreement that left Microsoft owning slightly less than of SCO this amount prevented both companies from having to disclose the exact amount in the event of an SCO IPO And SCO would acquire both of the other companies that had Xenix rights Logica s software products group in and HCR in When Microsoft eventually lost interest in OS as well the company based its further high end strategy on Windows NT br In SCO ported Xenix to the processor a bit chip after securing knowledge from Microsoft insiders that Microsoft was no longer developing Xenix Xenix System V Release introduced support for i SCSI and TCP IP SCO s Xenix System V was the first bit operating system available on the market for the x CPU architecture br Microsoft continued to use Xenix internally submitting a patch to support functionality in Unix to AT T in which trickled down to the code base of both Xenix and SCO Unix Microsoft is said to have used Xenix on Sun workstations and VAX minicomputers extensively within their company as late as All internal Microsoft email transport was done on Xenix based systems until when the company moved to its own Exchange Server product br SCO released its SCO Unix as a higher end product based on System V R and offering a number of technical advances over Xenix Xenix remained in the product line In the meantime AT T and Sun Microsystems completed the merge of Xenix BSD SunOS and System V R into System V R The last version of SCO Xenix itself was System V R released in br br br Features br Aside from its AT T Unix base Xenix incorporated elements from BSD notably the vi text editor and its supporting libraries termcap and curses Its kernel featured some original extensions by Microsoft notably file locking and semaphores while to the userland Microsoft added a visual shell for menu driven operation instead of the traditional UNIX shell A limited form of local networking over serial lines RS ports was possible through the micnet software which supported file transfer and electronic mail although UUCP was still used for networking via modems br OEMs often added further modifications to the Xenix system br br br Trusted Xenix br Trusted Xenix was a variant initially developed by IBM under the name Secure XENIX later versions under the Trusted Xenix name were developed by Trusted Information Systems It incorporated the Bell LaPadula model of multilevel security and had a multilevel secure interface for the STU III secure communications device that is an STU III connection would be made available only to those applications running at the same privilege level as the key loaded in the STU III It was evaluated by formal methods and achieved a B security rating under the DoD s Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria examples of A class systems are Honeywell s SCOMP Aesec s GEMSOS and Boeing s SNS Server Version was released in January version in April and version in September It was still in use as late as br br br See also
