Redox RED oks REE doks reduction oxidation or oxidation reduction is a type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of the reactants change Oxidation is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state while reduction is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state The oxidation and reduction processes occur simultaneously in the chemical reaction br There are two classes of redox reactions br br Electron transfer Only one usually electron flows from the atom ion or molecule being oxidized to the atom ion or molecule that is reduced This type of redox reaction is often discussed in terms of redox couples and electrode potentials br Atom transfer An atom transfers from one substrate to another For example in the rusting of iron the oxidation state of iron atoms increases as the iron converts to an oxide and simultaneously the oxidation state of oxygen decreases as it accepts electrons released by the iron Although oxidation reactions are commonly associated with the formation of oxides other chemical species can serve the same function In hydrogenation bonds like C C are reduced by transfer of hydrogen atoms br br br Terminology br Redox is a portmanteau of the words reduction and oxidation The term redox was first used in br Oxidation is a process in which a substance loses electrons Reduction is a process in which a substance gains electrons br The processes of oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously and cannot occur independently In redox processes the reductant transfers electrons to the oxidant Thus in the reaction the reductant or reducing agent loses electrons and is oxidized and the oxidant or oxidizing agent gains electrons and is reduced The pair of an oxidizing and reducing agent that is involved in a particular reaction is called a redox pair A redox couple is a reducing species and its corresponding oxidizing form e g Fe Fe The oxidation alone and the reduction alone are each called a half reaction because two half reactions always occur together to form a whole reaction br br br Oxidants br br Oxidation originally implied a reaction with oxygen to form an oxide Later the term was expanded to encompass substances that accomplished chemical reactions similar to those of oxygen Ultimately the meaning was generalized to include all processes involving the loss of electrons or the increase in the oxidation state of a chemical species A Substances that have the ability to oxidize other substances cause them to lose electrons are said to be oxidative or oxidizing and are known as oxidizing agents oxidants or oxidizers The oxidant removes electrons from another substance and is thus itself reduced A Because it accepts electrons the oxidizing agent is also called an electron acceptor Oxidants are usually chemical substances with elements in high oxidation states e g N O MnO CrO Cr O OsO or else highly electronegative elements e g O F Cl Br I that can gain extra electrons by oxidizing another substance br Oxidizers are oxidants but the term is mainly reserved for sources of oxygen particularly in the context of explosions Nitric acid is a strong oxidizer br br br Reductants br br Substances that have the ability to reduce other substances cause them to gain electrons are said to be reductive or reducing and are known as reducing agents reductants or reducers The reductant transfers electrons to another substance and is thus itself oxidized Because it donates electrons the reducing agent is also called an electron donor Electron donors can also form charge transfer complexes with electron acceptors The word reduction originally referred to the loss in weight upon heating a metallic ore such as a metal oxide to extract the metal In other words ore was reduced to metal Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated that this loss of weight was due to the loss of oxygen as a gas Later scientists realized that the metal atom gains electrons in this process The meaning of reduction then became generalized to include all processes involving a gain of electrons Reducing equivalent refers to chemical species which transfer the equivalent of one electron in redox reactions The term is common in biochemistry A reducing equivalent can be an electron or a hydrogen atom as a hydride ion br Reductants in chemistry are very diverse Electropositive elemental metals such as lithium sodium magnesium iron zinc and aluminium are good reducing agents These metals donate electrons relatively readily br Hydride transfer reagents such as NaBH and LiAlH reduce by atom transfer they transfer the equivalent of hydride or H These reagents are widely used in the reduction of carbonyl compounds to alcohols A related method of reduction involves the use of hydrogen gas H as sources of H atoms br br br Electronation and deelectronation br The electrochemist John Bockris proposed the words electronation and deelectronation to describe reduction and oxidation processes respectively when they occur at electrodes These words are analogous to protonation and deprotonation They have not been widely adopted by chemists worldwide although IUPAC has recognized the terms electronation and de electronation br br br Rates mechanisms and energies br br Redox reactions can occur slowly as in the formation of rust or rapidly as in the case of burning fuel Electron transfer reactions are generally fast occurring within the time of mixing br The mechanisms of atom transfer reactions are highly variable because many kinds of atoms can be transferred Such reactions can also be quite complex involving many steps The mechanisms of electron transfer reactions occur by two distinct pathways inner sphere electron transfer and outer sphere electron transfer br Analysis of bond energies and ionization energies in water allow calculation of the thermodynamic aspects of redox reactions br br br Standard electrode potentials reduction potentials br br Each half reaction has a standard electrode potential Eocell which is equal to the potential difference or voltage at equilibrium under standard conditions of an electrochemical cell in which the cathode reaction is the half reaction considered and the anode is a standard hydrogen electrode where hydrogen is oxidized br br H H e br The electrode potential of each half reaction is also known as its reduction potential Eored or potential when the half reaction takes place at a cathode The reduction potential is a measure of the tendency of the oxidizing agent to be reduced Its value is zero for H e H by definition positive for oxidizing agents stronger than H e g V for F and negative for oxidizing agents that are weaker than H e g V for Zn br For a redox reaction that takes place in a cell the potential difference is br br Eocell Eocathode Eoanode br However the potential of the reaction at the anode is sometimes expressed as an oxidation potential br br Eoox Eored br The oxidation potential is a measure of the tendency of the reducing agent to be oxidized but does not represent the physical potential at an electrode With this notation the cell voltage equation is written with a plus sign br br Eocell Eored cathode Eoox anode br br br Examples of redox reactions br br In the reaction between hydrogen and fluorine hydrogen is being oxidized and fluorine is being reduced br br H F HF br This reaction is spontaneous and releases kJ per g of hydrogen because the H F bond is much stronger than the F F bond This reaction can be analyzed as two half reactions The oxidation reaction converts hydrogen to protons br br H H e br The reduction reaction converts fluorine to the fluoride anion br br F e F br The half reactions are combined so that the electrons cancel br br The protons and fluoride combine to form hydrogen fluoride in a non redox reaction br br H F HF br The overall reaction is br br H F HF br br br Metal displacement br br In this type of reaction a metal atom in a compound or solution is replaced by an atom of another metal For example copper is deposited when zinc metal is placed in a copper II sulfate solution br br Zn s CuSO aq ZnSO aq Cu s br In the above reaction zinc metal displaces the copper II ion from copper sulfate solution and thus liberates free copper metal The reaction is spontaneous and releases kJ per g of zinc br The ionic equation for this reaction is br br Zn Cu Zn Cu br As two half reactions it is seen that the zinc is oxidized br br Zn Zn e br And the copper is reduced br br Cu e Cu br br br Other examples br The reduction of nitrate to nitrogen in the presence of an acid denitrification br NO e H N H O br The combustion of hydrocarbons such as in an internal combustion engine produces water carbon dioxide some partially oxidized forms such as carbon monoxide and heat energy Complete oxidation of materials containing carbon produces carbon dioxide br The stepwise oxidation of a hydrocarbon by oxygen in organic chemistry produces water and successively an alcohol an aldehyde or a ketone a carboxylic acid and then a peroxide br br br Corrosion and rusting br br The term corrosion refers to the electrochemical oxidation of metals in reaction with an oxidant such as oxygen Rusting the formation of iron oxides is a well known example of electrochemical corrosion it forms as a result of the oxidation of iron metal Common rust often refers to iron III oxide formed in the following chemical reaction br Fe O Fe O br The oxidation of iron II to iron III by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an acid br Fe Fe e br H O e OH br Here the overall equation involves adding the reduction equation to twice the oxidation equation so that the electrons cancel br Fe H O H Fe H O br br br Disproportionation br A disproportionation reaction is one in which a single substance is both oxidized and reduced For example thiosulfate ion with sulfur in oxidation state can react in the presence of acid to form elemental sulfur oxidation state and sulfur dioxide oxidation state br br S O H S SO H O br Thus one sulfur atom is reduced from to while the other is oxidized from to br br br Redox reactions in industry br Cathodic protection is a technique used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell A simple method of protection connects protected metal to a more easily corroded sacrificial anode to act as the anode The sacrificial metal instead of the protected metal then corrodes A common application of cathodic protection is in galvanized steel in which a sacrificial coating of zinc on steel parts protects them from rust br Oxidation is used in a wide variety of industries such as in the production of cleaning products and oxidizing ammonia to produce nitric acid br Redox reactions are the foundation of electrochemical cells which can generate electrical energy or support electrosynthesis Metal ores often contain metals in oxidized states such as oxides or sulfides from which the pure metals are extracted by smelting at high temperature in the presence of a reducing agent The process of electroplating uses redox reactions to coat objects with a thin layer of a material as in chrome plated automotive parts silver plating cutlery galvanization and gold plated jewelry br br br Redox reactions in biology br br Many important biological processes involve redox reactions Before some of these processes can begin iron must be assimilated from the environment br Cellular respiration for instance is the oxidation of glucose C H O to CO and the reduction of oxygen to water The summary equation for cell respiration is br br C H O O CO H O Energy br The process of cell respiration also depends heavily on the reduction of NAD to NADH and the reverse reaction the oxidation of NADH to NAD Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are complementary but photosynthesis is not the reverse of the redox reaction in cell respiration br br CO H O light energy C H O O br Biological energy is frequently stored and released by means of redox reactions Photosynthesis involves the reduction of carbon dioxide into sugars and the oxidation of water into molecular oxygen The reverse reaction respiration oxidizes sugars to produce carbon dioxide and water As intermediate steps the reduced carbon compounds are used to reduce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD to NADH which then contributes to the creation of a proton gradient which drives the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate ATP and is maintained by the reduction of oxygen In animal cells mitochondria perform similar functions br br Free radical reactions are redox reactions that occur as a part of homeostasis and killing microorganisms where an electron detaches from a molecule and then reattaches almost instantaneously Free radicals are a part of redox molecules and can become harmful to the human body if they do not reattach to the redox molecule or an antioxidant br The term redox state is often used to describe the balance of GSH GSSG NAD NADH and NADP NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ The redox state is reflected in the balance of several sets of metabolites e g lactate and pyruvate beta hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate whose interconversion is dependent on these ratios Redox mechanisms also control some cellular processes Redox proteins and their genes must be co located for redox regulation according to the CoRR hypothesis for the function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts br br br Redox cycling br Wide varieties of aromatic compounds are enzymatically reduced to form free radicals that contain one more electron than their parent compounds In general the electron donor is any of a wide variety of flavoenzymes and their coenzymes Once formed these anion free radicals reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and regenerate the unchanged parent compound The net reaction is the oxidation of the flavoenzyme s coenzymes and the reduction of molecular oxygen to form superoxide This catalytic behavior has been described as a futile cycle or redox cycling br br br Redox reactions in geology br br Minerals are generally oxidized derivatives of metals Iron is mined as its magnetite Fe O Titanium is mined as its dioxide usually in the form of rutile TiO To obtain the corresponding metals these oxides must be reduced which is often achieved by heating these oxides with carbon or carbon monoxide as reducing agents Blast furnaces are the reactors where iron oxides and coke a form of carbon are combined to produce molten iron The main chemical reaction producing the molten iron is br br Fe O CO Fe CO br br br Redox reactions in soils br Electron transfer reactions are central to myriad processes and properties in soils and redox potential quantified as Eh platinum electrode potential voltage relative to the standard hydrogen electrode or pe analogous to pH as log electron activity is a master variable along with pH that controls and is governed by chemical reactions and biological processes Early theoretical research with applications to flooded soils and paddy rice production was seminal for subsequent work on thermodynamic aspects of redox and plant root growth in soils Later work built on this foundation and expanded it for understanding redox reactions related to heavy metal oxidation state changes pedogenesis and morphology organic compound degradation and formation free radical chemistry wetland delineation soil remediation and various methodological approaches for characterizing the redox status of soils br br br Mnemonics br br The key terms involved in redox can be confusing For example a reagent that is oxidized loses electrons however that reagent is referred to as the reducing agent Likewise a reagent that is reduced gains electrons and is referred to as the oxidizing agent These mnemonics are commonly used by students to help memorise the terminology br br OIL RIG oxidation is loss of electrons reduction is gain of electrons br LEO the lion says GER grr loss of electrons is oxidation gain of electrons is reduction br LEORA says GEROA the loss of electrons is called oxidation reducing agent the gain of electrons is called reduction oxidizing agent br RED CAT and AN OX or AnOx RedCat an ox red cat reduction occurs at the cathode and the anode is for oxidation br RED CAT gains what AN OX loses reduction at the cathode gains electrons what anode oxidation loses electrons br PANIC Positive Anode and Negative is Cathode This applies to electrolytic cells which release stored electricity and can be recharged with electricity PANIC does not apply to cells that can be recharged with redox materials These galvanic or voltaic cells such as fuel cells produce electricity from internal redox reactions Here the positive electrode is the cathode and the negative is the anode br br br See
