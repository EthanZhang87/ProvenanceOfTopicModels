Cygwin SIG win is a free and open source Unix like environment and command line interface for Microsoft Windows The project also provides a software repository containing many open source packages Cygwin allows source code for Unix like operating systems to be compiled and run on Windows Cygwin provides native integration of Windows based applications br The terminal emulator Mintty is the default command line interface provided to interact with the environment The Cygwin installation directory layout mimics the root file system of Unix like systems with directories such as bin home etc usr and var br Cygwin is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License version It was originally developed by Cygnus Solutions which was later acquired by Red Hat now part of IBM to port the Linux toolchain to Win including the GNU Compiler Suite Rather than rewrite the tools to use the Win runtime environment Cygwin implemented a POSIX compatible environment in the form of a DLL br The brand motto is Get that Linux feeling on Windows br br br History br br Cygwin began in as a project of Steve Chamberlain a Cygnus engineer who observed that Windows NT and used COFF as their object file format and that GNU already included support for x and COFF and the C library newlib He thought that it would be possible to retarget GCC and produce a cross compiler generating executables that could run on Windows A prototype was later developed Chamberlain bootstrapped the compiler on a Windows system to emulate Unix to let the GNU configure shell script run br Initially Cygwin was called gnuwin When Microsoft registered the trademark Win the was dropped to simply become Cygwin br In Cygnus offered Cygwin as a commercial product Subsequent versions have not been released instead relying on continued open source releases br Geoffrey Noer was the project lead from to Christopher Faylor was lead from to he left Red Hat and became co lead with Corinna Vinschen Corinna Vinschen has been the project lead from mid to date as of March br From June the Cygwin library version was licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License LGPL version br br br Description br Cygwin is provided in two versions the full bit version and a stripped down bit version whose final version was released in Cygwin consists of a library that implements the POSIX system call API in terms of Windows system calls to enable the running of a large number of application programs equivalent to those on Unix systems and a GNU development toolchain including GCC and GDB Programmers have ported the X Window System K Desktop Environment GNOME Apache and TeX Cygwin permits installing inetd syslogd sshd Apache and other daemons as standard Windows services Cygwin programs have full access to the Windows API and other Windows libraries br Cygwin programs are installed by running Cygwin s setup program which downloads them from repositories on the Internet br The Cygwin API library is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License version or later with an exception to allow linking to any free and open source software whose license conforms to the Open Source Definition br Cygwin consists of two parts br br A dynamic link library in the form of a C standard library that acts as a compatibility layer for the POSIX API and br A collection of software tools and applications that provide a Unix like look and feel br Cygwin supports POSIX symbolic links representing them as plain text files with the system attribute set Cygwin represented them as Windows Explorer shortcuts but this was changed for reasons of performance and POSIX correctness Cygwin also recognises NTFS junction points and symbolic links and treats them as POSIX symbolic links but it does not create them The POSIX API for handling access control lists ACLs is supported br br br Technical details br A Cygwin specific version of the Unix mount command allows mounting Windows paths as filesystems in the Unix file space Initial mount points can be configured in etc fstab which has a format very similar to Unix systems except that Windows paths appear in place of devices Filesystems can be mounted in binary mode by default or in text mode which enables automatic conversion between LF and CRLF endings which only affects programs that open files without explicitly specifying text or binary mode br Cygwin introduced comprehensive support for POSIX locales and the UTF Unicode encoding became the default br The fork system call for duplicating a process is fully implemented but the copy on write optimization strategy could not be used br The Cygwin DLL contains a console driver that emulates a Unix style terminal within the Windows console Cygwin s default user interface is the bash shell running in the Cygwin console The DLL also implements pseudo terminal pty devices Cygwin ships with a number of terminal emulators that are based on them including mintty rxvt urxvt and xterm The version of GCC that comes with Cygwin has various extensions for creating Windows DLLs such as specifying whether a program is a windowing or console mode program Support for compiling programs that do not require the POSIX compatibility layer provided by the Cygwin DLL used to be included in the default GCC but as of it is provided by cross compilers contributed by the MinGW w project br br br Software packages br Cygwin s base package selection is about MB containing the bash interactive user and dash installation shells and the core file and text manipulation utilities Additional packages are available as optional installs from within the Cygwin setup program and package manager setup x exe bit The Cygwin Ports project provided additional packages that were not available in the Cygwin distribution itself Examples included GNOME K Desktop Environment MySQL database and the PHP scripting language Most ports have been adopted by volunteer maintainers as Cygwin packages and Cygwin Ports are no longer maintained Cygwin ships with GTK and Qt br The Cygwin X project allows graphical Unix programs to display their user interfaces on the Windows desktop for both local and remote programs br br br See also br Windows Subsystem for Linux Compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows br br br Notes br br br
