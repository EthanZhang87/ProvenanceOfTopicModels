JavaOS is a discontinued operating system based on a Java virtual machine It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems Unlike Windows macOS Unix or Unix like systems which are primarily written in the C programming language JavaOS is primarily written in Java It is now considered a legacy system br br br History br The Java programming language was introduced by Sun in May Jim Mitchell and Peter Madany at JavaSoft designed a new operating system codenamed Kona written completely in Java In March Tom Saulpaugh joined the now seven person Kona team to design an input output I O architecture having come from Apple as Macintosh system software engineer since June and co architect of Copland XI XIII br JavaOS was first evangelized in a Byte article In JavaSoft s official product announcement described the compact OS designed to run in anything from net computers to pagers In early JavaSoft transferred JavaOS to SunSoft In late Bob Rodriguez led the team to collaborate with IBM who then marketed the platform accelerated development and made significant key architectural contributions to the next release of JavaOS eventually renamed JavaOS for Business XI XIII IBM indicated its focus was more on network computer thin clients specifically to replace traditional IBM green screen and Unix X terminals and to implement single application clients br The Chorus distributed real time operating system was used for its microkernel technology XIII This began with Chorus Syst mes SA a French company licensing JavaOS from Sun and replacing the earlier JavaOS hardware abstraction layer with the Chorus microkernel thereby creating the Chorus Jazz product which was intended to allow Java applications to run in a distributed real time embedded system environment Then in September it was announced that Sun Microsystems was acquiring Chorus Syst mes SA br In Sun and IBM announced the discontinuation of the JavaOS product As early as Sun materials referred to JavaOS as a legacy technology recommending migration to Java ME leaving the choice of specific OS and Java environment to the implementer br br br Design br JavaOS is based on a hardware architecture native microkernel running on platforms including ARM PowerPC SPARC StrongARM and IA x The Java virtual machine runs on the microkernel All device drivers are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine A graphics and windowing system implementing the Abstract Window Toolkit AWT application programming interface API is also written in Java br JavaOS was designed to run on embedded systems and has applications in devices such as set top boxes computer networking infrastructure and automated teller machines ATMs It comes with the JavaStation br br br Licensing br JavaSoft granted licenses to more than manufacturers including Oracle Acer Xerox Toshiba and Nokia IBM and Sun announced the cooperation for JavaOS for Business at the end of March br br br See also br br Android operating system br Java Desktop System br JX operating system br Inferno operating system br SavaJe br Vino operating system br br br
