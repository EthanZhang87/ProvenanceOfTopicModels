The LynxOS RTOS is a Unix like real time operating system from Lynx Software Technologies formerly LynuxWorks Sometimes known as the Lynx Operating System LynxOS features full POSIX conformance and more recently Linux compatibility LynxOS is mostly used in real time embedded systems in applications for avionics aerospace the military industrial process control and telecommunications br br br History br The first versions of LynxOS were written in in Dallas Texas by Mitchell Bunnell and targeted at a custom built Motorola based computer The first platform LynxOS ran on was an Atari ST with cross development done on an Integrated Solutions UNIX machine In LynxOS was ported to the Intel architecture Around application binary interface ABI compatibility with UNIX System V was added Compatibility with other operating systems including Linux followed br Full Memory Management Unit support has been included in the kernel since for the reliability of protected memory and the performance advantages of virtual addresses The PowerPC architecture is also supported and in February Lynx announced planned support for the ARM Cortex A family br LynxOS components are designed for absolute determinism hard real time performance which means that they respond within a known period of time Predictable response times are ensured even in the presence of heavy input output I O due to the kernel s unique threading model which allows interrupt routines to be very short and fast br Lynx holds an expired patent on the technology that LynxOS uses to maintain hard real time performance U S patent was granted to Lynx November Operating System Architecture using Multiple Priority Light Weight kernel Task based Interrupt Handling br In Lynx introduced a specialized version of LynxOS named LynxOS especially for use in avionics applications that require certification to industry standards such as DO B br In late support for the programming language Rust was added to the certified toolchain for LynxOS and LynxElement unikernel br The Usenet newsgroup comp os lynx is devoted to discussion of LynxOS br br br br br br External links br Official website br Patent LynuxWorks Operating System Architecture using Multiple Priority Light Weight kernel Task based Interrupt Handling br Whitepaper Using the Microprocessor MMU for Software Protection in Real Time Systems br Applications using LynxOS and other Lynx operating systems
