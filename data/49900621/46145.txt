Solaris is a proprietary Unix operating system originally developed by Sun Microsystems After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in it was renamed Oracle Solaris br Solaris superseded the company s earlier SunOS in and became known for its scalability especially on SPARC systems and for originating many innovative features such as DTrace ZFS and Time Slider br Solaris supports SPARC and x workstations and servers from Oracle and other vendors Solaris was registered as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification until April br Historically Solaris was developed as proprietary software In June Sun Microsystems released most of the codebase under the CDDL license and founded the OpenSolaris open source project With OpenSolaris Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software After the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in January Oracle decided to discontinue the OpenSolaris distribution and the development model In August Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel effectively turning Solaris back into a closed source proprietary operating system Following that OpenSolaris was forked as Illumos and is alive through several illumos distributions In September Oracle laid off most of the Solaris teams br br br History br In AT T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time Berkeley Software Distribution UNIX System V and Xenix This became Unix System V Release SVR br On September Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD derived Unix SunOS with one based on SVR This was identified internally as SunOS but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time Solaris The justification for this new overbrand was that it encompassed not only SunOS but also the OpenWindows graphical user interface and Open Network Computing ONC functionality br Although SunOS x micro releases were retroactively named Solaris by Sun the Solaris name is used almost exclusively to refer only to the releases based on SVR derived SunOS and later br For releases based on SunOS the SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number For example Solaris incorporates SunOS After Solaris the was dropped from the release name so Solaris incorporates SunOS and the latest release SunOS forms the core of Solaris br Although SunSoft stated in its initial Solaris press release their intent to eventually support both SPARC and x systems the first two Solaris releases and were SPARC only An x version of Solaris was released in June about months after the SPARC version as a desktop and uniprocessor workgroup server operating system It included the Wabi emulator to support Windows applications At the time Sun also offered the Interactive Unix system that it had acquired from Interactive Systems Corporation In Sun released Solaris supporting both SPARC and x systems from a unified source code base br In the Solaris kernel source code leaked br On September Simon Phipps a former Sun Microsystems employee not hired by Oracle in the acquisition reported on Twitter that Oracle had laid off the Solaris core development staff which many interpreted as sign that Oracle no longer intended to support future development of the platform While Oracle did have a large layoff of Solaris development engineering staff development continued and Solaris was released in br br br Supported architectures br Solaris uses a common code base for the platforms it supports bit SPARC and x br Solaris has a reputation for being well suited to symmetric multiprocessing supporting a large number of CPUs It has historically been tightly integrated with Sun s SPARC hardware including support for bit SPARC applications since Solaris with which it is marketed as a combined package This has led to more reliable systems but at a cost premium compared to commodity PC hardware However it has supported x systems since Solaris and bit x applications since Solaris allowing Sun to capitalize on the availability of commodity bit CPUs based on the x architecture Sun heavily marketed Solaris for use with both its own x based Sun Java Workstation and the x models of the Sun Ultra series workstations and servers based on AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors as well as x systems manufactured by companies such as Dell Hewlett Packard and IBM As of the following vendors support Solaris for their x server systems br br Dell will test certify and optimize Solaris and OpenSolaris on its rack and blade servers and offer them as one of several choices in the overall Dell software menu br Intel br Hewlett Packard Enterprise distributes and provides software technical support for Solaris on BL DL and SL platforms br Fujitsu Siemens br br br Other platforms br Solaris included support for the PowerPC platform PowerPC Reference Platform but the port was canceled before the Solaris release In January a community of developers at Blastwave began work on a PowerPC port which they named Polaris In October an OpenSolaris community project based on the Blastwave efforts and Sun Labs Project Pulsar which re integrated the relevant parts from Solaris into OpenSolaris announced its first official source code release br A port of Solaris to the Intel Itanium architecture was announced in but never brought to market br On November IBM Sun and Sine Nomine Associates demonstrated a preview of OpenSolaris for System z running on an IBM System z mainframe under z VM called Sirius in analogy to the Polaris project and also due to the primary developer s Australian nationality HMS Sirius of was a ship of the First Fleet to Australia On October a prototype release of Sirius was made available and on November the same year IBM authorized the use of Sirius on System z Integrated Facility for Linux IFL processors br Solaris also supports the Linux platform application binary interface ABI allowing Solaris to run native Linux binaries on x systems This feature is called Solaris Containers for Linux Applications SCLA based on the branded zones functionality introduced in Solaris br br br Installation and usage options br Solaris can be installed from various pre packaged software groups ranging from a minimalistic Reduced Network Support to a complete Entire Plus OEM Installation of Solaris is not necessary for an individual to use the system The DVD ISO image can be used to load Solaris running in memory rather than initiating the installation br Additional software like Apache MySQL etc can be installed as well in a packaged form from sunfreeware and OpenCSW Solaris can be installed from physical media or a network for use on a desktop or server or be used without installing on a desktop or server br br br Updates br There are several types of updates within each major release including the Software Packages and the Oracle Solaris Image br Additional minor updates called Support Repository Updates SRUs and Critical Patch Update Packages CPUs require a support credential thus are not freely available to the public br br br Desktop environments br br Early releases of Solaris used OpenWindows as the standard desktop environment In Solaris to OpenWindows supported both NeWS and X applications and provided backward compatibility for SunView applications from Sun s older desktop environment NeWS allowed applications to be built in an object oriented way using PostScript a common printing language released in The X Window System originated from MIT s Project Athena in and allowed for the display of an application to be disconnected from the machine where the application was running separated by a network connection Sun s original bundled SunView application suite was ported to X br Sun later dropped support for legacy SunView applications and NeWS with OpenWindows which shipped with Solaris and switched to X R with Display Postscript support The graphical look and feel remained based upon OPEN LOOK OpenWindows was the last release under Solaris The OPEN LOOK Window Manager olwm with other OPEN LOOK specific applications were dropped in Solaris but support libraries were still bundled providing long term binary backwards compatibility with existing applications The OPEN LOOK Virtual Window Manager olvwm can still be downloaded for Solaris from sunfreeware and works on releases as recent as Solaris br br Sun and other Unix vendors created an industry alliance to standardize Unix desktops As a member of the Common Open Software Environment COSE initiative Sun helped co develop the Common Desktop Environment CDE This was an initiative to create a standard Unix desktop environment Each vendor contributed different components Hewlett Packard contributed the window manager IBM provided the file manager and Sun provided the e mail and calendar facilities as well as drag and drop support ToolTalk This new desktop environment was based upon the Motif look and feel and the old OPEN LOOK desktop environment was considered legacy CDE unified Unix desktops across multiple open system vendors CDE was available as an unbundled add on for Solaris and and was included in Solaris through br br In Sun issued a preview release of the open source desktop environment GNOME based on the GTK toolkit for Solaris Solaris introduced GNOME as an alternative to CDE Solaris includes Sun s Java Desktop System JDS which is based on GNOME and comes with a large set of applications including StarOffice Sun s office suite Sun describes JDS as a major component of Solaris The Java Desktop System is not included in Solaris which instead ships with a stock version of GNOME Likewise CDE applications are no longer included in Solaris but many libraries remain for binary backwards compatibility br The open source desktop environments KDE and Xfce along with numerous other window managers also compile and run on recent versions of Solaris br Sun was investing in a new desktop environment called Project Looking Glass since The project has been inactive since late br br br License br br br Traditional operating system license to br For versions up to Solaris Solaris was licensed under a license that permitted a customer to buy licenses in bulk and install the software on any machine up to a maximum number The key license grant was br br License to Use Customer is granted a non exclusive and non transferable license License for the use of the accompanying binary software in machine readable form together with accompanying documentation Software by the number of users and the class of computer hardware for which the corresponding fee has been paid br In addition the license provided a License to Develop granting rights to create derivative works restricted copying to only a single archival copy disclaimer of warranties and the like The license varied only little through br br br Open source until March br From Sun began to release the source code for development builds of Solaris under the Common Development and Distribution License CDDL via the OpenSolaris project This code was based on the work being done for the post Solaris release code named Nevada eventually released as Oracle Solaris As the project progressed it grew to encompass most of the necessary code to compile an entire release with a few exceptions br br br Post Sun closed source March to present br When Sun was acquired by Oracle in the OpenSolaris project was discontinued after the board became unhappy with Oracle s stance on the project In March the previously freely available Solaris was placed under a restrictive license that limited the use modification and redistribution of the operating system The license allowed the user to download the operating system free of charge through the Oracle Technology Network and use it for a day trial period After that trial period had expired the user would then have to purchase a support contract from Oracle to continue using the operating system br With the release of Solaris in the license terms changed again The new license allows Solaris and Solaris to be downloaded free of charge from the Oracle Technology Network and used without a support contract indefinitely however the license only expressly permits the user to use Solaris as a development platform and expressly forbids commercial and production use Educational use is permitted in some circumstances From the OTN license br br If You are an educational institution vested with the power to confer official high school associate bachelor master and or doctorate degrees or local equivalent Degree s You may also use the Programs as part of Your educational curriculum for students enrolled in Your Degree program s solely as required for the conferral of such Degree collectively Educational Use br When Solaris is used without a support contract it can be upgraded to each new point release however a support contract is required for access to patches and updates that are released monthly br br br Version history br br Notable features of Solaris include DTrace Doors Service Management Facility Solaris Containers Solaris Multiplexed I O Solaris Volume Manager ZFS and Solaris Trusted Extensions br Updates to Solaris versions are periodically issued In the past these were named after the month and year of their release such as Solaris as of Solaris sequential update numbers are appended to the release name with a period such as Oracle Solaris br In ascending order the following versions of Solaris have been released br br A more comprehensive summary of some Solaris versions is also available Solaris releases are also described in the Solaris FAQ br br br Development release br The underlying Solaris codebase has been under continuous development since work began in the late s on what was eventually released as Solaris Each version such as Solaris is based on a snapshot of this development codebase taken near the time of its release which is then maintained as a derived project Updates to that project are built and delivered several times a year until the next official release comes out br The Solaris version under development by Sun since the release of Solaris in was codenamed Nevada and is derived from what is now the OpenSolaris codebase br In an addition to the Solaris development process was initiated Under the program name Software Express for Solaris or just Solaris Express a binary release based on the current development basis was made available for download on a monthly basis allowing anyone to try out new features and test the quality and stability of the OS as it progressed to the release of the next official Solaris version A later change to this program introduced a quarterly release model with support available renamed Solaris Express Developer Edition SXDE br In Sun announced Project Indiana with several goals including providing an open source binary distribution of the OpenSolaris project replacing SXDE The first release of this distribution was OpenSolaris br br The Solaris Express Community Edition SXCE was intended specifically for OpenSolaris developers It was updated every two weeks until it was discontinued in January with a recommendation that users migrate to the OpenSolaris distribution Although the download license seen when downloading the image files indicates its use is limited to personal educational and evaluation purposes the license acceptance form displayed when the user actually installs from these images lists additional uses including commercial and production environments br SXCE releases terminated with build and OpenSolaris releases terminated with build a few weeks later The next release of OpenSolaris based on build was due in March but it was never fully released though the packages were made available on the package repository Instead Oracle renamed the binary distribution Solaris Express changed the license terms and released build a as in November br br br Open source derivatives br br br Current br br illumos A fully open source fork of the project started in by a community of Sun OpenSolaris engineers and Nexenta OS OpenSolaris was not open source Some drivers and some libraries were property of other companies that Sun now Oracle licensed and was not able to release br OpenIndiana A project under the illumos umbrella aiming to become the de facto OpenSolaris distribution installed on production servers where security and bug fixes are required free of charge br SchilliX The first LiveCD released after OpenSolaris code was opened to public br napp it A webmanaged ZFS storage appliance based on Solaris and the free forks like OmniOS with a Free and Pro edition br NexentaStor Optimized for storage workloads based on Nexenta OS br SmartOS Virtualization centered derivative from MNX Solutions previously Joyent br br br Discontinued br OpenSolaris A project initiated by Sun Microsystems discontinued after the acquisition by Oracle br Nexenta OS discontinued October First distribution based on Ubuntu userland with Solaris derived kernel br StormOS discontinued September A lightweight desktop OS based on Nexenta OS and Xfce br MartUX The first SPARC distribution of OpenSolaris with an alpha prototype released by Martin Bochnig in April It was distributed as a Live CD but is later available only on DVD as it has had the Blastwave community software added Its goal was to become a desktop operating system The first SPARC release was a small Live CD released as marTux Live CD in summer of the first straight OpenSolaris distribution for SPARC not to be confused with GNOME metacity theme It was later re branded as MartUX and the next releases included full SPARC installers in addition to the Live media Much later MartUX was re branded as OpenSXCE when it moved to the first OpenSolaris release to support both SPARC and Intel architectures after Sun was acquired by Oracle br MilaX A small Live CD Live USB with minimal set of packages to fit a MB image br Dyson illumos kernel with GNU userland and packages from Debian Project is no longer active and the website is offline br EON ZFS Storage A NAS implementation targeted at embedded systems br Jaris OS Live DVD and also installable Pronounced according to the IPA but in English as Yah Rees This distribution has been heavily modified to fully support a version of Wine called Madoris that can install and run Windows programs at native speed Jaris stands for Japanese Solaris Madoris is a combination of the Japanese word for Windows mado and Solaris br OpenSXCE An OpenSolaris distribution release for both bit and bit x platforms and SPARC microprocessors initially produced from OpenSolaris source code repository ported to the illumos source code repository to form OpenIndiana s first SPARC distribution Notably the first OpenSolaris distribution with illumos source for SPARC based upon OpenIndiana OpenSXCE finally moved to a new source code repository based upon DilOS br br br Reception br Robert Lipschutz and Gregg Harrington from PC Magazine reviewed Solaris in br All in all Sun has stayed the course with Solaris While its more user friendly management is welcome that probably won t be enough to win over converts What may is the platform s reliability flexibility and power br Robert Lipschutz also reviewed Solaris br Be that as it may since the Solaris download is free it behooves any IT manager to load it on an extra server and at least give it a try br Tom Henderson reviewed Solaris for Network World br Solaris provides a flexible background for securely dividing system resources providing performance guarantees and tracking usage for these containers Creating basic containers and populating them with user applications and resources is simple But some cases may require quite a bit of fine tuning br Robert Escue for OSNews br I think that Sun has put some really nice touches on Solaris that make it a better operating system for both administrators and users The security enhancements are a long time coming but are worth the wait Is Solaris perfect in a word no it is not But for most uses including a desktop OS I think Solaris is a huge improvement over previous releases br Thomas Greene for The Register br We ve had fun with Solaris It s got virtues that we definitely admire What it needs to compete with Linux will be easier to bring about than what it s already got It could become a Linux killer or at least a serious competitor on Linux s turf The only question is whether Sun has the will to see it through br br br See also
