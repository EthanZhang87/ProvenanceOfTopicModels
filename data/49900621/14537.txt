IRIX EYE ricks is a discontinued operating system developed by Silicon Graphics SGI to run on the company s proprietary MIPS workstations and servers It is based on UNIX System V with BSD extensions In IRIX SGI originated the XFS file system and the industry standard OpenGL graphics system br br br History br SGI originated the IRIX name in the release of the operating system for the SGI IRIS D series of workstations and servers Previous releases are identified only by the release number prefixed by D such as D The D prefix continued to be used in official documentation to prefix IRIX release numbers Prior to the IRIS D SGI bundled the GL operating system based on UniSoft UniPlus System V Unix and using the proprietary MEX Multiple EXposure windowing system br IRIX x is based on UNIX System V Release with BSD enhancements and incorporates the Sight windowing system based on NeWS and IRIS GL SGI s own Extent File System EFS replaces the System V filesystem br IRIX released in replaces Sight with the X Window System X R the Dwm window manager providing a similar look and feel to Sight br IRIX released in incorporates certain features of UNIX System V Release including ELF executables IRIX introduced the XFS journaling file system br In IRIX added support for the bit MIPS R processor but is otherwise similar to IRIX Later x releases support other members of the MIPS processor family in bit mode IRIX was released for the SGI O workstation only IRIX improved multiprocessor scalability for the Octane Origin and Onyx systems The Origin and Onyx IRIX was marketed as Cellular IRIX although it only incorporates some features from the original Cellular IRIX distributed operating system project br The last major version of IRIX is released in May New minor versions of IRIX were released every quarter until and then four minor releases Through version there are two branches of each release a maintenance release identified by an m suffix that includes only fixes to the original IRIX code and a feature release with an f suffix that includes improvements and enhancements An overlay upgrade from x to the maintenance release was available as a free download whereas versions and higher required an active Silicon Graphics support contract br A Computerworld review found IRIX in a critical state SGI had been moving its efforts to Linux and the Windows based SGI Visual Workstation but MIPS and IRIX customers convinced SGI to continue to support its platform through On September an SGI press release announced the end of the MIPS and IRIX product lines Production ended on December with final deliveries in March except by special arrangement Support for these products ended in December and they will receive no further updates br Much of IRIX s core technology has been open sourced and ported by SGI to Linux including XFS br In SGI filed for bankruptcy and then was purchased by Rackable Systems which was later purchased by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in All SGI hardware produced after is based on either IA or x architecture so it is incapable of running IRIX and is instead intended for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or SUSE Linux Enterprise Server HPE has not stated any plans for IRIX development or source code release br br br Features br IRIX is compliant with UNIX System V Release UNIX and POSIX including e c draft ACLs and Capabilities br In the early s IRIX was a leader in Symmetric Multi Processing SMP scalable from to more than processors with a single system image IRIX has strong support for real time disk and graphics I O IRIX was widely used for the s and s in the computer animation and scientific visualization industries due to its large application base and high performance It still is relevant in a few legacy applications br IRIX is one of the first Unix versions to feature a graphical user interface for the main desktop environment IRIX Interactive Desktop uses the Dwm X window manager with a custom look designed using the Motif widget toolkit IRIX is the originator of the industry standard OpenGL for graphics chips and image processing libraries br IRIX uses the MIPSPro compiler for both its front end and back end The compiler also known in earlier versions as IDO IRIS Development Option was released in many versions many of which are coupled to the OS version The last version was m designed for or later The compiler is designed to support parallel POSIX programming in C C Fortran and Ada The Workshop GUI IDE is used for development Other tools include Speedshop for performance tuning and Performance Co Pilot br br br Dwm br Dwm is the window manager component of the IRIX Interactive Desktop normally used on Silicon Graphics workstations running IRIX Dwm is derived from the older Motif Window Manager and uses the Motif widget toolkit on top of the X Window System found on most Unix systems Dwm on IRIX was one of the first default graphical user interface desktops to be standard on a Unix computer system Dwm refers to Fourth dimension window manager and has no relation to dwm br Other X window managers that mimic the Dwm look and feel exist such as Dwm theme for IceWM and Dwm which is a clone compatible implementation of Dwm based on OpenMotif Dwm support both the classic SGI look and a modern polished look and feel with anti aliased fonts and UTF support br br br Features br A stacking window manager br Uses the Motif widget library br Applications can be launched via a menu panel br Window decorations include borders and a titlebar br The titlebar provides a meta button and facilities to minimize and maximize windows br Support for themes br br br See also br IRIX software br Silicon Graphics Image format about iris br br br br br br External
