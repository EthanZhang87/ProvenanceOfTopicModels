A browser engine also known as a layout engine or rendering engine is a core software component of every major web browser The primary job of a browser engine is to transform HTML documents and other resources of a web page into an interactive visual representation on a user s device br br br Name and scope br Besides browser engine two other related terms are commonly used layout engine and rendering engine In theory layout and rendering or painting could be handled by different engines In practice however these components are tightly coupled and rarely encountered on their own outside of the browser engine br In addition to layout and rendering a browser engine enforces the security policy between documents handles navigation through hyperlinks and data submitted through forms and implements the Document Object Model DOM exposed to scripts associated with the document br Every major browser supports JavaScript to provide a wide range of dynamic behavior for web pages However JavaScript is implemented as a separate JavaScript engine which has enabled its usage elsewhere In a browser the two engines are coordinated via the DOM and Web IDL bindings br Browser engines are also used in non browser applications An email client needs one to display HTML email Beginning in the s many apps have been created with the frameworks based on Google s Chromium project each of these standalone apps functions much like a web app Two examples are Spotify and Slack br br br Layout and rendering br The layout of a web page is typically specified by Cascading Style Sheets CSS Each style sheet is a series of rules for how the page should be presented For example some rules specify typography details such as font color and text size while others determine the placement of images The engine combines all relevant CSS rules to calculate precise graphical coordinates for the visual representation it will paint on the screen br Some engines may begin rendering before a page s resources are downloaded This can result in visual changes as more data is received such as images being gradually filled in or a flash of unstyled content br br br Notable engines br br Apple created the WebKit engine for its Safari browser by forking the KHTML engine of the KDE project All browsers for iOS must use WebKit as their engine br Google originally used WebKit for its Chrome browser but eventually forked it to create the Blink engine All Chromium based browsers use Blink as do applications built with CEF Electron or any other framework that embeds Chromium br Microsoft has two proprietary engines Trident and EdgeHTML Trident also called MSHTML is used in the Internet Explorer browser EdgeHTML being a fork of Trident was the original engine of the Edge browser now called Edge Legacy it s still found in some UWP apps The new Chromium based Edge was remade with the Blink engine br Mozilla develops the Gecko engine for its Firefox browser and the Thunderbird email client br br br Timeline br Only the duration of active development is shown which is when relevant new Web standards continue to be added to the engine br br br See also br Comparison of browser engines br br br
