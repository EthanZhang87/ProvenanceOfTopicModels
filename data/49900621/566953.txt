UnixWare is a Unix operating system It was originally released by Univel a jointly owned venture of AT T s Unix System Laboratories USL and Novell It was then taken over by Novell Via Santa Cruz Operation SCO it went on to Caldera Systems Caldera International and The SCO Group before it was sold to UnXis now Xinuos UnixWare is typically deployed as a server rather than a desktop Binary distributions of UnixWare are available for x architecture computers UnixWare is primarily marketed as a server operating system br br br History br br br Univel br After the SVR effort to merge SunOS and System V AT T s Unix System Laboratories USL formed the Univel partnership with Novell to develop a desktop version of Unix for i and i machines codenamed Destiny br Destiny is based on the Unix System V release kernel The MoOLIT toolkit is used for the windowing system allowing the user to choose between an OPEN LOOK or MOTIF like look and feel at runtime In order to make the system more robust on commodity desktop hardware the Veritas VXFS journaling file system is used in place of the UFS file system used in SVR Networking support in UnixWare includes both TCP IP and interoperability with Novell s NetWare protocols IPX SPX the former were the standard among Unix users at the time of development while PC networking was much more commonly based on NetWare br Destiny was released in as UnixWare with the intention of unifying the fragmented PC Unix market behind this single variant of the operating system The system was earlier to reach the corporate computing market than Microsoft s Windows NT but observers of the period remarked that UnixWare was just another flavor of Unix Novell s involvement being more a marketing ploy than a significant influx of technology There two editions of Destiny a Personal Edition which includes Novell IPX networking but not TCP IP and an Advanced Server Edition with TCP IP and other server software The personal edition is limited to two active users while the server edition includes an unlimited user license Around copies of UnixWare were sold br In UnixWare Personal Edition came with DOS Merge and Novell s DR DOS br In Novell purchased USL from AT T and merged USL and Univel into a new Unix Systems Group br br br Novell br br In Novell released UnixWare which includes TCP IP in both the personal and advanced server editions br The MOTIF runtime libraries are included for COSE compliance NUC NetWare Unix Client software is included for integration with Novell NetWare servers The Advanced Merge application is installed on both the server and personal editions to allow running DOS and Windows applications br Novell later released bug fix versions and finally on June br UnixWare based on the Unix System V release MP kernel which added support for multiprocessing began shipping to OEMs and developers in December and to the consumer market in March Both the personal and server editions support two processor systems with the possibility of buying extra Processor Upgrade licenses for the server edition Supported multiprocessor systems include standard Intel MP SMP machines and Corollary C bus systems The system supports NetWare ODI network drivers in an effort to increase the number of supported network interfaces Other new features in the release include a POSIX Threads library in addition to the older UI threads library br Before SCO licensed UnixWare in Novell had also announced a project to create a SuperNOS based on NetWare and UnixWare technologies in the future This never materialized Instead a NetWare server on Linux was offered as Caldera NetWare for Linux for OpenLinux since and Novell s Open Enterprise Server finally came in br br br Santa Cruz Operation br br In the Santa Cruz Operation SCO acquired UnixWare from Novell The exact terms of this transaction were disputed see SCO vs Novell courts have subsequently determined that Novell retained the ownership of Unix br When the transfer was made public SCO announced that it would work towards merging UnixWare with its OpenServer SVR based OS but the first release of UnixWare from SCO was version in At the release of UnixWare it was announced that the proposed UnixWare OpenServer merger was known as project Gemini to be available in and a bit version of UnixWare was to be developed for br One controversial change was the adoption of an OpenServer like user licensing policy The Univel and Novell releases of UnixWare allow users on the personal edition or unlimited numbers of users on the server edition With UnixWare the server edition includes a license for up to users Customers wanting more users could purchase or unlimited user license extensions br SCO released three updates to UnixWare UnixWare released in achieved Unix branding UnixWare and available in are largely bug fix releases br In Compaq released a package known as the Integrity XC consisting of a single system image cluster of Proliant servers with a version of UnixWare UnixWare NonStop Clusters br The first results of the Gemini project were made available in early as UnixWare SCO named the kernel version Unix System V release The system is largely based on UnixWare with features for driver compatibility with OpenServer allowing use of OpenServer network drivers System administration utilities from OpenServer scoadmin replace the original UnixWare sysadm utility Major new features of UnixWare include multi path I O large files and file systems and support for large memory systems br UnixWare lacks the Xenix compatibility features of both its ancestors br In SCO released the UnixWare update which increased the number of editions the Business user Department user and Enterprise user editions replace the earlier personal and server editions The WebTop application from Tarantella Inc is included br In SCO released the UnixWare update Simultaneously the UnixWare NonStop Clusters IP single system image cluster package was released This new package allows commodity hardware to be used as well as the proprietary Compaq hardware supported by the earlier Integrity XC product and was directly available from SCO br br br Caldera Systems Caldera International and The SCO Group br br On August Santa Cruz Operation SCO announced that it would sell its Server Software and Services Divisions as well as rights to the OpenServer and UnixWare products to Caldera Systems In March Caldera Systems became Caldera International CII and the SCO purchase was completed in May The remaining part of the Santa Cruz Operation company the Tarantella Division changed its name to Tarantella Inc br Caldera International s initial release of UnixWare was renamed OpenUNIX This release is what would have been UnixWare br Caldera International renamed itself to The SCO Group in August after broadening its product line to include mobile products and services br Later the newly renamed The SCO Group reverted to the previous UnixWare brand and version release numbering releasing UnixWare and No further OpenUNIX releases were made available and OpenUNIX OU was never released The SCO Group continued to maintain UnixWare and issues periodic maintenance updates and support br Between and The SCO Group engaged in a series of legal battles In September The SCO Group filed for Chapter bankruptcy protection br On April UnXis bought The SCO Group operating assets and intellectual property rights after having been approved by the bankruptcy court in Delaware br The SCO Group Inc then renamed itself TSG Group Inc and SCO Operations Inc became TSG Operations Inc and in August filed to convert from Chapter to Chapter br br br UnXis and Xinuos present br The rights to Unixware as well as OpenServer were acquired by UnXis in br In June UnXis was renamed as Xinuos and announced product and availability for SCO UnixWare now supporting both physical and virtual machines br br br Version history br br br SCO Skunkware and open source br All versions of UnixWare have included significant open source components including BIND X Sendmail DHCP Perl Tcl and others Later releases are bundled with numerous additional open source applications including Apache Samba MySQL PostgreSQL OpenSSH and Mozilla software br All versions of SCO operating system distributions including UnixWare also have an extensive set of open source packages available for free download via the SCO Skunkware site br br br See also br Portable NetWare br Caldera OpenLinux br Lineo Embedix br SUSE
