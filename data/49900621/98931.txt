The AIM alliance also known as the PowerPC alliance was formed on October between Apple IBM and Motorola Its goal was to create an industry wide open standard computing platform based on the POWER instruction set architecture It was intended to solve legacy problems future proof the industry and compete with Microsoft s monopoly and the Wintel duopoly The alliance yielded the launch of Taligent Kaleida Labs the PowerPC CPU family the Common Hardware Reference Platform CHRP hardware platform standard and Apple s Power Macintosh computer line br br br History br br br Development br Microsoft s worst nightmare is a conjoined Apple and IBM No other single change in the dynamics of the IT industry could possibly do as much to emasculate Windows br From the s into the s the computer industry was moving from a model of just individual personal computers toward an interconnected world where no single company could afford to be vertically isolated anymore Infinite Loop says most people at Apple knew the company would have to enter into ventures with some of its erstwhile enemies license its technology or get bought Furthermore Microsoft s monopoly and the Wintel duopoly threatened competition industrywide and the Advanced Computing Environment ACE consortium was underway br Phil Hester a designer of the IBM RS convinced IBM s president Jack Kuehler of the necessity of a business alliance Kuehler called Apple President Michael Spindler who bought into the approach for a design that could challenge the Wintel based PC Apple CEO John Sculley was even more enthusiastic br On July Apple and IBM signed a non contractual letter of intent proposing an alliance and outlining its long term strategic technology goals Its main goal was creating a single unifying open standard computing platform for the whole industry made of a new hardware design and a next generation operating system IBM intended to bring the Macintosh operating system into the enterprise and Apple intended to become a prime customer for the new POWER hardware platform Considering it to be critically poorly communicated and confusing to the outside world at this point industry commentators nonetheless saw this partnership as an overall competitive force against Microsoft s monopoly and Intel s and Microsoft s duopoly IBM and Motorola would have engineers to codevelop chips at a joint manufacturing facility in Austin Texas Motorola would sell the chips to Apple or anyone else br br Executives said the negotiations were stop and go sometimes seeming to founder and then speeding up as impasses were resolved The main disagreements occurred when one company or the other thought it was giving away too much technology Executives said that the technological contributions of both sides were evaluated and that money was used to balance the terms in what negotiators referred to as the cosmic arithmetic But how much money is being paid and which company is paying is closely guarded information br Between the three companies more than people had been involved to define a more unified corporate culture with less top down executive decree They collaborated as peers and future coworkers in creating the alliance and the basis of its ongoing future dialog which promised to change the landscape of computing in the s br br br Launch br In the earth shook IBM and Apple clasped hands and pronounced themselves allies From this union sprang Taligent developing nothing less than a universal operating system br On October the historic AIM alliance was officially formed with a contract between Apple CEO John Sculley IBM Research and Development Chief Jack Kuehler and IBM Vice President James Cannavino Kuehler said Together we announce the second decade of personal computing and it begins today and Sculley said this would launch a renaissance in technological innovation as they signed the foot high stack of papers comprising the contract The New York Times called it an act that a year ago almost no one in the computer world would have imagined possible It was so sweeping that it underwent antitrust review by the United States federal government br In Apple and IBM created two new companies called Taligent and Kaleida Labs as had been declared in the alliance contract with the expectation that neither would launch any products until the mid s Since Apple had already created a next generation operating system codenamed Pink and Taligent Inc was incorporated to bring Pink to market as the ultimate crossplatform object oriented OS and application frameworks Kaleida was to create an object oriented cross platform multimedia scripting language which would enable developers to create entirely new kinds of applications that would harness the power of the platform IBM provided affinity between its own Workplace OS and Taligent replacing Taligent s microkernel with the IBM Microkernel and adopting Taligent s CommonPoint application framework into Workplace OS OS and AIX br br It s natural that many people saw Apple s alliance with former adversary IBM Corp as an ominous portent for the independent future of the Macintosh The sight of Apple and IBM chief executives gripping and grinning on national television wasn t nearly as confusing as their vow to bring the Mac and IBM desktop computers into the st century with shared technology such as PowerPC chips PowerOpen Unix and new operating software from Taligent Inc and Kaleida Labs Inc Present and future shock aside that s a lot to digest br CISC microprocessors including the mainstream Intel x products were considered an evolutionary dead end and that because RISC was the future the next few years were a period of great opportunity br The alliance s hardware is based on the PowerPC processors the first of which the PowerPC is a single chip version of IBM s POWER CPU Both IBM and Motorola would manufacture PowerPC integrated circuits for this new platform The computer architecture base is called PReP PowerPC Reference Platform later complemented with OpenFirmware and renamed CHRP Common Hardware Reference Platform IBM used PReP and CHRP for the PCI version of IBM s RS platform which was adapted from existing Micro Channel architecture models and changed only to support the new x bus style of the PowerPC br br The development of the PowerPC is centered at an Austin Texas facility called the Somerset Design Center The building is named after the site in Arthurian legend where warring forces put aside their swords and members of the three teams that staff the building say the spirit that inspired the name has been a key factor in the project s success thus far br Part of the culture here is not to have an IBM or Motorola or Apple culture but to have our own br In Apple delivered its first alliance based hardware platform the PowerPC based Power Macintosh line on schedule as predicted by the original alliance contract Infinite Loop considered the PowerPC to be five years too late to the overall market no more than a welcome offering to Apple s own market base and further hamstrung by the legacy architecture of System br br br Downturn br In IT journalist Don Tennant asked Bill Gates to reflect upon what trend or development over the past years had really caught him by surprise Gates responded with what Tennant described as biting deadpan sarcasm Kaleida and Taligent had less impact than we expected Tennant believed the explanation to be that Microsoft s worst nightmare is a conjoined Apple and IBM No other single change in the dynamics of the IT industry could possibly do as much to emasculate Windows br Efforts by Motorola and IBM to popularize PReP and CHRP failed when Apple IBM and Taligent all failed to provide a single comprehensive reference operating system for server and personal markets mainly Taligent s OS or IBM s Workplace OS Windows NT was the only OS with mainstream consumer recognition that had been ported to PowerPC but there was virtually no market demand for it on this non mainstream hardware Although PowerPC was eventually supported by several Unix variants Windows NT and Workplace OS in the form of OS these operating systems generally ran just as well on commodity Intel based hardware so there was little reason to use the PReP systems The BeBox designed to run BeOS uses some PReP hardware but is overall incompatible with the standard Kaleida Labs closed in Taligent was absorbed into IBM in Some CHRP machines shipped in and without widespread reception br br Relations between Apple and Motorola further deteriorated in with the return of Steve Jobs to Apple and his contentious termination of Power Macintosh clone licensing Reportedly a heated telephone conversation between Jobs and Motorola CEO Christopher Galvin resulted in the long favored Apple being demoted to just another customer mainly for PowerPC CPUs In retaliation Apple and IBM briefly expelled Motorola from the AIM alliance and forced Motorola to stop making PowerPC CPUs leaving IBM to design and produce all future PowerPC chips Motorola was reinstated into the alliance in br br br Legacy br The PowerPC is the clearest intended success that came out of the AIM alliance From to Apple used PowerPC chips in almost every Macintosh PowerPC also has had success in the embedded market and in video game consoles GameCube Wii Wii U Xbox and PlayStation br After being reinstated into the AIM alliance Motorola helped IBM to design some laptop PowerPC chips with IBM s manufacturing In Motorola spun off its Semiconductor production as Freescale Semiconductor and left the AIM alliance completely leaving IBM and Apple in the alliance Freescale continued to help IBM design PowerPC chips until Freescale was acquired and absorbed by NXP Semiconductors in br Apple transitioned entirely to Intel CPUs in due to eventual disappointment with the direction and performance of PowerPC development as of the G model especially in the fast growing laptop market This was seen as the end of the AIM alliance as that left IBM as the sole user of PowerPC br Taligent was launched from the original AIM alliance based originally on Apple s Pink operating system From Taligent came the CommonPoint application framework and many global contributions to internationalization and compilers in the form of Java Development Kit VisualAge C and the International Components for Unicode open source project br Power org was founded in by IBM and fifteen partners with intent to develop enable and promote Power Architecture technology such as PowerPC POWER and software applications br The OpenPOWER Foundation is a collaboration around Power ISA based products initiated by IBM and announced as the OpenPOWER Consortium on August It has more than members In IBM announced its open sourcing of the Power ISA br br br See also br Advanced Computing Environment br Advanced RISC Computing br br br br br Charles
