The term Research Unix refers to early versions of the Unix operating system for DEC PDP PDP VAX and Interdata and computers developed in the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center CSRC br br br History br br The term Research Unix first appeared in the Bell System Technical Journal Vol No Part July August to distinguish it from other versions internal to Bell Labs such as PWB UNIX and MERT whose code base had diverged from the primary CSRC version However that term was little used until Version Unix but has been retroactively applied to earlier versions as well Prior to V the operating system was most commonly called simply UNIX in caps or the UNIX Time Sharing System br AT T licensed Version to educational institutions and Version also to commercial sites Schools paid and others discouraging most commercial use but Version was the most widely used version into the s Research Unix versions are often referred to by the edition of the manual that describes them because early versions and the last few were never officially released outside of Bell Labs and grew organically So the first Research Unix would be the First Edition and the last the Tenth Edition Another common way of referring to them is as Version x Unix or Vx Unix where x is the manual edition All modern editions of Unix excepting Unix like implementations such as Coherent Minix and Linux derive from the th Edition br Starting with the th Edition versions of Research Unix had a close relationship to BSD This began by using cBSD as the basis for the th Edition In a Usenet post from Dennis Ritchie described these later versions of Research Unix as being closer to BSD than they were to UNIX System V which also included some BSD code br br Research Unix th Edition started from I think BSD c but with enormous amounts scooped out and replaced by our own stuff This continued with th and th The ordinary user command set was I guess a bit more BSD flavored than SysVish but it was pretty eclectic br br br Versions br br br Legacy br In Caldera International released Unix V V V V V V V on PDP and Unix V on VAX as FOSS under a permissive BSD like software license br In Unix Heritage Society and Alcatel Lucent USA Inc on behalf of itself and Nokia Bell Laboratories released V V and V under the condition that only non commercial use was allowed and that they would not assert copyright claims against such use br br br See also br Ancient UNIX br History of Unix br Inferno Another operating system from the same team br Lions Commentary on UNIX th Edition with Source Code br PWB UNIX A version of Unix for internal use at Bell Labs for production use br br br br br br External links br br UNIX Evolution PostScript by Ian F Darwin and Geoffrey Collyer br Unix heritage More links and source code for some Research Unix versions br The Evolution of the Unix Time sharing System by Dennis M Ritchie br The Restoration of Early UNIX Artifacts by Warren Toomey School of IT Bond University br Full Manual Pages documentation for Research Unix th Edition br List of new features in Research Unix th Edition br Emulator for running UNIX v
