BlackBerry BB was a proprietary mobile operating system for the BlackBerry line of smartphones both developed by BlackBerry Limited formerly known as Research In Motion Released in January BlackBerry is a complete rework from the company s previous BlackBerry OS software br It is based on QNX a Unix like operating system that was originally developed by QNX Software Systems until the company was acquired by Research In Motion in BlackBerry supports the application framework Qt version and in some later models features an Android runtime to run Android applications Prior to version BlackBerry also supported the Adobe AIR runtime The user interface uses a combination of gestures and touch based interactions for navigation and control making it possible to control a device without having to press any physical buttons with the exception of the power button that switches the device on or off It also supports hardware keyboards including ones that support touch input br On October BlackBerry Limited announced that there were no plans to release new APIs and software development kits SDKs or adopt Qt version Future updates like versions and would focus on security and privacy enhancements only effectively putting the operating system in maintenance mode At the same time the company introduced its first Android based device BlackBerry Priv The BlackBerry Leap was the last smartphone released on the BB platform After BlackBerry Limited ceased making smartphones in its successor BlackBerry Mobile by licensee TCL abandoned the platform and only developed devices based on Android starting with the BlackBerry KeyOne br On December BlackBerry Limited announced that there would be at least another two years of support for BlackBerry and BlackBerry OS devices in August however BlackBerry stated in a press release that they would continue to support critical infrastructure for BlackBerry beyond the end of the year BlackBerry became end of life effective January br br br History br The operating system was originally called BBX but this was changed when BlackBerry was blocked from using the BBX trademark after legal action from BASIS International who already used it for their software br On November CEO Thorsten Heins announced a January launch of the BlackBerry operating system version and the first smartphones running it The operating system as well as two devices the Z a full touchscreen device and the Q a device equipped with a physical keyboard were announced simultaneously around the world on January The company also announced that the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet would receive an update to BlackBerry later in Subsequently BlackBerry stated when releasing their Q financial results that the BlackBerry PlayBook would not be receiving an update to BlackBerry citing that the hardware would not provide a good experience of BlackBerry and were focusing on future devices BlackBerry continued to support and develop the PlayBook with its separate Tablet OS br On May BlackBerry OS was launched This brought improvements to many features requested by users br On September in Asia BlackBerry announced the launch of BlackBerry OS and a new BlackBerry device the Z providing performance increases over the previous BlackBerry devices br On June BlackBerry announced an official relationship with Amazon com which resulted in the update bundling the Amazon Appstore br On December BlackBerry CEO John S Chen announced that there would be at least two years of support for BlackBerry and BlackBerry OS devices At that time the operating system was expected to be end of life at the end of with many built in software packages having their support ended such as Facebook Dropbox Evernote LinkedIn etc br BlackBerry Limited have announced that the operating system BlackBerry OS and earlier BlackBerry software and BlackBerry PlayBook will become end of life effectively starting from January After this period some of the applications and services such as data phone calls SMS and functionality built into it may not function properly br br br Features br br br Controls br The touchscreen is the predominant input method of BlackBerry in addition to hardware keyboard for devices that have one Users can use gestures and keyboard shortcuts to navigate around the system For instance a user can unlock the device or return to the home screen by swiping from the bottom to the top Some gestures offer additional modes of interaction when they are used differently For instance the same gesture can be used to show unread notifications when the user swipes from the bottom edge to somewhat the middle and slightly to the right and also keep the finger on the touchscreen Similarly when the finger is moved from the bottom to the right in a curved motion the user can enter BlackBerry Hub immediately Devices with a hardware keyboard can use keyboard shortcuts to reach applications or perform specific functions more quickly br br br Multitasking br When a user returns to the home screen from within an application the application is minimized into a so called Active Frame An Active Frame is a miniaturized window of the application that keeps running in the background A user can return to such an application by tapping on the Active Frame or close it by tapping on the X icon Active Frames can have widget like functionality and show small bits of information similar to widgets on Android For instance the calendar application can show upcoming events and meetings BlackBerry limits the number of active applications and it varies per device br br br BlackBerry Hub br BlackBerry collates emails SMS MMS calls and notifications into the BlackBerry Hub It shows all messages and notifications in a continuous list sorted by date The user can filter results by application or in the case of email also by inbox The user can create view or act upon messages or notifications directly from the Hub For instance when the user opens a Facebook message the Hub will open a small part of the Facebook application and allow the user to perform the same actions as the Facebook application itself Applications need to support the Hub specifically to use most of these features which is only possible for applications written with the native SDK Notifications from unsupported applications are collated in the generic notifications tab br br br Miscellaneous br Other notable features of BlackBerry include br br A virtual keyboard with support for predictive typing and several gestures br Voice control and BlackBerry Assistant and later a virtual assistant with which the user can perform various tasks by voice input or typed queries br BlackBerry Balance with which the user can separate personal from work data if enabled by the device s enterprise server The user can switch between two workspaces each with their own applications files and accounts br BlackBerry Link with which the user can synchronize data between the device and a computer update the device or make backups It supports iTunes and Windows Media Player br br br Applications br br br Preloaded br BlackBerry has a number of applications that help users perform various tasks and activities These include a web browser as well applications for notes reminders calculator clock music media weather and file management Cloud services like Box and Dropbox are also integrated by default In addition BlackBerry s messaging service BlackBerry Messenger is included which supports video chat VoIP and screen sharing br br br Third party applications br BlackBerry can run applications that were written with its native SDK Android applications compiled for API levels support varies per version and applications written for Adobe AIR only supported until version BlackBerry provides the distribution platform BlackBerry World Since version Android application packages can be installed directly whereas on previous versions Android applications could only be installed through BlackBerry World or by sideloading which required packaging such applications into a native package format BAR On version BlackBerry Limited partnered with Amazon to bundle Amazon Appstore as another source of Android apps br At release in January BlackBerry had third party applications At the BlackBerry Live conference BlackBerry announced that they had more than applications br Some developers have offered applications to access the Google Play Store although this is not sanctioned by BlackBerry or Google Applications that depend on the Google Play Services framework may not run Similarly Android applications that require a newer API level than cannot run on BlackBerry br br br Devices br br br Released Devices br br BlackBerry supports the following BlackBerry smartphones all of which can run the latest version The BlackBerry Leap is the last smartphone from BlackBerry to run the BlackBerry operating system as BlackBerry devices are now running Android instead br br br Canceled devices br BlackBerry Colt originally planned as the first QNX powered BlackBerry smartphone br BlackBerry Caf a all touch model intended for emerging markets br BlackBerry Kopi a QWERTY model intended for emerging markets br br br Developer activities br br br Engagement strategy br Building up to the launch the company made substantial changes to how it had previously engaged developers being substantially more active at courting developers solving issues and being transparent about development updates The company sent two teams to engage developers The first focused on acquiring premier applications from third parties The second team focused on engaging the broader development community and building the platforms application count br br br Prototype smartphones br In May the company released a prototype touch screen smartphone to BlackBerry developers as part of the BlackBerry Jam Conference in Orlando Florida The Dev Alpha A device which resembled a small BlackBerry PlayBook ran an early version of the operating system and was provided as a means for developers to develop and test their applications on a physical device br In September a second developer prototype was released in September known as the Dev Alpha B It includes a faster processor and a number of internal improvements br A third developer device the Dev Alpha C was announced on November and is the first developer prototype to demonstrate the physical keyboard capabilities of BlackBerry Acquisition of a Dev Alpha C device is based around a point system meaning that developers who have previously developed apps for BlackBerry or have had the Dev Alpha A B devices will have a higher chance of receiving a device than a new BlackBerry developer It was released at the BlackBerry Jam Europe event in February br br br Portathons br Pre launch Portathons held by BlackBerry have received up to applications submitted per weekend br br br Reception br Reviews of BlackBerry have been mixed David Pogue of The New York Times noted that the software was simple to master elegantly designed and surprisingly complete It offers features nobody else offers some tailored to the corporate world that raised BlackBerry aloft in its glory days Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal referred to the operating system as logical and generally easy to use Mossberg praised the virtual keyboard camera software and messaging hub but criticized its application ecosystem cloud capabilities and the immaturity of some features Gizmodo s Kyle Wagner states that BlackBerry s home screen gives BB the single best implementation of multitasking of any mobile OS right now Wagner goes on to say that the Hub works out to function a bit more like a junk drawer He also reports what he refers to as the Tragic Flaw Unlike every other major OS right now BlackBerry does not feel fully integrated br In comparison to that at launch CrackBerry com views the new features more positively and takes into account the fact that the OS is brand new It says that the BlackBerry Hub is a polished solution to efficiently managing the influx of messages we have coming at us It goes on to mention minor discrepancies and finally pointing out that many of the problems are getting fixed in future updates some now released e g battery life improvements call ringtone disabled in bedside mode It criticizes the limited customization options compared to BlackBerry OS Alert tone volumes alert light colour Regarding the apps in BlackBerry World really impressed by the quality of apps BlackBerry World has to offer it notes that the application ecosystem is not as large as Android and iOS because of its age brand new and finishes with doubtlessly many more will come around once they see the Z getting traction in the wild Its general summary of BlackBerry with thought for its predecessor is that BlackBerry really is the best of the old and the best of the new assembled seamlessly into an elegant practical and integrated package br BlackBerry added a compatibility layer for Android software which allowed developers to repackage their Android apps for distribution on BlackBerry World This advertised feature has received a poor reception as the Android apps performed abysmally on the phone Sluggish ugly and disconnected from the core OS In fact because these apps are being run in a software emulation of Android Gingerbread no less that s version they bear little to no relationship to the rest of the operating system Later versions added the ability for users to manually install Android app packages Beginning with the BlackBerry Passport Amazon Appstore was bundled with BlackBerry to provide an additional source of third party Android software BlackBerry CEO John S Chen hoped that Amazon s own smartphone the Fire Phone would bolster the adoption of the Amazon store and attract more major developers to it and in turn BlackBerry s ecosystem The Fire Phone was a commercial failure however which led to BlackBerry s decision to develop an Android phone of its own resulting in the BlackBerry Priv br br br Version history br br br
