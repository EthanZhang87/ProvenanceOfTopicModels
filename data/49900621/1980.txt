id: 1980
Amiga is a family of personal computers introduced by Commodore in The original model is one of a number of mid s computers with or bit processors KB or more of RAM mouse based GUIs and significantly improved graphics and audio compared to previous bit systems These systems include the Atari ST released earlier the same year as well as the Macintosh and Acorn Archimedes Based on the Motorola microprocessor the Amiga differs from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound including sprites and a blitter and a pre emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS br The Amiga was released in July but production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early The best selling model the Amiga was introduced in along with the more expandable Amiga The Amiga was introduced in followed by the Amiga Plus and Amiga in March Finally the Amiga and Amiga were released in late The Amiga line sold an estimated million units br Although early advertisements cast the computer as an all purpose business machine especially when outfitted with the Sidecar IBM PC compatibility add on the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer with a wide range of games and creative software It also found a niche in video production with the Video Toaster hardware and software and Amiga s audio hardware made it a popular platform for music tracker software The processor and memory capacity enabled D rendering packages including LightWave D Imagine and Traces a predecessor to Blender br Poor marketing and the failure of later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems resulted in Commodore quickly losing market share to the rapidly dropping prices of IBM PC compatibles which gained color graphics in as well as the fourth generation of video game consoles br Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April after a version of the Amiga packaged as a game console the Amiga CD failed in the marketplace Since the demise of Commodore various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line including Genesi Eyetech ACube Systems Srl and A EON Technology AmigaOS has influenced replacements clones and compatible systems such as MorphOS and AROS Currently Belgian company Hyperion Entertainment maintains and develops AmigaOS which is an official and direct descendant of AmigaOS the last system made by Commodore for the original Amiga Computers br br br History br br br Concept and early development br Jay Miner joined Atari Inc in the s to develop custom integrated circuits and led development of the Atari Video Computer System s TIA When complete the team began developing a much more sophisticated set of chips CTIA ANTIC and POKEY that formed the basis of the Atari bit computers br With the bit line s launch in the team once again started looking at a next generation chipset Nolan Bushnell had sold the company to Warner Communications in and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales Miner wanted to start work with the new Motorola but management was only interested in another based system Miner left the company and for a time the industry br In Larry Kaplan left Atari and founded Activision In Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company Hi Toro The system was code named Lorraine in keeping with Miner s policy of giving systems female names in this case the company president s wife Lorraine Morse When Kaplan left the company late in Miner was promoted to head engineer and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation br br The Amiga hardware was designed by Miner RJ Mical and Dale Luck A breadboard prototype for testing and development was largely completed by late and shown at the January Consumer Electronics Show CES At the time the operating system was not ready so the machine was demonstrated with the Boing Ball demo a real time animation showing a red and white spinning ball bouncing and casting a shadow this bouncing ball later became the official logo of Escom subsidiary Amiga Technologies CES attendees had trouble believing the computer being demonstrated had the power to display such a demo and searched in vain for the real computer behind it br A further developed version of the system was demonstrated at the June CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the video game crash of br In March Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the XLD The talks were progressing slowly and Amiga was running out of money A temporary arrangement in June led to a loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going The terms required the loan to be repaid at the end of the month otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari br br br Commodore br During Atari lost over million a week due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market By the end of the year Warner was desperate to sell the company In January Jack Tramiel resigned from Commodore due to internal battles over the future direction of the company A number of Commodore employees followed him to his new company Tramel Technology This included a number of the senior technical staff where they began development of a based machine of their own In June Tramiel arranged a no cash deal to take over Atari reforming Tramel Technology as Atari Corporation br As many Commodore technical staff had moved to Atari Commodore was left with no workable path to design their own next generation computer The company approached Amiga offering to fund development as a home computer system They quickly arranged to repay the Atari loan ending that threat The two companies were initially arranging a million license agreement before Commodore offered million to purchase Amiga outright br By late the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits and the system hardware was being readied for production At this time the operating system OS was not as ready and led to a deal to port an OS known as TRIPOS to the platform TRIPOS was a multitasking system that had been written in BCPL during the s for the PDP minicomputer but later experimentally ported to the This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the C language and the entire system became AmigaOS br The system was enclosed in a pizza box form factor case a late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a garage under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored br br br Launch br The first model was announced in as simply The Amiga from Commodore later to be retroactively dubbed the Amiga They were first offered for sale in August but by October only had been built all of which were used by Commodore Machines only began to arrive in quantity in mid November meaning they missed the Christmas buying rush By the end of the year they had sold machines and severe cashflow problems made the company pull out of the January CES Bad or entirely missing marketing forcing the development team to move to the east coast notorious stability problems and other blunders limited sales in early to between and units a month units were reported as having been sold from the machine s launch up to the end of br br br Later models br In late Thomas Rattigan was promoted to COO of Commodore and then to CEO in February He immediately implemented an ambitious plan that covered almost all of the company s operations Among these was the long overdue cancellation of the now outdated PET and VIC lines as well as a variety of poorly selling Commodore offshoots and the Commodore workstation effort br Another one of the changes was to split the Amiga into two products a new high end version of the Amiga aimed at the creative market and a cost reduced version that would take over for the Commodore in the low end market These new designs were released in as the Amiga and Amiga the latter of which went on to widespread success and became their best selling model br Similar high end low end models would make up the Amiga line for the rest of its history follow on designs included the Amiga Amiga Plus Amiga and the Amiga Amiga These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the ECS and AGA which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications br The Amiga line sold an estimated machines over its lifetime The machines were most popular in the UK and Germany with about million sold in each country and sales in the high hundreds of thousands in other European nations The machine was less popular in North America where an estimated were sold In the United States the Amiga found a niche with enthusiasts and in vertical markets for video processing and editing In Europe it was more broadly popular as a home computer and often used for video games Beginning in it overlapped with the bit Mega Drive then the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the early s Commodore UK s Kelly Sumner did not see Sega or Nintendo as competitors but instead credited their marketing campaigns which spent over million or equivalent to in for promoting video games as a whole and thus helping to boost Amiga sales br br br Bankruptcy br In spite of his successes in making the company profitable and bringing the Amiga line to market Rattigan was soon forced out in a power struggle with majority shareholder Irving Gould This is widely regarded as the turning point as further improvements to the Amiga were eroded by rapid improvements in other platforms br Commodore shut down the Amiga division on April and filed for bankruptcy three days later Commodore s assets were purchased by Escom a German PC manufacturer who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies They re released the A and A T and introduced a new version of the A T In it was reported that Escom had sold the Amiga intellectual property to VIScorp for m equivalent to in Amiga Technologies researched and developed the Amiga Walker prototype They presented the machine publicly at CeBit but this deal fell through and Escom in turn went bankrupt in br A U S Wintel PC manufacturer Gateway then purchased the Amiga branch and technology In Gateway sold the Amiga brand to Amiga Inc without having released any products Amiga Inc licensed the rights to sell hardware using the AmigaOne brand to Eyetech Group and Hyperion Entertainment In Amiga Inc sold its intellectual property to Amiga Corporation br br br Hardware br br The Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several coprocessors which handle audio video and direct memory access independently of the Central Processing Unit CPU This architecture gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors particularly for graphics intensive applications and games br The architecture uses two distinct bus subsystems the chipset bus and the CPU bus The chipset bus allows the coprocessors and CPU to address Chip RAM The CPU bus provides addressing to conventional RAM ROM and the Zorro II or Zorro III expansion subsystems This enables independent operation of the subsystems The CPU bus can be much faster than the chipset bus CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses Additionally busboards or bridgeboards may provide ISA or PCI buses br br br Central processing unit br The most popular models from Commodore including the Amiga Amiga and Amiga use the Motorola as the CPU From a developer s point of view the provides a full suite of bit operations but the chip can address only MB of physical memory and is implemented using a bit arithmetic logic unit and has a bit external data bus so bit computations are transparently handled as multiple bit values at a performance cost The later Amiga and the Amiga models use fully bit compatible processors from Motorola improved performance and larger addressing capability br CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third party manufacturers Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards Such boards often included faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and hard disk controllers br Towards the end of Commodore s time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the series to higher performance RISC processors such as the PA RISC Those ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy Despite this third party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native microkernel and software Later Amiga clones featured PowerPC processors only br br br Custom chipset br The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations with a large degree of backward compatibility The Original Chip Set OCS appeared with the launch of the A in OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved Enhanced Chip Set ECS in and finally by the partly bit Advanced Graphics Architecture AGA in Each chipset consists of several coprocessors that handle graphics acceleration digital audio direct memory access and communication between various peripherals e g CPU memory and floppy disks In addition some models featured auxiliary custom chips that performed tasks such as SCSI control and display de interlacing br br br Graphics br br All Amiga systems can display full screen animated planar graphics with EHB Mode or colors HAM Mode Models with the AGA chipset A and A also have non EHB and HAM Mode color modes and a palette expanded from to million colors br The Amiga chipset can genlock which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal When combined with setting transparency this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications and provides the ability to do character generation and CGI effects far more cheaply than earlier systems This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions for weather graphics and radar advertising channels music video production and desktop videographers The NewTek Video Toaster was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga br In the release of the Amiga A fixed frequency monochrome monitor with built in framebuffer and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high resolution graphic modes for NTSC and for PAL br br br ReTargetable Graphics br br ReTargetable Graphics is an API for device drivers mainly used by rd party graphics hardware to interface with AmigaOS via a set of libraries The software libraries may include software tools to adjust resolution screen colors pointers and screenmodes The standard Intuition interface is limited to display depths of bits while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like bits br br br Sound br The sound chip named Paula supports four PCM sound channels two for the left speaker and two for the right with bit resolution for each channel and a bit volume control per channel The analog output is connected to a low pass filter which filters out high frequency aliasing when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate see Nyquist frequency The brightness of the Amiga s power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga s low pass filter The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness and deactivated when dimmed or off on older A Amigas On Amiga and first Amiga and Amiga model the power LED had no relation to the filter s status and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter Paula can read arbitrary waveforms at arbitrary rates and amplitudes directly from the system s RAM using direct memory access DMA making sound playback without CPU intervention possible br Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels software such as OctaMED uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least br The quality of the Amiga s sound output and the fact that sound hardware is part of the standard chipset and easily addressed by software were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years Third party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions multi track direct to disk recording multiple hardware sound channels and bit and beyond resolutions A retargetable sound API called AHI was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software br br br Kickstart firmware br br Kickstart is the firmware upon which AmigaOS is bootstrapped Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a bootable volume such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive Most models excluding the Amiga come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded ROM chip br br br Keyboard and mouse br br The keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid s IBM PC Ten function keys a numeric keypad and four separate directional arrow keys Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A Absent are Home End Page Up and Page Down keys These functions are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key which a function key usually acts as on PCs usually F In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys the Amiga has Amiga keys rendered as Open Amiga and Closed Amiga similar to the Open Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards The left is used to manipulate the operating system moving screens and the like and the right delivers commands to the application The absence of Num lock frees space for more mathematical symbols around the numeric pad br Like IBM compatible computers the mouse has two buttons but in AmigaOS pressing and holding the right button replaces the system status line at the top of the screen with a Maclike menu bar As with Apple s Mac OS prior to Mac OS menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option not by left clicking Menu items that have a Boolean toggle state can be left clicked whilst the menu is kept open with the right button which allows the user for example to set some selected text to bold underline and italics in one visit to the menus br The mouse plugs into one of two Atari joystick ports used for joysticks game paddles and graphics tablets Although compatible with analog joysticks Atari style digital joysticks became standard Unusually two independent mice can be connected to the joystick ports some games such as Lemmings were designed to take advantage of this br br br Other peripherals and expansions br br The Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available As a result of this and the Amiga s audio and video capabilities the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video br Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware such as memory expansions SCSI controllers CPU boards and graphics boards Other upgrades include genlocks network cards for Ethernet modems sound cards and samplers video digitizers extra serial ports and IDE controllers Additions after the demise of Commodore company are USB cards The most popular upgrades were memory SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards These were sometimes combined into one device br Early CPU accelerator cards used the full bit CPUs of the family such as the Motorola and Motorola almost always with bit memory and usually with FPUs and MMUs or the facility to add them Later designs feature the Motorola or Motorola Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers br Phase designed the PowerUP boards Blizzard PPC and CyberStorm PPC featuring both a k a or and a PowerPC or CPU which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations a powerful CPU is needed to run MAME for example but even decoding JPEG pictures and MP audio was considered heavy computation at the time It is also possible to ignore the k CPU and run Linux on the PPC via project Linux APUS but a PowerPC native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared br bit graphics cards and video cards were also available Graphics cards were designed primarily for D artwork production workstation use and later gaming Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals and processing and manipulating video br In the North American market the NewTek Video Toaster was a video effects board that turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer that found its way into many professional video environments One well known use was to create the special effects in early series of Babylon Due to its NTSC only design it did not find a market in countries that used the PAL standard such as in Europe In those countries the OpalVision card was popular although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster Low cost time base correctors TBC specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards br Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A A and A allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards Sound Blaster sound cards Ethernet cards USB cards and television tuner cards Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards that contained an Intel x series chip allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC br PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers PCI busboards with Ethernet sound and D graphics cards and tower cases allowed the A and A to survive well into the late nineties br Expansion boards were made by Richmond Sound Design that allow their show control and sound design software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio lighting automation relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park for example See Amiga software for more information on these applications br Other devices included the following br br Amiga with KB RAM and real time clock br Trumpcard Zorro II SCSI interface br GVP A Turbo accelerator RAM expansion PC emulator br A A SCSI hard disk controller MB RAM expansion br A SCSI tape backup unit with a capacity of MB OEM Archive Viper inch br A Ethernet Zorro II interface the first Ethernet interface for Amiga uses the AMD Am chip The same interface chip is used in DECstation as well br Ariadne Zorro II Ethernet interface using the AMD Am br A Zorro II Ethernet interface using the SMC C QF br X Surf from Individual Computers using the Realtek AS br A Arcnet br A floppy disk drive consisting of a inch double density DD rpm kbit s drive unit connected via DB connector track to track delay is on the order of ms The default capacity is KB Many clone drives were available and products such as the Catweasel and KryoFlux make it possible to read and write Amiga and other special disc formats on standard x PCs br NE compatible PCMCIA Ethernet cards for Amiga and Amiga br br br Serial ports br The Commodore A board provides seven RS C serial ports in addition to the Amiga s built in serial port Each port can be driven independently at speeds of to bits s There is however a driver available on Aminet that allows two of the serial ports to be driven at bits s The serial card used the CE CPU clocked at MHz This CPU was also part of the CSG CPU core that was used in the Commodore computer br br br Networking br Amiga has three networking interface APIs br br AS the official Commodore TCP IP stack API with hard coded drivers in revision AS r for the A Ethernet and the A Arcnet interfaces In revision AS r the SANA II interface was used br SANA II a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme and lacks proper support for promiscuous and multicast modes br Miami Network Interface MNI an API that doesn t have the problems that SANA II suffers from It requires AmigaOS v or higher br Different network media were used br br br Models and variants br br The original Amiga models were produced from to They are in order of production UX T CDTV CD and T The PowerPC based AmigaOne computers were later marketed beginning in Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga clones and still do so today br br br Commodore Amiga br br The first Amiga model the Amiga was launched in In PC World rated the Amiga as the seventh greatest PC of all time stating Years ahead of its time the Amiga was the world s first multimedia multitasking personal computer br Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the Amiga in the Amiga in and the Amiga in each offering improved capabilities and expansion options The best selling models were the budget models however particularly the highly successful Amiga and the Amiga The Amiga was the shortest lived model replacing the Amiga and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the Amiga which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga br The CDTV launched in was a CD ROM based game console and multimedia appliance several years before CD ROM drives were common The system never achieved any real success br Commodore s last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was the Amiga CD a bit CD ROM games console Although discontinued after Commodore s demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe The CD was a next generation CDTV and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market br Following purchase of Commodore s assets by Escom in the A and A T continued to be sold in small quantities until though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity br Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the rock band The B s Early A units had the words B ROCK LOBSTER silk screen printed onto their printed circuit board a reference to the song Rock Lobster The Amiga referenced JUNE BUG after the song Junebug and the Amiga had CHANNEL Z after Channel Z and the CD had Spellbound br br br AmigaOS systems br br AmigaOS is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems It is mainly based on AmigaOS source code with some parts of version Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards on the Teron series based AmigaOne computers built by Eyetech under license by Amiga Inc on the Pegasos II from Genesi bPlan GmbH on the ACube Systems Srl Sam ep Sam ex AmigaOne systems and on the A EON AmigaOne X br AmigaOS had been available only in developer pre releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc and Hyperion Entertainment the Belgian company that is developing the OS the commercial AmigaOS had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards br AmigaOS for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November Version was released in August for AmigaOne systems and in May for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is update Starting with release update there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS x ROMs all classic Amiga models including CD and relative Workbench files br Acube Systems entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS to its Sam ep and Sam ex line of PowerPC based motherboards In a version for Pegasos II was released in co operation with Acube Systems In A EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the AmigaOne X to consumers through their partner Amiga Kit who provided end user support assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system br br br Amiga hardware clones br Long time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga clone market with their DraCo non linear video editing system It appears in two versions initially a tower model and later a cube DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga VLabMotion Toccata WarpEngine RetinaIII into a true Amiga clone powered by the Motorola processor The DraCo can run AmigaOS up through AmigaOS It is the only Amiga based system to support FireWire for video I O DraCo also offers an Amiga compatible Zorro II expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus capable of MB sec transfer rates faster than Commodore s Zorro III The technology was later used in the Casablanca system a set top box also designed for non linear video editing br In Index Information released the Access an Amiga clone similar to the Amiga but on a motherboard that could fit into a standard inch drive bay It features either a or CPU with a AGA chipset and runs AmigaOS br In former Amiga employees John Smith Peter Kittel Dave Haynie and Andy Finkel to mention few formed a new company called PIOS Their hardware platform PIOS One was aimed at Amiga Atari and Macintosh users The company was renamed to Met box in until it folded br The NatAmi short for Native Amiga hardware project began in with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features The NatAmi motherboard is a standard Mini ITX compatible form factor computer motherboard powered by a Motorola Freescale and its chipset It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA Altera chip on the board The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the Minimig motherboard and its history is very similar to that of the C One mainboard developed by Jeri Ellsworth and Jens Sch nfeld From a commercial point of view Natami s circuitry and design are currently closed source One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga compatible motherboard that includes up to date features but that does not rely on emulation as in WinUAE modern PC Intel components or a modern PowerPC mainboard As such NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas such as with AmigaOne or Pegasos computers This purist philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two megabytes of audio and video graphics RAM as in the AGA chipset and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern FPGA Altera Cyclone IV chip Later the developers decided to create from scratch a new software form processor chip codenamed N that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip br In two new Amiga clones were announced both using FPGA based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga OCS custom chipset The first the Minimig is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren Referred to as new Amiga hardware the original model was built on a Xilinx Spartan development board but soon a dedicated board was developed The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise Agnus Paula and Gary chips as well as both CIAs and implements a simple version of Amber The rest of the chips are an actual CPU ram chips and a PIC microcontroller for BIOS control The design for Minimig was released as open source on July In February an Italian company Acube Systems began selling Minimig boards A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade Replay board The Replay uses an FPGA with about three times more capacity and that does support the AGA chipset and a soft core with capabilities The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines br The second is the Clone A system announced by Individual Computers As of mid it has been shown in its development form with FPGA based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga motherboard br br br Operating systems br br br AmigaOS br br AmigaOS is a single user multitasking operating system It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement preemptive multitasking It was developed first by Commodore International and initially introduced in with the Amiga John C Dvorak wrote in PC Magazine in AmigaOS remains one of the great operating systems of the past years incorporating a small kernel and tremendous multitasking capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in OS and Windows NT The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as K of address space br AmigaOS combines a command line interface and graphical user interface AmigaDOS is the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and Workbench the native graphical windowing graphical environment for file management and launching applications AmigaDOS allows long filenames up to characters with whitespace and does not require filename extensions The windowing system and user interface engine that handles all input events is called Intuition br The multi tasking kernel is called Exec It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system providing pre emptive multitasking with prioritised round robin scheduling It enabled true pre emptive multitasking in as little as KB of free memory br AmigaOS does not implement memory protection the CPU does not include a memory management unit Although this speeds and eases inter process communication because programs can communicate by simply passing a pointer back and forth the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to crashes from badly behaving programs than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system A co operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools br The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore s initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS s underlying software routines but also to the hardware itself enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the Commodore to POKE the hardware directly as was done on the older platform While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos it also contributed to system instabilityas some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level For this reason when the new AGA chipset was released Commodore declined to release low level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines br The latest version for the PPC Amigas is the AmigaOS and for the k Amigas is the AmigaOS br br br Influence on other operating systems br AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems MorphOS and AROS clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems AmigaOS also influenced BeOS which featured a centralized system of Datatypes similar to that present in AmigaOS Likewise DragonFly BSD was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer WindowLab and amiwm are among several window managers for the X Window System seek to mimic the Workbench interface IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license This allowed OS to have the WPS Workplace Shell GUI shell for OS a bit operating system br br br Unix and Unix like systems br Commodore Amiga produced Amiga Unix informally known as Amix based on AT T SVR It supports the Amiga and Amiga and is included with the Amiga UX Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware accelerated windowing system that can scroll windows without copying data Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on or processors br Other still maintained operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform including Linux and NetBSD Both require a CPU with MMU such as the with or full versions of the or There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards Debian and Yellow Dog Linux can run on the AmigaOne br There is an official older version of OpenBSD The last Amiga release is MINIX also runs on Amiga br br br Emulating other systems br br The Amiga Sidecar is a complete IBM PC XT compatible computer contained in an expansion card It was released by Commodore in and promoted as a way to run business software on the Amiga br br br Amiga software br br In the late s and early s the platform became particularly popular for gaming demoscene activities and creative software uses During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software often developing titles simultaneously for the Atari ST due to the similar hardware architecture Popular creative software included D rendering ray tracing packages bitmap graphics editors desktop video software software development packages and tracker music editors br Until the late s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non commercial software often developed by enthusiasts and much of which was freely redistributable An on line archive Aminet was created in and until the late s was the largest public archive of software art and documents for any platform br br br Marketing br br The name Amiga was chosen by the developers from the Spanish word for a female friend because they knew Spanish and because it occurred before Apple and Atari alphabetically It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was user friendly as a pun or play on words br The first official Amiga logo was a rainbow colored double check mark In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces Although it was never adopted as a trademark by Commodore the Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating Following Escom s purchase of Commodore in the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo br Early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all purpose business machine though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer Throughout the s and early s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television br br br Legacy br Since the demise of Commodore various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line br br Genesi sold PowerPC based hardware under the Pegasos brand running AmigaOS and MorphOS br Eyetech sold PowerPC based hardware under the AmigaOne brand from to running AmigaOS br Amiga Kit distributes and sells PowerPC based hardware under the AmigaOne brand from to present day running AmigaOS br ACube Systems sells the AmigaOS compatible Minimig system with a Freescale MC SEC CPU Motorola compatible and AmigaOS compatible Sam Sam AmigaOne systems with PowerPC processors br A EON Technology Ltd sells the AmigaOS compatible AmigaOne X system with P A Semi PWRficient PA T M processor br Amiga Kit Vesalia Computer and AMIGAstore eu sell numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems br AmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems AmigaOS based on AmigaOS source code with some parts of version is developed by Hyperion Entertainment and runs on PowerPC based hardware MorphOS based on some parts of AROS source code is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on Apple and other PowerPC based hardware br There is also AROS a free and open source operating system re implementation of the AmigaOS APIs for Amiga k x and ARM hardware one version runs Linux hosted on the Raspberry Pi In particular AROS for Amiga k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and or for use on real classic hardware br br br Magazines br Amiga Format continued publication until Amiga Active was launched in and was published until br Several magazines are in publication today Print magazine Amiga Addict started publication in Amiga Future which is available in both English and German Bitplane it a bimonthly magazine in Italian and AmigaPower a long running French magazine br br br Trade shows br The Amiga continues to be popular enough that fans to support conferences such as Amiga which had over vendors br br br Uses br The Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation Season and part of season of the television series Babylon were rendered in LightWave D on Amigas Other television series using Amigas for special effects included SeaQuest DSV and Max Headroom br In addition many celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga br br Andy Warhol was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch where he made a computer artwork of Debbie Harry Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers and was the author of a multimedia opera
