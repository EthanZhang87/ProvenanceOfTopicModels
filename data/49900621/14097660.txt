TI RTOS is an embedded tools ecosystem created and offered by Texas Instruments TI for use across a range of their embedded system processors It includes a real time operating system RTOS component named TI RTOS Kernel formerly named SYS BIOS which evolved from DSP BIOS networking connectivity stacks power management file systems instrumentation and inter processor communications like DSP BIOS Link It is free and open source software released under a BSD license br TI RTOS can be used within TI s Code Composer Studio integrated development environment IDE IAR Systems IAR Embedded Workbench and the GNU Compiler Collection GCC Separate versions of TI RTOS are provided to support TI s MSP x including MSP SimpleLink Wireless MCU Sitara Tiva C C and C lines of embedded devices br TI RTOS provides system services to an embedded application such as preemptive multitasking memory management and real time analysis TI RTOS can be used in different microprocessors with different processing and memory constraints It is supported by Secure Sockets Layer SSL and Transport Layer Security TLS libraries such as WolfSSL br br br History br The roots of TI RTOS were originally developed by Spectron Microsystems a subsidiary of Dialogic Corporation as the first RTOS developed specifically for digital signal processors and was named SPOX Spectron eventually also developed a second product named BIOSuite that included a real time kernel and various associated tools br Spectron Microsystems was eventually acquired by Texas Instruments and the SPOX and BIOSuite products were merged into one microkernel product named DSP BIOS The DSP BIOS RTOS product underwent significant changes to its application programming interface API in version With the release of version in August DSP BIOS was renamed SYS BIOS to reflect its support for microcontrollers beyond DSPs With the release of version in April SYS BIOS was renamed TI RTOS Kernel and made a component of the TI RTOS product suite br TI RTOS was released initially in July for TI s microprocessors The release of TI RTOS in April completed the renaming process and integrated the TI RTOS Kernel and other components under one software umbrella br br br Component overview br br TI RTOS consists of many components for Kernel Drivers and Board Initialization Network Services Interprocessor Communication Instrumentation and File Systems br br br Licensing br Most of the TI RTOS components are released under the BSD License Any user can rebuild the kernel using the included source code br br br RTOS Kernel Overview br br br Organization br The TI RTOS Kernel is made up of a number of discrete components called modules Each module can provide services via an API and is individually configurable A developer can choose whether this module is included in the runtime image or optimized out If included the user can configure various aspects of the Semaphore module and instances of semaphores to be created on system start up The module provides an API so that semaphores can be created posted pended and deleted as an embedded program runs br br br Threading br TI RTOS Kernel supports different types of threads in an embedded system br br Hardware Interrupt Hwi support threads initiated by a hardware interrupt br Software Interrupt Swi structured to be similar to Hwis but allow processing to be deferred until after a hardware interrupt has completed br Task a discrete thread that can execute or block while waiting for an event to occur br Idle the lowest priority thread that only runs when no other thread is ready to execute br br br Memory management br TI RTOS Kernel has tools to set up an embedded system s memory map and allow memory buffers to be allocated and deallocated while the system runs The type of memory manager used during runtime is configurable so that memory fragmentation can be minimized br br br Real time debugging br The TI RTOS kernel can use modules to provide information about the execution of the system This includes the time utilisation of the CPU by various threads and the logging of events that occur both in the system application and in the TI RTOS kernel The Code Composer Studio IDE is able to graphically display this logged data for analysis br br br br br br External links br TI RTOS software page on TI website
