TempleOS formerly J Operating System LoseThos and SparrowOS is a biblical themed lightweight operating system OS designed to be the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible It was created by American programmer Terry A Davis who developed it alone over the course of a decade after a series of manic episodes that he later described as a revelation from God br The system was characterized as a modern x Commodore using an interface similar to a mixture of DOS and Turbo C Davis proclaimed that the system s features such as its x resolution color display and single voice audio were designed according to explicit instructions from God It was programmed with an original variation of C C named HolyC in place of BASIC and included an original flight simulator compiler and kernel br First released in as J Operating System TempleOS was renamed in and was last updated in br br br Background br br Programmer Terry A Davis began experiencing regular manic episodes in leading him to numerous stays at mental hospitals Initially diagnosed with bipolar disorder he was later declared schizophrenic and remained unemployed for the rest of his life He suffered from delusions of space aliens and government agents that left him briefly hospitalized for his mental health issues After experiencing a self described revelation he proclaimed that he was in direct communication with God and that God told him the operating system was for God s third temple br Davis began developing TempleOS circa One of its early names was the J Operating System before renaming it to LoseThos a reference to a scene from the film Platoon In Davis wrote that LoseThos was primarily for making video games It has no networking or Internet support As far as I m concerned that would be reinventing the wheel Another name he used was SparrowOS before settling on TempleOS In mid his website announced God s temple is finished Now God kills CIA until it spreads sic br Davis died after being hit by a train on August br br br System overview br TempleOS is a bit non preemptive multi tasking multi cored public domain open source ring only single address space non networked PC operating system for recreational programming The OS runs bit ASCII with graphics in source code and has a D and D graphics library which run at x VGA with colors Like most modern operating systems it has keyboard and mouse support It supports ISO FAT and RedSea file systems the latter created by Davis with support for file compression According to Davis many of these specifications such as the x resolution color display and single audio voice were instructed to him by God He explained that the limited resolution was to make it easier for children to draw illustrations for God br The operating system includes an original flight simulator compiler and kernel One bundled program After Egypt is a game in which the player travels to a burning bush to use a high speed stopwatch The stopwatch is meant to act as an oracle that generates pseudo random text something Davis likened to a Ouija board and glossolalia An example of generated text follows br br among consigned penally result perverseness checked stated held sensation reasonings skies adversity Dakota lip Suffer approached enact displacing feast Canst pearl doing alms comprehendeth nought br TempleOS was written in a programming language developed by Davis as a middle ground between C and C originally called C C Plus later renamed to Holy C possibly a reference to the Holy See It doubles as the shell language enabling the writing and execution of entire applications from within the shell The IDE that comes with TempleOS supports several features such as embedding images in code It uses a non standard text format known as DolDoc which has support for hypertext links images and D meshes to be embedded into what are otherwise standard ASCII files for example a file can have a spinning D model of a tank as a comment in source code Most code in the OS is JIT compiled and it is generally encouraged to use JIT compilation as opposed to creating binaries Davis ultimately wrote over lines of code for the OS br br br Holy C br br Holy C formerly C is a variant of the C and C programming Languages designed by Terry A Davis specifically for the TempleOS It functions as both a general purpose language for application development and a scripting language for automating tasks within TempleOS br br br Design and Features br Holy C shares similarities with C and C but incorporates distinct features br br Compilation and Performance Holy C compiles directly to x assembly offering potential performance benefits for tasks suited to low level control br Inline Assembly Integration Holy C allows programmers to directly embed x assembly instructions within the source code enabling fine grained optimization for performance critical sections br Error Handling The language prioritizes clear and human readable error messages to aid debugging br Standard Library Holy C provides a set of libraries for common programming operations including string manipulation numerical calculations and date handling br Syntax and Flexibility Compared to C Holy C offers some syntactic variations and potentially greater flexibility in code structure br C Compatibility Holy C maintains a degree of compatibility with C code allowing programmers to leverage existing C libraries and functions within a Holy C environment br Holy C s primary use case lies within the TempleOS ecosystem Due to TempleOS s niche position Holy C adoption remains limited outside of that specific operating system br However some programmers find Holy C s unique features and its connection to TempleOS intriguing Online resources exist for those interested in learning more about Holy C including tutorials and a standalone compiler that facilitates experimentation independent of TempleOS br br br Critical reception br TempleOS received mostly sympathetic reviews Tech journalist David Cassel opined that programming websites tried to find the necessary patience and understanding to accommodate Davis TechRepublic and OSNews published positive articles on Davis s work even though Davis was banned from the latter for hostile comments targeting its readers and staff In his review for TechRepublic James Sanders concluded that TempleOS is a testament to the dedication and passion of one man displaying his technological prowess It doesn t need to be anything more OSNews editor Kroc Camen wrote that the OS shows that computing can still be a hobby why is everybody so serious these days If I want to code an OS that uses interpretive dance as the input method I should be allowed to do so companies like Apple be damned In the OS was shown as a part of an outsider art exhibition in Bourgogne France br br br Legacy br After Davis death OSNews editor Thom Holwerda wrote Davis was clearly a gifted programmer writing an entire operating system is no small feat and it was sad to see him affected by his mental illness One fan described Davis as a programming legend while another a computer engineer compared the development of TempleOS to a one man built skyscraper He added that it actually boggles my mind that one man wrote all that and that it was hard for a layperson to understand what a phenomenal achievement it is to write an entire operating system alone br TempleOS is in the public domain Davis family has wished for fans to donate to the National Alliance for Mental Illness and other organizations working to ease the pain and suffering caused by mental illness br br br Forks br ZealOS The Zeal Operating System is a modernized fork of the bit Temple Operating System br TinkerOS br Shrine br br br See also
