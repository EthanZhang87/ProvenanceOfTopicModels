id: 1497926
Windows Services for UNIX SFU is a discontinued software package produced by Microsoft which provided a Unix environment on Windows NT and some of its immediate successor operating systems br SFU and used the MKS Toolkit starting with SFU SFU included the Interix subsystem which was acquired by Microsoft in from US based Softway Systems as part of an asset acquisition SFU was the last release and was available as a free download from Microsoft Windows Server R included most of the former SFU components on Disk naming the Interix subsystem component Subsystem for UNIX based Applications SUA In Windows Server and high end versions of both Windows Vista and Windows Enterprise and Ultimate a minimal Interix SUA was included but most of the other SFU utilities had to be downloaded separately from Microsoft s web site br The Interix subsystem included in SFU and and later released as SUA Windows components provided header files and libraries that made it easier to recompile or port Unix applications for use on Windows they did not make Linux or other Unix binaries BSD Solaris Xenix etc compatible with Windows binaries Like the Microsoft POSIX subsystem that Interix replaced it is best thought of as a distinct Unix like platform br It is replaced by Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows and Windows Server br br br Components br br As of SFU it contained br br Over Unix utilities such as vi ksh csh ls cat awk grep kill etc br GCC compiler includes and libraries through an MS libc br A cc like wrapper for Microsoft Visual Studio command line C C compiler br GDB debugger br Perl br NFS server and client br A pcnfsd daemon br X tools and libraries br Tools for making NFS mount points appear as Windows shares and vice versa gateway services br A NIS server capability linked with Active Directory AD br Some Windows Unix authentication information synchronization tools br SFU did not contain the following br br bash OpenSSH sudo CVS ClamAV bzip gmake curl emacs Apache XView Ruby Tcl Python br Although SFU includes X Window System client libraries and applications it does not contain a native X server Administrators may configure any of the numerous third party Windows X servers Fully featured free options include Cygwin X Xming and WeirdX br br br Releases br br br br Microsoft produced at least one beta release of the initial version of SFU before its final release in February This release in English only was supported on the Windows NT SP for x and Alpha platforms This is the only known release to support Alpha It included a demonstration version of the MKS Toolkit along with the following components br br Telnet server br Telnet client br UNIX Utilities from MKS br Client for NFS br Server for NFS br Server for NFS Authentication br Windows NT to UNIX password synchronization br Help files and documentation br br br br This second installment of SFU was released April and was also for English however a Japanese language release appeared just two months later in June Both ran on Windows NT SP and Windows on x platforms with Internet Explorer SFU supported the following UNIX versions Solaris HP UX AIX Tru UNIX and Red Hat Linux It included the following components br br Server for NFS NFSServer br Client for NFS NFSClient br Gateway for NFS NFSGateway br Server for PCNFS Pcnfsd br User Name Mapping Mapsvc br Server for NFS Authentication NFSServerAuth br Server for NIS NIS br Telnet Client TelnetClient br Telnet server TelnetServer br Password synchronization PasswdSync br ActiveState ActivePerl Perl br UNIX utilities UnixUtilities br Cron service CronSvc br Rsh service RshSvc br There were subsequent updated OEM releases SFU SFU and SFU br br br br This version released in May was the first release to include the Interix subsystem Previously Microsoft had released Interix actually version as a separate product around the same time frame as SFU This SFU release included Interix release commonly called the version as reported by uname r with an internal Microsoft version of that relates to internal build sequences This Interix release contained significant technical extensions from the Interix release such as a rooted file system and setuid functionality that were entirely based on the Softway Systems Interix development codenamed Firebrand This was also released in English and followed by a later release in Japanese in October adding internationalization support Both supported Windows NT SP a Windows and Windows XP Professional on x platforms with Internet Explorer The MKS Toolkit was no longer included It included the following components br br Base Utilities for Interix BaseUtils including X R utilities br UNIX Perl for Interix UNIXPerl br Interix SDK InterixSDK including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler br GNU Utilities for Interix GNUUtils about utilities in total br GNU SDK for Interix GNUSDK including gcc and g br NFS Client for Windows NFSClient br NFS Gateway for Windows NFSGateway br NFS Server for Windows NFSServer br NIS Server for Windows NIS br Password Synchronization PasswdSync br Windows Remote Shell Service RshSvc br Telnet Server for Windows TelnetServer br NFS User Name Mapping Mapsvc br NFS Authentication Server NFSServerAuth br PCNFS Server Pcnfsd br ActiveState Perl Perl br br br br This was the final release of SFU and the only release to be distributed free of charge It was released January and included both English and Japanese versions for Windows Windows XP Professional and Windows Server original release only on x platforms with Internet Explorer It included Interix subsystem release build version adding internationalization support at least for the English version which did not have such until now and POSIX threading This release could only be installed to an NTFS file system earlier versions supported FAT this was for improved file security requirements in Interix The following UNIX versions were supported for NFS components Solaris and Red Hat Linux AIX L and HP UX i It included the following components br br Base Utilities for Interix BaseUtils including X R and X R utilities br UNIX Perl for Interix UNIXPerl br Interix SDK InterixSDK including headers and libraries for development and a wrapper for Visual Studio compiler br GNU Utilities for Interix GNUUtils again about utilities br GNU SDK for Interix GNUSDK including gcc and g br NFS Client for Windows NFSClient br NFS Gateway for Windows NFSGateway br NFS Server for Windows NFSServer br NIS Server for Windows NIS br Password synchronization PasswdSync br Windows Remote Shell Service RshSvc br Telnet Server for Windows TelnetServer br NFS User Name Mapping Mapsvc br NFS Authentication Server NFSServerAuth br PCNFS server Pcnfsd br ActiveState Perl Perl br Microsoft does not intend to produce any further standalone versions of SFU opting instead for the integrated SUA As of August v is unavailable from the provided Microsoft Link General support continued until extended support until br br br Known problems br Character translation must be used to accommodate filenames which include a colon or other characters that do not comply with the naming conventions of Windows file systems Files with the same name but different cases are also not allowed by default but can be enabled on installation with the side effect of making the underlying partition s filesystem case sensitive even for the Win subsystem br Network authentication for UNIX systems relies on the insecure NIS protocol LDAP and Kerberos based authentication require a third party solution Microsoft has released several hotfixes for Windows Services for UNIX and at least one Security Update KB The GNU Project utilities are several versions older than the latest ones A separate port of the up to date Debian utilities was started in but apparently abandoned in Several of the text processing utilities in SUA e g awk are not compatible with Unicode or wide character text files br No version of Windows Services for UNIX is available for Windows XP Professional x Edition br br br Legacy br Windows Server R contains most SFU components namely Microsoft Services for Network File System NFS Subsystem for UNIX based Applications SUA a k a Interix and Identity Management for UNIX The July SFU Security Update updated posix exe and related files to match the SUA version br Unlike the SFU the SUA version included in Windows Server R and subsequent versions has bit support and allows linking of Win libraries to SUA applications br Windows Vista and Windows Enterprise and Ultimate Editions also contain the Services for Unix components now called the Subsystem for UNIX based applications SUA and Client for NFS v Users must download the utilities and SDK separately However the server components from the SFU product line namely Server for NFS User Name Mapping Server for NIS Password Synchronization etc are not included these are included in Server editions of Windows i e Windows Server br SUA was deprecated in Windows Enterprise and Windows Server and completely removed in Windows and Windows Server R The NFS server is still supported in Windows Server R br The NFS client feature and server features are separate from the SUA in Windows and and remained supported until Windows Subsystem for Linux replaced it On desktop Windows NFS is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions The free reference implementation of NFS for Windows by UMICH CITI the development of which was sponsored by Microsoft does work on lower end versions of Windows but requires more involved installation br In Windows the NFS client gained krb p Kerberos with full data encryption support In Windows Kerberos was supported for authentication but only packet integrity checking was available for data The maximum block buffer size was also increased from KB to MB in Windows br Windows Server added support for NFS server The new implementation is kernel based RPC XDR wise but many optional features from NFS are not implemented including ACLs pNFS etc There is however support in PowerShell for mapping user identities br br br See also br Cygwin br UnxUtils br UWIN br Windows Subsystem for Linux br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Microsoft
