OSF is a variant of the Unix operating system developed by the Open Software Foundation during the late s and early s OSF is one of the first operating systems to have used the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University and is probably best known as the native Unix operating system for DEC Alpha architecture systems br In after AT T had sold UNIX System V to Novell and the rival Unix International consortium had disbanded the Open Software Foundation ceased funding of research and development of OSF The Tru UNIX variant of OSF was supported by HP until br br br Background br In during the so called Unix wars Digital Equipment Corporation DEC joined with IBM Hewlett Packard and others to form the Open Software Foundation OSF to develop a version of Unix named OSF The aim was to compete with System V Release from AT T Corporation and Sun Microsystems and it has been argued that a primary goal was for the operating system to be free of AT T intellectual property The fact that OSF is one of the first operating systems to have used the Mach kernel is cited as support of this assertion Digital also strongly promoted OSF for real time applications and with traditional UNIX implementations at the time providing poor real time support at best the real time and multi threading support can be interpreted as having been heavily dependent on the Mach kernel At the time of its introduction OSF became the third major flavor of UNIX together with System V and BSD br OSF at its inception combined Mach with a large part of the BSD kernel based on the Reno release to implement the UNIX API with this monolithic kernel arrangement continuing through the OSF release although the adoption of a microkernel had already been foreseen OSF introduced such a microkernel in the form of Mach hosting Unix system services separately in user space to provide the existing OSF functionality br br br Vendor releases br DEC s first release of OSF OSF Release in January was for its line of MIPS based DECstation workstations however this was never a fully supported product DEC ported OSF to their new Alpha AXP platform as DEC OSF AXP Release released in March OSF AXP is a full bit operating system preserving the kernel architecture based on Mach and BSD components From OSF AXP onwards UNIX System V compatibility was also integrated into the system but the architecture remained centred on the Mach modular kernel unlike later OSF versions of the system Although OSF was also developed for DECStation MIPS systems it was never officially released or sold Subsequent releases are named Digital UNIX and later Tru UNIX br Upon its acquisition of Apollo Computer in HP announced plans to introduce OSF on both companies products by late HP released a port of OSF to the early HP workstations based on the PA RISC architecture This was withdrawn soon afterwards due to lack of software and hardware support compared to competing operating systems specifically HP UX br As part of the AIM alliance and the resulting PowerOpen specification Apple Computer intended to base A UX for its PowerPC based Macintoshes upon OSF but the project was cancelled and PowerOpen deprecated br IBM used OSF as the basis of the AIX ESA operating system for System and System mainframes br Intel Paragon supercomputers used a version of OSF featuring the Mach kernel br OSF was also ported by Kendall Square Research to its proprietary microarchitecture used in the KSR supercomputer br br br OSF MK br The Open Software Foundation created OSF MK an evolution of OSF incorporating the OSF Mach kernel or OSF Microkernel based on Mach along with a variety of other functionality including the OSF Single Server providing the Unix system personality The complete system in the form of MK was made available under commercial terms to OSF licensees in April In contrast to the OSF server which was encumbered by proprietary Unix licensing the microkernel itself remained freely available for adoption by other projects In OSF MK it contains applicable code from the University of Utah Mach kernel such as the Shuttles modification used to speed up message passing and applicable code from the many Mach variants that sprouted off from the original Carnegie Mellon University Mach kernel It also consists of improvements made by the OSF such as built in collocation capability realtime improvements and rewriting of the IPC RPC component for better performance br br br OSF AD br OSF AD Advanced Development was a distributed version of OSF developed for massively parallel supercomputers by Locus Computing Corporation Variants of OSF AD are on several such systems including the Intel Paragon XP S and ASCI Red Convex Exemplar SPP as SPP UX and the Hitachi SR as HI UX MPP br br br OSF br OSF a successor to OSF was described as being based on the TMach system developed by Trusted Information Systems TMach or Trusted Mach was an operating system architecture incorporating the OSF Mach MK kernel introducing a trusted computing base layer consisting of trusted server components hosting an application layer in which untrusted programs would run In HP announced plans to merge the software platforms of its own products and those of newly acquired Apollo Computer to form a single OSF compliant platform to be delivered by br Other interpretations of the OSF name were associated with various plans to remove AT T licensed code from early forms of OSF and the Mach kernel in particular leading to speculation that a system based on the Chorus microkernel might supplant Mach entirely and become OSF itself With such a Chorus based architecture having been rejected in favour of the Mach microkernel the OSF designation persisted in reporting of this particular form of OSF br br br
