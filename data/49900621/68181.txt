id: 68181
A workstation is a special computer designed for technical or scientific applications Intended primarily to be used by a single user they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi user operating systems The term workstation has been used loosely to refer to everything from a mainframe computer terminal to a PC connected to a network but the most common form refers to the class of hardware offered by several current and defunct companies such as Sun Microsystems Silicon Graphics Apollo Computer DEC HP NeXT and IBM which powered the D computer graphics revolution of the late s br Workstations formerly offered higher performance than mainstream personal computers especially in CPU graphics memory and multitasking Workstations are optimized for the visualization and manipulation of different types of complex data such as D mechanical design engineering simulations like computational fluid dynamics animation video editing image editing medical imaging image rendering computational science and mathematical plots Typically the form factor is that of a desktop computer which consists of a high resolution display a keyboard and a mouse at a minimum but also offers multiple displays graphics tablets and D mice for manipulating objects and navigating scenes Workstations were the first segment of the computer market to present advanced accessories and collaboration tools like videoconferencing br The increasing capabilities of mainstream PCs since the late s have reduced distinction between the PCs and workstations Typical s workstations have expensive proprietary hardware and operating systems to categorically distinguish from standardized PCs From the s and s IBM s RS and IntelliStation have RISC based POWER CPUs running AIX and its IBM PC Series and Aptiva corporate and consumer PCs have Intel x CPUs However by the early s this difference largely disappeared since workstations use highly commoditized hardware dominated by large PC vendors such as Dell Hewlett Packard and Fujitsu selling x systems running Windows or Linux br br br History br br br Origins and development br The first computer that might qualify as a workstation is the IBM a small scientific computer designed to be used interactively by a single person sitting at the console It was introduced in One peculiar feature of the machine is that it lacks any arithmetic circuitry To perform addition it requires a memory resident table of decimal addition rules This reduced the cost of logic circuitry enabling IBM to make it inexpensive The machine is codenamed CADET and was initially rented for per month br In the IBM scientific computer became the successor to Both of these systems run Fortran and other languages They are built into roughly desk sized cabinets with console typewriters They have optional add on disk drives printers and both paper tape and punched card I O br Early workstations are generally dedicated minicomputers a multiuser system reserved for one user For example the PDP from Digital Equipment Corporation is regarded as the first commercial minicomputer br The Lisp machines developed at MIT in the early s pioneered some workstation principles as high performance networked single user systems intended for heavily interactive use Lisp Machines were commercialized beginning by companies like Symbolics Lisp Machines Texas Instruments the TI Explorer and Xerox the Interlisp D workstations The first computer designed for a single user with high resolution graphics and so a workstation in the modern sense is the Alto developed at Xerox PARC in Other early workstations include the Terak a Three Rivers PERQ and the later Xerox Star br br br s rise in popularity br br In the early s with the advent of bit microprocessors such as the Motorola several new competitors appeared including Apollo Computer and Sun Microsystems with workstations based on and Unix Meanwhile DARPA s VLSI Project created several spinoff graphics products such as the Silicon Graphics Target markets were differentiated with Sun and Apollo considered to be network workstations and SGI as graphics workstations RISC CPUs increased in the mid s typical of workstation vendors br Workstations often feature SCSI or Fibre Channel disk storage systems high end D accelerators single or multiple bit processors large amounts of RAM and well designed cooling Additionally the companies that make the products tend to have comprehensive repair replacement plans As the distinction between workstation and PC fades however workstation manufacturers have increasingly employed off the shelf PC components and graphics solutions rather than proprietary hardware or software Some low cost workstations are still expensive by PC standards but offer binary compatibility with higher end workstations and servers made by the same vendor This allows software development to take place on low cost relative to the server desktop machines br br br Thin clients br Workstations diversified to the lowest possible price point as opposed to performance called the thin client or network computer Dependent upon a network and server this reduces the machine to having no hard drive and only the CPU keyboard mouse and screen Some diskless nodes still run a traditional operating system and perform computations locally with storage on a remote server These are intended to reduce the initial system purchase cost and the total cost of ownership by reducing the amount of administration required per user br This approach was first attempted as a replacement for PCs in office productivity applications with the Station by Com In the s X terminals filled a similar role for technical computing Sun s thin clients include the Sun Ray product line However traditional workstations and PCs continued to drop in price and complexity as remote management tools for IT staff became available undercutting this market br br br M computer br br A high end workstation of the early s with the three Ms or a M computer coined by Raj Reddy and his colleagues at CMU has one megabyte of RAM a megapixel display roughly pixels and one MegaFLOPS compute performance at least one million floating point operations per second RFC defines the workstation environment more generally as hardware and software dedicated to serve a single user and that it provisions additional shared resources This is at least one order of magnitude beyond the capacity of the personal computer of the time The original IBM Personal Computer has KB memory a text only display and floating point performance around kFLOPS kFLOPS with the optional math coprocessor Other features beyond the typical personal computer include networking graphics acceleration and high speed internal and peripheral data buses br Another goal was to bring the price below one megapenny that is less than equivalent to in which was achieved in the late s Throughout the early to mid s many workstations cost from to equivalent to in or more br br br Decline br The more widespread adoption of these technologies into mainstream PCs was a direct factor in the decline of the workstation as a separate market segment br br Reliable components br High performance D graphics hardware for computer aided design CAD and computer generated imagery CGI animation is increasingly popular in the PC market around the mid to late s mostly driven by computer gaming yielding the first official GPU in Nvidia s NV and the breakthrough GeForce br High performance CPUs the first RISC of the early s offer roughly one order of magnitude in performance improvement over CISC processors of comparable cost Intel s x CISC family always had the edge in market share and the economies of scale that this implied By the mid s some CISC processors like the Motorola and Intel s and Pentium have performance parity with RISC in some areas such as integer performance at the cost of greater chip complexity and hardware floating point calculations relegating RISC to even more high end markets br Hardware support for floating point operations optional on the original IBM PC remained on a separate chip for Intel systems until the DX processor Even then x floating point performance lags other processors due to limitations in its architecture Today even low price PCs now have performance in the gigaFLOPS range br High performance high capacity data storage early workstations tend to use proprietary disk interfaces until the SCSI standard of the mid s Although SCSI interfaces soon became available for IBM PCs they were comparatively expensive and tend to be limited by the speed of the PC s ISA peripheral bus SCSI is an advanced controller interface good for multitasking and daisy chaining This makes it suited for use in servers and its benefits to desktop PCs which mostly run single user operating systems are less clear but it is standard on the s s Macintosh Serial ATA is more modern with throughput comparable to SCSI but at a lower cost br High speed networking Mbit s or better Mbit s network interfaces were commonly available for PCs by the early s although by that time workstations were pursuing even higher networking speeds moving to Mbit s Gbit s and Gbit s However economies of scale and the demand for high speed networking in even non technical areas have dramatically decreased the time it takes for newer networking technologies to reach commodity price points br Large displays to inch with high resolutions and high refresh rates for graphics and CAD work which were rare among PCs in the late s and early s but became common among PCs by the late s br Large memory configurations PCs such as IBM clones are originally limited to KB of RAM until the introduction of the processor early workstations have megabytes of memory IBM clones require special programming techniques to address more than KB until the as opposed to other bit processors such as SPARC which provide straightforward access to nearly their entire GB memory address range bit workstations and servers supporting an address range far beyond GB have been available since the early s a technology just beginning to appear in the PC desktop and server market in the mid s br Operating system early workstations ran the Unix operating system OS a Unix like variant or an unrelated equivalent OS such as VMS The PC CPUs of the time have limitations in memory capacity and memory access protection making them unsuitable to run OSes of this sophistication but this too began to change in the late s as PCs with the bit with integrated paged MMUs became widely affordable and enabling OS Windows NT and Unix like systems based on BSD and Linux on commodity PC hardware br Tight integration between the OS and the hardware Workstation vendors both design the hardware and maintain the Unix operating system variant that runs on it This allows for much more rigorous testing than is possible with an operating system such as Windows Windows requires that third party hardware vendors write compliant hardware drivers that are stable and reliable Also minor variations in hardware quality such as timing or build quality can affect the reliability of the overall machine Workstation vendors are able to ensure both the quality of the hardware and the stability of the operating system drivers by validating these things in house and this leads to a generally much more reliable and stable machine br br br Market position br br Since the late s the workstation and consumer markets have further merged Many low end workstation components are now the same as the consumer market and the price differential narrowed For example most Macintosh Quadra computers were originally intended for scientific or design work all with the Motorola CPU backward compatible with Macintoshes The consumer Macintosh IIcx and Macintosh IIci models can be upgraded to the Quadra In an era when many professionals preferred Silicon Graphics workstations the Quadra was an intriguing option at a fraction of the cost as resource intensive software such as Infini D brought studio quality D rendering and animations to the home desktop The Quadra can run A UX making it a Unix workstation Another example is the Nvidia GeForce consumer graphics card which spawned the Quadro workstation card which has the same GPU but different driver support and certifications for CAD applications and a much higher price br Workstations have typically driven advancements in CPU technology All computers benefit from multi processor and multicore designs essentially multiple processors on a die The multicore design was pioneered by IBM s POWER it and Intel Xeon have multiple CPUs more on die cache and ECC memory br Some workstations are designed or certified for use with only one specific application such as AutoCAD Avid Xpress Studio HD or D Studio Max The certification process increases workstation prices br br br Modern market br br br GPU workstations br Modern workstations are typically desktop computers with AMD or NVIDIA GPUs to do high performance computing on software programs such as video editing D modeling computer aided design and rendering br br br Decline of RISC workstations br By January all RISC based workstation product lines had been discontinued br br Hewlett Packard
