Domain OS is the discontinued operating system used by the Apollo Domain line of workstations manufactured by Apollo Computer It was originally launched in as AEGIS and was rebranded to Domain OS in when Unix environments were added to the operating system It is one of the early distributed operating systems Hewlett Packard supported the operating system for a short time after they purchased Apollo but they later ended the product line in favor of HP UX HP ended final support for Domain OS on January br br br AEGIS br AEGIS is distinctive mainly for being designed for the networked computer as distinct from its competitors which are essentially standalone systems with added network features The prime examples of this are the file system which is fully integrated across machines as opposed to Unix which draws a distinction between file systems on the host system and on others and the user administration system which is fundamentally network based So basic is this orientation that even a standalone Apollo machine cannot be configured without a network card br Domain OS implements functionality derived from both System V and early BSD Unix systems It improves on AEGIS by providing a core OS upon which the user can install any or all of three environments AEGIS System V Unix and BSD Unix This was done in order to provide greater compatibility with Unix AEGIS version SR which immediately preceded Domain OS itself numbered SR has an optional product called Domain IX available which provides a similar capability but with some drawbacks principally the fact that core administrative tasks still require AEGIS commands Also the SR permissions system is not fully compatible with Unix behaviour Domain OS provides new administrative commands and a more complex permissions system which can be configured to behave properly under any of the three environments Domain OS also provides an improved version of the X Window System complete with VUE HP s predecessor to CDE but performance tends to be poor br User upgrading from AEGIS SR to Domain OS SR was slowed by the fact that many users saw no requirement by increased disk space requirements by new and more complex administration tools by SR s poorer performance and by the buggy nature of SR although later versions are more reliable However later HP Apollo machines the DN DN and xx series workstations can only run SR br Unlike many operating systems of the day which were written in C or assembly language many Domain OS components are written in Pascal Compilers for users are available for C C Pascal and Fortran br All of the distributed administration features of Domain OS are built around a remote procedure call system called NCS RPC Though RPC was later end of lifed with the operating system HP contributed RPC to the Open Software Foundation which incorporated its Interface Definition Language IDL into their DCE product from which the same technology was later used for CORBA One of the original developers went to work for Microsoft where he developed MSRPC as a fairly compatible clone which today forms a central component of Windows systems Traces of the history can be seen in protocol names such as ncacn http br br br User interface br AEGIS is similar to other workstations of the time in that it uses a high resolution graphics screen and mouse to provide a GUI named DM Display Manager DM is integrated with the operating system s own window manager known as wmgr Window Manager The DM contains two built in functions a text editor and a transcript which is a kind of virtual terminal Additional functions can be added by user programs One of the unique features of the DM is universal editing All text in any of the built in windows can be edited using the same editing language This includes the history displayed in a transcript window although that text is read only In addition the history is unbounded It starts from the birth of the process to which it is attached and older history is never deleted Each transcript is attached to a mini input window where the process input can be edited using the same editing language used elsewhere br The AEGIS command interface is similar to Unix in that it has a command line interpreter which understands pipes redirection scripting etc and invokes other commands as separate programs but the actual commands themselves are designed to be easier to remember and use than their Unix equivalents and wildcards are expected to be expanded by individual commands rather than by the command line interpreter itself The user may embed environment variables in symbolic links which for example allows switching between different versions of Unix by setting the SYSTYPE environment variable accordingly symbolic links then point to the appropriate versions of the files br br br History br br Domain OS incorporates several ideas from Multics including single level store and dynamic linking br br br See also br
