title: Hobbyist operating system
id: 229119
The development of a hobbyist operating system is one of the more involved and technical options for a computer hobbyist The definition of a hobby operating system can sometimes be vague It can be from the developer s view where the developers do it just for fun or learning it can also be seen from the user s view where the users are only using it as a toy or it can be defined as an operating system which doesn t have a very big user base br Development can begin from existing resources like a kernel an operating system or a bootloader or it can also be made completely from scratch The development platform could be a bare hardware machine which is the nature of an operating system but it could also be developed and tested on a virtual machine Since the hobbyist must claim more ownership for adapting a complex system to the ever changing needs of the technical terrain much enthusiasm is common amongst the different groups attracted to operating system development br br br Development br Elements of operating system development include br br Kernel br Bootstrapping br Memory management br Process management and scheduling br Device driver management br Program API br External programs br User interface br The C programming language is frequently used for hobby operating system programming as well as assembly language though other languages can be used as well br The use of assembly language is common with small systems especially those based on eight bit microprocessors such as the MOS Technology family or the Zilog Z or in systems with a lack of available resources because of its small output size and low level efficiency br br br User interface br Most hobby operating systems use a command line interface or a simple text user interface due to ease of development More advanced hobby operating systems may have a graphical user interface For example AtheOS was a hobby operating system with a graphical interface written entirely by one programmer br br br Examples br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Use of BIOS br br This section is predominantly x oriented br The term BIOS Basic Input Output System refers to firmware that initialises computer hardware and has provisions to load an operating system The BIOS also sets up a standard interface for several low level device drivers at boot time BIOS resources are often used by hobbyist operating systems especially those written on bit x machines as many hobby operating systems developers lack the time to write complex low level drivers themselves or they simply want to get into writing software for the system as soon as possible br The most commonly used BIOS functions are VideoBIOS and Disk services These are used because video cards and disk drives vary significantly on different machines and specialised drivers are often difficult to write br The use of the BIOS is uncommon in operating systems that operate in Protected mode or Long mode because the system must switch back to real mode which BIOS drivers run in br br br See also br List of hobbyist operating systems br Computer architecture br br br br br br External links br OSDev org A hobby OSDev community br Independent Software Set of tutorials on boot loader development and entering protected mode br The little book about OS development This book is a practical guide to writing your own x operating system br Kernel Let s write a Kernel br aodfaq OS development FAQ br Bona Fide OS Development OS development tutorials and other documents br A step by step tutorial br Operating System Resource Center Information and resources on various OSDev topics both software and hardware
