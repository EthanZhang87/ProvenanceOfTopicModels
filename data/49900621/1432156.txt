EUMEL pronounced oimel for Extendable Multi User Microprocessor ELAN System and also known as L for Liedtke is an operating system OS which began as a runtime system environment for the programming language ELAN It was created in by Jochen Liedtke at the Bielefeld University EUMEL initially ran on the bit Zilog Z processor It later was ported to many different computer architectures br More than Eumel systems shipped mostly to schools and also to legal practices as a text processing platform br EUMEL is based on a virtual machine using a bitcode and achieves remarkable performance and function Z based EUMEL systems provide full multi user multi tasking operation with virtual memory management and complete isolation of one process against all others These systems usually execute ELAN programs faster than equivalent programs written in languages such as COBOL BASIC or Pascal and compiled into Z machine code on other operating systems br One of the main features of EUMEL is that it is persistent using a fixpoint restart logic This means that if the OS crashes or the power fails a user loses only a few minutes of work on restart they continue working from the prior fixpoint with all program state intact fully This is also termed orthogonal persistence br EUMEL was followed by the L microkernel and later the L microkernel family br br br
