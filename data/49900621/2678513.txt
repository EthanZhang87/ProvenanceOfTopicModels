transactional memory making memory systems that are resilient to failures br br In memory processing leads to dramatically faster computers in some cases speeding up applications by a factor of It changes the complete nature of how a business can run We re trying to lower the cost and to fit these systems in existing memory structures and reduce the number of components to make them more reliable and more secure br br br Industry br Cheriton cofounded Granite Systems with Andy Bechtolsheim The company developed gigabit Ethernet products It was acquired by Cisco Systems in br In August Stanford students Sergey Brin and Larry Page met Bechtolsheim on Cheriton s front porch At the meeting Bechtolsheim wrote the first cheque to fund their company Google and Cheriton joined him as an
