K is a discontinued open source research operating system OS for cache coherent bit multiprocessor systems It was developed primarily at IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in collaboration with the University of Toronto and University of New Mexico The main focus of this OS is to address performance and scalability issues of system software on large scale shared memory non uniform memory access NUMA multiprocessing computers br K uses a microkernel architecture rather than the traditional monolithic kernel design K consists of a small exception handling component that serves as the microkernel a fast inter process communication IPC mechanism named protected procedure call PPC and servers for most other components of the operating system These servers exist in separate address spaces and rely upon the fast IPC mechanism for communication with the microkernel and other servers br br br History br The core of K is based on the University of Toronto s operating system Tornado K is the university s third generation of research on scalable operating systems Tornado OS on a nuMachine Multiprocessor was the second generation and Hurricane OS on a Hector Multiprocessor was the first generation br br br Features br K supports the Linux PowerPC and application binary interfaces ABIs so most PowerPC Linux binary files can run on K without modification including the relational database DB K has some device drivers implemented specifically for it but it gets most of its hardware support by directly linking in Linux device drivers to a special server br Another goal of the K design is to achieve a customizable and maintainable system Being built with an object oriented programming design it allows applications to customize and thus optimize the OS services required and then on the fly hot swap kernel object implementations This is particularly important for applications such as databases and web servers where the ability to control physical resources can improve performance br br br Open source br The K source is via git br https github com jimix k br br br br br br External links br br Official website from the Internet Archive
