SkyOS Sky Operating System is a discontinued prototype commercial proprietary graphical desktop operating system written for the x computer architecture As of January development was halted with no plans to resume its development In August developer Robert Szeleney announced the release of a public beta on the SkyOS website This allows public users to download a Live CD of the SkyOS operating system for testing and to optionally install the system br br br History br br Development started in with the first version released in December br Up until version x the OS was freely available Starting with beta development of SkyOS in users were required to pay US to get access to beta releases br SkyOS adapted new filesystem SkyFS based on OpenBFS in and its graphics subsystem was improved in with support for desktop compositing including double buffering and transparency The OS also moved to ELF binaries then br The last beta build was released in August and there was no status update for several months br As the OS was mainly the work of one man Robert Szeleney there was increasing difficulty to add new device drivers br Considering lack of development under Robert Szeleney going open source was viewed by the tech press as the best option for SkyOS br Although Szeleney tried to bypass the lack of drivers by using a new kernel based on Linux or NetBSD and reported some progress in this regard development has not resumed br SkyOS website disappeared in and final public build from August was released for free shortly thereafter br br br Features br br br Kernel br SkyOS is a Unix like operating system with a monolithic kernel br The OS supports multiple users and symmetric multiprocessing br br br Graphics and GUI br SkyOS has an integrated graphics subsystem with support for desktop compositing including double buffering and transparency SkyOS GUI also allows system wide mouse gestures br br br SkyFS br SkyFS is a fork of the OpenBFS filesystem br SkyOS can also be run from the following filesystems br br FAT FAT FAT br ISO br br br Fast searching br SkyOS offers real time file content query searches with multiple keywords comparable to Beagle in Linux or Spotlight in macOS including indexing of files and programs br br br Porting applications br Most command line applications that were written to be compiled with the GNU Toolchain can be ported to SkyOS with little or no modification br SkyOS contains several frameworks for creating applications including Mono port Ported applications include Mozilla Firefox Mozilla Thunderbird Nvu GIMP and AbiWord There was also a monetary incentive for porting applications as the SkyOS community voted for desired programs and then supported developers with donations br br br Reception br Although SkyOS includes many interesting features limited application and hardware support are among its weaknesses e g only a few graphics cards allow D acceleration br Kernel and drivers updates were solely worked on by Szeleney and because of this he was unable to keep up with new devices This was one of the reasons the development ended for this project In the end the OS was not able to expand beyond a small albeit dedicated user community Apart from a short early open source time period the OS had a proprietary licence with a commercial model based on paid beta testing This led to some controversy as SkyOS developers were accused of unauthorized use of open source software No proof of any wrongdoing was given but the public image of the OS was tarnished nevertheless br br br See also br List of operating systems br br br br br br External links br SkyOS org The SkyOS Homepage br SkyOS at The SkyOS Homepage Alternative Address br TechIMO SkyOS Developers Interview br Slashdot Walking Through SkyOS Beta br Slashdot Thunderbird and Firefox Ported to SkyOS br OSNews com SkyOS The th Beta and Robert Szeleney br SkyOS archive and downloads br
