Illumos stylized as illumos is a partly free and open source Unix operating system It is based on OpenSolaris which was based on System V Release SVR and the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD Illumos comprises a kernel device drivers system libraries and utility software for system administration This core is now the base for many different open sourced Illumos distributions in a similar way in which the Linux kernel is used in different Linux distributions br The maintainers write illumos in lowercase since some computer fonts do not clearly distinguish a lowercase L from an uppercase i Il see homoglyph The project name is a combination of words illuminare from Latin for to light and OS for Operating System br br br Overview br br Illumos was announced via webinar on Thursday August as a community effort of some core Solaris engineers to create a truly open source Solaris by swapping closed source bits of OpenSolaris with open implementations br The original plan explicitly stated that Illumos would not be a distribution or a fork However after Oracle announced discontinuing OpenSolaris plans were made to fork the final version of the Solaris ON kernel allowing Illumos to evolve into a kernel of its own br As of efforts focused on libc the NFS lock manager the crypto module and many device drivers to create a Solaris like OS with no closed proprietary code As of development emphasis includes transitioning from the historical compiler Studio to GCC The userland software is now built with GNU make and contains many GNU utilities such as GNU tar br Illumos is lightly led by founder Garrett D Amore and other community members developers such as Bryan Cantrill and Adam Leventhal via a Developers Council br The Illumos Foundation has been incorporated in the State of California as a c trade association with founding board members Jason Hoffman formerly at Joyent Evan Powell Nexenta and Garrett D Amore As of August the foundation was in the process of formalizing its by laws and organizational development br At OpenStorage Summit the new logo for Illumos was revealed with official type and branding to follow over br br br Development br Its primary development project illumos gate derives from OS Net aka ON which is a Solaris kernel with the bulk of the drivers core libraries and basic utilities similar to what is delivered by a BSD src tree It was originally dependent on OpenSolaris OS Net but a fork was made after Oracle silently decided to close the development of Solaris and unofficially killed the OpenSolaris project br br br Features br ZFS a combined file system and logical volume manager providing a high level of data integrity for very large storage capacities br Solaris Containers or Zones a low overhead implementation of operating system level virtualization technology for x and SPARC systems br DTrace a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time br Kernel based Virtual Machine KVM a virtualization infrastructure KVM supports native virtualization on processors with hardware virtualization extensions br OpenSolaris Network Virtualization and Resource Control or Crossbow a set of features that provides an internal network virtualization and quality of service including virtual NIC VNIC pseudo network interface technology exclusive ip zones bandwidth management and flow control on a per interface and per VNIC basis br br br Distributions br br Distributions at illumos org br br DilOS with Debian package manager dpkg apt and virtualization support available for x and SPARC br NexentaStor distribution optimized for virtualization storage area networks network attached storage and iSCSI or Fibre Channel applications employing the ZFS file system br OmniOS Community Edition takes a minimalist approach suitable for server use br OpenIndiana a distribution that is a continuation and fork in the spirit of the OpenSolaris operating system br SmartOS a distribution for cloud computing with Kernel based Virtual Machine integration br Tribblix retro style distribution with modern components available for x and SPARC br v os a server only IPS based minimal SPARC distribution br XStreamOS a distribution for infrastructure cloud and web development br Discontinued br br Dyson derived from Debian using libc and SMF init system br OpenSXCE distribution for developers and system administrators for IA x x platforms and SPARC br br br See also br Solaris the ancestor of Illumos br br br br br br External links br Official website br napp it a ZFS web interface for Illumos based NAS or SAN appliances
