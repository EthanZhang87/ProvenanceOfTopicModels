effect immediately As of January the transaction fee for subscription products decreased to for any subscribers developers retain after paid months establishing that unlike what sources were reporting Google is using the same model as Apple with in app subscriptions on the App Store br Google has deals with some companies to pay less fees than the rest of Android app developers br br br Google Play Store on Android br br Google Play Store shortened to Play Store on the Home screen and App screen is Google s official pre installed app store on Android certified devices It provides access to

versions such as Nougat Carriers can also ban certain apps from being installed on users devices for example tethering applications br There is no requirement that Android applications be acquired using the Google Play Store Users may download Android applications from a developer s website or through a third party app store alternative Google Play Store applications are self contained Android Package files APK similar to exe files to install programs on Microsoft Windows computers On Android devices an Unknown sources feature in Settings allows users to bypass the Google Play Store and install APKs from other sources Depending on developer preferences some apps can be installed to a phone s external storage card br In Google decided to rewrite the Play Store app s UI code using Jetpack Compose which was in pre alpha at the time It stated that the existing code was years old and had incurred tremendous tech debt over countless Android platform releases and feature updates br br br Installation history br The Google Play Store app features a history of all installed apps Users can remove apps from the list with the changes also synchronizing to the Google Play website interface where the option to remove apps from the history does not exist br br br Compatibility br Google publishes the source code for Android through its Android Open Source Project allowing enthusiasts and developers to program and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system However not all these modified versions are compatible with apps developed for Google s official Android versions The Android Compatibility Program serves to define a baseline implementation of Android that is compatible with third party apps written by developers Only Android devices that comply with Google s compatibility requirements may install and access the Google Play Store application As stated in a help page for the Android Open Source Project Devices that are Android compatible may participate in the Android ecosystem including Android Market devices that don t meet the compatibility requirements exist outside that ecosystem In other words the Android Compatibility Program is how we separate Android compatible devices from devices that merely run derivatives of the source code We welcome all uses of the Android source code but only Android compatible devices as defined and tested by the Android Compatibility Program may participate in the Android ecosystem br Since August all new and updated Google Play apps must have bit binaries with some exceptions Since August Google Play will not serve apps that only have bit binaries to devices compatible with bit apps This requirement does not apply to Android TV or Wear OS apps br br br Google Play Services br br In Google began decoupling certain aspects of its Android operating system particularly its core applications so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS One of those components Google Play Services is a closed source system level process providing APIs for Google services installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android Froyo and higher With these changes Google can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself As a result Android and Jelly Bean contained relatively fewer user facing changes focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements br br br History of app growth br br br Google Play Awards and yearly lists br In April Google announced the Google Play Awards described as a way to recognize our incredible developer community and highlight some of the best apps and games The awards showcase five nominees across ten award categories and the apps are featured in a dedicated section of Google Play Google stated that Nominees were selected by a panel of experts on the Google Play team based

March Google disclosed that over the past few months it had begun using a combination of automated tools and human reviewers to check apps for malware and terms of service violations before they are published in the Google Play Store At the same time it began rolling out a new age based ratings system for apps and games based on a given region s official ratings authority for example ESRB in most of the Americas and PEGI in Europe br In October Google announced a new detection and filtering system designed to provide additional enhancements to protect the integrity of the store The new system is aimed to detect and filter cases where developers have been attempting to manipulate the placement of their apps through illegitimate means like fraudulent installs fake reviews and incentivized ratings br In April Google announced changes to the store s app review process stating that it would take several days to review app submissions from new and less established developers The company later clarified that in exceptional cases certain apps may be subject to an expanded review process delaying the publication by seven days or longer br In Google imposes strict guidelines for personal loan apps on Play Store from May that make the customer s data vulnerable br br br Application bans br Some mobile carriers can block users from installing certain apps In March reports surfaced that several tethering apps were banned from the store However the apps were later restored with a new ban preventing only T Mobile subscribers from downloading the apps Google released a statement br br On Monday several applications that enable tethering were removed from the Android Market catalog because they were in violation of T Mobile s terms of service in the US Based on Android s Developer Distribution Agreement section we remove applications from the Android Market catalog that violate the terms of service of a carrier or manufacturer br We inadvertently unpublished the applications for all carriers and today we have corrected the problem so that all Android Market users outside the T Mobile US network will now have access to the applications We have notified the affected developers br In April Google removed the Grooveshark app from the store due to unspecified policy violations CNET noted that the removal came after some of the top music labels have accused the service of violating copyright law TechCrunch wrote approximately two weeks later that Grooveshark had returned to Android albeit not through the official App Market but rather Playing on Android s ability to install third party applications through the browser Grooveshark has taken on the responsibility of distributing the application themselves br In May Google banned the account of the developer of several video game emulators Neither Google nor the developer publicly revealed the reason for the ban br In March Google began to pull ad blocking apps from the Google Play Store per section of the developers agreement which prohibits apps that interfere with servers and services br Apps that exempt themselves from power management policies introduced on Android Marshmallow without being adversely affected by them are banned br In July Google banned additional categories of apps including those that perform cryptocurrency mining on device apps that facilitate the sale of explosives firearms ammunition or certain firearms accessories are only used to present ads contain adult content but are aimed towards children multiple apps with highly similar content and user experience and apps that are created by an automated tool wizard service or based on templates and submitted to Google Play by the operator of that service on behalf of other persons br In two Iranian state supported ridesharing apps and three messenger apps were deleted through Play Protect for being malware and spyware br br br Application security br In February Google introduced a new automated antivirus system called Google Bouncer to scan both new and existing apps for malware e g spyware or trojan horses In the Bouncer feature and other safety measures within the Android platform were rebranded under the umbrella name Google Play Protect a system that regularly scans apps for threats br Android apps can ask for or require certain permissions on the device including access to body sensors calendar camera contacts location microphone phone SMS storage Wi Fi and access to Google accounts br In July Google described a new security effort called peer grouping in which apps performing similar functionalities such as calculator apps are grouped together and attributes compared If one app stands out such as requesting more device permissions than others in the same group Google s systems automatically flag the app and security engineers take a closer inspection Peer grouping is based on app descriptions metadata and statistics such as download count br br br Security issues br In early March DroidDream a trojan rootkit exploit was released to the then named Android Market in the form of several free applications that were in many cases pirated versions of existing priced apps This exploit allowed hackers to steal information such as IMEI and IMSI numbers phone model user ID and service provider The exploit also installed a backdoor that allowed the hackers to download more code to the infected device The exploit only affected devices running Android versions earlier than Gingerbread Google removed the apps from the Market immediately after being alerted but the apps had already been downloaded more than times according to Android Police s estimate Android Police wrote that the only method of removing the exploit from an infected device was to reset it to a factory state although community developed solutions for blocking some aspects of the exploit were created A few days later Google confirmed that malicious apps had been uploaded to Android Market and had been downloaded to devices before being removed from the store Google emailed affected users with information that As far as we can determine the only information obtained was device specific IMEI IMSI unique codes which are used to identify mobile devices and the version of Android running on your device as opposed to personal data and account information It also announced the then new remote kill functionality alongside a security update that lets Google remotely remove malicious apps from users devices However days later a malicious version of the security update was found on the Internet though it did not contain the specific DroidDream malware New apps featuring the malware renamed DroidDream Light surfaced the following June and were also removed from the store br At the Black Hat security conference in security firm Trustwave demonstrated their ability to upload an app that would circumvent the Bouncer blocker system The application used a JavaScript exploit to steal contacts SMS messages and photos and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch denial of service attacks Nicholas Percoco senior vice president of Trustwave s SpiderLabs advanced security team stated that We wanted to test the bounds of what it s capable of The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection with Percoco further saying that As an attack all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer Trustwave reached out to Google to share their findings but noted that more manual testing of apps might be necessary to detect apps using malware masking techniques br According to a research study released by RiskIQ a security services company malicious apps introduced through Google Play increased between and while the number of apps removed by Google dropped from in to in The study further revealed that Apps for personalizing Android phones led all categories as most likely to be malicious According to PC World Google said it would need more information about RiskIQ s analysis to comment on the findings br In October Engadget reported about a blog post named Password Storage in Sensitive Apps from freelance Android hacker Jon Sawyer who decided to test the top privacy apps on Google Play Testing two applications one named Hide Pictures Keep Safe Vault and the other named Private Photo Vault Sawyer found significant errors in password handling in both and commented These companies are selling products that claim to securely store your most intimate pieces of data yet are at most snake oil You would have near equal protection just by changing the file extension and renaming the photos br In April security firm Check Point announced that a malware named FalseGuide had been hidden inside approximately game guide apps in Google Play The malware is capable of gaining administrator access to infected devices where it then receives additional modules that let it show popup ads The malware a type of botnet is also capable of launching DDoS attacks After being alerted to the malware Google removed all instances of it in the store but by that time approximately two million Android users had already downloaded the apps the oldest of which had been around since November br In June researchers from the Sophos security company announced their finding of apps using a third party development library that shows intrusive advertisements on users phones Even after such apps are force closed by the user advertisements remain Google removed some of the apps after receiving reports from Sophos but some apps remained When asked for comment Google didn t respond In August apps were removed from Google Play after security firm Lookout discovered that the apps contained an software development kit that allowed for malicious advertising The apps had been collectively downloaded over million times and consisted of a wide variety of use cases including health weather photo editing Internet radio and emoji br In all of over apps were banned from Google Play due to abusive contents this is a increase over the number of apps banned in br In March Check Point discovered apps containing a malware program that had infected a total of million devices The program called Tekya was designed to evade detection by Google Play Protect and VirusTotal and then fraudulently click on ads Around the same time Dr Web discovered at least six apps with total downloads containing at least modifications program called Android Circle In addition to performing click fraud Android Circle can also operate as adware and perform phishing attacks br On July Dr Web discovered malicious apps on Google Play that steal Facebook users logins and passwords Their specialists uncovered trojans that were available on Google Play Store with over million installs among them The apps tricked victims into logging into their Facebook accounts and hijacked the credentials via JavaScript code Google removed these apps later on br On September Zimperium zLabs recently discovered a large scale malware campaign has infected more than million Android devices from over countries and likely stole hundreds of millions from its victims by subscribing to paid services without their knowledge GriftHorse the trojan used in these attacks was discovered by researchers who first spotted this illicit global premium services campaign This campaign has been active for roughly five months between November and April when their malicious apps were last updated The malware was delivered using over trojanized Android applications delivered through Google s official Play Store and third party app stores Google has removed the apps after being notified of their malicious nature but this malware are still available for download on third party repositories br On November ThreatFabric researchers explain how they discovered four different malware dropper campaigns distributing banking trojans on the Google Play Store This evolution includes creating small realistic looking apps that focus on common themes such as fitness cryptocurrency QR codes and PDF scanning to trick users into installing the app Once these dropper apps are installed they will silently communicate with the threat actor s server to receive commands When ready to distribute the banking trojan the threat actor s server will tell the installed app to perform a fake update that drops and launches the malware on the Android device br br br Patent issues br Some developers publishing on Google Play have been sued for patent infringement by patent trolls people who own broad or vaguely worded patents that they use to target small developers If the developer manages to successfully challenge the initial assertion the patent troll changes the claim of the violation in order to accuse the developer of having violated a different assertion in the patent This situation continues until the case goes into the legal system which can have substantial economic costs prompting some developers to settle In February Austin Meyer a flight simulator game developer was sued for having used a copy protection system in his app a system that he said Google gave us And of course this is what Google provides to everyone else that is making a game for Android Meyer claimed that Google would not assist in the lawsuit and he stated that he would not settle the case His battle with the troll continued for several years uploading a video in June discussing that he was then being sued for uploading his app to Google Play because the patent troll apparently owns the idea sic of the Google Play Store itself Android Authority wrote that This scenario has played out against many other app developers for many years and have prompted discussions over a larger issue at stake in which developers stop making apps out of fear of patent problems br br br Availability br Users outside the countries regions listed below only have access to free apps and games through Google Play br br br See also br
