strategy showing up late for functions staying silent when a response is expected Such behavior is sometimes protested by associates evoking exasperation or confusion People who are recipients of passive aggressive behavior may experience anxiety due to the discordance between what they perceive and what the perpetrator is saying br br br Application br br br Psychology br br In psychology passive aggression is one of the most misused psychological terms After some debate the American Psychiatric Association dropped it from the list of personality disorders in the DSM IV as too narrow to be a full blown diagnosis and not well enough supported by scientific evidence to meet increasingly rigorous standards of definition Culturally the ambiguous passive aggressive label is misused by laypersons and professionals alike The removal of the passive aggressive personality definition from the official diagnostic manual was in large measure because of the frequent misapplication and because of the often contradictory and unclear descriptions clinicians in the field provided Most of the definitions which follow which had previously been classified as passive aggressive are often more correctly described as overt aggression or covert aggression which is the correct definition to describe subtle deliberate calculating and underhanded tactics that manipulators and other disturbed characters use to intimidate control deceive and abuse others br The outdated definition rejected by the American Psychiatric Association is as follows Passive aggressive behavior is characterized by a habitual pattern of non active resistance to expected work requirements opposition sullenness stubbornness and negative attitudes in response to requirements for normal performance levels expected by others Most frequently it occurs in the workplace where resistance is exhibited by indirect behaviors such as procrastination forgetfulness and purposeful inefficiency especially in reaction to demands by authority figures but it can also occur in interpersonal contexts br Another source characterizes passive aggressive behavior as A personality trait marked by a pervasive pattern of negative attitudes and characterized by passive sometimes obstructionist resistance to complying with expectations in interpersonal or occupational situations Behaviors such as learned helplessness procrastination stubbornness resentment sullenness or deliberate repeated failure to accomplish requested tasks for which one is often explicitly responsible br br br Conflict theory br In conflict theory passive aggressive behavior can resemble a behavior better described as catty as it consists of deliberate active but carefully veiled hostile acts which are distinctively different in character from the non assertive style of passive resistance br br br Work br br Passive aggressive behavior from workers and managers is damaging to team unity and productivity In an ad for Warner s online ebook it says The worst case of passive aggressive behavior involves destructive attitudes such as negativity sullenness resentment procrastination forgetting to do something chronic lateness and intentional inefficiency If this behavior is ignored it could result in decreased office efficiency and frustration among workers If managers are passive aggressive in their behavior it can end up stifling team creativity Paula De Angelis says It would actually make perfect sense that those promoted to leadership positions might often be those who on the surface appear to be agreeable diplomatic and supportive yet who are actually dishonest backstabbing saboteurs behind the scenes br br br History br Passive aggressive behavior was first defined clinically by Colonel William C Menninger during World War II in the context of men s reaction to military compliance Menninger described soldiers who were not openly defiant but expressed their civil disobedience what he called aggressiveness by passive measures such as pouting stubbornness procrastination inefficiency and passive obstructionism due to what Menninger saw as an immaturity and a reaction to routine military stress br According to some psychoanalytic views noncompliance is not indicative of true passive aggressive behavior which may instead be defined as the manifestation of emotions that have been repressed based on a self imposed need for acceptance br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br Kantor Martin Passive aggression a guide for the therapist the patient and the victim Westport
