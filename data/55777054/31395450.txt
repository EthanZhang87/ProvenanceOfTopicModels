Actually Free which was modeled after the Kindle Unlimited program Apps in the program were offered at no charge to users with Amazon paying revenue to developers based on per minute usage of the apps by end users By contrast developers did not receive any revenue for apps offered under the previous free app promotions The Actually Free collection was accessible via a section of Amazon Appstore on

the US based website Amazon com br br br Reception br Shortly after the Amazon Appstore launch the International Game Developers Association IGDA published an open letter expressing concerns that were primarily aimed at Amazon s distribution terms The main concerns about the conditions were that Appstore terms force developers to permanently lower their Appstore prices if ever they do promotions on other stores and that Amazon could choose to lower the price of an application while deciding to reduce the developer s share without having to ask permission Following this address Amazon clarified the Appstore developer agreement but this did not assuage the IGDA s concerns which declared that Amazon s terms represent a threat to game developers br In July the Swedish developer Bithack pulled its Apparatus application from the Appstore and published an open letter explaining that the store was a disaster for indie developers The main problems related to the very slow review process the absence of any means to filter unsupported devices and that Amazon changed the price of the application without consulting the developer leading to the IGDA reiterating its warnings concerning Amazon s policy once again br br br Accusation of trademark infringement by Apple br br Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon for using a similar name to the Apple App Store Amazon claimed that the term was too generic to be trademarked and asked the judge to dismiss the suit Apple responded to Amazon s attempted dismissal of the lawsuit by claiming that Amazon was tarnishing the trademark by using the name A federal judge denied Apple s request for a preliminary injunction disagreeing with Amazon s claim that the term is generic and citing that Apple had not established a likelihood of confusion with Amazon s services to obtain an injunction Apple changed its complaint after Amazon started advertising the Kindle Fire now saying that Amazon is trying to confuse customers further by dropping the for Android part of Amazon Appstore for Android In the amended complaint Apple wrote that Amazon s use is also likely to lessen the goodwill associated with Apple s App Store service and Apple products designed to utilize Apple s App Store service by associating Apple s App Store service with the inferior qualities of Amazon s service br In January Apple s claims were rejected by a US District judge who argued that the company presented no evidence that Amazon had attempted to mimic Apple s site or advertising or communicated that its service possesses the characteristics and qualities that the public has come to expect from the Apple APP STORE and or Apple products In July Apple dropped the case br br br See also br List of mobile app distribution platforms br Google Play
