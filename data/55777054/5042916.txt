Canada is a country in North America Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean making it the world s second largest country by total area with the world s longest coastline Its border with the United States is the world s longest international land border The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions It is a sparsely inhabited country of million people the vast majority residing south of the th parallel in urban areas Canada s capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto Montreal and Vancouver br Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years Beginning in the th century British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast As a consequence of various armed conflicts France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in In with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom highlighted by the Statute of Westminster and culminating in the Canada Act which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom br Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition The country s head of government is the prime minister who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons and is called upon by the governor general representing the monarch of Canada the ceremonial head of state The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual English and French in the federal jurisdiction It is very highly ranked in international measurements of government transparency quality of life economic competitiveness innovation education and gender equality It is one of the world s most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations the product of large scale immigration Canada s long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its history economy and culture br A developed country Canada has a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well developed international trade networks Recognized as a middle power Canada s strong support for multilateralism and internationalism has been closely related to its foreign relations policies of peacekeeping and aid for developing countries Canada is part of multiple international organizations and forums br br br Etymology br br While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of Canada the name is now accepted as coming from the St Lawrence Iroquoian word kanata meaning village or settlement In Indigenous inhabitants of the present day Quebec City region used the word to direct French explorer Jacques Cartier to the village of Stadacona Cartier later used the word Canada to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to Donnacona the chief at Stadacona by European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the Saint Lawrence River as Canada br From the th to the early th century Canada referred to the part of New France that lay along the Saint Lawrence River In the area became two British colonies called Upper Canada and Lower Canada These two colonies were collectively named the Canadas until their union as the British Province of Canada in br Upon Confederation in Canada was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the London Conference and the word dominion was conferred as the country s title By the s the term Dominion of Canada was no longer used by the United Kingdom which considered Canada a realm of the Commonwealth br The Canada Act which brought the Constitution of Canada fully under Canadian control referred only to Canada Later that year the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to Canada Day br br br History br br br Indigenous peoples br The first inhabitants of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia by way of the Bering land bridge and arrived at least years ago The Paleo Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada The characteristics of Indigenous societies included permanent settlements agriculture complex societal hierarchies and trading networks Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late th and early th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations Indigenous peoples in present day Canada include the First Nations Inuit and M tis the last being of mixed descent who originated in the mid th century when First Nations people married European settlers and subsequently developed their own identity br The Indigenous population at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between and two million with a figure of accepted by Canada s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples As a consequence of European colonization the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent and several First Nations such as the Beothuk disappeared The decline is attributed to several causes including the transfer of European diseases such as influenza measles and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity conflicts over the fur trade conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations self sufficiency br Although not without conflict European Canadians early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful First Nations and M tis peoples played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada particularly for their role in assisting European coureurs des bois and voyageurs in their explorations of the continent during the North American fur trade These early European interactions with First Nations would change from friendship and peace treaties to the dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties From the late th century European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society These attempts reached a climax in the late th and early th centuries with forced integration through state funded boarding schools health care segregation and displacement A period of redress began with the formation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada by the Government of Canada in This included recognition of past cultural genocide settlement agreements and betterment of racial discrimination issues such as addressing the plight of missing and murdered Indigenous women br br br European colonization br br It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was Norse explorer Leif Erikson In approximately AD the Norse built a small short lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps years at L Anse aux Meadows on the northern tip of Newfoundland No further European exploration occurred until when seafarer John Cabot explored and claimed Canada s Atlantic coast in the name of Henry VII of England In French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the Gulf of Saint Lawrence where on July he planted a metre ft cross bearing the words long live the King of France and took possession of the territory New France in the name of King Francis I The early th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the Basque and Portuguese establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast In general early settlements during the Age of Discovery appear to have been short lived due to a combination of the harsh climate problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia br In Sir Humphrey Gilbert by the royal prerogative of Queen Elizabeth I founded St John s Newfoundland as the first North American English seasonal camp In the French established their first seasonal trading post at Tadoussac along the Saint Lawrence French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in and established the first permanent year round European settlements at Port Royal in and Quebec City in Among the colonists of New France Canadiens extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and Acadians settled the present day Maritimes while fur traders and Catholic missionaries explored the Great Lakes Hudson Bay and the Mississippi watershed to Louisiana The Beaver Wars broke out in the mid th century over control of the North American fur trade br The English established additional settlements in Newfoundland in along with settlements in the Thirteen Colonies to the south A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between and the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years War Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in after the Seven Years War br br br British North America br br The Royal Proclamation of established First Nation treaty rights created the Province of Quebec out of New France and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia St John s Island now Prince Edward Island became a separate colony in To avert conflict in Quebec the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act expanding Quebec s territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley More importantly the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule It re established the French language Catholic faith and French civil law there staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies further fuelling anti British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution br After the successful American War of Independence the Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the newly formed United States and set the terms of peace ceding British North American territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country The American war of independence also caused a large out migration of Loyalists the settlers who had fought against American independence Many moved to Canada particularly Atlantic Canada where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories New Brunswick was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes which led to the incorporation of Saint John New Brunswick as Canada s first city To accommodate the influx of English speaking Loyalists in Central Canada the Constitutional Act of divided the province of Canada into French speaking Lower Canada later Quebec and English speaking Upper Canada later Ontario granting each its own elected legislative assembly br br The Canadas were the main front in the War of between the United States and the United Kingdom Peace came in no boundaries were changed Immigration resumed at a higher level with over arrivals from Britain between and New arrivals included refugees escaping the Great Irish Famine as well as Gaelic speaking Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances Infectious diseases killed between and percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before br The desire for responsible government resulted in the abortive Rebellions of The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in ended the Oregon boundary dispute extending the border westward along the th parallel This paved the way for British colonies on Vancouver Island and in British Columbia The Anglo Russian Treaty of Saint Petersburg established the border along the Pacific coast but even after the US Alaska Purchase of disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska Yukon and Alaska BC border br br br Confederation and expansion br br Following three constitutional conferences the British North America Act officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July initially with four provinces Ontario Quebec Nova Scotia and New Brunswick Canada assumed control of Rupert s Land and the North Western Territory to form the Northwest Territories where the M tis grievances ignited the Red River Rebellion and the creation of the province of Manitoba in July British Columbia and Vancouver Island which had been united in joined the confederation in on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within years while Prince Edward Island joined in In during the Klondike Gold Rush in the Northwest Territories Parliament created the Yukon Territory Alberta and Saskatchewan became provinces in Between and almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US br To open the West and encourage European immigration the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways including the Canadian Pacific Railway passed the Dominion Lands Act to regulate settlement and established the North West Mounted Police to assert authority over the territory This period of westward expansion and nation building resulted in the displacement of many Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies to Indian reserves clearing the way for ethnic European block settlements This caused the collapse of the Plains Bison in western Canada and the introduction of European cattle farms and wheat fields dominating the land The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands The federal government did provide emergency relief on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves During this time Canada introduced the Indian Act extending its control over the First Nations to education government and legal rights br br br Early th century br br Because Britain still maintained control of Canada s foreign affairs under the British North America Act its declaration of war in automatically brought Canada into the First World War Volunteers sent to the Western Front later became part of the Canadian Corps which played a substantial role in the Battle of Vimy Ridge and other major engagements of the war Out of approximately Canadians who served in the First World War some were killed and another were wounded The Conscription Crisis of erupted when the Unionist Cabinet s proposal to augment the military s dwindling number of active members with conscription was met with vehement objections from French speaking Quebecers The Military Service Act brought in compulsory military service though it coupled with disputes over French language schools outside Quebec deeply alienated Francophone Canadians and temporarily split the Liberal Party In Canada joined the League of Nations independently of Britain and the Statute of Westminster affirmed Canada s independence br The Great Depression in Canada during the early s saw an economic downturn leading to hardship across the country In response to the downturn the Co operative Commonwealth Federation CCF in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a welfare state as pioneered by Tommy Douglas in the s and s On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King war with Germany was declared effective September by King George VI seven days after the United Kingdom The delay underscored Canada s independence br The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December In all over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the Second World War and approximately were killed and another were wounded Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war including the failed Dieppe Raid the Allied invasion of Italy the Normandy landings the Battle of Normandy and the Battle of the Scheldt in Canada provided asylum for the Dutch monarchy while that country was occupied and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to its liberation from Nazi Germany br The Canadian economy boomed during the war as its industries manufactured military materiel for Canada Britain China and the Soviet Union Despite another Conscription Crisis in Quebec in Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy br br br Contemporary era br The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the Dominion of Newfoundland to relinquish responsible government in and become a Crown colony ruled by a British governor After two referendums Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in as a province br Canada s post war economic growth combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments led to the emergence of a new Canadian identity marked by the adoption of the maple leaf flag in the implementation of official bilingualism English and French in and the institution of official multiculturalism in Socially democratic programs were also instituted such as Medicare the Canada Pension Plan and Canada Student Loans though provincial governments particularly Quebec and Alberta opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions br br Finally another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the Canada Act the patriation of Canada s constitution from the United Kingdom concurrent with the creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under its own monarchy In Nunavut became Canada s third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government br At the same time Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the Quiet Revolution of the s giving birth to a secular nationalist movement The radical Front de lib ration du Qu bec FLQ ignited the October Crisis with a series of bombings and kidnappings in and the sovereigntist Parti Qu b cois was elected in organizing an unsuccessful referendum on sovereignty association in Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the Meech Lake Accord failed in This led to the formation of the Bloc Qu b cois in Quebec and the invigoration of the Reform Party of Canada in the West A second referendum followed in in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of to percent In the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession by a province would be unconstitutional and the Clarity Act was passed by Parliament outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation br In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late s and early s These included the explosion of Air India Flight in the largest mass murder in Canadian history the cole Polytechnique massacre in a university shooting targeting female students and the Oka Crisis of the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups Canada joined the Gulf War in and was active in several peacekeeping missions in the s including operations in the Balkans during and after the Yugoslav Wars and in Somalia resulting in an incident that has been described as the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military Canada sent troops to Afghanistan in resulting in the largest amount of Canadian deaths for any single military mission since the Korean War in the early s br In Canadian forces participated in the NATO led intervention into the Libyan Civil War and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid s The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in three years before the COVID pandemic in Canada began on January with widespread social and economic disruption In the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from to these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro Canadian culture br br br Geography br br By total area including its waters Canada is the second largest country in the world after Russia By land area alone Canada ranks fourth due to having the world s largest area of fresh water lakes Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east along the Arctic Ocean to the north and to the Pacific Ocean in the west the country encompasses km sq mi of territory Canada also has vast maritime terrain with the world s longest coastline of kilometres mi In addition to sharing the world s largest land border with the United States spanning km mi Canada shares a land border with Greenland and hence the Kingdom of Denmark to the northeast on Hans Island and a maritime boundary with France s overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast Canada is also home to the world s northernmost settlement Canadian Forces Station Alert on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island latitude N which lies kilometres mi from the North Pole br Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions the Canadian Shield the interior plains the Great Lakes St Lawrence Lowlands the Appalachian region the Western Cordillera Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Arctic Archipelago Boreal forests prevail throughout the country ice is prominent in northern Arctic regions and through the Rocky Mountains and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture The Great Lakes feed the St Lawrence River in the southeast where the lowlands host much of Canada s economic output Canada has over lakes of which are larger than km sq mi containing much of the world s fresh water There are also fresh water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera Canada is geologically active having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes br br br Climate br br Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada vary from region to region Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces which experience a continental climate where daily average temperatures are near C F but can drop below C F with severe wind chills In non coastal regions snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year while in parts of the north snow can persist year round Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate with a mild and rainy winter On the east and west coasts average high temperatures are generally in the low s C s F while between the coasts the average summer high temperature ranges from to C to F with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding C F br Much of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada Canada s annual average temperature over land has risen by C F with changes ranging from to C to F in various regions since The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies In the southern regions of Canada air pollution from both Canada and the United States caused by metal smelting burning coal to power utilities and vehicle emissions has resulted in acid rain which has severely impacted waterways forest growth and agricultural productivity Canada is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitter globally with emissions increased by percent between and br br br Biodiversity br br Canada is divided into terrestrial and five marine ecozones These ecozones encompass over classified species of Canadian wildlife with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries due to human activities invasive species and environmental issues in the country there are currently more than species at risk of being lost About percent of Canada s resident species are considered Secure Over half of Canada s landscape is intact and relatively free of human development The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth with approximately km sq mi undisturbed by roads cities or industry Since the end of the last glacial period Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions with percent of its land area covered by forests approximately percent of the world s forested land br Approximately percent of the nation s landmass and freshwater are conservation areas including percent designated as protected areas Approximately percent of its territorial waters are conserved including percent designated as protected areas Canada s first National Park Banff National Park established in spans square kilometres sq

protected area spanning roughly square kilometres sq mi Canada s largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area which spans square kilometres sq mi br br br Government and politics br br Canada is described as a full democracy with a tradition of liberalism and an egalitarian moderate political ideology An emphasis on social justice has been a distinguishing element of Canada s political culture Peace order and good government alongside an Implied Bill of Rights are founding principles of the Canadian government br At the federal level Canada has been dominated by two relatively centrist parties practising brokerage politics the centre left leaning Liberal Party of Canada and the centre right leaning Conservative Party of Canada or its predecessors The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale Five parties had representatives elected to the Parliament in the election the Liberals who formed a minority government the Conservatives who became the Official Opposition the New Democratic Party occupying the left the Bloc Qu b cois and the Green Party of Canada Far right and far left politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society br Canada has a parliamentary system within the context of a constitutional monarchy the monarchy of Canada being the foundation of the executive legislative and judicial branches The reigning monarch is also monarch of other Commonwealth countries though all are sovereign of one another and each of Canada s provinces To carry out most of their federal royal duties in Canada the monarch appoints a representative the governor general on the advice of the prime minister br br The monarchy is the source of sovereignty and authority in Canada However while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial advice in certain rare crisis situations the use of the executive powers or royal prerogative is otherwise always directed by the Cabinet a committee of ministers of the Crown responsible to the elected House of Commons and chosen and headed by the prime minister the head of government To ensure the stability of government the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the individual who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a majority of members in the House of Commons The Prime Minister s Office PMO is thus one of the most powerful institutions in government initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown besides the aforementioned the governor general lieutenant governors senators federal court judges and heads of Crown corporations and government agencies The leader of the party with the second most seats usually becomes the leader of the Official Opposition and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check br br The Parliament of Canada passes all statute laws within the federal sphere It comprises the monarch the House of Commons and the Senate While Canada inherited the British concept of parliamentary supremacy this was later with the enactment of the Constitution Act all but completely superseded by the American notion of the supremacy of the law br Each of the members of Parliament in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding The Constitution Act requires that no more than five years pass between elections although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October general elections still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost confidence vote in the House The members of the Senate whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis serve until age br Canadian federalism divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the provinces Provincial legislatures are unicameral and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons Canada s three territories also have legislatures but these are not sovereign and have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces The territorial legislatures also differ structurally from their provincial counterparts br br br Law br br The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions The Constitution Act known as the British North America Act prior to affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments The Statute of Westminster granted full autonomy and the Constitution Act ended all legislative ties to Britain as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms The Charter guarantees basic rights and freedoms that usually cannot be over ridden by any government though a notwithstanding clause allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the Charter for a period of five years br br Canada s judiciary plays an important role in interpreting laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court final arbiter and has been led since December by Richard Wagner the Chief Justice of Canada The governor general appoints the court s nine members on the advice of the prime minister and minister of justice The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions br Common law prevails everywhere except in Quebec where civil law predominates Criminal law is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada Law enforcement including criminal courts is officially a provincial responsibility conducted by provincial and municipal police forces In most rural and some urban areas policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police br Canadian Aboriginal law provides certain constitutionally recognized rights to land and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by section of the Constitution Act These rights may include provision of services such as healthcare through the Indian Health Transfer Policy and exemption from taxation br br br Provinces and territories br br Canada is a federation composed of federated states called provinces and three federal territories In turn these may be grouped into four main regions Western Canada Central Canada Atlantic Canada and Northern Canada Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare education and welfare as well as administration of justice but not criminal law Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces br The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown and power and authority from the Constitution Act whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the Parliament of Canada and the commissioners represent the King in his federal Council rather than the monarch directly The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively and any changes to that arrangement require a constitutional amendment while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada br br br Foreign relations br br Canada is recognized as a middle power for its role in global affairs with a tendency to pursue multilateral and international solutions Canada is known for its strong commitment to international peace and security as well as being a mediator in conflicts and for providing aid to developing countries The Canadian Security Intelligence Service CSIS is tasked with gathering and analyzing intelligence to prevent threats such as terrorism espionage and foreign interference while the Communications Security Establishment CSE is focused on cyber security and protecting Canada s digital infrastructure br Canada and the United States have a long complex and intertwined relationship they are close allies co operating regularly on military campaigns and humanitarian efforts Canada also maintains historic and traditional ties to the United Kingdom and to France along with both countries former colonies through its membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie Canada is noted for having a positive relationship with the Netherlands owing in part to its contribution to the Dutch liberation during the Second World War Canada has diplomatic and consular offices in over locations in approximately foreign countries br Canada is a member of various international organizations and forums Canada was a founding member of the United Nations in and formed the North American Aerospace Defense Command together with the United States in The country has membership in the World Trade Organization the Five Eyes the G and the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD The country joined the Organization of American States OAS in and seeks to expand its ties to Pacific Rim economies through membership in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum APEC Canada ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in and seven principal UN human rights conventions and covenants since then br br br Military and peacekeeping br br Alongside many domestic obligations more than Canadian Armed Forces CAF personnel are currently deployed in multiple foreign military operations The Canadian unified forces comprise the Royal Canadian Navy Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force The nation employs a professional volunteer force of approximately active personnel and reserve personnel increasing to and respectively under Strong Secure Engaged with a sub component of approximately Canadian Rangers In Canada s military expenditure totalled approximately billion or around percent of the country s gross domestic product GDP placing it th for military expenditure by country br Canada s role in developing peacekeeping and its participation in major peacekeeping initiatives during the th century has played a major role in its positive global image The notion of peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from its closest ally the United States Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations such as the Vietnam War or the invasion of Iraq Since the st century Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN sanctioned military operations through NATO rather than directly through the UN The change to participation via NATO has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties br br br Economy br br Canada has a highly developed mixed market economy with the world s ninth largest economy as of and a nominal GDP of approximately US trillion It is one of the world s largest trading nations with a highly globalized economy In Canadian trade in goods and services reached trillion Canada s exports totalled over billion while its imported goods were worth over billion of which approximately billion originated from the United States In Canada had a trade deficit in goods of billion and a trade deficit in services of billion The Toronto Stock Exchange is the ninth largest stock exchange in the world by market capitalization listing over companies with

th in Canada s economy ranks above most Western nations on The Heritage Foundation s Index of Economic Freedom and experiences a relatively low level of income disparity The country s average household disposable income per capita is well above the OECD average Canada ranks among the lowest of the most developed countries for housing affordability and foreign direct investment br Since the early th century the growth of Canada s manufacturing mining and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an urbanized industrial one The Canadian economy is dominated by the service industry which employs about three quarters of the country s workforce Canada has an unusually important primary sector of which the forestry and petroleum industries are the most prominent components Many towns in northern Canada where agriculture is difficult are sustained by nearby mines or sources of timber br br Canada s economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since the Second World War The Canada United States Free Trade Agreement FTA of eliminated tariffs between the two countries while the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA
