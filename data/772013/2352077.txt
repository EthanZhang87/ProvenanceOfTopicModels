title: Daytime running lamp
id: 2352077
A daytime running lamp DRL also daytime running light is an automotive lighting and bicycle lighting device on the front of a roadgoing motor vehicle or bicycle automatically switched on when the vehicle s handbrake has been pulled down when the vehicle is in gear or when the engine is started emitting white yellow or amber light Their intended use is not to help the driver see the road or their surroundings but to help other road users identify an active vehicle br br br Implementations br br Depending on prevailing regulations and equipment vehicles may implement the daytime running light function by functionally turning on specific lamps by operating low beam headlamps or fog lamps at full or reduced intensity by operating high beam headlamps at reduced intensity or by steady burning operation of the front turn signals Compared to any mode of headlamp operation to produce the daytime running light functionally dedicated DRLs maximize the potential benefits in safety performance glare motorcycle masking and other potential drawbacks br br br Usage br A daytime running lamp is usually automatically switched on once the ignition is on other vehicles may switch the daytime running lamps on when the parking brake is released or when the vehicle is shifted into gear A daytime running lamp emits a brighter light when the headlamps are not turned on and its brightness will be dimmed slightly in conjunction with the headlamps being turned on br br br Safety performance br A study by the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration analysed the effect of DRLs on frontal and side on crashes between two vehicles and on vehicle collisions with pedestrians cyclists and motorcyclists The analysis determined that DRLs offer no statistically significant reduction in the frequency or severity of the collisions studied except for a reduction in light trucks and vans involvement in two vehicle crashes by a statistically significant br br br Effect of ambient light br The daytime running light was first mandated and safety benefits first perceived in Scandinavian countries where it is persistently dark during the winter season As ambient light levels increase the potential safety benefit decreases while the DRL intensity required for a safety improvement increases The safety benefit produced by DRLs in relatively dark Nordic countries is roughly triple the benefit observed in the relatively bright United States br br br Effect on motorcycle safety br A number of motorcycling advocacy groups are concerned over reduced motorcycle conspicuity and increased vulnerability with the introduction of headlamp based DRLs on cars and other dual track vehicles since it means motorcycles are no longer the only vehicles displaying headlamps during the day Some researchers have suggested that amber DRLs be reserved for use exclusively on motorcycles in countries where amber is not presently a permissible color for DRLs on any vehicles while other research has concluded there is a safety disadvantage to two mm x candela cd DRLs on motorcycles in comparison to one mm x cd dipped low beam headlight The latter result suggests that a daytime running lamp s luminous area may have an important influence on its effectiveness br br br Environmental impact br br DRL power consumption varies widely depending on the implementation Current production DRL systems consume from watts dedicated LED system to over W headlamps and all parking tail and marker lights on International regulators primarily in Europe are working to balance the potential safety benefit offered by DRL with the increased fuel consumption due to their use Because the power to run the DRLs must be produced by the engine which in turn requires burning additional fuel high power DRL systems increase CO emissions sufficiently to affect a country s compliance with the Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas emissions For that reason low power solutions are being encouraged and headlamp based systems are not allowed after DRLs became mandatory in Europe at the beginning of LEDs and low power high efficacy long life light bulbs produce appropriate amounts of light for an effective DRL without significantly increasing fuel consumption or emissions Fuel consumption reductions of up to mpg may be found when comparing a W DRL system to a W DRL system In the UK s Department of Transport also found significant reductions in emissions and fuel consumption when comparing a W DRL system to a W full headlight DRL systems DRL fuel consumption can be reduced to insignificant levels by the use of to W DRL systems based on LEDs or high efficacy filament bulbs br br br Worldwide br br br Europe br br br European Union br br European Union Directive EC required all passenger cars and small delivery vans first type approved on or after February in the EU to come equipped with daytime running lights European Union Directive EC ended validity on October implicitly repealed by the replacement Regulation EC No The mandate was extended to trucks and buses in August Using headlamps or front turn signals or fog lamps as DRLs is not permitted the EU Directive requires functionally specific daytime running lamps compliant with ECE Regulation and mounted to the vehicle in accordance with ECE Regulation DRLs compliant with R emit white light on an axis of between and candela with an apparent surface of cm to cm with an additional requirement of between and candela in a defined field br In the past Germany Spain France and other European countries have encouraged or required daytime use of low beam headlamps on certain roads at certain times of year Ireland encourages the use of low beam headlights during the winter Italy and Hungary require daytime running lamps outside populated areas and Bulgaria Czech Republic Estonia Kosovo Latvia Lithuania North Macedonia Montenegro Poland Romania Serbia Slovakia and Slovenia require the use of full or reduced voltage low beam headlights at all times Whether this requirement is met by the DRLs required on new cars since February is a matter of individual countries laws br br br Nordic countries br br DRLs were first mandated in the Nordic countries where ambient light levels in the winter are generally low even during the day Sweden was the first country to require widespread DRLs in At the time the function was known as varselljus perception light or notice light The initial regulations in these countries favored devices incorporating W signal bulbs identical to those used in brake lamps and turn signals producing yellow or white light of approximately to cd on a axis mounted at the outer left and right edges of the front of the vehicle Finland adopted a daytime light requirement in on rural roads in wintertime and in on rural roads in summertime and on all roads all year long Norway in Iceland in and Denmark in To increase manufacturer flexibility in complying with the requirement for DRLs the daytime illumination of low beam headlights was added as an optional implementation Given the headlamp specifications in use in those countries such an implementation would produce approximately cd axially br br br United Kingdom br UK regulations briefly required vehicles first used on or after April to be equipped with a dim dip device br or functionally dedicated daytime running lamps except those vehicles type approved to ECE Regulation regarding installation of lighting equipment this exception was made because ECE R did not require dim dip or daytime running lights and while countries signatory to the ECE Regulations are permitted to maintain their own national regulations as an option to the ECE regulations they are not permitted to bar vehicles approved under the ECE regulations The dim dip system operated the low beam headlamps called dipped beam in the UK at between and of normal low beam intensity The running lamps permitted as an alternative to dim dip were required to emit at least cd straight ahead and no more than cd in any direction In practice most vehicles were equipped with the dim dip option rather than the running lamps br The dim dip lights were not intended for use as daytime running lights Rather they operated when the engine was running and the driver switched on the front position parking lamps Dim dip was intended to provide a nighttime town beam with intensity between that of the parking lamps commonly used at the time by British drivers in city traffic after dark and low beam headlamps the former were considered insufficiently intense to provide improved conspicuity in conditions requiring it while the latter were considered too glaring for safe use in built up areas The UK was the only country to require such dim dip systems though vehicles so equipped were sold in other Commonwealth countries with left hand traffic br In the European Commission successfully prosecuted the UK government in the European Court of Justice arguing that the UK requirement for dim dip was illegal under EC directives prohibiting member states from enacting vehicle lighting requirements not contained in pan European EC directives As a result the UK requirement for dim dip was quashed Nevertheless dim dip systems remain permitted and while such systems are not presently as common as they once were dim dip functionality was fitted on many new cars such as the Volkswagen Polo well into the s br br br Canada br br Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard requires DRLs on all new vehicles made or imported after January Canada s proposed DRL regulation was essentially similar to regulations in place in Scandinavia with an axial luminous intensity limit of cd but automakers claimed it was too expensive to add a new front lighting device and would increase warranty costs due to increased bulb replacements to run the low beams After a regulatory battle the standard was rewritten to permit the use of reduced voltage high beam headlamps producing up to axial candela as well as permitting any light color from white to amber or selective yellow These changes to the regulation permitted automakers to implement a less costly DRL such as by connecting the high beam filaments in series to supply each filament with half its rated voltage or by burning the front turn signals full time except when they are actually flashing as turn indicators br br br United States br Shortly after Canada mandated DRLs General Motors interested in reducing the build variations of cars for the North American market petitioned the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in to permit but not require US vehicles to be equipped with DRLs like those in Canada NHTSA objected on grounds of the potential for high intensity DRLs to cause problems such as glare and turn signal masking and issued a proposed rule in that specified a maximum intensity of cd Industry and safety watchdogs reacted to the proposed rule and eventually the glare objections were set aside and most of the same types of DRLs allowed in Canada were permitted but not required effective with the model year General Motors immediately equipped most and in following years all of its vehicles with DRLs beginning with the Chevrolet Corsica Saab Volkswagen Volvo Suzuki and Subaru gradually introduced DRLs in the U S market beginning in In recent years Lexus has installed high beam or turn signal based DRLs on US models Some Toyota models come with DRLs as standard or optional equipment and with a driver controllable on and off switch Starting in the model year Honda began equipping their U S models with DRLs mostly by reduced intensity operation of the high beam headlamps br Public reaction to DRLs generally neutral to positive in Canada is decidedly mixed in the U S Thousands of complaints regarding glare from DRLs were lodged with the DOT shortly after DRLs were permitted on cars and there was also concern that headlamp based DRLs reduce the conspicuity of motorcycles and that DRLs based on front turn signals introduce ambiguity into the turn signal system In in response to these complaints and after measuring actual DRL intensity well above the cd limit on vehicles in use DOT proposed changes to the DRL specification that would have capped axial intensity at cd a level equivalent to the European cd and identical to the initially proposed Canadian limit During the open comment period a volume of public comments were received by NHTSA in support of lowering the intensity or advocating the complete elimination of DRLs from U S roads Automaker sentiment generally ran along consistent lines with European automakers experienced at complying with European DRL requirements voicing no objection to the proposal and North American automakers repeating the same objections they raised in response to Canada s initial cd proposal The NHTSA proposal for DRL intensity reduction was rescinded in pending agency review and decision on a petition filed in by General Motors seeking to have NHTSA mandate DRLs on all U S vehicles The GM petition was denied by the NHTSA in on grounds of severe methodological and analytical flaws in the studies and data provided by GM as evidence for a safety benefit to DRLs In denying the petition the NHTSA said br br the agency remains neutral with respect to a policy regarding the inclusion of DRLs in vehicles we do not find data that provides a definitive safety benefit that justifies Federal regulation manufacturers should continue to make individual decisions regarding DRLs in their vehicles br Several states on the Eastern seaboard the Southeast Gulf Coast and California have laws that require headlights to be switched on when windshield wipers are in use DRLs are not considered headlights in most vehicle codes and so DRLs may not meet the letter of these laws in use br br br Australia br DRLs are permitted but not required in Australia though the Australian College of Road Safety an Australian automotive safety group advocates making DRLs mandatory rather than optional br br br See
