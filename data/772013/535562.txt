title: Bumper (car)
id: 535562
A bumper is a structure attached to or integrated with the front and rear ends of a motor vehicle to absorb impact in a minor collision ideally minimizing repair costs Stiff metal bumpers appeared on automobiles as early as that had a mainly ornamental function Numerous developments improvements in materials and technologies as well as greater focus on functionality for protecting vehicle components and improving safety have changed bumpers over the years Bumpers ideally minimize height mismatches between vehicles and protect pedestrians from injury Regulatory measures have been enacted to reduce vehicle repair costs and more recently impact on pedestrians br br br History br Bumpers were at first just rigid metal bars George Albert Lyon invented the earliest car bumper The first bumper appeared on a vehicle in and Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau Fabriksgesellschaft an Austrian carmaker installed it The construction of these bumpers was unreliable as they featured only a cosmetic function Early car owners had the front spring hanger bolt replaced with ones long enough to attach a metal bar G D Fisher patented a bumper bracket to simplify the attachment of the accessory The first bumper designed to absorb impacts appeared in It was made of rubber and Frederick Simms gained a patent in br br Automakers added bumpers in the mid s but consisted of a strip of steel across the front and back Often treated as an optional accessory bumpers became more and more common in the s as automobile designers made them more complex and substantial Over the next decades chrome plated bumpers became heavy elaborative and increasingly decorative until the late s when U S automakers began establishing new bumper trends and brand specific designs The s saw the use of lighter chrome plated blade like bumpers with a painted metal valance filling the space below it Multi piece construction became the norm as automakers incorporated grilles lighting and even rear exhaust into the bumpers br On the Pontiac GTO General Motors incorporated an Endura body colored plastic front bumper designed to absorb low speed impact without permanent deformation It was featured in a TV advertisement with John DeLorean hitting the bumper with a sledgehammer and no damage resulted Similar elastomeric bumpers were available on the front and rear of the Plymouth Barracuda In Renault introduced a plastic bumper sheet moulding compound on the Renault br Current design practice is for the bumper structure on modern automobiles to consist of a plastic cover over a reinforcement bar made of steel aluminum fiberglass composite or plastic Bumpers of most modern automobiles have been made of a combination of polycarbonate PC and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS called PC ABS br br br Physics br Bumpers offer protection to other vehicle components by dissipating the kinetic energy generated by an impact This energy is a function of vehicle mass and velocity squared The kinetic energy is equal to the product of the mass and the square of the speed In formula form br br br br br br E br br k br br br br br br br br br br br br m br br v br br br br br br br displaystyle E text k tfrac mv br br br A bumper that protects vehicle components from damage at miles per hour must be four times as tough as a bumper that protects at miles per hour with the collision energy dissipation concentrated at the extreme front and rear of the vehicle Small increases in bumper protection can lead to weight gain and loss of fuel efficiency br Until rigidity was seen as beneficial to occupant safety among automotive engineers Modern theories of vehicle crashworthiness point in the opposite direction towards vehicles that crumple progressively A completely rigid vehicle might have excellent bumper protection for vehicle components but would offer poor occupant safety br br br Pedestrian safety br Bumpers are increasingly being designed to mitigate injury to pedestrians struck by cars such as through the use of bumper covers made of flexible materials Front bumpers especially have been lowered and made of softer materials such as foams and crushable plastics to reduce the severity of impact on legs br br br Height mismatches br br For passenger cars the height and placement of bumpers are legally specified under both U S and EU regulations Bumpers do not protect against moderate speed collisions because during emergency braking suspension changes the pitch of each vehicle so bumpers can bypass each other when the vehicles collide Preventing override and underride can be accomplished by extremely tall bumper surfaces Active suspension is another solution to keeping the vehicle level br Bumper height from the roadway surface is essential in engaging other protective systems Airbag deployment sensors typically do not trigger until contact with an obstruction and it is crucial that front bumpers be the first parts of a vehicle to make contact in the event of a frontal collision to leave sufficient time to inflate the protective cushions br Energy absorbing crush zones are completely ineffective if they are physically bypassed an extreme example of this occurs when the elevated platform of a tractor trailer completely misses the front bumper of a passenger car and the first contact is with the glass windshield of the passenger compartment br br br Truck vs car br Underride collisions in which a smaller vehicle such as a passenger sedan slides under a larger vehicle such as a tractor trailer often result in severe injuries or fatalities The platform bed of a typical tractor trailer is at the head height of seated adults in a typical passenger car and thus can cause severe head trauma in even a moderate speed collision Around people are killed this way in the United States annually br Following the June death of actress Jayne Mansfield in an auto truck accident the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommended requiring a rear underride guard also known as a Mansfield bar an ICC bar or a DOT Department of Transportation bumper These may not be more than in cm from the road The U S trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature and there are no requirements to repair ICC bars damaged in service However in NHTSA upgraded the requirements for the rear underride prevention structure on truck trailers and Transport Canada went further with an even more stringent requirement for energy absorbing rear underride guards In July NHTSA issued a proposal to upgrade the U S performance requirements for underride guards br Many European nations have also required side underride guards to mitigate lethal collisions where the car impacts the truck from the side A variety of different types of side underride guards of this nature are in use in Japan the US and Canada However they are not required in the United States br UN Regulation sets forth requirements for rear underrun protective devices RUPDs and their installation among which is that trucks and trailers of various types must have such devices with height above the ground not more than cm in cm in or cm in br br br SUV vs car br Mismatches between SUV bumper heights and passenger car side impact beams have allowed serious injuries at relatively low speeds In the United States NHTSA is studying how to address this issue as of br Beyond lethal interactions repair costs of passenger car SUV collisions can also be significant due to the height mismatch This mismatch can result in vehicles being so severely damaged that they are inoperable after low speed collisions br br br Regulation br In most jurisdictions bumpers are legally required on all vehicles Regulations for automobile bumpers have been implemented for two reasons to allow the car to sustain a low speed impact without damage to the vehicle s safety systems and to protect pedestrians from injury These requirements conflict bumpers that withstand impact well and minimize repair costs tend to injure pedestrians more while pedestrian friendly bumpers tend to have higher repair costs br Although a vehicle s bumper systems are designed to absorb the energy of low speed collisions and help protect the car s safety and other expensive nearby components most bumpers are designed to meet only the minimum regulatory standards br br br International standards br International safety regulations devised initially as European standards under the auspices of the United Nations have now been adopted by most countries outside North America These specify that a car s safety systems must still function normally after a straight on pendulum or moving barrier impact of km h mph to the front and the rear and to the front and rear corners of km h mph at cm in above the ground with the vehicle loaded or unloaded br br br Pedestrian safety br European countries have implemented regulations to address the issue of deaths annually in worldwide pedestrian auto accidents br br br Bull bars br br Specialized bumpers known as bull bars or roo bars protect vehicles in rural environments from collisions with large animals However studies have shown that such bars increase the threat of death and serious injury to pedestrians in urban environments because the bull bar is rigid and transmits all force of a collision to the pedestrian unlike a bumper which absorbs some force and crumples In the European Union the sale of rigid metal bull bars that do not comply with the relevant pedestrian protection safety standards has been banned br br br Off road bumpers br Off road vehicles often utilize aftermarket off road bumpers made of heavy gauge metal to improve clearance height above terrain maximize departure angles clear larger tires and ensure additional protection Similar or identical to bull bars off road bumpers feature a rigid construction and do not absorb by plastic deformation any energy in a collision which is more dangerous for pedestrians than factory plastic bumpers The legality of the aftermarket off road bumpers varies by jurisdiction br br br United States br br Bumper regulations in the United States focus on preventing low speed accidents from impairing safe vehicle operation limiting damage to safety related vehicle components and containing the costs of repair after a crash br br br First standards br br In the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA issued the country s first regulation applicable to passenger car bumpers Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No FMVSS Exterior Protection took effect on September when most automakers would begin producing their model year vehicles The standard prohibited functional damage to specified safety related components such as headlamps and fuel system components when the vehicle is subjected to barrier crash tests at miles per hour km h for front and mph km h for rear bumper systems The requirements effectively eliminated automobile bumper designs that featured integral automotive lighting components such as tail lamps br In October the U S Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act MVICS which required NHTSA to issue a bumper standard that yields the maximum feasible reduction of cost to the public and to the consumer Factors considered included the costs and benefits of implementation the standard s effect on insurance costs and legal fees savings in consumer time and inconvenience as well as health and safety considerations br The model year passenger cars sold in the U S used a variety of designs They ranged from non dynamic versions with solid rubber guards to recoverable designs with oil and nitrogen filled telescoping shock absorbers br The standards were further tightened for the model year passenger cars with standardized height front and rear bumpers that could take angle impacts at miles per hour km h with no damage to the car s lights safety equipment and engine There was no provision in the law for consumers to opt out of this protection br br br Regulatory effect on design br The regulations specified bumper performance they did not prescribe any particular bumper design Nevertheless many cars for the U S market were equipped with bulky massive protruding bumpers to comply with the mile per hour bumper standard in effect from to This often meant additional overall vehicle length as well as new front and rear designs to incorporate the stronger energy absorbing bumpers adding weight to the extremities of the vehicle Passenger cars featured gap concealing flexible filler panels between the bumpers and the car s bodywork causing them to have a massive blockish look However other bumper designs also met the requirements The AMC Matador coupe had free standing bumpers with rubber gaiters alone to conceal the retractable shock absorbers Endura bumpers compliant with the regulations yet tightly integrated into the front bodywork were used on models such as the Pontiac Grand Am starting in and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo starting in with significantly lower mass than heavy chromed steel bumpers with separate impact energy absorbers br br The bumper regulations applied to all passenger cars both American made and imported With exceptions including the Volvo Porsche and Rolls Royce Silver Shadow European and Asian automakers tended to put compliant bumpers only on cars destined for the U S and Canadian markets where the regulations applied This meant their North American spec cars tended to look different than versions of the same model sold elsewhere br U S bumper height requirements effectively made some models such as the Citro n SM ineligible for importation to the United States Unlike international safety regulations U S regulations were written without provision for hydropneumatic suspension br br br Zero damage standards br The requirements promulgated under MVICS were consolidated with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number FMVSS Exterior Protection of Vehicles and promulgated in March This new bumper standard was placed in the United States Code of Federal Regulations at CFR separate from the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards at CFR The new requirements applicable to model year passenger cars were called the Phase I standard At the same time a zero damage requirement Phase II was enacted for bumper systems on and newer cars The most rigorous requirements applied to through model vehicles mile per hour km h front and rear barrier and pendulum crash tests were required and no damage was allowed to the bumper beyond a in mm dent and in mm displacement from the bumper s original position br br All wheel drive cross over cars such as the AMC Eagle were classified as multi purpose vehicles or trucks and thus exempt from the passenger car bumper standards br br br Stringency reduced in br The recently elected Reagan administration had pledged to use cost benefit analysis to reduce regulatory burdens on industry which impacted this standard br As discussed in detail under Physics before people believed the stronger the structure including the bumpers the safer the car A later analysis led to the understanding of crumple zones rather than rigid construction that proved deadly to passengers because the force from impact went straight inside the vehicle and onto the passenger br NHTSA amended the bumper standard in May halving the front and rear crash test speeds for and newer car bumpers from miles per hour km h to miles per hour km h and the corner crash test speeds from miles per hour km h to miles per hour km h In addition the zero damage Phase II requirement was rolled back to the damage allowances of Phase I At the same time a passenger car bumper height requirement of to inches cm was established for passenger cars br NHTSA evaluated the results of its change in noting it resulted in lower weight and manufacturing costs offset by higher repair costs br Despite these findings consumer and insurance groups decried the weakened bumper standard They argued that the standard increased overall consumer costs without any attendant benefits except for automakers In Consumers Union petitioned NHTSA to return to the Phase II standard and disclose bumper strength information to consumers In NHTSA rejected that petition br br br Consumer information br In the United States the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS subjects vehicles to low speed barrier tests mph or km h and publishes the results including repair costs Car makers that do well in these tests tend to publicize the results br In the IIHS conducted four crash tests on three different year examples of the Plymouth Horizon The results illustrate the effect of the br changes to the U S bumper regulations repair costs are quoted in United States dollars br br Horizon with Phase II mph bumpers br Horizon with Phase I mph bumpers br Horizon br br br Bumpers today br Today s bumpers are designed to mitigate injuries to pedestrians and minimize weight at the ends of the vehicle thereby increasing occupant protection from progressive crumpling in a serious accident They are no longer made of steel and rubber but of a plastic outer fascia over a lightweight impact absorbing polystyrene foam core br br br Canada br Automobile bumper standards in Canada were first enacted simultaneously as those in the United States These were closely similar to the km h mph U S regulation and the Canadian requirements were not lowered to km h mph in as was done in the United States br Some automakers provided stronger Canadian specification bumpers throughout the North American market while others chose weaker bumpers in the U S market This limited grey import vehicles between the U S and Canada br In early Canada s regulation shifted to harmonize with U S Federal standards and international UN Regulations As in the U S consumer protection groups opposed the change while Canadian regulators maintained that the km h mph test speed is used worldwide and is more compatible with improved pedestrian protection in vehicle pedestrian crashes br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br br Viscusi Kip Regulatory Economics in
