Telematics is an interdisciplinary field encompassing telecommunications vehicular technologies road transport road safety etc electrical engineering sensors instrumentation wireless communications etc and computer science multimedia Internet etc Telematics can involve any of the following br br The technology of sending receiving and storing information using telecommunication devices to control remote objects br The integrated use of telecommunications and informatics for application in vehicles and to control vehicles on the move br Global navigation satellite system technology integrated with computers and mobile communications technology in automotive navigation systems br Most narrowly The use of such systems within road vehicles also called vehicle telematics br br br History br Telematics is a translation of the French word t l matique which was first coined by Simon Nora and Alain Minc in a report to the French government on the computerization of society It referred to the transfer of information over telecommunications and was a portmanteau blending the French words t l communications telecommunications and informatique computing science The original broad meaning of telematics continues to be used in academic fields but in commerce it now generally means vehicle telematics br br br Vehicle telematics br Telematics can be described as thus br br The convergence of telecommunications and information processing the term later evolved to refer to automation in automobiles such as the invention of the emergency warning system for vehicles GPS navigation integrated hands free cell phones wireless safety communications and automatic driving assistance systems all are covered under the telematics umbrella br The science of telecommunications and informatics applied in wireless technologies and computational systems p the IEEE standard in the family and also referred to as Wireless Access for the Vehicular Environment WAVE is the primary standard that addresses and enhances Intelligent Transport System br br Vehicle telematics can help improve the efficiency of an organization br br br Vehicle tracking br Vehicle tracking is monitoring the location movements status and behavior of a vehicle or fleet of vehicles This is achieved through a combination of a GPS GNSS receiver and an electronic device usually comprising a GSM GPRS modem or SMS sender installed in each vehicle communicating with the user dispatching emergency or co ordinating unit and PC based or web based software The data is turned into information by management reporting tools in conjunction with a visual display on computerized mapping software Vehicle tracking systems may also use odometry or dead reckoning as an alternative or complementary means of navigation br GPS tracking is usually accurate to around meters but the European Space Agency has developed the EGNOS technology to provide accuracy to meters br br br Trailer tracking br br Trailer tracking refers to the tracking of movements and position of an articulated vehicle s trailer unit through the use of a location unit fitted to the trailer and a method of returning the position data via mobile communication network IOT Internet of things or geostationary satellite communications for use through either PC or web based software br Cold store freight trailers that deliver fresh or frozen foods are increasingly incorporating telematics to gather time series data on the temperature inside the cargo container both to trigger alarms and record an audit trail for business purposes An increasingly sophisticated array of sensors many incorporating RFID technology is being used to ensure the cold chain br br br Container tracking br Freight containers can be tracked by GPS using a similar approach to that used for trailer tracking i e a battery powered GPS device communicating its position via mobile phone or satellite communications Benefits of this approach include increased security and the possibility to reschedule the container transport movements based on accurate information about its location According to Berg Insight the installed base of tracking units in the intermodal shipping container segment reached at the end of Growing at a compound annual growth rate of percent the installed base reached units at the end of br br br Fleet management br Fleet management is the management of a company s fleet and includes the management of ships and or motor vehicles such as cars vans and trucks Fleet vehicle management can include a range of functions such as vehicle financing vehicle maintenance vehicle telematics tracking and diagnostics driver management fuel management health and safety management and dynamic vehicle scheduling Fleet management is a function which allows companies that rely on transport in their business to remove or minimize the risks associated with vehicle investment improving efficiency and productivity while reducing overall transport costs and ensuring compliance with government legislation and Duty of Care obligations These functions can either be dealt with by an in house fleet management department or an outsourced fleet management provider br br br Telematics standards br br The Association of Equipment Management Professionals AEMP developed the industry s first telematics standard br In AEMP brought together the major construction equipment manufacturers and telematics providers in the heavy equipment industry to discuss the development of the industry s first telematics standard Following agreement from Caterpillar Volvo CE Komatsu and John Deere Construction Forestry to support such a standard the AEMP formed a standards development subcommittee chaired by Pat Crail CEM to develop the standard This committee consisted of developers provided by the Caterpillar Trimble joint venture known as Virtual Site Solutions Volvo CE and John Deere This group worked from February through September to develop the industry s first standard for the delivery of telematics data br The result the AEMP Telematics Data Standard V was released in and officially went live on October As of November Caterpillar Volvo CE John Deere Construction Forestry OEM Data Delivery and Navman Wireless are able to support customers with delivery of basic telematics data in a standard xml format Komatsu Topcon and others are finishing beta testing and have indicated their ability to support customers in the near future br The AEMP s telematics data standard was developed to allow end users to integrate key telematics data operating hours location fuel consumed and odometer reading where applicable into their existing fleet management reporting systems As such the standard was primarily intended to facilitate importation of these data elements into enterprise software systems such as those used by many medium to large construction contractors Prior to the standard end users had few options for integrating this data into their reporting systems in a mixed fleet environment consisting of multiple brands of machines and a mix of telematics equipped machines and legacy machines those without telematics devices where operating data is still reported manually via pen and paper One option available to machine owners was to visit multiple websites to manually retrieve data from each manufacturer s telematics interface and then manually enter it into their fleet management program s database This option was cumbersome and labor intensive br A second option was for the end user to develop an API Application Programming Interface or program to integrate the data from each telematics provider into their database This option was quite costly as each telematics provider had different procedures for accessing and retrieving the data and the data format varied from provider to provider This option automated the process but because each provider required a unique custom API to retrieve and parse the data it was an expensive option In addition another API had to be developed any time another brand of machine or telematics device was added to the fleet br A third option for mixed fleet integration was to replace the various factory installed telematics devices with devices from a third party telematics provider Although this solved the problem of having multiple data providers requiring unique integration methods this was by far the most expensive option In addition to the expense many third party devices available for construction equipment are unable to access data directly from the machine s electronic control modules ECMs or computers and are more limited than the device installed by the OEM Cat Volvo Deere Komatsu etc in the data they are able to provide In some cases these devices are limited to location and engine runtime although they are increasingly able to accommodate a number of add on sensors to provide additional data br The AEMP Telematics Data Standard provides a fourth option By concentrating on the key data elements that drive the majority of fleet management reports hours miles location fuel consumption making those data elements available in a standardized xml format and standardizing the means by which the document is retrieved the standard enables the end user to use one API to retrieve data from any participating telematics provider as opposed to the unique API for each provider that was required previously greatly reducing integration development costs br The current draft version of the AEMP Telematics Data Standard is now called the AEM AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard which expands the original standard Version to include data fields with fault code capability This new draft standard is a collaborative effort of AEMP and the Association of Equipment Manufacturers AEM working on behalf of their members and the industry This Draft API replaces the current version and does not currently cover some types of equipment e g agriculture equipment cranes mobile elevating work platforms air compressors and other niche products br In addition to the new data fields the AEM AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard changes how data is accessed in an effort to make it easier to consume and integrate with other systems and processes It includes standardized communication protocols for the ability to transfer telematics information in mixed equipment fleets to end user business enterprise systems enabling the end user to employ their own business software to collect and then analyze asset data from mixed equipment fleets without the need to work across multiple telematics provider applications br To achieve a globally recognized standard for conformity worldwide the AEM AEMP Draft Telematics API Standard will be submitted for acceptance by the International Organization for Standardization ISO Final language is dependent upon completion of the ISO acceptance process br br br Satellite navigation br Satellite navigation in the context of vehicle telematics is the technology of using a GPS and electronic mapping tool to enable a driver to locate a position plan a route and navigate a journey br br br Mobile data br Mobile data is the use of wireless data communications using radio waves to send and receive real time computer data to from and between devices used by field based personnel These devices can be fitted solely for use while in the vehicle Fixed Data Terminal or for use in and out of the vehicle Mobile Data Terminal See mobile Internet br The common methods for mobile data communication for telematics were based on private vendors RF communication infrastructure During the early s manufacturers of mobile data terminals AVL devices moved to try cellular data communication to offer cheaper ways to transmit telematics information and wider range based on cellular provider coverage Since then as a result of cellular providers offering low GPRS G and later UMTS G rates mobile data is almost totally offered to telematics customers via cellular communication br br br Wireless vehicle safety communications br Wireless vehicle safety communications telematics aid in car safety and road safety It is an electronic subsystem in a vehicle used for exchanging safety information about road hazards and the locations and speeds of vehicles over short range radio links This may involve temporary ad hoc wireless local area networks br Wireless units are often installed in vehicles and fixed locations such as near traffic signals and emergency call boxes along the road Sensors in vehicles and at fixed locations as well as in possible connections to wider networks provide information displayed to drivers The range of the radio links can be extended by forwarding messages along multi hop paths Even without fixed units information about fixed hazards can be maintained by moving vehicles by passing it backwards It also seems possible for traffic lights which one can expect to become smarter to use this information to reduce the chance of collisions br In the future it may connect directly to the adaptive cruise control or other vehicle control aids Cars and trucks with the wireless system connected to their brakes may move in convoys to save fuel and space on the roads When a column member slows down those behind it will automatically slow also Certain scenarios may required less engineering effort such as when a radio beacon is connected to a brake light br In fall network ideas were tested in Europe where radio frequency bandwidth had been allocated The MHz allocated is at GHz and unallocated bandwidth at GHz may also be used The standard is IEEE p a low latency form of the Wi Fi local area network standard Similar efforts are underway in Japan and the USA br br br Emergency warning system for vehicles br Telematics technologies are self orientating open network architecture structures of variable programmable intelligent beacons developed for application in the development of intelligent vehicles with the intent to accord blend or mesh warning information with surrounding vehicles in the vicinity of travel intra vehicle and infrastructure Emergency warning systems for vehicle telematics are developed particularly for international harmonization and standardization of vehicle to vehicle infrastructure to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure real time Dedicated Short Range Communication DSRC systems br Telematics most commonly relate to computerized systems that update information at the same rate they receive data enabling them to direct or control a process such as an instantaneous autonomous warning notification in a remote machine or group of machines In the use of telematics relating to intelligent vehicle technologies instantaneous direction travel cognizance of a vehicle may be transmitted in real time to surrounding vehicles traveling in the local area of vehicles equipped with EWSV to receive said warning signals of danger br br br Intelligent vehicle technologies br Telematics comprise electronic electromechanical and electromagnetic devices usually silicon micro machined components operating in conjunction with computer controlled devices and radio transceivers to provide precision repeatability functions such as in robotics artificial intelligence systems emergency warning validation performance reconstruction br Intelligent vehicle technologies commonly apply to car safety systems and self contained autonomous electromechanical sensors generating warnings that can be transmitted within a specified targeted area of interest i e within meters of the emergency warning system for the vehicle s transceiver In ground applications intelligent vehicle technologies are utilized for safety and commercial communications between vehicles or between a vehicle and a sensor along the road br On November the most advanced Intelligent Vehicle concept car was demonstrated in New York City when a Toyota Prius became the first LTE connected car The demonstration was provided by the NG Connect project a collaboration of automotive telematic technologies designed to exploit in car G wireless network connectivity br br br Carsharing br Telematics technology has enabled the emergence of carsharing services such as Local Motion Uber Lyft Car Go Zipcar worldwide or City Car Club in the UK Telematics enabled computers allow organizers to track members usage and bill them on a pay as you drive basis Some systems show users where to find an idle vehicle Car Clubs such as Australia s Charter Drive use telematics to monitor and report on vehicle use within predefined geofence areas to demonstrate the reach of their transit media car club fleet br br br Auto insurance Usage based insurance UBI br br The general idea of telematics auto insurance is that a driver s behavior is monitored directly while the person drives and this information is transmitted to an insurance company The insurance company then assesses the risk of that driver having an accident and charges insurance premiums accordingly A driver who drives less responsibly will be charged a higher premium than a driver who drives smoothly and with less calculated risk of claim propensity Other benefits can be delivered to end users with Telematics based telematics as customer engagement can be enhanced with direct customer interaction br Telematics auto insurance was independently invented and patented by a major U S auto insurance company Progressive Auto Insurance U S patent and a Spanish independent inventor Salvador Minguijon Perez European Patent EP B The Perez patents cover monitoring the car s engine control computer to determine distance driven speed time of day braking force etc Progressive is currently developing the Perez technology in the U S and European auto insurer Norwich Union is developing the Progressive technology for Europe Both patents have since been overturned in courts due to prior work in the commercial insurance sectors br Trials conducted by Norwich Union in found that young drivers to year olds signing up for telematics auto insurance have had a lower accident rate than average br In theoretical economic research on the social welfare effects of Progressive s telematics technology business process patents questioned whether the business process patents are pareto efficient for society Preliminary results suggested that it was not but more work is needed In April Progressive patents were overturned by the U S legal system on the grounds of lack of originality br The smartphone as the in vehicle device for insurance telematics has been discussed in great detail and the instruments are available for the design of smartphone driven insurance telematics br br br Telematics education br br br Engineering Degree programs br Federico Santa Mar a Technical University UTFSM in Chile has a
