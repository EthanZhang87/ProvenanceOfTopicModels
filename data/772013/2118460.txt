A hood ornament or bonnet ornament or bonnet mascot in Commonwealth English also called a motor mascot or car mascot is a specially crafted model that symbolizes a car company like a badge located on the front center portion of the hood It has been used as an adornment nearly since the inception of automobiles br br br Origin br According to the author of A History of Cars written for youth the first hood ornament was a sun crested falcon to bring good luck mounted on the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun s chariot br In the early years automobiles had their radiator caps outside the hood and on top of the grille which also served as an indicator of the temperature of the engine s coolant fluid The Boyce MotoMeter Company was issued a patent in for a radiator cap that incorporated a thermometer that was visible to the driver with a sensor that measured the heat of the water vapor rather than the water itself This became useful gauge for the driver because many early engines did not have water pumps but a circulation system based on the thermo syphon principle as in the Ford Model T br The exposed radiator cap became a focal point for automobile personalization br Hood ornaments were popular in the s s s and s with many automakers fitting them to their vehicles They also serve to differentiate cars and the ornaments were inspired by animals mythological figures and the automakers logos A common element on every Rolls Royce since is the Spirit of Ecstacy on the hood that serves as a type of calling card and denotes the message of luxury During the s advertisements for Mercedes Benz emphasized their star hood ornament as representing the world famous product of the oldest automobile works in the world and as the ultimate symbol of luxury br A market developed supplying accessories to those who wanted to add an ornament or car mascot to their automobile These were a way to express the owner s love of their car or customizing to express individuality Most of these companies went out of business with only Louis Lejeune Ltd in England surviving Sculptors like Bazin Paillet Sykes Renevey and Lejeune created detailed miniature sculptures like figurines br Hood ornaments were viewed as objets d art according to Richard Teague who served as styling vice president at American Motors Corporation AMC A sculptor described some hood ornaments as certainly some kind of sex symbol a symbol of virility There were Art Deco stylized women s forms serving as hood ornaments After World War II Nash Motors commissioned George Petty to design hood ornaments featuring female figures without clothing for their cars Petty used his daughter to make the Flying Lady hood ornament which became a marketing coup for Nash and the Airflyte models in the Ambassador and Statesman cars Nash had four different versions of this iconic ornament on its vehicles for ten years before designing non anthropomorphic hood decorations br Teague brought back a hood ornament for the top of the line AMC Ambassador cars because of the good feeling they provide to the owners or at least a reminder of the money spent on the car Others in the auto industry such as Dick Macadam a chief stylist at Chrysler hold the view that hood ornaments provide an aiming point for centering possibly making for easier and safer car handling br br br Legal restrictions br Restrictions to fitting ornaments on the front of vehicles have been introduced in some jurisdictions Projecting decorative designs on the hood may increase the risk of injury to pedestrians during a collision br Regulations introduced in the United States for the model year vehicles meant the disappearance of fixed stand up hood ornaments as well as spinner wheel protrusions Later versions featured flexibly mounted spring loaded stand up hood ornaments designed to fold without breaking on impact such as on the Ford Thunderbird AMC Ambassador and on the Jeep Wagoneer SJ br In the European Union since all new cars have had to conform to a European directive on vehicle exterior projections Rolls Royce s mascot is now mounted on a spring loaded mechanism designed to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck with a force greater than newtons pounds force Other hood ornaments were designed with a spring mount to fold on impact For aftermarket ornaments breakaway nylon fixings are available that comply with EC Directive br The ornaments have been moved down from the hood to the grille They are now viewed as overwrought and detrimental to aerodynamics br br br Branding br br Many automakers wanted their emblems displayed on their vehicles hoods Boyce Motormeter accommodated them with corporate logos or mascots as well as numerous organizations that wanted custom cap emblems to identify their members The company had over such customers at one time during the mid s for car truck tractor boat airplane and motorcycle manufacturers and in had employees in six countries U S England Canada Australia France and Germany The hundreds of motor vehicle manufacturers before meant many customers for their customized emblems br Brand identification remains essential as firms try to distinguish their company s cookie cutter SUV sedan or pick up truck from another company s cookie cutter SUV sedan or pick up truck merely with a hood ornament or a name on the bumper br br br Examples br Along with the grille the hood ornament is often a distinctive styling element and many marques use it as their primary brand identifier br Examples of hood ornaments include br br Archer on Pierce Arrow cars br Ottawa leader Pontiac on Pontiac automobiles br Crest and wreath on Cadillac cars br Letter B with wings on Bentley cars br Ball with wings on Horch cars br Leaping jaguar on Jaguar cars br Lion rampant on Peugeot cars br Marlin jumping out of water mounted in a sight on AMC s fastback br Rocket on Oldsmobile cars br Rocky Mountain big horn ram s head on Dodge cars and trucks br Spirit of Ecstasy on Rolls Royce cars br Stork on Hispano Suiza cars br Three pointed star surrounded by a circle on Mercedes Benz sedans and wagons br Trishields on Buick cars br Additionally many models in all price and market segments such as Buick Regal Chevrolet Impala Jeep Grand Wagoneer SJ and Chrysler Cordoba featured unique emblems and accompanying distinctive standup hood ornaments br br br The importance of design br While originally designed for a purpose the hood ornament became transformed into elaborate decorations or symbols As a result the radiator cap was changed into an art form and became a way of individualizing the car representing a company s vision of the automobile or speaking volumes about the owner of the vehicle Another design objective developed for the hood ornament reflected an idea of motion and speed and grace br There are legal issues in protecting the designs of hood ornaments Less expensive than patenting the design protection by copyright may be possible only if and only to the extent that such design incorporates pictorial graphic or sculptural features that can be identified separately from and capable of existing independently of the utilitarian aspects of the article Thus the Rolls Royce ornament could be used as a separate sculpture while most other distinctive hood ornament forms would not be considered free standing items br br br Materials used in manufacturing br Hood ornaments are usually cast in brass zinc or bronze and chrome plated During the years when chrome plating was unavailable silver or nickel was substituted Some also incorporated other materials like plastic bakelite or colored glass The Ford Custom DeLuxe hood ornament was molded in Plexiglas Others contained a light bulb for illumination at night Pontiac featured a lighted Indian head hood ornament through after which it was replaced by the flying V design br The best known glass mascots were made by Ren Lalique in France Other sellers or producers of glass mascots include Sabino in France Red Ashay in England and Persons Majestic in the U S The latter two had their products made in Czechoslovakia Like Louis Lejeune Ltd the Lalique Company is one of the few survivors from this era of motoring br br br Collectibility br Some hood ornaments are attractive for more than the car s owners such as the red white and blue golden lion crests that were on the hoods of Fords that children took to decorate their hats belts or bicycles The company solved the problem by offering a free miniature crest to all the kids that wrote letters requesting one br There is a collector s market for hood ornaments and car mascots One of the most sought after is the Nash Petty Hood Ornament with one of the most largest followers of all hood ornament collectors To satisfy collectors reproduction castings of the Flying Lady are being made from the original Nash ornament br br
