Cruise control also known as speed control cruise command autocruise or tempomat is a system that automatically controls the speed of an automobile The system is a servomechanism that takes over the car s throttle to maintain a steady speed set by the driver br br br History br br Speed control existed in early automobiles such as the Wilson Pilcher in the early s They had a lever on the steering column that could be used to set the speed to be maintained by the engine In the Peerless included a governor to keep the speed of the engine through an extra throttle lever on the steering wheel Peerless successfully used a flyball governor They advertised their system as being able to maintain speed whether uphill or down br A governor was used by James Watt and Matthew Boulton in to control steam engines but the use of governors dates at least back to the th century On an engine the governor uses centrifugal force to adjust the throttle position to adapt the engine s speed to different loads e g when going up a hill br Modern cruise control also known as a speedostat or tempomat was invented in by the blind inventor and mechanical engineer Ralph Teetor He came up with the idea due to being frustrated by his driver s habit of speeding up and slowing down as he talked br A more significant factor in developing cruise control was the mph km h speed limit imposed in the United States during World War II to reduce gasoline use and tire wear A mechanism controlled by the driver provided resistance to further pressure on the accelerator pedal when the vehicle reached the desired speed Teetor s idea of a dashboard speed selector with a mechanism connected to the driveshaft and a device able to push against the gas pedal was patented in He added a speed lock capability that maintained the car s speed until the driver tapped the brake pedal or turned off the system br A U S patent for a constant speed regulator was filed in by M Sgt Frank J Riley He conceived the device while driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike and installed his invention in his car in br Another inventor named Harold Exline working independently of Riley also invented a type of cruise control that he first installed on his car and friends cars Exline filed a U S patent for a vacuum powered throttle control with electrically controlled air valve in which was granted in Despite these patents Riley Exline and subsequent patent holders were not able to collect royalties for any cruise control inventions br The first car with Teetor s speedostat system was the Chrysler Imperial called auto pilot using a speed control dial on the dashboard This system calculated ground speed from the rotating speedometer cable and used a bi directional screw drive electric motor to vary the throttle position as needed Cadillac soon renamed and marketed the device as cruise control br In American Motors Corporation AMC introduced a low priced automatic speed control for its large sized cars with automatic transmissions The AMC cruise command unit was actuated through a push button on the dashboard once the car s desired speed was reached The throttle position was automatically adjusted by a vacuum control that opened and closed the throttle based on input from the speedometer cable rather than through an adjustable control on the dashboard The unit would shut off anytime the brakes were applied br Daniel Aaron Wisner invented an automotive electronic cruise control in as an engineer for RCA s Industrial and Automation Systems Division in Plymouth Michigan His invention is described in two patents filed that year US patents and with the second introducing digital memory and was the first electronic device that controlled a car br Due to the oil crisis and rising fuel prices the device became more popular in the U S Cruise control can save gas by avoiding surges that expel fuel while driving at steady speeds In AMC GM and Chrysler priced the option at to while Ford charged br In the late s an integrated circuit for Wisner s design for electronic cruise control was finally commercially developed by Motorola as the MC Automotive Speed Control Processor in CMOS The advantage of electronic speed control over its mechanical predecessor was that it could be integrated with electronic accident avoidance and engine management systems br br br Operation br br The driver must manually bring the vehicle up to speed and use a button to set the cruise control to the current speed br The cruise control takes its speed signal from a rotating driveshaft speedometer cable wheel speed sensor from the engine s RPM or internal speed pulses produced electronically by the vehicle Most systems do not allow the use of the cruise control below a certain speed typically around or mph or km h The vehicle will maintain the desired speed by pulling the throttle cable with a solenoid a vacuum driven servomechanism or by using the electronic systems built into the vehicle fully electronic if it uses a drive by wire system br All cruise control systems must have the capability to be turned off explicitly and automatically when the driver depresses the brake pedal and often also the clutch Cruise control systems frequently include a memory feature to resume the set speed after braking and a coast feature to reduce the set speed without braking When the cruise control is engaged the throttle can still accelerate the car but once the pedal is released it will slow down the vehicle until it reaches the previously set speed br On the latest vehicles fitted with electronic throttle control cruise control can be integrated into the vehicle s engine management system Modern adaptive systems include the ability to automatically reduce speed when the distance to a car in front or the speed limit decreases br The cruise control systems of some vehicles incorporate a speed limiter function which will not allow the vehicle to accelerate beyond a preset maximum this can usually be overridden by fully depressing the accelerator pedal Most systems will prevent the vehicle from increasing engine speed to accelerate beyond the chosen speed However they will not apply the brakes in the event of overspeeding downhill nor stop the car from going faster than the selected speed even with the engine just idling br Cruise control is less flexible on vehicles with a manual transmission because depressing the clutch pedal and shifting gears usually disengages the cruise control The resume feature has to be used each time after selecting the new gear and releasing the clutch Therefore cruise control is most beneficial at motorway highway speeds when top gear is used virtually all the time The speed limiter function however does not have this problem br br br Advantages and disadvantages br Some advantages of cruise control include br br It is helpful for long drives along highways and sparsely populated roads by reducing driver fatigue and improving comfort by allowing positioning changes more safely br Some drivers use it to avoid speeding particularly those who may unconsciously increase speed during a long highway journey br Increased fuel efficiency br However when misused cruise control can lead to accidents due to several factors such as br br hazardous weather conditions Many states warn against using cruise control if the road has ice or snow When a car skids with cruise control enabled the vehicle will keep accelerating increasing the chance of losing control If the vehicle is sliding on ice the driver should not brake or accelerate but just let the vehicle slow down on its own br speeding around curves that require slowing down br rough or loose terrain that could negatively affect the cruise control controls br Encourages drivers to pay less attention to driving increasing the risk of an accident br Risk of SUA Sudden Unintended Acceleration and possible accidents Drivers with feet at rest lose spatial perception and may hit the accelerator instead of the brake pedal in a sudden emergency br br br Adaptive cruise control br br Some modern vehicles have adaptive cruise control ACC systems a general term meaning improved cruise control Dynamic set speed systems use the GPS position of speed limit signs from a database Many systems also incorporate cameras lasers and millimeter wave radar equipment to determine how close a vehicle is to others or other objects on the roadway br The technologies can be set to maintain a distance from vehicles in front of the car the system will automatically slow down based on the vehicles in front or continue to keep the set speed Some systems cannot detect completely stationary cars or pedestrians so the driver must always pay attention Automatic braking systems use either a single or a combination of sensors radar lidar and camera to allow the vehicle to keep pace with the car it is following slow when closing in on the vehicle in front and accelerate to the preset speed when traffic allows Some systems also feature forward collision warning systems which warn the driver if a vehicle in front given the speed of both vehicles gets too close within the preset headway or braking distance br Vehicles with adaptive cruise control are considered a Level autonomous car as defined by SAE International br br br See
