id: 2144362
A voice user interface VUI enables spoken human interaction with computers using speech recognition to understand spoken commands and answer questions and typically text to speech to play a reply A voice command device is a device controlled with a voice user interface br Voice user interfaces have been added to automobiles home automation systems computer operating systems home appliances like washing machines and microwave ovens and television remote controls They are the primary way of interacting with virtual assistants on smartphones and smart speakers Older automated attendants which route phone calls to the correct extension and interactive voice response systems which conduct more complicated transactions over the phone can respond to the pressing of keypad buttons via DTMF tones but those with a full voice user interface allow callers to speak requests and responses without having to press any buttons br Newer voice command devices are speaker independent so they can respond to multiple voices regardless of accent or dialectal influences They are also capable of responding to several commands at once separating vocal messages and providing appropriate feedback accurately imitating a natural conversation br br br Overview br A VUI is the interface to any speech application Only a short time ago controlling a machine by simply talking to it was only possible in science fiction Until recently this area was considered to be artificial intelligence However advances in technologies like text to speech speech to text natural language processing and cloud services contributed to the mass adoption of these types of interfaces VUIs have become more commonplace and people are taking advantage of the value that these hands free eyes free interfaces provide in many situations br VUIs need to respond to input reliably or they will be rejected and often ridiculed by their users Designing a good VUI requires interdisciplinary talents of computer science linguistics and human factors psychology all of which are skills that are expensive and hard to come by Even with advanced development tools constructing an effective VUI requires an in depth understanding of both the tasks to be performed as well as the target audience that will use the final system The closer the VUI matches the user s mental model of the task the easier it will be to use with little or no training resulting in both higher efficiency and higher user satisfaction br A VUI designed for the general public should emphasize ease of use and provide a lot of help and guidance for first time callers In contrast a VUI designed for a small group of power users including field service workers should focus more on productivity and less on help and guidance Such applications should streamline the call flows minimize prompts eliminate unnecessary iterations and allow elaborate mixed initiative dialogs which enable callers to enter several pieces of information in a single utterance and in any order or combination In short speech applications have to be carefully crafted for the specific business process that is being automated br Not all business processes render themselves equally well for speech automation In general the more complex the inquiries and transactions are the more challenging they will be to automate and the more likely they will be to fail with the general public In some scenarios automation is simply not applicable so live agent assistance is the only option A legal advice hotline for example would be very difficult to automate On the flip side speech is perfect for handling quick and routine transactions like changing the status of a work order completing a time or expense entry or transferring funds between accounts br br br History br Early applications for VUI included voice activated dialing of phones either directly or through a typically Bluetooth headset or vehicle audio system br In a CNN business article reported that voice command was over a billion dollar industry and that companies like Google and Apple were trying to create speech recognition features In the years since the article was published the world has witnessed a variety of voice command devices Additionally Google has created a speech recognition engine called Pico TTS and Apple released Siri Voice command devices are becoming more widely available and innovative ways for using the human voice are always being created For example Business Week suggests that the future remote controller is going to be the human voice Currently Xbox Live allows such features and Jobs hinted at such a feature on the new Apple TV br br br Voice command software products on computing devices br Both Apple Mac and Windows PC provide built in speech recognition features for their latest operating systems br br br Microsoft Windows br Two Microsoft operating systems Windows and Windows Vista provide speech recognition capabilities Microsoft integrated voice commands into their operating systems to provide a mechanism for people who want to limit their use of the mouse and keyboard but still want to maintain or increase their overall productivity br br br Windows Vista br With Windows Vista voice control a user may dictate documents and emails in mainstream applications start and switch between applications control the operating system format documents save documents edit files efficiently correct errors and fill out forms on the Web The speech recognition software learns automatically every time a user uses it and speech recognition is available in English U S English U K German Germany French France Spanish Spain Japanese Chinese Traditional and Chinese Simplified In addition the software comes with an interactive tutorial which can be used to train both the user and the speech recognition engine br br br Windows br In addition to all the features provided in Windows Vista Windows provides a wizard for setting up the microphone and a tutorial on how to use the feature br br br Mac OS X br All Mac OS X computers come pre installed with the speech recognition software The software is user independent and it allows for a user to navigate menus and enter keyboard shortcuts speak checkbox names radio button names list items and button names and open close control and switch among applications However the Apple website recommends a user buy a commercial product called Dictate br br br Commercial products br If a user is not satisfied with the built in speech recognition software or a user does not have a built speech recognition software for their OS then a user may experiment with a commercial product such as Braina Pro or DragonNaturallySpeaking for Windows PCs br and Dictate the name of the same software for Mac OS br br br Voice command mobile devices br Any mobile device running Android OS Microsoft Windows Phone iOS or later or Blackberry OS provides voice command capabilities In addition to the built in speech recognition software for each mobile phone s operating system a user may download third party voice command applications from each operating system s application store Apple App store Google Play Windows Phone Marketplace initially Windows Marketplace for Mobile or BlackBerry App World br br br Android OS br Google has developed an open source operating system called Android which allows a user to perform voice commands such as send text messages listen to music get directions call businesses call contacts send email view a map go to websites write a note and search Google br The speech recognition software is available for all devices since Android Froyo but the settings must be set to English Google allows for the user to change the language and the user is prompted when he or she first uses the speech recognition feature if he or she would like their voice data to be attached to their Google account If a user decides to opt into this service it allows Google to train the software to the user s voice br Google introduced the Google Assistant with Android Nougat It is much more advanced than the older version br Amazon com has the Echo that uses Amazon s custom version of Android to provide a voice interface br br br Microsoft Windows br Windows Phone is Microsoft s mobile device s operating system On Windows Phone the speech app is user independent and can be used to call someone from your contact list call any phone number redial the last number send a text message call your voice mail open an application read appointments query phone status and search the web br In addition speech can also be used during a phone call and the following actions are possible during a phone call press a number turn the speaker phone on or call someone which puts the current call on hold br Windows introduces Cortana a voice control system that replaces the formerly used voice control on Windows phones br br br iOS br Apple added Voice Control to its family of iOS devices as a new feature of iPhone OS The iPhone S iPad iPad Mini G iPad Air iPad Pro G iPod Touch G and later all come with a more advanced voice assistant called Siri Voice Control can still be enabled through the Settings menu of newer devices Siri is a user independent built in speech recognition feature that allows a user to issue voice commands With the assistance of Siri a user may issue commands like send a text message check the weather set a reminder find information schedule meetings send an email find a contact set an alarm get directions track your stocks set a timer and ask for examples of sample voice command queries In addition Siri works with Bluetooth and wired headphones br br br Amazon Alexa br In Amazon introduced the Alexa smart home device Its main purpose was just a smart speaker that allowed the consumer to control the device with their voice Eventually it turned into a novelty device that had the ability to control home appliance with voice Now almost all the appliances are controllable with Alexa including light bulbs and temperature By allowing voice control Alexa can connect to smart home technology allowing you to lock your house control the temperature and activate various devices This form of A I allows for someone to simply ask it a question and in response the Alexa searches for finds and recites the answer back to you br br br Speech recognition in cars br As car technology improves more features will be added to cars and these features could potentially distract a driver Voice commands for cars according to CNET should allow a driver to issue commands and not be distracted CNET stated that Nuance was suggesting that in the future they would create a software that resembled Siri but for cars Most speech recognition software on the market in had only about to voice commands but Ford Sync had However CNET suggested that even voice commands was not sufficient given the complexity and the variety of tasks a user may want to do while driving Voice command for cars is different from voice command for mobile phones and for computers because a driver may use the feature to look for nearby restaurants look for gas driving directions road conditions and the location of the nearest hotel Currently technology allows a driver to issue voice commands on both a portable GPS like a Garmin and a car manufacturer navigation system br List of Voice Command Systems Provided By Motor Manufacturers br br Ford Sync br Lexus Voice Command br Chrysler UConnect br Honda Accord br GM IntelliLink br BMW br Mercedes br Pioneer br Harman br Hyundai br br br Non verbal input br While most voice user interfaces are designed to support interaction through spoken human language there have also been recent explorations in designing interfaces take non verbal human sounds as input In these systems the user controls the interface by emitting non speech sounds such as humming whistling or blowing into a microphone br One such example of a non verbal voice user interface is Blendie an interactive art installation created by Kelly Dobson The piece comprised a classic s era blender which was retrofitted to respond to microphone input To control the blender the user must mimic the whirring mechanical sounds that a blender typically makes the blender will spin slowly in response to a user s low pitched growl and increase in speed as the user makes higher pitched vocal sounds br Another example is VoiceDraw a research system that enables digital drawing for individuals with limited motor abilities VoiceDraw allows users to paint strokes on a digital canvas by modulating vowel sounds which are mapped to brush directions Modulating other paralinguistic features e g the loudness of their voice allows the user to control different features of the drawing such as the thickness of the brush stroke br Other approaches include adopting non verbal sounds to augment touch based interfaces e g on a mobile phone to support new types of gestures that wouldn t be possible with finger input alone br br br Design challenges br Voice interfaces pose a substantial number of challenges for usability In contrast to graphical user interfaces GUIs best practices for voice interface design are still emergent br br br Discoverability br With purely audio based interaction voice user interfaces tend to suffer from low discoverability it is difficult for users to understand the scope of a system s capabilities In order for the system to convey what is possible without a visual display it would need to enumerate the available options which can become tedious or infeasible Low discoverability often results in users reporting confusion over what they are allowed to say or a mismatch in expectations about the breadth of a system s understanding br br br Transcription br While speech recognition technology has improved considerably in recent years voice user interfaces still suffer from parsing or transcription errors in which a user s speech is not interpreted correctly These errors tend to be especially prevalent when the speech content uses technical vocabulary e g medical terminology or unconventional spellings such as musical artist or song names br br br Understanding br Effective system design to maximize conversational understanding remains an open area of research Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution named entity recognition information retrieval and dialog management Most voice assistants today are capable of executing single commands very well but limited in their ability to manage dialogue beyond a narrow task or a couple turns in a conversation br br br Future uses br br Pocket size devices such as PDAs or mobile phones currently rely on small buttons for user input These are either built into the device or are part of a touch screen interface such as that of the Apple iPod Touch and iPhone Siri Application Extensive button pressing on devices with such small buttons can be tedious and inaccurate so an easy to use accurate and reliable VUI would potentially be a major breakthrough in the ease of their use Nonetheless such a VUI would also benefit users of laptop and desktop sized computers as well as it would solve numerous problems currently associated with keyboard and mouse use including repetitive strain injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome the challenges of navigating and inputting text within digital interfaces by the visually impaired and slow typing speed on the part of inexperienced keyboard users Moreover keyboard use typically entails either sitting or standing stationary in front of the connected display by contrast a VUI would free the user to be far more mobile as speech input eliminates the need to look at a keyboard br Such developments could change the face of current machines and have far reaching implications on how users interact with them Hand held devices would be designed with larger easier to view screens as no keyboard would be required Touch screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on screen keyboard thus providing full screen viewing of the content Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built under the desk s surface Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices from microwave ovens to photocopiers could also be eliminated br Numerous challenges would have to be overcome however for such developments to occur First the VUI would have to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between input such as commands and background conversation otherwise false input would be registered and the connected device would behave erratically A standard prompt such as the famous Computer call by characters in science fiction TV shows and films such as Star Trek could activate the VUI and prepare it to receive further input by the same speaker Conceivably the VUI could also include a human like representation a voice or even an on screen character for instance that responds back e g Yes Vamshi and continues to communicate back and forth with the user in order to clarify the input received and ensure accuracy br Second the VUI would have to work in concert with highly sophisticated software in order to accurately process and find retrieve information or carry out an action as per the particular user s preferences For instance if Samantha prefers information from a particular newspaper and if she prefers that the information be summarized in point form she might say Computer find me some information about the flooding in southern China last night in response the VUI that is familiar with her preferences would find facts about flooding in southern China from that source convert it into point form and deliver it to her on screen and or in voice form complete with a citation Therefore accurate speech recognition software along with some degree of artificial intelligence on the part of the machine associated with the VUI would be required br br br Privacy implications br Privacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of voice user interfaces in unencrypted form and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech a user s manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity personality traits body shape physical and mental health condition sex gender moods and emotions socioeconomic status and geographical origin br br br See also br Speech synthesis
