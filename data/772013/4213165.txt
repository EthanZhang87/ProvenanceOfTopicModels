id: 4213165
Weight distribution is the apportioning of weight within a vehicle especially cars airplanes and trains Typically it is written in the form x y where x is the percentage of weight in the front and y is the percentage in the back br In a vehicle which relies on gravity in some way weight distribution directly affects a variety of vehicle characteristics including handling acceleration traction and component life For this reason weight distribution varies with the vehicle s intended usage For example a drag car maximizes traction at the rear axle while countering the reactionary pitch up torque It generates this counter torque by placing a small amount of counterweight at a great distance forward of the rear axle br In the airline industry load balancing is used to evenly distribute the weight of passengers cargo and fuel throughout an aircraft so as to keep the aircraft s center of gravity close to its center of pressure to avoid losing pitch control In military transport aircraft it is common to have a loadmaster as a part of the crew their responsibilities include calculating accurate load information for center of gravity calculations and ensuring cargo is properly secured to prevent its shifting br In large aircraft and ships multiple fuel tanks and pumps are often used so that as fuel is consumed the remaining fuel can be positioned to keep the vehicle balanced and to reduce stability problems associated with the free surface effect br In the trucking industry individual axle weight limits require balancing the cargo when the gross vehicle weight nears the legal limit br br br See also br Center of mass br Center of percussion br Load transfer br Mass distribution br Roll center br Tilt test br Weight transfer br br br br br br External links br Weight Distribution Calculator
