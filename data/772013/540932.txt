id: 540932
The Pontiac Bonneville is a model line of full size or mid size front engine rear drive cars manufactured and marketed by Pontiac from until with a hiatus for model years br The Bonneville marketed as the Parisienne in Canada until and its platform partner the Grand Ville are some of the largest Pontiacs ever built in station wagon body styles they reached just over inches m long and at pounds kg and more were also some of the heaviest cars produced at the time br The Bonneville nameplate was introduced as a limited production performance convertible during the model year its name taken from the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah an early site of US auto racing and numerous world s land speed record records itself named after U S Army officer Benjamin Bonneville br br br Origin br br The Bonneville name first appeared in on a pair of bubble topped GM Motorama concept cars called the Bonneville Special sharing an appearance with the Chevrolet Corvette It was also the beginning of a new tradition of Pontiac vehicles using French words for model names br It entered the production lineup as a high performance fuel injected luxury convertible version of the Star Chief in and was loaded with every available option as standard equipment to include leather upholstery power adjustable front seat power windows power steering power brakes and power convertible top with the exception of air conditioning and a fashionable for the time continental kit br Standard only for the Bonneville was Pontiac s first ever fuel injection system A mechanical system built by Rochester it was similar in principle but not identical to the contemporary Chevrolet Bel Air installed with the Rochester Ramjet continuous mechanical fuel injection closed loop Pontiac did not release official power ratings for this engine which had only been introduced earlier in replacing the flathead straight eight saying only that it had more than hp kW Contemporary road tests suggest that it was actually somewhat inferior to the Tri Power engines although it did have better fuel economy br This put the Bonneville in a Cadillac like price range of US in dollars more than double the base price of the Chieftain on which it was built with the result being a fully equipped Bonneville could cost more than the longer entry level Cadillac Series Only units were produced that first year all of them fuel injected making it one of the most collectible Pontiacs of all time and was introduced to compete with the Chrysler C The following year it became a separate model and it would endure until as the division s top of the line model br br br First generation br br The Bonneville became a separate model in available as a two door hardtop or a convertible It paced the Indianapolis in its first year As a separate model Bonneville had a significantly lower price tag of in dollars for the convertible thanks to the removal of most of the luxury items found on the Star Chief bodystyle from standard equipment to the option list Also a hp kW cu in cc V marketed as a with four barrel carburetor and dual exhausts was now standard equipment br The fuel injection system continued to be offered with the standard engine on the Star Chief bodystyle was now listed as an extra cost option but very few Bonnevilles were so equipped due to a towering option price tag of US in dollars which was not considered a very good value considering that for US a more reliable Tri Power option was available with three Rochester two barrel carburetors and similar power The Tri Power produces a claimed hp kW while the fuel injected version was rated at hp kW at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm on compression br The retail price dropped from the previous year to US in dollars for the coupe adding leather interior and a power operated convertible top The fuel injected engine became an option on any Pontiac model Only about were produced before the fuel injection system was quietly dropped and fuel injection would not be offered on the Bonneville until with the Eighth Generation br br For GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production and introduced Anniversary models for each brand Cadillac Buick Oldsmobile Pontiac and Chevrolet The models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand Cadillac Eldorado Seville Buick Limited Riviera Oldsmobile Starfire Pontiac Bonneville Catalina and the all new Chevrolet Bel Air Impala was also the year the Silver Streak styling feature was no longer offered which was first used in It was also the last year of Harley Earls tenure as department head of GM s Art and Colour Section br br br br br br br br br br br Second generation br br In its third year the Bonneville became the senior series with the addition of the four door hardtop sedan and Safari station wagon body styles while the Pontiac Catalina became the junior series The Bonneville played an important part that year in the introduction of two of Pontiac s greatest marketing inspirations the split grille and the Wide Track slogan introducing a front tread width of in mm and rear tread width of in mm as opposed to other GM products with a in mm width for front and rear width At the bottom of the rear quarters a skeg a downward fin jutted outboard to counterbalance the rearward point of the quarter panel br The Wide Track slogan was not just ad copy either as Pontiac pushed its wheels further out toward the fenders than anyone else and created what were considered to be the best cornering full size cars in the industry Both the grille design and the Wide Track phrase remained part of Pontiac s image up to the brand s termination A Safe T Track differential used to minimize wheel spin was an option beginning in As the platform expanded to add sedans and the Safari station wagons they were also used as a basis for various specialty cars such as hearses br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Third generation br br The Bonneville was Pontiac s senior model throughout the s and was instrumental in pushing Pontiac to third place in sales from to br The distinctive protruding grille made its appearance on all Pontiac products during the early s and was a modern revival of a similar appearance on Pontiac products during the s and early s as demonstrated on the Pontiac Torpedo br The Bonneville differed from its lesser Catalina and Star Chief counterparts by featuring more luxurious interior trim with upgraded cloth and Morrokide vinyl or expanded Morrokide upholstery in sedans and coupes expanded Morrokide in Safari wagons and genuine leather seating in convertibles Bonnevilles with the exception of Bonneville Safari station wagons were also along with Star Chiefs built on a longer wheelbase version of GM s B Body The hardtop coupe had a listed retail price of in dollars br In the Bonneville coupe was offered along with the all new Pontiac Grand Prix which has the same luxurious interior of the Bonneville on the shorter Catalina wheelbase and the Grand Prix was slightly more expensive and exclusive br For a luxurious appearance the Bonneville came with instrument panels and door panels with walnut veneer trim carpeted lower door panels grab bar on the passenger side of the dash and courtesy lights and a rear arm rest Beginning in a Bonneville Brougham option package was available that included an even more luxurious interior trim level with front and rear seats featuring center armrests upgraded door panels and a standard Cordova vinyl roof with Brougham nameplates The two door hardtop was marketed as the Sports Coupe the four door pillarless models were called Vistas br Bonneville models were standard equipped with Hydra Matic through or Turbo Hydra Matic on automatic transmissions Options included power steering and power brakes as well as air conditioning Other popular options included power windows power seats radio cruise control and lug aluminum wheels that included integral brake drums for improved stopping power br The Bonneville also had more powerful standard V engines than other full sized Pontiacs including the cu in L or cu in L V s with four barrel carburetors power ratings of to hp to kW depending on year with many optional V offerings such as the availability of the Tri Power three two barrel carburetor options on both the cu in L and cu in L V s that offered up to hp kW through br For only Pontiac offered the cu in L Super Duty with two four barrel carburetors rated at hp kW as a US option in dollars whereas the base Bonneville was listed at US in dollars br br br Fourth generation br br In B Body Pontiacs received a dramatic restyle featuring fastback rooflines on coupes rakish fender lines and even more pronounced Coke bottle styling Bonnevilles followed largely the same styling cues as on other Pontiacs but was inches longer thanks to its new inch wheelbase chassis The interior featured new instrumentation and dashboard styling as well as new upholstery This series Bonneville retained the longer wheelbase over the Grand Prix but the hardtop coupe was priced lower at in dollars and was not offered the center console included in the Grand Prix This generation also introduced fender skirts over the rear wheels for an upscale look shared with Cadillac Buick and Oldsmobile senior models br Engine options remained unchanged from the model year with a cu in L hp unit being standard equipped with a Carter AFB barrel carburetor A cu in L engine was an optional upgrade Both engines had choices of Tri Power multi carburetion setups and higher compression ratios br New for Pontiacs in was GM s Turbo Hydramatic transmission which was released the year prior This new speed unit had a torque converter unlike the old fluid coupling based Super Hydramatic featured on past Bonneville models The new transmission also changed the shift pattern from P N D S L R to a safer and ultimately more modern P R N D S L br In Pontiac Motor Division received the Motor Trend Car of the Year award As part of this award Motor Trend reviewed GTO Grand Prix Catalina and Bonneville br In the Bonneville featured a minor update with new front and rear sheet metal trim and bright work The interior saw some updates including a more squared up dashboard and minor changes in instrumentation Powertrain components were the same as br The Bonneville for received a major update over the previous years Styling was changed dramatically and featured a new grille in bumper front design more creases to accentuate the Coke bottle styling and an updated rear fascia The interior featured a new wraparound style dash with new switchgear instrumentation and trim As per the up and coming US Title legislation Bonnevilles were equipped with seatbelts as standard as well as other government mandated safety equipment br also saw a large powertrain and chassis refresh for Pontiac The cubic inch plant was replaced with cu in L one and the cubic inch plant was replaced with a cu in L one As per GM s internal edict the multi carburation setups found on earlier cars were replaced with the new Quadra Jet spread bore carburetor Carter AFB carburetors were still standard but the Quadra Jet was featured as the new High performance upgrade A myriad of horsepower ratings were optional A dual circuit master cylinder was standard as per legislation and disc brakes became an optional extra br saw a large styling update for Bonneville The front fascia was heavily revised with new side by side headlights however the side and rear styling stayed largely the same from The interior saw some minor updates to styling with less chrome as well as an available Track Tape player br Power was upgraded to horsepower on the base CI engine up from on the model year the CI engine remained an option br In the rest of the Bonneville s styling was updated The front fascia stayed similar to however the rest of the car saw a restyle The creases on the side were removed and the overall Coke Bottle effect was lessened The rear end saw widened taillights and a color coded bumper insert The interior saw even more updates featuring more padding wood trim and a slanted dashboard br Power trains were upgraded to a standard hp CI engine br saw the most dramatic update to styling for Bonneville featuring an entirely new front fascia with more square features and an updated vertical twin grille design Wrap around amber turn signals were integrated into the lower bumper Side body lines remained similar to the model year however the rear design was completely revised with lowered tail lights and bumper with a design more similar to that of and model years than those directly prior br The interior was similar to the model year retaining the slanted design and minimal chrome trim br A new cu in L V was made standard for the model year with the CI engine being an option br br br Fifth generation br br For the Bonneville was downgraded in the model hierarchy as a new top line Grand Ville series was introduced In effect it took the place of the discontinued Executive above the lower priced Catalina The Bonneville had new Monocoque styling and was offered in three body styles a pillared four door sedan four door hardtop sedan and two door hardtop coupe The standard engine for was a cubic inch V with two barrel carburetor that was rated at gross horsepower for and net horsepower for and optionally available was the four barrel version of the rated at gross horsepower in and net horsepower in The on paper power ratings reflect the change in power measurement undertaken by the industry for was also the first year for Pontiac and other GM divisions to reduce compression ratios on all engines across the board to operate on lower octane regular leaded low lead or unleaded gasoline reflecting a corporate edict anticipating the introduction of catalytic converters in to help meet increasingly stringent federal and California emission requirements br In mid a Turbo Hydramatic transmission power steering and power front disc brakes became standard equipment on Bonneville and other full sized Pontiacs as well as other full sized GM cars br From to the Bonneville s standard engine dropped to a horsepower cubic inch V Optionally available was the four barrel V rated at horsepower kW in and and in and In Bonneville was the only full sized Pontiac to offer a Radial Tuned Suspension option package which included the steel belted radial tires along with an upgraded suspension with Pliacell shock absorbers and front and rear sway bars The RTS option was expanded for to all full sized Pontiacs and radial ply tires became standard on all models though an upgraded RTS package was still available as an option br saw the end of the pillarless two door hardtop model replaced by a coupe with frameless door glass but with a thick B pillar and fixed rear opera window The model year introduced rectangular headlights its frontal appearance was similar to the Cadillac DeVilles and Fleetwoods of the same era br With the demise of the Grand Ville series after Bonneville once again became the top line full sized Pontiac series with a Bonneville Brougham model featuring the luxurious interior appointments from the departed Grand Ville br Adjustable pedals were optional in the last year the Bonneville was offered as a pillarless door hardtop all subsequent Bonnevilles would have a thick B pillar and metal framed door glass br br br br br br br Size comparison between and full size Pontiac sedans br br br Sixth generation br br The Bonneville was significantly downsized for model year Bonnevilles and Catalinas were inches mm shorter in length over four inches mm narrower and pounds lighter compared to their counterparts while offering increased headroom rear seat legroom and trunk space and much improved fuel economy a major selling point in the years following the energy crisis br Only a pillared four door sedan and two door coupe with optional opera windows were offered as the hardtop sedans and hardtop coupes offered in previous years were discontinued for all GM divisions br The Bonneville regained the Safari station wagon as part of its model lineup for the first time since with faux woodgrain exterior trim and interior appointments shared with Bonneville coupes and sedans The Safari was available in both and passenger configurations and featured a dual action side or bottom hinged tailgate rather than the disappearing clamshell tailgates of full sized Pontiac wagons br For and the standard engine in Bonneville was Pontiac s new cubic inch V rated at horsepower kW while optional engines included a horsepower or horsepower cubic inch V A horsepower Oldsmobile cubic inch V was also an option In later years increasingly stringent fuel economy standards mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE regulations would lead to the discontinuation of the larger engines with a cubic inch Buick V becoming the standard engine on Bonneville coupes and sedans for and with the only optional V s offered including and cubic inch Pontiac built gasoline engines or an Oldsmobile built cid diesel powerplant br For all GM B bodies received revised styling and aerodynamic improvements along with reduced weight br The Bonneville and Catalina already the smallest selling of GM s B body line suffered a serious drop in demand following the economic recession that began in the spring of With that GM discontinued the th generation with the model year along with the and engines br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Seventh generation br br Following the discontinuation of full sized Pontiacs the Bonneville name was instead simply swapped onto the midsized LeMans which also suffered from poor sales Thus GM planners reasoned that attaching a more well known model name to it would spark demand This model had been produced since along with its siblings the Chevrolet Malibu Oldsmobile Cutlass and Buick Century and sported a Buick cid V Chevrolet cid V or Oldsmobile cid diesel V A Buick liter V was available in The models were officially known as the Pontiac Bonneville Model G built on the GM G platform although later models were not badged as such Styling was revised to bear a closer resemblance to the departed B body Bonneville and coupes were dropped GM also began marketing the Bonneville in Canada for the first time starting in and Canadian models carried the Grand LeMans name as GM s full size Bonnevilles in Canada were referred to as Parisienne br While the previous LeMans on which the new Bonneville was based was classified as an A Body introduction of GM s new front wheel drive A bodies e g Pontiac in prompted the change to Model G on these RWD cars was the last year for the G body station wagon as the Pontiac s wagon replaced it The Bonneville sedan continued in base Limited Edition LE and Brougham versions through The Bonnevilles are direct descendants of the Pontiac Tempest These Bonnevilles were the smallest and the last of the old breed of Bonnevilles having rear wheel drive full perimeter frame body on frame and old fashioned American car ride and styling br br However some Pontiac customers did not take to the downsized Bonneville as a portion of new car buyers were switching their preferences from compact and mid sized cars back to full sized V powered cars thanks to improving gasoline prices Late in the model year Pontiac reintroduced a full sized car to the American market by bringing over the Canadian built Pontiac Parisienne which was essentially a restyled Chevrolet Caprice and powered by Chevrolet V or V engines The Bonneville was then again one notch below the top of the line from late through br However exactly as before a downsizing proved its salvation In the Parisienne was discontinued and the Bonneville was completely redesigned as a front wheel drive car rejoining its pre platform mates the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Delta and it regained its status as the senior Pontiac br br br Eighth generation br br For Pontiac migrated the Bonneville from the rear drive G body with a V to the GM s one year old front drive H Body platform shared with the Buick LeSabre and Oldsmobile Initially a hp kW L V was the sole engine mated to a four speed Hydramatic T automatic in base and LE trim levels The base model was only used for For LE models an SSE sport package was also available featuring a quicker gear ratio sportier suspension and more standard features marketed as having a more sporty European character than the LeSabre and br br For model year MY Pontiac replaced the LG engine with a revised version of the same engine with an increase of hp and ft lbf N m of torque the engine now used a regular production code RPO LN and was now called the V Featuring sequential port fuel injection the engine produced hp kW and lb ft N m Other models on the H body platform were fitted with the LN engine one year later in The LN was used through since the Bonneville was redesigned for the model year br Also in the LE model which was previously the top trim level for becomes the base trim The base model which was used for was dropped Additionally two new models are introduced the midlevel SE which went from an option package to a trim level and the SSE trim The SE and SSE trims were then available with many more comfort and convenience options standard such as electronic climate control a digital compass Driver Information Center way way for the SSE according to GM material power leather seats heated power mirrors CD player with the premium sound package and many more br The SSE features an extra deep rear valence a spoiler lower body cladding a digital compass trip computer an eight speaker premium sound system

exterior sport appearance package that included body cladding assorted ground effects a body color grille and removal of the Bonneville door badges and Pontiac trunk badge and replacing the Bonneville trunk badge with an SSE Bonneville badge br For a compact disc player and remote keyless entry became optional For models a facelift was introduced for the Bonneville with revisions to the grille headlights and taillights which included amber rear turn signal indicators For the model year Pontiac made suspension revisions was also the last year for the first front wheel drive generation of the Bonneville br br br Ninth generation br br The ninth generation Bonneville debuted on February at the Chicago International Auto Show with sales launching in July for the model year The exterior featured an aerodynamic drag coefficient of the interior featured a trunk pass through and two available engines the naturally aspirated liter V and its supercharged variants Both engines used a speed overdrive automatic transmission The ninth generation Bonneville was the first General Motors vehicle available with dual front passenger airbags br Developed over a year period from to early under program director Dave Mitchell styling work took place from to with a final design by John Folden chosen in and frozen for production that same year The first prototypes were built in and entered testing in mid In August production preparation began with early production builds constructed during late The first series production models were assembled in May with SE variants launched in July br Entry trim was the SE the only trim with available six passenger seating the SSE was the mid level trim and the SSEi was the new top level trim which received a standard passenger side airbag According to Pontiac the trim acronyms had no implied meaning The base and mid level models offered GM s naturally aspirated liter V and the SSEi received its supercharged variant All engines used a speed overdrive automatic transmission SSEi models received dual airbags and antilock brakes SE and SSE models received a driver side airbag and optional ABS The SSE models came with standard ABS and traction control br The new N A Series I RPO L engine was used producing hp kW and lbf ft N m as well as the newly designed force inducted Series I RPO L equipped with an Eaton M roots type supercharger which made hp kW and lbf ft N m The newly revised N A L for the model year only was not equipped with an EGR Valve and can be distinguished by its white intake manifold as opposed to

Certain equipment such as electronic climate control and premium sound could be deleted from an SLE equipped car Through SE models equipped with the Supercharged engine option required the SLE H U package These carried SE emblems and the SLE H U appeared on the Series Production Identification SPID label of equipped vehicles as an Regular Production order RPO code For MY SLE emblems were added to the vehicle exterior The SLE trim continued onto the model year Many more standard was included with the SSE trim The SSEi came standard with most of the available options in the lower models as well as the supercharged engine RPO L br MY For SSEi trims used a new Generation III Eaton M supercharger with integral OBD capabilities raising the horsepower to hp kW and torque to lbf ft N m MY introduced the new five spoke Torque Star wheels and exhaust resonator to lower the engine s tone and front passenger airbag The former SSEi trim level became an SSEi Supercharger Package Traction control became optional for the SSE trims which included GM s Computer Command Ride suspension s designed to reduce body lean and pitch and automatically adjust the suspension from soft to firm when cornering accelerating or stopping br MY For SE and SSE trims received the naturally aspirated Series II engine RPO L making hp kW and lbf ft N m The SSEi was equipped with the Series I SC RPO L engine until the model year when it too was updated br br br br br br MY In September styling changes were introduced for the model year facelift with revised tail lights headlights grille and lower

rarest model br MY For the Bonneville gets no major changes However a new transmission the T E was introduced for the naturally aspirated installed in SE and SSE models For the Bonneville essentially stood pat since an all new model would arrive in br In March GM announced that these engines and other GM engines supplied with Dexcool antifreeze coolant might be prone to intake manifold failure and other problems with the cooling system if proper regular maintenance is not correctly performed After settlement of a class action lawsuit GM agreed to compensate owners of many vehicles that suffered
