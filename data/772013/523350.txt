id: 523350
A suicide door is an automobile door hinged at its rear rather than the front Such doors were originally used on horse drawn carriages but are rarely found on modern vehicles primarily because they are less safe than a front hinged door Being rear hinged if the vehicle were moving and the door opened aerodynamic drag would force the door open and the driver passenger would have to lean forward and out of the vehicle to close it As seat belts were not in common use at that time the risk of falling out of the car and into traffic was high hence the name suicide door Another reason could have been that while a door was open on a city street a speeding car moving in the same direction as the parked car could rip a front hinged door off the parked car but someone inside the adjacent seat even if moving to leave the car could not get scratched However with a suicide door someone inside or partially outside the passenger compartment would get struck by the suicide door forcefully swinging back to a shut position due to the impact of the speeding car on the door br Initially standard on many models later they became popularized in the custom car trade Automobile manufacturers

were common on cars manufactured in the first half of the th century including the iconic Citro n Traction Avant In the era before seat belts the accidental opening of such doors meant that there was a greater risk of falling out of the vehicle compared to front hinged doors where airflow pushed the doors closed rather than opening them further br Rear hinged doors were especially popular with mobsters in the gangster era of the s supposedly owing to the ease of pushing passengers out of moving vehicles with the air around the moving car holding the door open according to Dave Brownell the former editor of Hemmings Motor News br After World War II rear hinged doors were mostly limited to rear doors of four door sedans The best known use of rear hinged doors on post World War II American

few Chinese electric vehicles including the Singulato iS in and HiPhi X in Lincoln announced that limited edition Continentals would be made with coach doors marking the Continental s th anniversary The Citroen Ami electric vehicle is unusual in having a suicide door for the driver but a conventional door for the passenger as the doors are identical units that are not differentiated by side br In the early s rear hinged rear doors that are held closed by the front doors and cannot be opened until released by opening the front door on the same side hinged at the front have appeared on a number
