title: Automobile auxiliary power outlet
id: 10407767
An automobile auxiliary power outlet also known as car cigarette lighter or auxiliary power outlet in an automobile was initially designed to power an electrically heated cigarette lighter but became a de facto standard DC connector to supply electrical power for portable accessories used in or near an automobile directly from the vehicle s electrical system Such include mobile phone chargers cooling fans portable fridges electric air pumps and power inverters br In most vehicles at least one car outlet is present Some vehicles may have more power outlets usually one for the front passengers one for the rear passengers and one for the luggage trunk br The voltage of the power outlet is usually near V DC and may be elevated between V to V while the engine is running br The V power circuit is protected by a car fuse often rated at to amperes which provides to watts of power Large appliances such as hair dryers or toasters draw too much power to be fed from an auxiliary power socket If wired directly rather than through the ignition an empty car battery can be charged through the outlet from an external power source which is more convenient albeit slower than currents supported through electrical clamps on the car battery br br br History br The electrical cigar lighter was invented and patented in the early s by the Swiss Austrian inventor Friedrich Wilhelm Schindler In the s these tools were sold as electrical cigar lighters Cigarrenanz nder later Zigarrenanz nder in the major German warehouse catalogues Before the Great Depression cigarettes overtook cigars in sale and they became more popularly known as cigarette lighters though they have remained the diameter of a standard cigar of millimetres in or a ring gauge br In the Morris U S patent was issued for a so called wireless or cordless lighter with a removable element The igniter was heated in the socket and then manually removed for use after an appropriate time interval br In the United States cigarette lighters started appearing in in some models They were a standard feature by the s br In the Connecticut Automotive Specialty Company Casco in Bridgeport patented its version of an automotive cigarette lighter which used a cord and reel In the reel type lighters the igniter unit was connected with a source of current by a cable which was wound on a spring drum so that the igniter unit and cable could be withdrawn from the socket and be used for lighting a cigar or cigarette As the removable plug was returned to the socket the wires were reeled back into it The circuit was closed either by pressing a button or removing the igniter from its socket br The modern automatic removable automotive V Coil lighter was developed by Casco in for which it received U S patent issued in br br br Technical design br The sockets and mating plugs are defined in the ANSI SAE J specification For the volt systems the center contact is the positive terminal and the shell is the negative terminal Most automobiles connect the negative terminal to the frame of the vehicle negative ground br volt auto connectors are made to comply with a standard by Underwriters Laboratories for safety UL was developed to cover the requirements for portable adapters rated V DC or less that are intended to be supplied from the battery powered electrical system of a vehicle Products covered by the standard include cord assemblies of a plug that mates with the standard cigarette receptacle found in automobiles br br volt cigarette lighter receptacle and plug br Receptacle inside diameter

sometimes as a second socket in American automobiles expressly for DC power connections br Plugs often include a pilot light LED indicator to indicate that electrical power is connected Optionally the plug may be equipped with an internal fuse for electrical safety usually rated at amps or less In some designs the tip of the plug may be unscrewed to reveal a cylindrical glass fuse other variants may use a blade type fuse inserted into the side or back of the plug br br br Uses br br br Lighter br br The lighter is a metal or plastic cylinder containing a thin flat coil of nichrome metal strip through which high current amperes passes when the device is activated usually by pushing it into the socket as though it were a push button When pushed in the lighter is held against the force of a spring by a clip attached to a bimetallic strip The heating element glows orange hot in seconds causing the bimetallic strip to bend and release the mechanism The handle pops out eliminating the need for the user to time the heating operation If the lighter is then promptly removed from its socket it can light a cigarette cigar or tinder br A common feature of Italian cars in the s to the s such as Alfa Romeos and Ferraris is the Brico Pram cigarette lighter which differs from conventional designs in that the lighter does not pop out for removal to light a cigarette even though it visually resembles the traditional design Instead the center of the lighter features a tapered opening for the user to insert a cigarette until it touches the heating element the rim of the handle is then pressed down to activate the lighter the heating element then lights the cigarette and disengages the circuit with an audible ping once the desired temperature is reached as per a conventional lighter The advantage of such a design is in safety as the red hot heating element cannot be accidentally dropped onto an occupant s lap Still it takes away the ability for the lighter to be removed for the receptacle to be used as a power outlet and it also does not allow cigars to be lit as the opening is not large enough br br br Electrical outlet br br In newer cars the socket is equipped with a plastic cover without the lighter heating element However the socket has been repurposed and continues to be used to power consumer electronics in vehicles Often a vehicle may come with several outlets for convenience some in the rear passenger area of the vehicle or even the cargo area for powering portable devices These outlets usually have a plastic cap tethered to them and are usually labeled as being only for DC power because they are not intended to withstand the heat produced by an electrical cigarette lighter br The use of cigarette lighter receptacles to supply volt DC power is an example of backward compatibility to a de facto standard As a power connector the lighter receptacle is larger harder to use and less reliable than other DC connectors Cigarette lighter receptacles are in widespread use in many highway vehicles and some boats Portable cigarette lighter receptacles attached to cables and alligator clips for connection directly to car batteries are available for temporary use In newer vehicles one or more USB connectors may also be provided Plus in newer cars the power output from the lighter plug is so reliable that it can charge laptops without any voltage problems br Standardized volt DC automobile plugs are defined in the United States by UL Standard regarding vehicle battery adapters This standard covers plugs and cord sets that insert into cigarette lighter receptacles In Europe volt plugs and sockets are not specially regulated and do not require approvals for the CE mark br The male plug is sometimes used to feed power into a vehicle to recharge its battery because it usually has no regulatory circuitry between the outlet and the car battery For instance portable solar battery maintainers generally connect to a vehicle s battery in this manner Trickle chargers also sometimes connect in this way eliminating the need to leave a vehicle s hood open as well as eliminating the possibility of reversed polarity Most cars nowadays are designed with a battery negative earthing system and therefore have a V positive power distribution In such a case the centre pin of a plug socket will be V DC and the outer casing V While polarity is not an issue for a cigarette lighter it is prudent to verify the correct matching of polarities when connecting other kinds of accessories br In some models the cigarette lighter outlet is not powered when the ignition key is removed and charging is not possible though modification of the fuse box may allow unlocking continuous power output by establishing a parallel circuit from a continuously powered fuse slot through a piggyback connector br Since the cigarette lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors can lead to many problems In addition to the issues with partially compatible physical dimensions the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions owing to poor retention Also there have been reports of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance br A second problem is that nominally twelve volt power in cars fluctuates widely The outlet is connected directly to the electrical system of the car The actual voltage matching the car battery s voltage will be approximately volts when dormant less in cold conditions approximately volts when the engine and the alternator generator are operating more when cold and may briefly drop as low as volts during engine start due to the high temporary battery current usage When used DC to DC converters will usually compensate for small fluctuations but reliable power may not be available without an independent battery powered uninterruptible power supply br Rarely more extreme cases of voltage fluctuation can occur when the car battery is disconnected while the engine is running or when the car receives a jump start When the battery is disconnected while the engine is running its voltage smoothing effect similar to capacitors is unavailable and a load dump transient can produce very high voltages as the built in voltage regulator has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value The load dump transient may also ruin the diodes in the alternator by exceeding their breakdown voltage A car receiving a jump start from a truck may be subject to a V electrical system used in some vehicles Also a double battery jump start is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates br Equipment intended to be powered by the receptacle needs to account for intermittent contact and voltages outside the nominal V DC such as maximum voltage V continuously or maximum voltage of V lasting hour V lasting minute and V lasting ms An example of protection component ratings tolerance is to V DC Robust equipment must tolerate temperatures varying between and C and F plus possible high humidity and condensation of water br br br See also br Automobile accessory power br EmPower aircraft power adapter br Inductive charging
