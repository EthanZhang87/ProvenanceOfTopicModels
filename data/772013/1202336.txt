Power windows or electric windows are automobile windows which can be raised and lowered by pressing a button or switch as opposed to using a crank handle br br br History br br Packard had introduced hydraulic window lifts power windows in fall of for its new Packard series cars This was a hydro electric system In the Ford Motor Company followed with the first power windows on the Lincoln Custom only the limousine and seven passenger sedans Cadillac had a straight electric divider window but not side windows on their series br Power assists originated in the need and desire to move convertible body style tops up and down by some means other than human effort The earliest power assists were vacuum operated and were offered on Chrysler Corporation vehicles particularly the low cost Plymouth convertibles in the late s br Shortly before World War II General Motors developed a central hydraulic pump for working convertible tops This system was introduced on convertibles built by GM Previously GM had used a vacuum system which did not have the power to handle increasingly larger and complex four side windows vs only two convertible top mechanisms br Chief Engineer of the Buick Division Charles A Chayne had introduced an electrically controlled hydraulic system into the Buick convertibles that provided fingertip operation of the top door windows and front seat adjustment These systems were based on major hydraulic advances made in military weapons in preparation for World War II br The Hydro Electric system windows front seat adjustment and convertible top was standard on model year The seat and window assist system became available on GM closed cars standard on some Cadillac Series models and all Series Specials commonly called Fleetwood beginning with the The full system was standard only on the high end GM convertibles made by Oldsmobile Buick and Cadillac It was only available as a package that is power assisted windows front seat and convertible top where applicable This feature can be identified in and later General Motors model numbers with an X at the end such as the Cadillac Sixty Special sedan model X The electrically operated hydraulic pump system was shared by Hudson and Packard for their through models The driver s door contained four buttons in addition to the remaining individual windows br Ford also had a similar electro hydraulic system on higher end convertibles Mercury and Ford Sportsman convertibles with wood trim were equipped with power windows on four windows from through and Mercury and Lincoln by These systems were used by other luxury car models Imperial and Packard until Chrysler introduced the all electric operation on the Imperial The availability of power windows increased with the use of small high torque electric motors General Motors also followed with full electric operation in This included four way and then six way seats which were introduced in Chevrolet introduced the oddity of power front windows only in the model Ford also introduced full four door power windows in sedans in The full sized Nash Airflyte models featured optional power windows br Electrically operated vent windows were available as early as on the Continental Mark II The s Cadillac Fleetwood came standard with power front and rear vent windows in addition to standard power side windows for a total of eight power window controls on the driver s door panel br Modern heavy duty highway tractors frequently have an option for power window controls however these are generally what is referred to as straight air That is the compressed air system used for air brakes is also used for the windows These types of trucks have long used compressed air cylinders for seat height adjustment In a similar fashion to the electro hydraulic system the compressed air is merely released to lower the window and or seat The compressed air is then admitted to the respective cylinder to raise the window or seat br In a typical auto light truck installation there is an individual switch at each window and a set of switches in the driver s door or a frame pillar so the driver can operate all the windows These switches took on many different appearances from heavy chrome plate to inexpensive plastic br However some models like Saab Volvo Mazda and Holden have used switches located in the center console where they are accessible to all the occupants In this case the door mounted switches can be omitted This also removes the need to produce separate door components and wiring for left and right hand drive variants br br br Operation br Power windows are usually inoperable when the car is not running This is primarily a security feature It would be a simple thing to allow electric power windows to be operable when the ignition is turned off however it would also make the car much easier to steal Some systems offer the compromise of leaving power applied to the windows until a passenger door is opened at which time the window power is removed br Hydraulic drive systems could lower the windows at rest since pressure from the hydraulic system was merely released to lower the window Raising the windows required an electrically operated pump to operate and introduce pressure at the appropriate cylinder These systems also required pressure lines to each cylinder in the doors as well as on certain cars to the power seat and a power operated convertible top Because of the complexity the system could also leak fluid br Many modern cars have a time delay feature first introduced by Cadillac in the s called retained accessory power This allows operation of the windows and some other accessories for ten minutes or so after the engine is stopped Another feature is the express down window which allows the window to be fully lowered with one tap on the switch as opposed to holding the switch down until the window retracts Many luxury vehicles during the s expanded on this feature to include express up on the driver s window and recently some manufacturers have added the feature on all window switches for all passengers convenience This is done by activating the switch until a click response is felt br Power windows have become so common that by some automakers eliminated hand crank windows from all their models So many vehicles now have power windows that some people no longer understand the formerly common sign from another driver of using their hand to simulate moving a window crank to indicate that they wish to speak with someone when stopped at a light or in a parking lot The Audi RS sold in Europe however still has roll up windows for the rear doors although its counterpart sold in the U S has power windows for all doors br br br Safety br Power windows have come under some scrutiny after several fatal accidents in which children s necks have become trapped leading to suffocation Some designs place the switch in a location on a hand rest where it can be accidentally triggered by a child climbing to place his or her head out of the window To prevent this many vehicles feature a driver controlled lockout switch preventing rear seat passengers usually smaller children from accidentally triggering the switches This also prevents children from playing with them and pets riding with their heads out windows from activating the power window switch br A power window lockout switch is a popular convenience that allows the driver to prevent passengers usually children from using the windows Many cars have a feature called courtesy power on which allows the windows to remain operational for a brief period after the key is taken out of the ignition so that adjustments can be made without putting the key back in Additionally some vehicles offer the option to operate the windows from outside the car using a remote br Starting with the model year U S government regulations required automakers to install safety mechanisms to improve child safety However the rules do not prevent all potential injuries to a hand finger or even a child s head if someone deliberately holds the switch when the window is closing In the U S auto safety administration tentatively decided against requiring all cars to have automatic reversing power windows if they sense an obstruction while closing Proposed requirements concern automatic one touch up window systems but most vehicles with this feature already have automatic reversing The federal government made a written contract that all automakers should make the lever switches as opposed to the rocker and toggle switches standard on all new vehicles by October br br br br br br External links br Power Windows Are Perilous CBS News br Fixing Power Windows br Nice Karim How Power Windows Work
