title: Vehicle registration plate
id: 237221
A vehicle registration plate also known as a number plate British Indian and Australian English or license plate American English or licence plate Canadian English is a metal or plastic plate attached to a motor vehicle or trailer for official identification purposes All countries require registration plates for road vehicles such as cars trucks and motorcycles Whether they are required for other vehicles such as bicycles boats or tractors may vary by jurisdiction The registration identifier is a numeric or alphanumeric ID that uniquely identifies the vehicle or vehicle owner within the issuing region s vehicle register In some countries the identifier is unique within the entire country while in others it is unique within a state or province Whether the identifier is associated with a vehicle or a person also varies by issuing agency There are also electronic license plates br br br Legal requirements br br In Europe most governments require a registration plate to be attached to both the front and rear of a vehicle although certain jurisdictions or vehicle types such as motorcycles require only one plate which is usually attached to the rear of the vehicle Special vehicles such as agricultural and construction equipment might have the license plate attached to other parts of the vehicle National databases relate this number to other information describing the vehicle such as the make model colour year of manufacture engine size type of fuel used mileage recorded and other similar data in jurisdictions where vehicles are regularly inspected for roadworthiness every year or two vehicle identification number chassis number and the name and address of the vehicle s registered owner or keeper br br In the vast majority of jurisdictions the government holds a monopoly on the manufacturing of vehicle registration plates for that jurisdiction Either a government agency or a private company with express contractual authorization from the government makes plates as needed which are then mailed to delivered to or picked up by the vehicle owners Thus it is normally illegal for private citizens to make and affix their own plates because such unauthorized private manufacturing is equivalent to forging an official document Alternatively the government will merely assign plate numbers and it is the vehicle owner s responsibility to find an approved private supplier to make a plate with that number Additionally citizens can create custom plates following specific guidelines and naming conventions approved by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency DVLA br In some jurisdictions plates will be permanently assigned to that particular vehicle for its lifetime If the vehicle is either destroyed or exported to a different jurisdiction the plate number is retired or reissued exported vehicles must be re registered in the jurisdiction of import China requires the re registration of any vehicle that crosses its borders from another country such as for overland tourist visits regardless of the length of time it is due to remain there this has to be arranged with prior approval Other jurisdictions follow a plate to owner policy meaning that when a vehicle is sold the seller removes the current plate s from the vehicle Buyers must either obtain new plates or attach plates they already hold as well as register their vehicles under the buyer s name and plate number A person who sells a car and then purchases a new one can apply to have the old plates put onto the new car One who sells a car and does not buy a new one may depending on the local laws involved have to turn the old plates in or destroy them or may be permitted to keep them Some jurisdictions permit the registration of the vehicle with personal vanity or cherished mark plates br In some jurisdictions plates require periodic replacement often associated with a design change of the plate itself Vehicle owners may or may not have the option to keep their original plate number and may have to pay a fee to exercise this option Alternately or additionally vehicle owners have to replace a small decal on the plate or use a decal on the windshield to indicate the expiration date of the vehicle registration periodic safety and or emissions inspections or vehicle taxation Other jurisdictions have replaced the decal requirement through the use of computerization a central database maintains records of which plate numbers are associated with expired registrations communicating with automated number plate readers to enable law enforcement to identify expired registrations in the field br br br Placement br br Plates are usually fixed directly to a vehicle or to a plate frame that is fixed to the vehicle Sometimes the plate frames contain advertisements inserted by the vehicle service centre or the dealership from which the vehicle was purchased Vehicle owners can also purchase customized frames to replace the original frames In some jurisdictions registration plate frames are illegal or have design restrictions For example many states like Texas allow plate frames but prohibit plate frames from covering the name of the state province district Native American tribe or country that issued the license plate when that information appears on the plate Plates are designed to conform to standards with regard to being read by eye in day or at night or by electronic equipment Some drivers purchase clear smoke colored or tinted covers that go over the registration plate to prevent electronic equipment from scanning the registration plate Legality of these covers varies Some cameras incorporate filter systems that make such avoidance attempts unworkable usually with infra red filters br Vehicles pulling trailers such as caravans and semi trailer trucks are typically required to display a third registration plate on the rear of the trailer br br br Plate design considerations br An engineering study by the University of Illinois published in recommended that the state of Illinois adopt a numbering system and plate design composed of combinations of characters which can be perceived quickly and accurately are legible at a distance of approximately feet m under daylight conditions and are readily adapted to filing and administrative procedures It also recommended that a standard plate size of inches cm by inches cm be adopted through the United States to replace the earlier inches cm by inches cm size to allow longer registration numbers to be displayed without excessively tight spacing or excessively thin or narrow characters br In order to combat registration plate fraud from the s several jurisdictions developed their own anti fraud typefaces so that characters cannot be painted or modified to resemble other characters Since the s many jurisdictions have adopted the FE Schrift typeface br English uses twenty six letters languages such as German Icelandic and Danish have more letters so assuming that the letters vs digits must appear in particular locations common on plates in most jurisdictions for instance four decimal digits and two letters where the letters must come first allowing AB but excluding A B allowing for repeating letters and digits the combinations for each of these will be br br If letters and digits can appear in any order it is problematic to allow both the letter O and the digit to be used Even if the license plate uses distinguishable characters for the two someone transcribing the plate may not know which symbol has which meaning and the owner of plate EM F VO may get in trouble for something the owner of plate EM F V did Other letter digit pairs like I and may be similarly problematic to a lesser degree Allowing for repeating letters and digits the combinations for each of these will be br br br History br France was the first country to introduce the registration plate with the enactment of the Paris Police Ordinance on August followed by Germany in The Netherlands was the first country to introduce a national registration plate called a driving permit in Initially these plates were just sequentially numbered starting at but this was changed in br In the United States where each state issues plates New York State has required plates since black numerals on a white background after first requiring in only that the owner s initials be clearly visible on the back of the vehicle At first plates were not government issued in most jurisdictions and motorists were obliged to make their own In Massachusetts was the first state to issue plates In Idaho was the first state to put a logo on the plate the Idaho Potato br In Spain the first law to define rules on non animal vehicle traction was Real orden de de circulaci n de veh culos cuyo motor no sea la fuerza animal and the registration of vehicles was defined as a provincial task in the Reglamento de para el servicio de coches autom viles por las carreteras br The first Spanish registration plate PM was issued for a Cl ment Talbot on October in Palma de Mallorca From to vehicles were registered br br br Materials br The earliest plates were made of enamel on metal or ceramic with no backing which made them fragile and impractical Few of these early plates survived Later experimental materials include cardboard leather plastic and during wartime shortages copper and pressed soybeans br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br As of the st century most plates are made out of aluminium Metal plates are manufactured through one of two processes embossing or riveting For embossing a plate is placed between dies on each side corresponding to the desired characters and compressed by a press For riveting holes are drilled through the plate and then individual letters are riveted one by one to the plate br New technology has allowed for the development of digital license plates In Michigan approved Public Act making electronic license plates legal br br br Sizes br br Early th century plates varied in size and shape from one jurisdiction to the next such that if someone moved or the car was resold in a new area new holes would need to be drilled into the automobile often on the bumper to support the new plate or an adapter plate be made Standardization of plates came in when automobile manufacturers came to agreement with governments and international standards organizations While peculiar local variants exist there are four basic standards worldwide br br by mm by inches or by mm by inches in the bulk of European

Protectorate of Bechuanaland and number plates then used a BP prefix then BPA BPB etc followed by up to three digits in white on black background the plates being made in the characteristic style of South Africa at that time br br br Burkina Faso br br Vehicles are fitted with registration plates in the front and rear of the vehicle Motorcycles cc or more must be licensed and only bear rear plates Registration is performed at the local police or Gendarmerie station The first digits of the plate indicate the province in which the vehicle is registered Only plates which meet government standards and are sold by licensed dealers may be fitted br Private passenger car registration plates have a white background with black letters and digits Plates exist in a long pattern and a rectangular pattern similar in size and appearance to French plates The plate is adorned with a small flag of Burkina Faso in the shape of the country inscribed in a black circle The letters BF appear below the circle also in black This circle and BF design is to the right of the long plate and to the upper right of the rectangular plate Motorcycle plates are similar to rectangular automobile

the emblems of the Economic Community of Central African States code and the CMR emblem br br br Kenya br br The current series of vehicle registration plates in Kenya are on a white plate with black lettering and look quite similar to UK suffix style registrations The format is LLL L where L denotes a letter and denotes a digit The older series of number plates were black with white or silver lettering The rear plates in the older series of number plates were yellow and black lettering According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics there are over vehicles on Kenyan roads as at br br br Morocco br br New style post black lettering on white Moroccan vehicle registrations have one or two digits to the right of the plate to indicate the town of registration br Each number is separated by a vertical line To the left of the plate are a series of up to digits issued consecutively These are separated from the town of registration digits by a hyphen br Earlier plates black lettering on white Pre white lettering on black differed in that they could have either one or two numbers to indicate the town of registration The group of digits was separated from the rest of the plate by a vertical line br The current plates use numerals without script Earlier plates used numerals and included Arabic script br br br South Africa br br South African number plates are unique in each of the provinces Each province has its own number plate design and colors as well as numbering scheme br br br Americas br br br Argentina br br The history of registration plates in Argentina can be broken down in two major phases the decentralized phase until and the centralized one since During the decentralized phase registration plates were assigned by each municipality or by the provinces while during the second phase the national state took charge of standardizing and centralizing the design and style br Argentina has used the ABC format since However from new registration plates with the logo of Mercosur and the AB CD format were implemented Both formats coexist temporarily br br br Bolivia br br Bolivia s current registration plate system consists of four numbers followed by three letters At the top of the plate BOLIVIA is spelled out At the top left corner the Bolivian flag may be present and at the top right corner a letter denoting the department in which the car is registered according to the ISO BO code is displayed on either a metal tab on older plates or a sticker on newer plates The current registration plate design consists of a white background with a blue borderline and blue letters and numbers br Serial digits progress sequentially from right to left with the AAA format followed by the AAA format and currently the AAA format br Older plate serials consisted of three numbers followed by three letters A to Z except O and Q They had a white background with black letters and numbers br br br Brazil br br Brazil adopted its former system in which uses the form ABC with a dot between the letters and the numbers A combination given to a particular vehicle follows it from first issue to the scrapyard it cannot be transferred to another vehicle Above the combination there was a metallic band with the state abbreviation SP S o Paulo RJ Rio de Janeiro PR Paran AM Amazonas etc and the name of the municipality in which the vehicle title owner resides During the first registration of a new vehicle the registering state issues a registration plate to the vehicle rather than owner and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life br Brazil as a member of Mercosur from September on began a new registration system where plates have a blue band at the top with the logo of Mercosur on the left the country s name centered and country flag on the right On the bottom left there is the international vehicle registration code for Brazil BR The plates are always white the letter coloring indicates the category e g black on white private blue on white official police fire departments etc red on white taxis buses paid freight etc A new format based on the previous one ABC D was implemented All used cars when transferred to another owner must change to the new format keeping their registration where only its second number the fifth position of the alphanumeric combination shall change to a letter following the pattern A B C D J As of both formats coexist for the time being br br br Canada br br In Canada license plates are issued on the provincial or territorial level Federally issued plates are only used by the Department of National Defence All provinces issue plates in which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface The territory of Nunavut introduced the first flat registration plate in Canada in July br In the Canadian provinces and territories of Alberta New Brunswick Newfoundland and Labrador the Northwest Territories Nova Scotia Nunavut Prince Edward Island Quebec Saskatchewan and the Yukon registration plates are currently only required on the rear of the vehicle The remaining provinces British Columbia Manitoba and Ontario require the registration plates to be mounted on both the front and rear of the vehicle When a person moves from one province to another they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence br In all North American passenger vehicle registration plates except for French controlled St Pierre and Miquelon were standardized at a size of in in mm mm although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes such as motorcycles and for the state of Delaware s historic alternate black and white plates which are in in mm mm The plates of the Northwest Territories are shaped like a polar bear but bolt to the standard holes Nunavut inherited this design on its creation but switched to rectangular plates in Canadian Forces vehicles that travel on regular roads display registration plates These vehicles have registration plates issued by the Department of National Defence Domestic plates were issued by the DND after br Most Canadian provinces offer personalized or vanity license plates where one can display their own unique combination of characters br Prison inmates in Ontario make registration plates br br br Colombia br br Private black on yellow plates with the ABC format are used in Colombia The municipality of issuance is embossed at the bottom of the plate br br br Ecuador br br Vehicle number plates in Ecuador have only one design with the word Ecuador appearing in uppercase letters centred at the top of the plate and a unique letter number combination which consists of three letters except for motorbikes diplomatic vehicles and vehicles owned by international organisations followed by three or more numerical digits Formats in use are ABC old format and ABC new format br The first letter in the letter number combination indicates the province of issue The second letter might be sequential or a key letter identifying the type of registration plate the following letters and numbers are assigned in sequential order to the date the vehicle has been registered br br br Greenland br br Greenlandic vehicle registration plates normally have two letters and five digits The combination is simply a serial and has no connection with a geographic location but the digits have a number series based on vehicle type br br br Mexico br br Each Mexican state issues registration plates of a different design Most states change designs more or less every third year with each state on its own plate replacement cycle Every year Mexicans pay the tenencia or revalidaci n de placas car plates renewal tax A set of Mexican plates includes one pair of plates a windshield sticker and in a few states a plate sticker In the size of the plate number was reduced to accommodate the addition of the state number a legend indicating the position of the plate on the vehicle delantera front or trasera rear and additional graphics European sized plates do exist in Mexico but are not official or legal These generally contain the same design as the standard size plate in use at the time and bear the standard letter and number sequence br Mexican plates come in several different classifications private private border public public border federal public service fiscal and customs inspection Mexico Army and diplomatic The border plates were introduced in and are available in the Mexico USA border zone This zone is formed by the states of Baja California and Baja California Sur as well as parts of Sonora Chihuahua Coahuila and Tamaulipas While the state of Nuevo Le n shares a km mi border with the U S it does not have any cities within the border zone br br br Panama br In Panama the design of registration plates changes every year and the plates are the standard North American size and shape They used to be made by prison inmates but are now produced on demand and on site using a press Plates used to have numbers but since new plates for new vehicles have letters and numbers The letters go before the numbers They have a sticker on one of the corners indicating in which month of the year the plate was issued On the bottom center of the plate is the year when the plate was issued They also have holograms on the right edge of the plate On the top center the plate has the word PANAMA Government vehicles always begin with GO Taxis begin with T and are always yellow School buses say COLEGIAL instead of the year the plate was issued Motorcycles begin with M Metro buses begin with MB Plates for motorcycles are about half the standard size Plates of vehicles belonging to the national assembly are always white and have the logo of the national assembly on the left and two numbers on the right and are always white Vehicles of government executives have no registration plate Vehicles from Central America can be used freely in Panama without having to change plates but only if the vehicle will not be staying indefinitely in Panama Vehicles must be checked every year when changing the plate The plate must be changed every year and once the vehicle is checked a sticker must be attached to the back of the vehicle s windshield The color of the sticker changes every year br br br United States br br The first registration plates in North America appeared in in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Soon after other states followed suit with virtually every state having adopted a form of registration plates by br The first registration plates in the United States were made out of leather rubber iron and porcelain painted on the front in usually two different colors one for the background and one for the lettering This scheme held true for most states until about The front of the plate would usually contain the registration number in large digits and in smaller lettering on one side of the plate the two or four digit year number and an abbreviated state name Each year citizens were usually required to obtain a new registration plate from the state government which would have a different color scheme than the previous year making it easier for police to identify whether citizens were current with their vehicle registration br Even before some states had adopted the technique of embossing the metal plates with raised lettering and numbering without porcelain and applying paint all over the plate directly onto the metal Minnesota introduced some registration plates during this period with three different years embossed into the plate so that the plates were valid for three consecutive years e g and br In the United States registration plates are issued by each state The federal government issues plates only for its own vehicle fleet and for vehicles owned by foreign diplomats In the United States many Native American tribal governments issue plates for their members while some states provide special issues for tribal members Within each jurisdiction there may also be special plates for groups such as firefighters or military veterans and for state or municipality owned vehicles br The appearance of plates is frequently chosen to contain symbols or slogans associated with the issuing jurisdiction Some of these are intended to promote the region A few make political statements for example most plates issued in District of Columbia include the phrase Taxation Without Representation to highlight D C s lack of a voting representative in the United States Congress More recently some states have also started to put a web address pertaining to the state such as Pennsylvania which posts the address of its tourism site In some states Georgia Iowa Kentucky Mississippi Tennessee Ohio and some versions in Florida the issuing county is listed at the bottom while Kansas does so with a letter coded registration sticker Utah did so until Indiana identifies counties with a two digit code in the lower right corner of its plates Alabama Idaho Montana Ohio South Dakota Wyoming most Nebraska and some Oklahoma standard issue plates designate the county by unique codes usually numeric Idaho uses a one letter or one number one letter code Oklahoma uses a one letter code either in the plate number or registration sticker Some states such as New Hampshire New Mexico and New York formerly used county coded or county labeled plates before switching to standard progression plates br br Most states use plates onto which the letters and numbers are embossed so that they are slightly raised above its surface Characters on Vermont plates are engraved onto a large slightly raised portion of the plate Seventeen states Alabama Arizona Delaware Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Minnesota Montana Nebraska New Jersey Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Wyoming and both the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have moved to entirely digitally printed flat registration plates Several other states such as Colorado Mississippi Missouri New York Ohio Oregon Washington West Virginia and Wisconsin produce a flat registration plate only for certain plates such as personalized license plates and special interest plates Nevada reverted from using flat registration plates to using embossed plates after using flat plates as a standard issue for a few years br br The numbering system of registration plates also varies among the jurisdictions Some states issue a motorist a serial that stays with that person as long as they live in that state while other states periodically issue new serials and completely rotate out any old ones Some states issue registration plates to vehicles rather than owners and the serial stays with the vehicle for its life Several states do not regularly use certain letters most commonly the letters I O and or Q in their plates except on vanity plates so as not to confuse observers with the numbers one and zero br When a person moves from one state to another they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence Some U S states will even require a person to obtain new plates if they accept employment in that state unless they can show that they return to another state to live on a regular basis The most prominent exceptions to this policy are active duty military service members who legally do not change residence when they move to a new posting Federal law specifically allows them to choose to either retain the state vehicle registration of their original residence or change registration to their state of assignment br In the United States states Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas Delaware Florida Georgia Indiana Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Michigan Mississippi New Mexico North Carolina Ohio Oklahoma Pennsylvania South Carolina Tennessee and West Virginia do not require an official front registration plate In Nevada front plates are optional if the vehicle was not designed for a front plate and the manufacturer did not provide an add on bracket or other means of displaying the front plate In Massachusetts certain old rear only plates are grandfathered but newly issued registrations require both front and rear plates Vehicles owned by the United States Postal Service unlike other federally owned civilian vehicles do not bear registration plates but rather a postal service number such as on the Grumman LLV br In all North American passenger vehicle registration plates except for French controlled St Pierre and Miquelon were standardized at a size of in in mm mm although a smaller size is used for certain vehicle classes such as motorcycles and for the state of Delaware s historic alternate black and white plates which are in in mm mm However in Puerto Rico began issuing optional European style plates that incorporate the design language of the standard issue plates in a longer and narrower size typically seen in Europe br Tactical vehicles of the United States military do not bear registration plates even if they travel regularly on public streets and highways br In many U S states registration plates are made by prison inmates Because of this colloquial terms include license plate factories for prison and making license plates for serving a prison sentence br br br Asia br br br Afghanistan br br Afghan registration plates primarily use Persian script text and numerals The current version was introduced in br br br Bangladesh br br Bangladeshi registration plates use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals br In Bangladesh the Road Transport Authority BRTA issues vehicle registration plates for motor vehicles The vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh use Bengali alphabets and Bengali numerals The current version of Vehicle registration plates started in The International vehicle registration code for Bangladesh is BD br The general format of vehicle registration plates in Bangladesh is City Vehicle Class alphabet and No Vehicle No For example DHAKA D The DHAKA field represents the city name in Bengali alphabets the D field represents the vehicle class in Bengali alphabets the field represents the vehicle registration serial in Bengali numerals newer registrations have a higher serial number and finally the field represents the vehicle number of the vehicle in Bengali numerals br The plates are installed in both the front and rear of the vehicle with the rear plate permanently attached to the vehicle The plate is only removed when the vehicle has reached the end of service and has been sold for scrap New vehicles are not delivered to the purchaser until the plates have been attached at the dealership br br br China br br br Mainland br br The People s Republic of China issues vehicles registration plates at its Vehicle Management Offices under the administration of the Ministry of Public Security br The current plates are of the standard GA blue background and consist a one character provincial abbreviation a letter of the Latin alphabet corresponding to a certain city in the province and five numbers or letters of the alphabet e g A for a vehicle in Beijing or B for a vehicle from Shenzhen in Guangdong province The numbers are produced at random and are computer generated at the issuing office A previous registration plate system with a green background and the full name of the province in Chinese characters actually had a sequential numbering order and the numbering system was eventually beset with corruption br Yellow plates are issued to motorcycles and large vehicles such as coaches and buses Black plates are issued to vehicles belonging to diplomatic missions and foreigners including Hong Kong and Macau Vehicles registered in Hong Kong or Macau and permitted to enter China would be required to have a separate black plate from China as Hong Kong and Macau operate their own vehicles registration system The Chinese plates for these cars followed the pattern of the provincial character for Guangdong the Latin letter Z letters and or numbers ending in the abbreviated character for the territory e g for Hong Kong and for Macau br For motorcycles the front plate only included five numbers and rear contained the full information e g for a motorcycle registered in Shanghai as C the front plate would be and the rear plate bears the entire set br br br Hong Kong br br Hong Kong number plates follow the British system of colouring with front white and rear yellow plates The numbering system is two letters and up to four digits e g AB Registration plate numbers starting with AM are reserved for government use The front white and rear yellow background is a reflective material to comply with the BS AU a standard br In addition Hong Kong started a new scheme in to allow personalised registration plates with up to eight selectable letters or numbers br br br Macau br br Macau local registration plates follow the Portuguese pre system of colour and sequence Plates have a black background with white numbers Numbering system starts from M and then one letter and then numbers and separated by e g MA Earlier numbers will only have M instead of MA or MB or MC etc br br br Taiwan br br In the Republic of China Taiwan vehicle registration plates are issued by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications The registration numbers contain Latin letters A to Z Arabic numerals to and dash and plates also bear Chinese characters br br br India br br Vehicle registration plates usually known as number plates are issued by the Regional Transport Office of each district Most motor vehicles which are used on public roads are required by law to display them br The new system which is followed currently in all the states and cities came into effect in the early s The scheme comprises br br A two letter identification for the state in which the vehicle is registered br A two number code to identify the Regional Transport Office RTO where the vehicle is registered br An alphabet code to define the series one or two Alphabet depending on vehicle density of the district RTO br A four digit serial br For Example in the case of MH EL MH stands for Maharashtra stands for Sangli city RTO and EL denotes the series and serial number br The Delhi NCR however uses a modified system wherein an additional alphabet is inserted after the RTO code to classify vehicle type For example a Delhi registration plate may read DL C AB where DL stands for Delhi C stands for Car and AB is the series and number In this scheme C denotes Car S denotes Scooter Motorcycle R stands for rickshaw three wheeler F stands for Fancy or VIP numbers irrespective of vehicle type and P for Public transport vehicles br Some states have been adapting the dual letter series code system for example car series are CA CB CC motorbike series are MA MB and so on Most states however still use the standard series code denoted by a single letter of the alphabet br br br Indonesia br br Indonesian vehicle plates share the legacy of the Dutch colonial era which do not reflect the regional divisions of the country into provinces but the old system of karesidenan or residencies Their prefixes are therefore based on this system There are four types of plates that are used in Indonesia all consisting of a combination of alphabet and numbers br br For commercial and public vehicles a yellow background with black typeface br For private vehicles a white background with black typeface from June Before that a black background with white typeface br For government vehicles a red background with white typeface br Dealer plates are white background with red typeface usually for vehicles yet to have legal and confirmed information and owner br Besides these normal plates there are also military plates for Army Navy Air Force and also the Police While diplomatic corps get special white plates and black numbering with CD prefix The normal scheme comprises a one or two letters identification for the regencies followed by an up to four digit numbers for the car s identification and the last one to three letters are the serial code or district identification The expiry date of the license is embossed along the bottom and some on the top of the plate At the middle of the plate number the numbers are usually random or requested by the vehicle owner and has a maximum of four digits and a maximum of three letters at the end of the vehicle s plate number for example it could be B A B AB B AB and B ABC Sometimes the last maximum three letters at the end of the plate identifies the district region of the registered vehicle by the first letter for example B WIE which W identifies the vehicle is from the region of Southern South Tangerang city Kota Tangerang Selatan Banten province Vehicle owners may request their vehicle s last letters plate for their own desire but would need more affairs by the local police registering it for example that the owner s name is Adi then he would make his vehicle s plate number like so B ADI br Example br br B AB is mainly a vehicle registered in Jakarta distinguishable from the letter code from the first letter of the plate B represents the following cities Jakarta Depok Tangerang includes South Tangerang and Bekasi Mainly vehicles registered in and later starts using three letters at the end of the whole plate for example B ABC br L MN is a vehicle registered in Surabaya the provincial capital of East Java Surabaya code is L br DB AA is a vehicle registered in North Sulawesi which includes Minahasa and Manado which is the capital city of the province North Sulawesi code is DB br KT T is a vehicle registered in East Kalimantan Province Tarakan municipality on Borneo island East Kalimantan code is KT br F LU is a vehicle registered in Bogor city West Java Bogor city code is F br The plates usually have their expiration dates shown below or very few on the top of the serial numbers indicating its expiry month and year so if it says it means that the plate expires at December so the owner of the vehicle should pay tax and get a new plate at that time to which the process is redone every five years A new plate design introduced in April eliminates a white line circling the whole plate and has a thinner typeface until it was replaced in br br br Iran br br Iranian license plates have had European standard dimensions since Each province in Iran has multiple unique two digit codes that are included at the right end of the license plates in a distinguished square outline above which the word or Iran has been written A province s license plates will not be issued with a new code unless all possible combinations with the old code have been issued br In Tehran the first code to be issued for the province was code and subsequent codes all increased by as well meaning codes are unique to Tehran Ever since code was fully issued the new codes for Tehran have started from and subsequently increased by br br Private vehicles plates are black on white with a blue strip on the left The code in the square represents the regional codes The letter can be dependent on where the car s owner s principal address is located For example while regional code belongs to Fars Province letter M is dedicated to residents of Larestan County while letter H is dedicated to Jahrom County residents br Iran s license plate format is entirely in Persian alphabet It follows the format X NN br br is the registration code br X is the series letter Each unique classification of vehicles is assigned a unique letter For private vehicles for example if numbers start from B the letter B will not change until numbers reach B Then plates will go up to C These details are explained further in each section of this article br NN is the province code br br Example br br V is a vehicle registered in Shiraz

of stars or in Turkey s case where the blue stripe with the country code is standard but omits the flag over it Both the common EU format and e g Norwegian registration plates satisfy the requirements laid out in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic According to the convention when the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate it must also appear on the front registration

example was allocated AAA to FZZ Victoria was allocated from GAA to MZZ Queensland was allocated NAA to QZZ and South Australia was allocated from RAA to TZZ Western Australia was allocated UAA and

their call signs printed on them allowing public service officials controlling access to disaster areas to immediately recognize and allow operators into the areas facilitating their provision of crucial emergency communications Some U S states charge lower fees for ham radio plates than for vanity plates For example in Virginia the annual cost of an amateur radio vanity plate is a mere br In the U S most provinces of Canada and Australia vehicle owners may also pay extra for specialty plates with these the sequence of letters and digits is chosen by the licensing agency as with regular plates but the owners select a plate design that is different from the normal registration plate Fees for specialty plates are usually channeled to a specific charity or organization For example California has issued the Yosemite plate and whale tail plate both aimed at conservation efforts in the respective domains Some jurisdictions allow for these special plates to also be vanity plates usually for an additional fee on top of the cost of the plate br br In some Australian states it is possible to purchase personalized plates where an individual can choose the color design and sometimes even the shape and size of the plate as well as the displayed text For example the government of the state of Queensland offers a wide range of possibilities for customization including some

prohibited registration plates br Some registration plate combinations are banned from being issued by registration authorities These are typically combinations which deliberately or otherwise spell out a message that is likely to offend others Concerns about what is considered offensive differ from country to country In the United Kingdom these have included combinations with sexual connotations such as BO LUX and BL JOB The DVLA maintains block lists of possible combinations of letters and digits in an attempt to prevent this Some prohibited plates reflect religious concerns for example in New Jersey a woman found she was prohibited from registering the plate THEIST but permitted to register BAPTIST A similar registration for ATHE ST had been rejected in Both prohibitions were later lifted In Manitoba a plate reading ASIMIL was banned as being culturally offensive to indigenous people br In Maine passed legislation that removed most censorship from their vanity plate program Plates like GETFUKT are now allowed br In some states of Germany license plates that could be mistaken for Nazi codes with a definition further than Strafgesetzbuch section a are prohibited and in some cases even license plates that had existed for decades were not grandfathered in but had to be changed as stricter regulations were applied The letter combinations KZ HJ SS and SA are not issued for license plates anywhere in Germany due to their Nazi associations br br br Temporary registration plates br br Some jurisdictions issue temporary registration plates made of cardboard or security paper or even printed on plain paper for newly purchased vehicles for drivers waiting for plates in the mail or other registration issues A common length of time to have temporary plates is days although Ontario offers ten day permits and some U S states allow temporary tags to be effective for up to days Temporary registration plates are usually either attached to the vehicle in place of the rear registration plate or both registration plates or taped to the inside of the rear windshield while some states require it to be in the front windshield Expiration dates are usually hand written by regulatory employees or dealership sales personnel but due to easy alteration of hand written dates some states now digitally print the date on the tag If a driver continues to drive after the permit expires the vehicle can face impounding as an unplated vehicle br br br Novelty registration plates br br There also exist novelty registration plates often sold in gift or novelty shops Similar to vanity plates these novelties are printed with an individual s name or other words or phrases but unlike vanity plates they are not intended for legal identification of an automobile They can be displayed in the rear window for example or on the front of vehicles registered in jurisdictions that only require a valid plate on the rear of the vehicle br Novelty registration plates are usually installed by motorists or automobile dealerships While automobile dealerships may install such plates for promoting their business motorists may install novelty registration plates to express their brand preference or an affiliation with a group state country athletic team hobby art or custom br Antique auto collectors may use novelty replicas of period registration plates to give their show cars a dated look or import vehicle owners may use a novelty replica of a foreign plate to give it a foreign image Some states allow year of manufacture registrations where an original official plate expiring on the model year of an antique car is revalidated Wisconsin for instance permits the use of year of manufacture plates if the state issued plates are also carried somewhere within the vehicle California and Ohio also allow the Year of manufacture Plates br br br Registration plate accessories br br Today plates are commonly attached with screws that mount into threaded fittings on the vehicle but originally nut and bolt combinations were needed to fasten the plate to a bracket which led to the use of varied registration plate ornaments accessories and attachments The most common of these include fastening bolts with ornamental heads in a myriad of styles these are generally legal everywhere providing the plate itself is not obscured Those bolts faced with a colored glass or plastic reflector are termed registration plate jewels Traditionally the front plate would be fastened by an amber or green jewel and the rear by a red jewel but other colors have become available over the decades including blue clear and most recently purple br The manufacture and use of registration plate toppers attachments and accessories mounted atop plates often as advertising premiums has diminished because of the design of modern vehicle bodies that incorporate recessed plate mountings But older vehicles will usually have room for such attachments that may mention vehicle dealerships tourist attractions and petroleum companies Some of these commercial toppers also incorporate one or more reflectors or a safety related message Large stand alone glass or plastic reflectors or cataphotes some imprinted with an advertising message are still common plate toppers whenever registration plate brackets are able to accommodate them br br br International codes br br According to the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic vehicles in cross border traffic are obliged to display a distinguishing sign of the country of registration on the rear of the vehicle This sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate or may be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate When the distinguishing sign is incorporated into the registration plate it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle and may be supplemented with the flag or emblem of the national state or the emblem of the regional economic integration organization to which the country belongs The distinguishing sign should be displayed on the far left or far right on the registration plate When a symbol flag emblem is also displayed the distinguishing sign shall obligatory be placed on the far left on the plate The distinguishing sign shall be positioned so to be easy identifiable and so that it cannot be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility The distinguishing sign shall therefore be at least a different color from the registration number or have a different background color to that reserved for the registration number or be clearly separated from the registration number preferably with a line br The physical requirements for the separate sign are defined in Annex of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic which states that the letters shall be in black on a white background having the shape of an ellipse with the major axis horizontal The distinguishing sign should not be affixed in such a way that it could be confused with the registration number or impair its legibility br The allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations UN as the Distinguishing Signs of Vehicles in International Traffic being authorized by the UN s Geneva Convention on Road Traffic and Vienna Convention on Road Traffic Many but far from all vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO coincide with either the ISO two or three letter codes br br br Imitation international codes br In Canada Mexico and the United States where the international oval is not used on vehicles from neighboring countries putting one on a car is a matter of personal choice This has given rise to a tourist driven industry of imitation international code stickers For example the island of Martha s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts has MV while the Outer Banks region of North Carolina uses OBX Long Beach Island New Jersey uses LBI with the letter I substituted with an illustration of the island s lighthouse The city of Key West Florida uses KW as part of its Conch Republic rebellion from the U S There are also YNP ovals for Yellowstone Yosemite National Park Stickers of this sort are usually visibly different from any real international code sticker but some places sell what could appear to be real stickers touting that the abbreviation refers to their venue br In the United Kingdom imitation international codes are sometimes seen for the various parts of the country For example in Scotland oval stickers with cosse or Alba Scotland in French and Gaelic respectively are occasionally seen In Wales drivers commonly display CYM to indicate Cymru Wales br In Spain there are such codes for regionalist movements such as CAT for Catalonia or AST for Asturias which can be often seen in their reflective region br br br Debate about extending registration to bicycles br For many years councils in Australia have debated whether registration should also be required for bicycle riders br In Randwick councilor Charles Matthews proposed to impose a registration fee on bicycle riders which would be used to help fund cycleways being built by the council This proposal was rejected by other councillors In the Victorian council
