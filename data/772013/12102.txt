strike against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated local unions on the fringes of the industry into a major labor union and led to the unionization of the domestic United States automobile industry br After the first convention of UAW in the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal organizing campaigns at smaller plants as it had in the past but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer General Motors focusing on GM s production complex in Flint Michigan br Organizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders According to Wyndham Mortimer the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes br As the UAW studied its target it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the dies from which car body components were stamped one in Flint that produced the parts for Buicks Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles and another in Cleveland that produced Chevrolet parts br br While the UAW called for a sit down strike in Flint the police armed with guns and tear gas attempted to enter the Fisher Body plant on January The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges bottles and bolts At the time Vice President John Nance Garner supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike but this idea was rejected by President Franklin D Roosevelt The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re open The strike ended after days br That development forced GM to bargain with the union John L Lewis President of the United Mine Workers and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations spoke for the UAW in those negotiations UAW President Homer Martin was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way GM s representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW so Governor Frank Murphy acted as a courier and intermediary between the two groups Governor Murphy sent in the U S National Guard not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate strike breakers The two parties finally reached an agreement on February on a one page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM s employees who were union members for the next six months br br br Tool and die strike of br br The tool and die strike of also known as the strategy strike was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers In addition to representation rights the UAW working jointly with the Congress of Industrial Organizations CIO sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers br br br United Auto Workers UAW strike of br br From November until March days the UAW organized hourly workers to form a US wide strike against the General Motors Corporation workers used the tactic of the sit down strike It was the longest strike against a major manufacturer that the UAW had yet seen and it was also the longest national GM strike in its history As director of the UAW s General Motors Department coordinator of union relations with GM Walter Reuther suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a one at a time strategy which was intended to maximize pressure on the target company Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers a percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices However the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW and the workers received only a percent increase in wages br br br General Motors strike br br The General Motors strike was a strike from September to by the UAW against General Motors br On September General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company The first US wide strike against GM since was expected to idle plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time Talks broke down after more than straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages benefits job security and investments in US facilities br Two car assembly plants in Oshawa Ontario and a transmission facility in Windsor closed on September However on September a tentative agreement was reached and the strike s end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at a m By the following day all GM workers in both countries were back to work br br br General Motors strike br br On the morning of September after talks broke down to renew their contract which expired earlier that day the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at

against GM since came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM Striking labor union members received a a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike The strike cost GM more than billion br br br United Auto Workers strike br br The ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history Then recently elected UAW president Shawn Fain stated that he was fed up with the current situation between workers and automakers Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation pensions as well as the introduction of a four day workweek as opposed to the five day workweek GM CEO Mary Barra protested that her company offered an

Controversies br br br Streetcar conspiracy br br Between and GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines NCL and its subsidiaries in violation of the

Corvair br br Unsafe at Any Speed The Designed In Dangers of the American Automobile by Ralph Nader published in is a book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety It relates to the first models of the Chevrolet Corvair that had a swing axle suspension design that was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar anti roll bar as a cost cutting measure Corvairs required tire pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer s recommended tolerances The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential psi front psi rear when cold psi and psi hot and if one inflated the tires equally as was standard practice for all other cars at the time the result was dangerous over steer br In early March several media outlets including The New Republic and The New York Times alleged that GM had tried to discredit Ralph Nader hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for Nader s lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover overzealous surveillance Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law br A safety commission report conducted by Texas A M University concluded that the Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations The United States Department of Transportation DOT issued a press release in describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in studying the handling of the Corvair and four contemporary cars a Ford Falcon Plymouth Valiant Volkswagen Beetle and Renault Dauphine along with a second generation Corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension The page report reviewed NHTSA s extreme condition handling tests national crash involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors internal documentation regarding the Corvair s handling br NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests This review panel concluded that the Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests the handling and stability performance of the Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic br In former GM executive John DeLorean wrote in his book On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors that Nader s criticisms were valid br Journalist David E Davis said that despite Nader s claim that swing axle rear suspension were dangerous Porsche Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen all used similar swing axle concepts during that era br br br Apartheid br In GM along with other multinational corporations was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the
