Thomas Buckland Jeffery February April was a British emigrant to the United States who co founded the Gormully Jeffery company which made the Rambler bicycle He invented the clincher rim which was widely used to fit tires to bicycles and early automobiles and in established the Thomas B Jeffery Company to make automobiles again using Rambler branding br br br Early life br Jeffery was born on February at Mill Pleasant in Stoke Damerel Devon England to Thomas Hellier and Elizabeth Buckland Jeffery At sixteen years of age he was working as a mathematical instrument maker br At eighteen years of age he emigrated to the United States and became a resident of Chicago where he was connected with the business of manufacturing telescopes Later he was engaged in making models for the patent office br br br Bicycle manufacturer br In Jefferey together with R Philip Gormully started the Gormully Jeffery Manufacturing Company and began making the Rambler bicycle br Jeffery was an inventor and bicycle manufacturer with his partner R Philip Gormully who built and sold Rambler bicycles through his company Gormully Jeffery Mfg Co in Chicago from to The Rambler was still a proud piece of machinery when low prices took precedence over high quality Its body featured flared metal tubing for extra strength at the joints which were brazed by immersion in molten brass These techniques continued even after Gormully Jeffery and Rambler became names of the American Bicycle Company or Bicycle Trust which was not known for the best manufacturing techniques in all of its lines br By Gormully Jeffery was the country s second largest bicycle maker and Jeffery had gained fame for developing among other things the clincher rim that enabled pneumatic tires to be used Jeffery and Gormully were pioneers in the field br br br Invention of the clincher rim br Dunlop s original pneumatic tires were wrapped onto the rim making them hard to service The challenge was securely fastening the tire to the rim while also allowing it to be easily removed for service This was an era where horseshoe nails and other sharp debris were common on roads and tires typically had to be repaired every miles br From to a slew of patents were filed with various methods of fastening tires to rims Jeffery came up with an improved tire held on the rim by hard rubber flanges that locked into channels in the rim This came to be known as the Clincher tire Jeffery received a patent on the ancestor of all clincher tires in US Patent From to about clinchers which are still used on some bicycles were the most common form of tires used on U S automobiles br William Erskine Bartlett patented a similar clincher technology in Great Britain and the respective patents prevented British companies from manufacturing in the U S and vice versa in G J formed The Clincher Tire Manufacturer s Association to license the use of their patent to tire companies and the snubbing by CTMA of newcomers Goodyear and Firestone led these companies to develop the straight side tire which is the basis of all modern automobile tires The ancestor of the straight side tire was invented by Charles Kingston Welch in In CTMA lost a patent infringement suit over the G J patent opening the U S market to other manufacturers of clincher tires In CTMA changed its name to the Tire and Rim Association and that organization still publishes an annual Year Book containing tire and wheel standards br br br Automobile manufacturer br br Jeffery was one of America s first men interested in automobiles and in he built the first Rambler motor car It had a tiller type steering and was powered by a horsepower kW PS engine mounted under the seat br The Rambler Stanhope model was displayed at the first New York National Auto Show in Madison Square Garden This was the first national car exhibition that began on November lasting one week attracting paid visitors to see different cars and the show included a driving and maneuverability demonstrations on a foot m wide track around the display areas The Ramler Stanhope featured a water cooled two cylinder engine mounted in the front of the vehicle all major innovations at a time when most American cars were still positioning an air cooled engine under the seat br The Rambler Model A also featured a front mounted engine and the steering was positioned on the left side for right hand traffic br Around Jeffery sold his stake in G J and founded the Thomas B Jeffery Company He used the G J money to buy the Sterling Bicycle Co factory in Kenosha Wisconsin where he began to manufacture automobiles to produce them on a large scale br From until Jeffery moved steadily to bigger more reliable models His cars were built on assembly lines the second manufacturer to adopt them Ransom E Olds was first and in he sold Ramblers By Jeffery more than doubled this number One reason may have been because he went to the steering wheel before br In he was building a large variety of different body styles and sizes Among them was a five passenger Rambler weighing pounds kg and powered by a horsepower kW PS engine br His company also assisted all motorists by financing the first road signs that were put up in Kenosha County Wisconsin br Jeffery died in while on holiday in Pompeii in Italy After his death his son Charles T Jeffery changed the automotive branding from Rambler to Jeffery in the founder s honor br br br Legacy br In Jeffery s family sold the manufacturing business to Charles W Nash who renamed the company Nash Motors and greatly expanded its products and manufacturing Nash also brought back the Rambler automobile nameplate and the product line continued after Nash and Hudson merged to form American Motors Corporation which retained the Rambler name into the s in U S and foreign markets br br br Monopoly fighter br Jeffery contested several patents br br Fought the Pope bicycle patent and won br Fought the Selden bicycle patent and won br br br Timeline br Jeffery partners with Phillip Gormully and starts the Gormully Jeffery Manufacturing Company in Chicago Illinois br Jeffery invents the Clincher Tire br Jeffery builds a rear engine Rambler prototype using the Rambler name previously used on a highly successful line of bicycles made by G J br Positive reviews at the Chicago International Exhibition Tournament and the first National Automobile Show in New York prompt the Jefferys to enter the automobile business br Jeffery sells his stake in G J to the American Bicycle Company br Dec Thomas B Jeffery finalizes a deal to buy the Kenosha factory of the defunct Sterling Bicycle Co with money from the sale of his interest in the G J br Two more prototypes Models A and B are made br First production Ramblers the Model C open runabout and the Model D the same car with a folding top Both are powered by an hp cu in cyl engine mounted beneath the seat and both are steered by a pioneering right side tiller a new concept at the time First year production totals units making Jeffery the second largest car maker behind Olds Motor Works br Mar Thomas B Jeffery dies while on vacation in
