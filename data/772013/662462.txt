A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device which may be mechanical electromechanical or piezoelectric piezo for short Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices timers train and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke br br br History br br br Electromechanical br The electric buzzer was invented in by Joseph Henry They were mainly used in early doorbells until they were phased out in the early s in favor of musical chimes which had a softer tone br br br Piezoelectric br br Piezoelectric buzzers or piezo buzzers as they are sometimes called were invented by Japanese manufacturers and fitted into a wide array of products during the s to s This advancement mainly came about because of cooperative efforts by Japanese manufacturing companies In they established the Barium Titanate Application Research Committee which allowed the companies to be competitively cooperative and bring about several piezoelectric innovations and inventions br br br Types br br br Electromechanical br Early devices were based on an electromechanical system identical to an electric bell without the metal gong Similarly a relay may be connected to interrupt its own actuating current causing the contacts to buzz the contacts buzz at line frequency if powered by alternating current Often these units were anchored to a wall or ceiling to use it as a sounding board The word buzzer comes from the rasping noise that electromechanical buzzers made br br br Mechanical br A joy buzzer is an example of a purely mechanical buzzer and they require drivers Other examples of them are doorbells br br br Piezoelectric br br A piezoelectric element may be driven by an oscillating electronic circuit or other audio signal source driven with a piezoelectric audio amplifier Sounds commonly used to indicate that a button has been pressed are a click a ring or a beep br br A piezoelectric buzzer beeper also depends on acoustic cavity resonance or Helmholtz resonance to produce an audible beep br br br Modern applications br While technological advancements have caused buzzers to be impractical and undesirable there are still instances in which buzzers and similar circuits may be used Present day applications include br br Novelty uses br Judging panels br Educational purposes br Annunciator panels br Electronic metronomes br Game show lock out device br Microwave ovens and other household appliances br Sporting events such as basketball games br Electrical alarms br Joy buzzer mechanical buzzer used for pranks br br br See also br Alarm clock br Alarm management br Klaxon br Vibrator mechanical br Joy buzzers br UVB a Russian radio station that emits a characteristic buzzing sound and is also called The Buzzer br br br
