title: Vehicle frame
id: 11699678
A vehicle frame also historically known as its chassis is the main supporting structure of a motor vehicle to which all other components are attached comparable to the skeleton of an organism br Until the s virtually every car had a structural frame separate from its body This construction design is known as body on frame By the s unibody construction in passenger cars had become common and the trend to unibody for passenger cars continued over the ensuing decades br Nearly all trucks buses and most pickups continue to use a separate frame as their chassis br br br Functions br The main functions of a frame in a motor vehicle are br br To support the vehicle s mechanical components and body br To deal with static and dynamic loads without undue deflection or distortion br These include br Weight of the body passengers and cargo loads br Vertical and torsional twisting transmitted by going over uneven surfaces br Transverse lateral forces caused by road conditions side wind and steering of the vehicle br Torque from the engine and transmission br Longitudinal tensile forces from starting and acceleration as well as compression from braking br Sudden impacts from collisions br br br Frame rails br br Typically the material used to construct vehicle chassis and frames include carbon steel for strength or aluminum alloys to achieve a more lightweight construction In the case of a separate chassis the frame is made up of structural elements called the rails or beams These are ordinarily made of steel channel sections by folding rolling or pressing steel plate br There are three main designs for these If the material is folded twice an open ended cross section either C shaped or hat shaped U shaped results br Boxed frames contain closed chassis rails either by welding them up or by using premanufactured metal tubing br br br C Shaped br By far the most common the C channel rail has been used on nearly every type of vehicle at one time or another It is made by taking a flat piece of steel usually ranging in thickness from to but up to or more in some heavy duty trucks and rolling both sides over to form a C shaped beam running the length of the vehicle C channel is typically more flexible than fully boxed of the same gauge br br br Hat br Hat frames resemble a U and may be either right side up or inverted with the open area facing down They are not commonly used due to weakness and a propensity to rust However they can be found on Chevrolet cars and some Studebakers br Abandoned for a while the hat frame regained popularity when companies started welding it to the bottom of unibody cars effectively creating a boxed frame br br br Boxed br br Originally boxed frames were made by welding two matching C rails together to form a rectangular tube Modern techniques however use a process similar to making C rails in that a piece of steel is bent into four sides and then welded where both ends meet br In the s the boxed frames of conventional American cars were spot welded in multiple places down the seam when turned into NASCAR stock car racers the box was continuously welded from end to end for extra strength br br br Design features br While appearing at first glance as a simple form made of metal frames encounter significant stress and are built accordingly The first issue addressed is beam height or the height of the vertical side of a frame The taller the frame the better it can resist vertical flex when force is applied to the top of the frame This is the reason semi trucks have taller frame rails than other vehicles instead of just being thicker br As looks ride quality and handling became more important to consumers new shapes were incorporated into frames The most visible of these are arches and kick ups Instead of running straight over both axles arched frames sit lower roughly level with their axles and curve up over the axles and then back down on the other side for bumper placement Kick ups do the same thing without curving down on the other side and are more common on the front ends br Another feature are the tapered rails that narrow vertically or horizontally in front of a vehicle s cabin This is done mainly on trucks to save weight and slightly increase room for the engine since the front of the vehicle does not bear as much load as the back Design developments include frames that use multiple shapes in the same frame rail For example some pickup trucks have a boxed frame in front of the cab shorter narrower rails underneath the cab and regular C rails under the bed br On perimeter frames the areas where the rails connect from front to center and center to rear are weak compared to regular frames so that section is boxed in creating what are called torque boxes br br br Types br br br Full under body frames br br br Ladder frame br br Named for its resemblance to a ladder the ladder frame is one of the oldest simplest and most frequently used under body separate chassis frame designs It consists of two symmetrical beams rails or channels running the length of the vehicle connected by several transverse cross members Initially seen on almost all vehicles the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and unitized body construction It is now seen mainly on large trucks This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple perpendicular cross members are used The vehicle s overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it br br br Backbone tube br br A backbone chassis is a type of automotive construction with chassis that is similar to the body on frame design Instead of a relatively flat ladder like structure with two longitudinal parallel frame rails it consists of a central strong tubular backbone usually rectangular in cross section that carries the power train and connects the front and rear suspension attachment structures Although the backbone is frequently drawn upward into and mostly above the floor of the vehicle the body is still placed on or over sometimes straddling this structure from above br br br X frame br br This is the design used for the full size American models of General Motors in the late s and early s in which the rails from alongside the engine seemed to cross in the passenger compartment each continuing to the opposite end of the crossmember at the extreme rear of the vehicle It was specifically chosen to decrease the overall height of the vehicles regardless of the increase in the size of the transmission and propeller shaft humps since each row had to cover frame rails as well Several models had the differential located not by the customary bar between axle and frame but by a ball joint atop the differential connected to a socket in a wishbone hinged onto a crossmember of the frame br The X frame was claimed to improve on previous designs but it lacked side rails and thus did not provide adequate side impact and collision protection Perimeter frames replaced this design br br br Perimeter frame br br Similar to a ladder frame but the middle sections of the frame rails sit outboard of the front and rear rails routed around the passenger footwells inside the rocker and sill panels This allowed the floor pan to be lowered especially the passenger footwells lowering the passengers seating height and thereby reducing both the roof line and overall vehicle height as well as the center of gravity thus improving handling and road holding in passenger cars br This became the prevalent design for body on frame cars in the United States but not in the rest of the world until the unibody gained popularity For example Hudson introduced this construction on their rd generation Commodore models in This frame type allowed for annual model changes and lower cars introduced in the s to increase sales without costly structural changes br The Ford Panther platform discontinued in was one of the last perimeter frame passenger car platforms in the United States The fourth to seventh generation Chevrolet Corvette used a perimeter frame integrated with an internal skeleton that serves as a clamshell br In addition to a lowered roof the perimeter frame allows lower seating positions when that is desirable and offers better safety in the event of a side impact However the design lacks stiffness because the transition areas from front to center and center to rear reduce beam and torsional resistance and is used in combination with torque boxes and soft suspension settings br br br Platform frame br br This is a modification of the perimeter frame or of the backbone frame in which the passenger compartment floor and sometimes the luggage compartment floor have been integrated into the frame as loadbearing parts for strength and rigidity The sheet metal used to assemble the components needs to be stamped with ridges and hollows to give it strength br Platform chassis were used on several successful European cars most notably the Volkswagen Beetle where it was called body on pan construction Another German example are the Mercedes Benz Ponton cars of the s and s where it was called a frame floor in English language advertisements br The French Renault of which over eight million were made also used a platform frame The frame of the Citro n CV used a minimal interpretation of a platform chassis under its body br br br Space frame br br In a tubular spaceframe chassis the suspension engine and body panels are attached to a three dimensional skeletal frame of tubes and the body panels have limited or no structural function To maximize rigidity and minimize weight the design frequently makes maximum use of triangles and all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compressive never bending so they can be kept as thin as possible br The first true spaceframe chassis were produced in the s by Buckminster Fuller and William Bushnell Stout the Dymaxion and the Stout Scarab who understood the theory of the true spaceframe from either architecture or aircraft design br The Jaguar C Type racing sports car utilized a lightweight multi tubular triangulated frame over which an aerodynamic aluminum body was crafted br In the Audi A was the first mass market car with an aluminium chassis made feasible by integrating an aluminium space frame into the bodywork Audi A models have since used this construction method co developed with Alcoa and marketed as the Audi Space Frame br The Italian term Superleggera meaning super light was trademarked by Carrozzeria Touring for lightweight sports car body construction that only resembles a space frame chassis Using a three dimensional frame that consists of a cage of narrow tubes that besides being under the body run up the fenders and over the radiator cowl and roof and under the rear window it resembles a geodesic structure A skin is attached to the outside of the frame often made of aluminum This body construction is however not stress bearing and still requires the addition of a chassis br br br Unibody br br The terms unibody and unit body are short for unitized body unitary construction or alternatively fully integrated body and frame chassis It is defined as br br A type of body frame construction in which the body of the vehicle its floor plan and chassis form a single structure Such a design is generally lighter and more rigid than a vehicle having a separate body and frame br Vehicle structure has shifted from the traditional body on frame architecture to the lighter unitized integrated body structure that is now used for most cars br Integral frame and body construction requires more than simply welding an unstressed body to a conventional frame In a fully integrated body structure the entire car is a load carrying unit that handles all the loads experienced by the vehicle forces from driving and cargo loads Integral type bodies for wheeled vehicles are typically manufactured by welding preformed metal panels and other components together by forming or casting whole sections as one piece or by combining these techniques Although this is sometimes also referred to as a monocoque structure because the car s outer skin and panels are made load bearing there are still ribs bulkheads and box sections to reinforce the body making the description semi monocoque more appropriate br The first attempt to develop such a design technique was on the Lancia Lambda to provide structural stiffness and a lower body height for its torpedo car body The Lambda had an open layout with unstressed roof which made it less of a monocoque shell and more like a bowl One thousand were produced br A key role in developing the unitary body was played by the American firm the Budd Company now ThyssenKrupp Budd Budd supplied pressed steel bodywork fitted to separate frames to automakers Dodge Ford Buick and the French company Citro n br In Joseph Ledwinka an engineer with Budd designed an automobile prototype with a full unitary construction br Citro n purchased this fully unitary body design for the Citro n Traction Avant This high volume mass production car was introduced in and sold units over the next years of production This application was the first iteration of the modern structural integration of body and chassis using spot welded deeply stamped steel sheets into a structural cage including sills pillars and roof beams In addition to a unitary body with no separate frame the Traction Avant also featured other innovations such as front wheel drive The result was a low slung vehicle with an open flat floored interior br For the Chrysler Airflow Budd supplied a variation three main sections from the Airflow s body were welded into what Chrysler called a bridge truss construction Unfortunately this method was not ideal because the panel fits were poor To convince a skeptical public of the strength of unibody both Citro n and Chrysler created advertising films showing cars surviving after being pushed off a cliff br Opel was the second European and the first German car manufacturer to produce a car with a unibody structure production of the compact Olympia started in A larger Kapit n went into production in although its front longitudinal beams were stamped separately and then attached to the main body It was so successful that the Soviet post war mass produced GAZ M Pobeda of copied unibody structure from the Opel Kapit n Later Soviet limousine GAZ ZIM of introduced unibody design to automobiles with a wheelbase as long as m in br The streamlined Lincoln Zephyr with conventional front engine rear wheel drive layout utilized a unibody structure By unit construction was no longer a new idea for cars but it was unheard of in the American low price field and Nash wanted a bigger share of that market The single unit body construction of the Nash provided weight savings and Nash s Chairman and CEO George W Mason was convinced that unibody was the wave of the future br Since then more cars were redesigned to the unibody structure which is now considered standard in the industry By the unitized body design was used by Detroit s Big Three on their compact cars Ford Falcon Plymouth Valiant and Chevrolet Corvair After Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form American Motors Corporation its Rambler badged automobiles continued exclusively building variations of the unibody br Although the Chrysler Airflow had a weaker than usual frame and body framework welded to the chassis to provide stiffness in Chrysler moved from body on frame construction to a unit body design for most of its cars br Most of the American manufactured unibody automobiles used torque boxes in their vehicle design to reduce vibrations and chassis flex except for the Chevy II which had a bolt on front apron erroneously referred to as a subframe American Motors with its partner Renault during the late s incorporated unibody construction when designing the Jeep Cherokee XJ platform using the manufacturing principles unisides floorplan with integrated frame rails and crumple zones and roof panel used in its passenger cars such as the Hornets and all wheel drive Eagles for a new type of frame called the Uniframe a robust stamped steel frame welded to a strong unit body structure giving the strength of a conventional heavy frame with the weight advantages of Unibody construction This design was also used with the XJC concept developed by American Motors before its absorption by Chrysler which later became the Jeep Grand Cherokee ZJ The design is still used in modern day sport utility vehicles such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee br The unibody is now the preferred construction for mass market automobiles This design provides weight savings improved space utilization and ease of manufacture Acceptance grew dramatically in the wake of the two energy crises of the s and that of the s in which compact SUVs using a truck platform primarily the USA market were subjected to CAFE standards after by the late s truck based compact SUVs were phased out and replaced with crossovers An additional advantage of a strong bodied car lies in the improved crash protection for its passengers br br br Partial frames br br br Subframe br br A subframe is a distinct structural frame component to reinforce or complement a particular section of a vehicle s structure Typically attached to a unibody or a monocoque the rigid subframe can handle great forces from the engine and drive train It can transfer them evenly to a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a unitized body shell Subframes are often found at the front or rear end of cars and are used to attach the suspension to the vehicle A subframe may also contain the engine and transmission It normally has pressed or box steel construction but may be tubular and or other material br Examples of passenger car use include the GM F platform the numerous years and models built on the GM X platform GM s M L platform vans Chevrolet Astro GMC Safari which included an all wheel drive variant and the unibody AMC Pacer that incorporated a front subframe to isolate the passenger compartment from the engine suspension and
