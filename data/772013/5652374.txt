id: 5652374
An immobiliser or immobilizer is an electronic security device fitted to a motor vehicle that prevents the engine from being started unless the correct key transponder or smart key is present This prevents the vehicle from being hot wired after entry has been achieved and thus reduces motor vehicle theft Research shows that the uniform application of immobilisers reduced the rate of car theft by br br br Description br The electric immobiliser alarm system was invented by St George Evans and Edward Birkenbuel and patented in They developed a x grid of double contact switches on a panel mounted inside the car so when the ignition switch was activated current from the battery or magneto went to the spark plugs allowing the engine to start or immobilizing the vehicle and sounding the horn The system settings could be changed each time the car was driven Modern immobiliser systems are automatic meaning the owner does not have to remember to activate it br Early models used a static code in the ignition key or key fob which was recognised by an RFID loop transponder around the lock barrel and checked against the vehicle s engine control unit ECU for a match If the code is unrecognised the ECU will not allow fuel to flow and ignition to take place br Later models use rolling codes or advanced cryptography to defeat copying of the code from the key or ECU smart key br The microcircuit inside the key is activated by a small electromagnetic field which induces current to flow inside the key body which in turn broadcasts a unique binary code which is read by the automobile s ECU When the ECU determines that the coded key is both current and valid the ECU activates the fuel injection sequence br In some vehicles attempts to use an unauthorised or non sequenced key cause the vehicle to activate a timed no start condition and in some highly advanced systems even use satellite or mobile phone communication to alert a security firm that an unauthorised attempt was made to code a key br Coincidentally this information is often recorded in modern automobile ECUs as part of their on board diagnostics which may record many other variables including speed temperature driver weight geographic location throttle position and yaw angle This information can be used during insurance investigations warranty claims or technical troubleshooting br br br Regulation br Immobilisers have been mandatory in all new cars sold in Germany since January in the United Kingdom since October in Finland since in Australia since br In September a Transport Canada regulation mandated the installation of engine immobilisers in all new lightweight vehicles and trucks manufactured in Canada br br br Availability by car brand br Honda was the first motorcycle manufacturer to include immobilisers on its products in the s br Add on immobilisers are available for older cars or vehicles that do not come equipped with factory immobilisers The insurance approval for a self arming immobiliser is known as Thatcham after the Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre in Thatcham England Approved immobilisers must intercept at least two circuits typically the low voltage ignition circuit and the fuel pump circuit Some may also intercept the low current starter motor circuit from the key switch to the relay br Lack of immobilizers in many Kia and Hyundai U S models after and before mid made these cars targets for theft in the early s especially in Milwaukee County Wisconsin and Columbus Ohio The Kia Challenge TikTok trend was linked to series of Hyundai Kia vehicle thefts in br br br Cracking br Numerous vulnerabilities have been found in the immobilisers designed to protect modern cars from theft Many vehicle immobilisers use the Megamos chip which has been proven to be crackable The Megamos transponder is one of many different transponders found in today s immobiliser systems and also comes in many different versions Hacking of an immobiliser in the real world would be performed on the vehicle not on the key It would be faster to program a new key to the vehicle than to try to clone the existing key especially on modern vehicles br Some immobiliser systems tend to remember the last key code for so long that they may even accept a non transponder key even after the original key has been removed from the ignition for a few minutes br br br Effectiveness br A study in the Economic Journal found that the immobiliser lowered the overall rate of car theft by about between and The benefits in terms of prevented thefts were at least three times higher than the costs of installing the device br br br See also br Anti theft system br Anti hijack system br Ignition interlock device br Vehicle Theft Protection Program br Remote
