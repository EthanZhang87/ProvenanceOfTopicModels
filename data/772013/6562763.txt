id: 6562763
An opera window is a small fixed window usually behind the rear side window of an automobile They are typically mounted in the C pillar of some cars The design feature was popular during the s and early s and adopted by domestic U S manufacturers most often with a vinyl roof br The origin was from opera vehicles of around with occasional collapsible seating for extra passengers The opera window was also a feature on formal roof and limousine models with higher than a normal roof to accommodate passengers with top hats br br br History br br br The design element of a distinct fixed centered opera window was borrowed from such windows in horse drawn carriages and used during the classical era of automobile styling For example the Elcar in was good looking and even a fabric top in the style of a brougham with oval opera windows framed by landau bars Opera windows saw their demise in the s br Perhaps the most notable return was the porthole in the Ford Thunderbird It was provided as an option to improve rear quarter visibility with the removable hardtop in place The hottest thing going was the porthole window in the rear side pillar called opera windows that came in during the horse and buggy era br Opera windows began reappearing in the early s in such vehicles as the Continental Mark IV Almost all personal luxury cars would adopt opera windows usually framed by a vinyl roof Most often opera window variants were applied on two door hardtop or coup models spanning all types of vehicles from economy compacts to flagship personal luxury cars in which latter exploding realm they became recognition elements seeking to add a vintage element to their styling General Motors introduced an all new line of mid sized Colonade models for the model year Standard on all the coupes was a fixed triangular rear quarter window while higher trim versions used a rectangular vertical opera window br In some cars an additional feature was the so called opera light that was mounted on the outside of the B pillar or C pillar and illuminated when the exterior lights were switched on br br br Function br The windows were intended to offset the significant blind spots created by wide C pillars that were characteristic of many American cars produced at this time In an age of decreasing dimensions and increasingly common use of non opening rear side windows on door models a variety of shapes of rear windows may have helped passengers there to feel somewhat less claustrophobic br These windows were usually non functional however in the case of the AMC Matador coupe NASCAR racers the standard roll down quarter windows were causing aerodynamic drag Penske racing requested AMC a small porthole to smooth the airflow when open to the wind under racing conditions To qualify as a stock item for use on the tracks NASCAR required units must be available to the public The small opera window was first an optional D L Formal Window Package on the Brougham
