title: Backbone chassis
id: 8823195
Backbone tube chassis is a type of automobile construction chassis that is similar to the body on frame design Instead of a two dimensional ladder type structure it consists of a strong tubular backbone usually rectangular in cross section that connects the front and rear suspension attachment areas A body is then placed on this structure It was first used in the English Rover hp of and then the French Simplicia automobile in br The backbone chassis was extensively developed by Hans Ledwinka who used it in greater numbers on the Tatra and subsequent vehicles Ledwinka later used backbone frames with central tube and axles with swinging driveshafts on Tatra trucks becoming known as Tatra concept br br br Design br The truck backbone chassis is a design feature of Czech Tatra heavy trucks cross country military etc Hans Ledwinka used this style of chassis for the Tatra car in He then developed the design on trucks with x model Tatra which had excellent off road abilities br br This type of chassis has been used in numerous sports cars It does not provide protection against side collisions and thus has to be combined with a body that would compensate for this shortcoming br Examples of cars using a backbone chassis are Simplicia De Tomaso Mangusta DMC DeLorean Lloyd Lotus Elan Lotus Esprit and Europa koda Popular koda Rapid koda Superb Tatra br Tatra Tatra Toyota GT and TVR S Trucks with a backbone chassis include the Tatra Tatra and Tatra Some cars also use a backbone as a part of the chassis to strengthen it Examples include the Volkswagen Beetle where the transmission tunnel forms a backbone br br br Hybrid backbone ladder chassis br The Locost may appear to be using a backbone in addition to the outer space frame But examination shows that in standard form it is adding negligible stiffness and only serves as a convenient support structure for the sheet metal panels forming the transmission tunnel The Triumph Herald and Triumph Vitesse used a twin flanged box section backbone carrying the main torsional and bending loads with light channel section side rails to stiffen the body while the Triumph Spitfire and Triumph GT sports cars used only the twin box section backbone with separate side members in the body and rear suspension fore and aft loads were also taken by the floor not the backbone chassis directly br br br Advantages br A standard conception truck s superstructure has to withstand the torsion twist and subsequent wear reduces vehicle s lifespan br The half axles have better contact with the ground when operated off road This has little importance on roads br The vulnerable parts of the drive shaft are covered by a thick tube The whole system is extremely reliable However if a problem occurs repairs are more complicated br The modular system enables configurations of or axle vehicles with various wheel bases br The lack of structure in the sills rocker area allows deeper doors and a lower floor useful in low slung sportscars br br br Disadvantages br Manufacturing the backbone chassis is more complicated and more costly However the more axles with all wheel drive are needed the more cost benefit turns in favor of backbone chassis br The backbone chassis is heavier for a given torsional stiffness than a uni body br The chassis gives no protection against side impacts br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Comparison of standard ladder chassis and backbone chassis with half axles on off road testing track with emphasis on the twist of superstructure video br Ladder chassis Renault fire engine br Backbone chassis Tatra T fire engine
