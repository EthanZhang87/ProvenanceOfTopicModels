title: Clutch
id: 6517
A clutch is a mechanical device that allows the output shaft to be disconnected from the rotating input shaft The clutch s input shaft is typically attached to a motor while the clutch s output shaft is connected to the mechanism that does the work br In a motor vehicle the clutch acts as a mechanical linkage between the engine and transmission By disengaging the clutch the engine speed RPM is no longer determined by the speed of the driven wheels br Another example of clutch usage is in electric drills The clutch s input shaft is driven by a motor and the output shaft is connected to the drill bit via several intermediate components The clutch allows the drill bit to either spin at the same speed as the motor clutch engaged spin at a lower speed as the motor clutch slipping or remain stationary while the motor is spinning clutch disengaged br br br Types br br br Dry clutch br br A dry clutch uses dry friction to transfer power from the input shaft to the output shaft for example a friction disk pressing on a car engine s flywheel The majority of clutches are dry clutches especially in vehicles with manual transmissions Slippage of a friction clutch where the clutch is partially engaged but the shafts are rotating at different speeds is sometimes required such as when a motor vehicle accelerates from a standstill however the slippage should be minimised to avoid increased wear rates br In a pull type clutch pressing the pedal pulls the release bearing to disengage the clutch In a push type clutch pressing the pedal pushes the release bearing to disengage the clutch br A multi plate clutch consists of several friction plates arranged concentrically In some cases it is used instead of a larger diameter clutch Drag racing cars use multi plate clutches to control the rate of power transfer to the wheels as the vehicle accelerates from a standing start br Some clutch disks include springs designed to change the natural frequency of the clutch disc in order to reduce NVH within the vehicle Also some clutches for manual transmission cars use a clutch delay valve to avoid abrupt engagements of the clutch br br br Wet clutch br In a wet clutch the friction material sits in an oil bath or has flow through oil which cools and lubricates the clutch This can provide smoother engagement and a longer lifespan of the clutch however wet clutches can have a lower efficiency due to some energy being transferred to the oil Since the surfaces of a wet clutch can be slippery as with a motorcycle clutch bathed in engine oil stacking multiple clutch discs can compensate for the lower coefficient of friction and so eliminate slippage under power when fully engaged br Wet clutches often use a composite paper material br br br Centrifugal clutch br br A centrifugal clutch automatically engages as the speed of the input shaft increases and disengages as the input shaft speed decreases Applications include small motorcycles motor scooters chainsaws and some older automobiles br br br Cone clutch br br A cone clutch is similar to dry friction plate clutch except the friction material is applied to the outside of a conical shaped object br A common application for cone clutches is the synchronizer ring in a manual transmission br br br Dog clutch br br A dog clutch is a non slip design of clutch which is used in non synchronous transmissions br br br Single revolution clutch br br The single revolution clutch was developed in the th century to power machinery such as shears or presses where a single pull of the operating lever or later press of a button would trip the mechanism engaging the clutch between the power source and the machine s crankshaft for exactly one revolution before disengaging the clutch When the clutch is disengaged the driven member is stationary Early designs were typically dog clutches with a cam on the driven member used to disengage the dogs at the appropriate point br Greatly simplified single revolution clutches were developed in the th century requiring much smaller operating forces and in some variations allowing for a fixed fraction of a revolution per operation Fast action friction clutches replaced dog clutches in some applications eliminating the problem of impact loading on the dogs every time the clutch engaged br In addition to their use in heavy manufacturing equipment single revolution clutches were applied to numerous small machines In tabulating machines for example pressing the operate key would trip a single revolution clutch to process the most recently entered number In typesetting machines pressing any key selected a particular character and also engaged a single rotation clutch to cycle the mechanism to typeset that character Similarly in teleprinters the receipt of each character tripped a single revolution clutch to operate one cycle of the print mechanism br In Frederick G Creed developed a single turn wrap spring clutch that was particularly well suited to the repetitive start stop action required in teleprinters In two employees of Pitney Bowes Postage Meter Company developed an improved single turn spring clutch In these clutches a coil spring is wrapped around the driven shaft and held in an expanded configuration by the trip lever When tripped the spring rapidly contracts around the power shaft engaging the clutch At the end of one revolution if the trip lever has been reset it catches the end of the spring or a pawl attached to it and the angular momentum of the driven member releases the tension on the spring These clutches have long operating lives many have performed tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of cycles without the need of maintenance other than occasional lubrication br Cascaded pawl single revolution clutches superseded wrap spring single revolution clutches in page printers such as teleprinters including the Teletype Model and its successors using the same design principles IBM Selectric typewriters also used them These are typically disc shaped assemblies mounted on the driven shaft Inside the hollow disc shaped drive drum are two or three freely floating pawls arranged so that when the clutch is tripped the pawls spring outward much like the shoes in a drum brake When engaged the load torque on each pawl transfers to the others to keep them engaged These clutches do not slip once locked up and they engage very quickly on the order of milliseconds A trip projection extends out from the assembly If the trip lever engaged this projection the clutch was disengaged When the trip lever releases this projection internal springs and friction engage the clutch The clutch then rotates one or more turns stopping when the trip lever again engages the trip projection br br br Other designs br br Kickback clutch brakes Found in some types of synchronous motor driven electric clocks built before the s to prevent the clock from running backwards The clutch consisted of a wrap spring clutch brake that was coupled to the rotor by one or two stages of reduction gearing The clutch brake locked up when rotated backwards but also had some spring action The inertia of the rotor going backwards engaged the clutch and wound the spring As it unwound it restarted the motor in the correct direction br Belt clutch used on agricultural equipment lawnmowers tillers and snow blowers Engine power is transmitted via a set of belts that are slack when the engine is idling but an idler pulley can tighten the belts to increase friction between the belts and the pulleys br BMA clutch Invented by Waldo J Kelleigh in used for transmitting torque between two shafts consisting of a fixed driving member secured to one of said shafts and a movable driving member having a contacting surface with a plurality of indentations br Electromagnetic clutch typically engaged by an electromagnet that is an integral part of the clutch assembly Another type the magnetic particle clutch contains magnetically influenced particles in a chamber between driving and driven members application of direct current makes the particles clump together and adhere to the operating surfaces Engagement and slippage are notably smooth br Wrap spring clutch has a helical spring typically wound with square cross section wire These were developed in the late th and early th century In simple form the spring is fastened at one end to the driven member its other end is unattached The spring fits closely around a cylindrical driving member If the driving member rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag Because of this spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil Rotating the driving member the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly The torque required to make a spring clutch slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring obeying the capstan equation br br br Usage in automobiles br br br Manual transmissions br Most cars and trucks with a manual transmission use a dry clutch which is operated by the driver using the left most pedal The motion of the pedal is transferred to the clutch using hydraulics master and slave cylinders or a cable The clutch is only disengaged at times when the driver is pressing on the clutch pedal therefore the default state is for the transmission to be connected to the engine A neutral gear position is provided so that the clutch pedal can be released with the vehicle remaining stationary br The clutch is required for standing starts and is usually but not always used to assist in synchronising the speeds of the engine and transmission during gear changes i e while reducing the engine speed RPM during upshifts and increasing the engine speed during downshifts br The clutch is usually mounted directly to the face of the engine s flywheel as this already provides a convenient large diameter steel disk that can act as one driving plate of the clutch Some racing clutches use small multi plate disk packs that are not part of the flywheel Both clutch and flywheel are enclosed in a conical bellhousing for the gearbox The friction material used for the clutch disk varies with a common material being an organic compound resin with a copper wire facing or a ceramic material br br br Automatic transmissions br In an automatic transmission the role of the clutch is performed by a torque converter However the transmission itself often includes internal clutches such as a lock up clutch to prevent slippage of the torque converter in order to reduce the energy loss through the transmission and therefore improve fuel economy br br br Fans and compressors br Older belt driven engine cooling fans often use a heat activated clutch in the form of a bimetallic strip When the temperature is low the spring winds and closes the valve which lets the fan spin at about to of the crankshaft speed As the temperature of the spring rises it unwinds and opens the valve allowing fluid past the valve making the fan spin at about to of crankshaft speed br A vehicle s air conditioning compressor often uses magnetic clutches to engage the compressor as required br br br Usage in motorcycles br br Motorcycles typically employ a wet clutch with the clutch riding in the same oil as the transmission These clutches are usually made up of a stack of alternating friction plates and steel plates The friction plates have lugs on their outer diameters that lock them into a basket that is turned by the crankshaft The steel plates have lugs on their inner diameters that lock them to the transmission input shaft A set of coil springs or a diaphragm spring plate force the plates together when the clutch is engaged br On motorcycles the clutch is operated by a hand lever on the left handlebar No pressure on the lever means that the clutch plates are engaged driving while pulling the lever back towards the rider disengages the clutch plates through cable or hydraulic actuation allowing the rider to shift gears or coast Racing motorcycles often use slipper clutches to eliminate the effects of engine braking which being applied only to the rear wheel can cause instability br br br See also br br br
