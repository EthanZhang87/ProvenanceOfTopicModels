Scissor doors also called flap doors wing doors beetle wing doors turtle doors switchblade doors swing up doors upswing doors Lamborghini doors and Lambo doors are automobile doors that rotate vertically at a fixed hinge at the front of the door rather than outward as with a conventional door br br br History br br The first vehicle to feature scissor doors was the Alfa Romeo Carabo concept car designed by Bertone s Marcello Gandini The door style was dictated by Gandini s desire for an innovative design and by his concern over the car s extremely poor rear visibility In order to reverse the car the driver would be able to lift the door and lean his upper body out of the hatch in order to see behind the car The first production car to feature the doors was a Lamborghini Gandini s Countach the sports car s wide chassis created similar problems to those found on the Carabo calling for the unusual door configuration This sports car was quite impractical for real life as due to unusual design it was impossible to backup without doors open wide So such doors were originally offered as a practical measure that helped the driver Besides traditional swing open doors would make it more difficult to get out of the vehicle due to high door sills The doors were used on the Countach s successor the Diablo on its replacement the Murci lago and on a low production run derivative of the Murci lago called the Revent n The Centenario is the latest Lamborghini car to feature the trademark doors Having used the exotic door style for several of its cars the Italian manufacturer has become synonymous with the implementation of scissor doors which are sometimes colloquially referred to as Lambo doors br br Today many aftermarket companies are specialized in production of scissor door conversion kits for regular production cars that originally come with regular doors A common scissor door conversion kit also known as a Lambo door kit includes model specific redesigned door hinges and gas filled shocks Such kits are usually bolt on or weld on and require some modifications to front bumpers and door panels Original door panels are not replaced so a vehicle looks standard from the outside when the doors are closed br br br Advantages br Offers the possibility of operating the car with the door open in a manner that would be difficult or impossible in a car with conventional doors br Because the doors stay within the car s track throughout their range of movement they are useful when parking in tight spaces A gull wing door style offers similar usability but the doors swing out from the car s area slightly br The hinge is placed in a similar location to a conventional door so a convertible version of the car is possible with the same door style br Reduces the dooring hazard to cyclists br br br Disadvantages br The cost of manufacturing the door hinge can be more than that of a conventional door br The door still impedes access egress much more than a gullwing and in some cases more than a conventional door br If the height of the parking lot ceiling is insufficient a car door may come into contact with it when it opens br In the event of a rollover emergency egress may be more difficult than with conventional doors or impossible br br br Types br There are different types of scissor doors The conventional type rotates to degrees Scissor doors can be powered and they usually are br br br Vertical lift system br Vertical lift system VLS doors have a scissor door configuration The biggest difference is that they are designed to initially open slightly outward before opening upward to allow the top edge of the door to clear the door frame and A pillar Although butterfly doors also move upwards and outwards VLS doors are not the same as butterfly doors as VLS doors move outward only a small degree compared to butterfly doors br br br degrees br Although conventional scissor doors rotate to degrees some can rotate up to degrees these are commonly used for modified cars Such scissor doors have the benefit of not obstructing the entrance or exit to the car as much as conventional scissor doors VLS doors also can be made to rotate to degrees br br br Scissor conventional door hybrid br Some aftermarket example scissor doors are also designed so they can open either vertically scissor door or horizontally conventional door as the user chooses Such doors allow the user to gain the benefits of both types of door choosing to open the doors in whichever style is best suited to the situation br br br In popular culture br Scissor doors are widely noted as a status symbol in popular culture In Migos released a track called Lambo Doors in the first line referring to an observer who has never seen such high status doors In Rick Ross released a track called Lamborghini Doors in which he notes a number of objects that are rising up like the titular doors In the TV series Silicon Valley a character remarks that he feels poor when he has regular car doors rather than doors that go like this gesturing as if his arms were gull wing doors or like this gesturing as if his arms were scissor doors leading to other commentators referring to scissor doors as billionaire doors br br br See also br br br br br br External links
