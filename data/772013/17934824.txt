A vehicle canopy is a rarely used type of door for cars It has no official name so it is also known as an articulated canopy bubble canopy cockpit canopy canopy door or simply a canopy A canopy is a type of door which sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way to provide access for passengers It is similar to an aircraft canopy There are no established sub types of canopies so they can be hinged at the front side or back although hinging at the front is most common Canopy doors are rarely used on production cars and are sometimes used on concept cars br br br Advantages br Normal car doors open out of the car s track so they can obstruct the road or pavement when opened This is not an issue with canopies as they open vertically br A pillars are not necessary as there are no side doors so the windscreen can extend from the front to the back of the car giving the driver a field of vision of more than degrees and minimising blind spots A pillars are sometimes still added such as in the Sterling Nova to give the car a more conventional look br br br Disadvantages br Air conditioning or climate control is necessary with an all glass canopy or with a wrap around windscreen because the canopy provides substantial greenhouse effect br In the case of a rollover accident exiting the vehicle would be impossible short of breaking the glass br Entering and exiting the vehicle can be hard with a high sill and awkward roof positioning This problem was overcome with the Saab Aero X which has a part canopy to fully open the interior br In situations of bad weather such as snow rain or hail it is impossible to enter or exit the vehicle without getting the interior wet unless under cover Significant snow accumulation may also need to be removed from the roof to make it light enough to lift br br br Cars that use canopies br This is not an exhaustive list br br br Messerschmitts br br Messerschmitt the notable German aeroplane manufacturer weren t allowed to produce aircraft after World War II Instead they produced cars These were designed by the aircraft engineer Fritz Fend A vehicle canopy was a new concept that is believed to be invented by Messerschmitt this originated from their aircraft design They quickly adopted the canopy as this was a simple solution that they had experience in Unlike most car canopies the Messerschmitt canopies are hinged on the side as was the canopy of their famous Bf fighter as was common with numerous other pre war and wartime fighter designs A problem with side hinging is that for a car with normal side by side seating arrangement the passengers sitting closest to the hinge will have to climb across the outer seat to get out of the car For that reason the side hinging canopy is best suited for single occupant or tandem seat cars and after this canopies were usually hinged at the front or back br br br Messerschmitt KR br The KR was the first car production or concept to have a canopy In the model was changed to the Messerschmitt KR br br br Messerschmitt KR br The most noticeable thing about the KR is its distinctive bubble canopy which gave rise to the term bubble car The KR continued Messerschmitt s side hinged canopies These were usually transparent acrylic Plexiglas or Perspex though reproductions are car safe polymethyl methacrylate br br br Alfa Romeo Scarabeo concept car br The first of concept cars made under the Alfa Romeo Scarabeo name was equipped with a forward hinged canopy br br br Holden Hurricane br br The Holden Hurricane concept car features a canopy door br br br Ferrari Modulo concept car br The Ferrari S Modulo concept car designed by Pininfarina features a canopy door br br br Bond Bug br br The Bond Bug is a small wheeled sports car and was the first production car to use a front hinged canopy br br br Nova kit car br Other than the Purvis Eureka a licensed copy of the Nova and the Bond Bug the Nova is the only production car to date to use a front hinged canopy door The windscreen has small A pillars so it looks like a conventional car when the canopy is closed br br br Buick Wildcat concept car br The Buick Wildcat concept car had a canopy The style of canopy used was an extended canopy composed of much of the front bodywork and not just the passenger compartment A canopy was used in this concept car as it was thought to be futuristic br br br Volkswagen litre car br br The concept Volkswagen litre car the VW L uses a canopy door The production version of the concept used butterfly doors br br br Maserati Birdcage th concept car br The Maserati Birdcage th lacks conventional doors instead using an extended canopy system The demonstrator model lacks air conditioning and so journalists including Evo Magazine s Harry Metcalfe experienced the previously mentioned glasshouse effect whilst driving the vehicle they were reportedly forced to keep the bubble slightly open on hot days to cool the car s interior br br br Saab Aero X concept car br br The Aero X s top canopy is styled on the one of the Saab aeroplanes and this was their inspiration for using a canopy The canopy opens by remote control and there is a lever to close it again br The three piece canopy eliminates the problems like a high sill and awkwardly angled roof although the mechanisms are more complex and so heavier and more likely to fail leaving an occupant stranded inside a car br The canopy includes a wrap around windscreen and a glass roof side windows and body panels which lift upwards lowering the sills and the top roof section of the interior fascia which moves inwards so it doesn t obstruct entry exit These sections intricately manoeuvre themselves into a position where they take up as little space as possible This construction eliminates the need for doors and A pillars and so the windscreen extends from B pillar to B pillar which has the important benefit of improving overall visibility br br br Human Horizons Concept H br In October Human Horizons the mother company of the HiPhi NEV brand revealed the Concept H alongside the Concept A The H is for Hypervelocity and the concept features a set of butterfly doors with an additional canopy opening which the company calls the A C E S or Articulated Cabin Entry System which moves part of the roof to make access easier The idea was later transferred to the HiPhi X production car in the form of gull wing doors or what the company calls the NT door br br br Batmobile br Various models of the Batmobile used in the production of the Batman films make use of the canopy door br br br Custom cars br br Bubble canopies are popular on some custom cars most notably those by Ed Roth such as the Orbitron Road Agent and Beatnik Bandit br br br Lamborghini br The Lamborghini Egoista the company s th anniversary celebration car has a canopy door It is designed to look like a fighter jet The Lamborghini Terzo Millennio a futuristic electric concept car introduced by Lamborghini and developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT also has a canopy door br br br In fictional media br The action roleplay video game expansion Cyberpunk Phantom Liberty features the Herrera Riptide a retro futuristic sports coupe vehicle that has a canopy door br br br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br A video
