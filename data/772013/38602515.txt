Omniview technology also known as surround view or bird view is a vehicle parking assistant technology that first was introduced in as the Around View Monitor option for the Nissan Elgrand and Infiniti EX It is designed to assist drivers in monitoring their surroundings for example while parking a vehicle in a small space br br br Principle br Early vehicle parking assistant products used ultrasonic parking sensors and or a single rear view camera to view and obtain distances to objects surrounding the vehicle providing drivers with an audible alarm or rear view video through a fisheye lens There are some drawbacks to these early products the alarm only provides a proximity warning but not the position of the object s relative to the vehicle and the rear view camera has a limited field of view However omniview technology overcomes these problems and has seen increasing availability br br Omniview system br br br br br br br br br br In most omniview systems there are four wide angle cameras one in the front of the vehicle one in the back of the vehicle and one each in the side mounted rear view mirrors The four cameras have overlapping fields of view that collectively cover the whole area around the vehicle and serve as an omnidirectional degree camera Video from the cameras are sent to the processor which synthesizes a bird s eye view from above the vehicle by stitching the video feeds together correcting distortion and transforming the perspective In some cases ultrasonic sensors are used in combination with the omniview system to provide distance information and highlight the relevant view that may be affected by potential obstacles br Because the bird s eye view is a simulated perspective using camera inputs much closer to the ground objects at ground level will appear relatively undistorted while those above the ground will appear to lean away from the vehicle In addition if the same object is captured by the overlapping fields of two cameras it can appear to lean away in two different directions br br br History br The first vehicle equipped with Nissan s Around View Monitor was the Japanese market Elgrand introduced in November In America the system was introduced one month later as an option for the EX from Nissan s luxury marque Infiniti At about the same time Mitsubishi Motors and Honda implemented similar functionality as the Multi around monitor system for the Delica and Multi View Camera System for the Odyssey respectively br Third party automotive component suppliers such as Freescale Semiconductor and Continental AG have developed and marketed modular omniview systems the latter through the acquisition of Application Solutions Ltd ASL Vision br Nissan have since added moving object detection using the cameras billing the system as Intelligent Around View Monitor I AVM In stuntman Paul Swift used the I AVM system to match the world record for the tightest J turn in a specially prepared Nissan Juke using a space just cm in wider than the vehicle s length to turn it around with the windows completely blacked out br An omniview system that uses four cameras and displays a three dimensional rendering of the vehicle and its surroundings has been proposed as a logical next step to increase the driver s awareness br br br See also br br br
