title: Turning radius
id: 7125851
The turning radius alternatively turning diameter or turning circle of a vehicle defines the minimum dimension typically the radius or diameter respectively of available space required for that vehicle to make a semi circular U turn without skidding The Oxford English Dictionary describes turning circle as the smallest circle within which a ship motor vehicle etc can be turned round completely The term thus refers to a theoretical minimal circle in which for example an aeroplane a ground vehicle or a watercraft can be turned around br The terms radius diameter or circle can have different meanings refer to the Alternative nomenclature section br br br Definition br br On wheeled vehicles with the common type of front wheel steering i e one two or even four wheels at the front capable of steering the vehicle s turning diameter measures the minimum space needed to turn the vehicle around while the steering is set to its maximum displacement from the central straight ahead position i e either extreme left or right If a marker pen was placed on the point of the vehicle furthest from the center of the turn the diameter of the circle traced during the turn defines the value of that vehicle s turning diameter Mathematically the turning radius would be half of the turning diameter br The curb to curb turning radius which considers the chassis and wheels only without body protrusions can be expressed as a simplified function of the wheelbase tire width and steering angle br br br br br t br u br r br n br i br n br g br br r br a br d br i br u br s br br br br br

generally associated with a standard rate turn in which an aircraft enters a coordinated turn which changes its heading at a rate of per second or in one minute In this case the turning radius depends

example a wheeled vehicle with a very small turning circle may be described as having a tight turning radius meaning that it is easier to turn around very tight corners Wheeled vehicles with four wheel steering will have a smaller turning radius than vehicles that steer wheels on one axle br br br Exceptions br br Technically the minimum possible turning circle for a vehicle would be where it does not move either forwards or backwards while turning and simply pivots on its central axis For a rectangular vehicle capable of doing this the smallest turning circle would be equal to the diagonal length of the vehicle As an example some boats can be turned in this way generally by using azimuth thrusters br Some wheeled vehicles are designed to spin around their central axis by making all wheels steerable such as certain lawnmowers and wheelchairs as they do not follow a circular path as they turn In this case the vehicle is referred to as a zero turning radius vehicle Some camera dollies used in the film industry have a round mode which allows them to spin around their z axis by allowing synchronized inverse rotation of their left and right wheel sets effectively giving them zero turning radius br Many conventionally steerable vehicles only one axle with steerable wheels can reverse the direction of travel in a space smaller than the stated turning radius by executing a specialized maneuver such as a J turn or similar skid or in a discontinuous motion such as a three point turn br br br Alternative nomenclature br br Other terms are sometimes used synonymously for turning diameter which can lead to confusion br br br Turning radius and diameter br The automotive term turning radius has been used as equivalent and interchangeable with the turning diameter For example the Audi A is specified by the manufacturer as having a turning diameter curb to curb of m ft Mathematically the radius of a circle is half the diameter so the correct turning radius in this example would be m m However another source lists the turning radius of the same vehicle as also being m which is the turning diameter br In practice the values of turning diameter tend to be listed more frequently in vehicle specifications so the term turning diameter will therefore be more correct in most cases The turning diameter will always give a higher number for a given vehicle and the turning diameter measurement is usually preferred by automotive manufacturers Such mixing of terms can lead to confusion among consumers br br br Turning circle br The term turning circle is another term also sometimes used synonymously for the turning diameter Some argue that turning circle is less ambiguous than turning radius but turning circle may introduce its own ambiguities since the same circle can be defined by multiple measurements including the radius br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br diameter br br br br d br br br br r br br br displaystyle d cdot r br br twice as big or circumference br br br br br br r br br br displaystyle pi r br br about times as big For example Motor Trend refers to a curb to curb turning circle of a Cadillac CTS as metres ft but the terminology is not yet settled AutoChannel com refers to the turning radius of the same car as metres ft br Turning circle is also sometimes used to refer to the path swept in the manoeuvre i e the arc or the circle s circumference in the case when the manoeuvre makes a complete turn br br br Different measurement methods br There are two methods for measuring the vehicle turning diameter which will give slightly different results These two methods are called wall to wall and curb to curb US spelling or alternatively kerb to kerb UK spelling br The wall to wall turning circle is the minimum distance between two walls both of which exceed the height of the vehicle in which the vehicle can make a U turn The kerb to kerb turning circle is the minimum distance between two raised curbs both of which are lower than the lowest body protrusions in which the vehicle can make a U turn The wall to wall turning circle is greater than the kerb to kerb measure for the same vehicle because of the front and rear body overhangs One can find these two ways of measuring the turning circle used in auto specifications for example a van might be listed as having a turning circle in meters of C W br br br Curb to curb br A curb or curb to curb turning circle will show the straight line distance from one side of the circle to the other through the center The name curb to curb indicates that a street would have to be this wide before this car can make a U turn and not hit a street curb with a wheel If you took the street curb and built it higher as high as the car and tried to make a U turn in the street parts of the car bumper would hit the wall br The kerb to kerb turning circle can be smaller than the turning circle as it refers to only a partial circle with the vehicle alongside one kerb to start with To perform a U turn in a forward direction only the centre of the turn is not coincident with the centre of the road thus a complete circle would not be possible without driving onto the pavement to complete the manoeuvre It also does not take into account that part of the vehicle that overhangs the wheels where as turning circle does br br br Wall to wall br The name wall or wall to wall turning circle denotes how far apart the two walls would have to be to allow a U turn without scraping the walls br br br Legal requirements for road vehicles br European Union and Switzerland br Road vehicles must be able to carry out a degrees turn on an annulus with an outer radius of metres ft and an inner radius of metres ft measured wall to wall In addition when entering this annulus no part of the vehicle can overreach a tangent by more than centimetres in this tangent is drawn at the outer m limit of the annulus br br New Zealand br New Zealand requires that road vehicles can perform a degrees turn on a circle with a metres ft diameter measured wall to wall The only part of the vehicle that may reach over this limitation are collapsible mirrors br br br Common
