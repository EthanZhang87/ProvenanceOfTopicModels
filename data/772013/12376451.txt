A bolt circle diameter or pitch circle diameter PCD sometimes simply called bolt circle or pitch circle is a common term for when a number of screw holes for bolts are evenly distributed with their centers along an imaginary circle with a given diameter br An example of use is mounting of car rims where the bolt circle is one of several factors that determine whether a set of rims will fit a car For example a bolt circle of or indicates that a rim is to be attached to the car via screws evenly spaced along a circle with a diameter of millimeters Other common uses for bolt circles are for indicating mounting for sim racing and real world car steering wheels or in the industry for mounting of servomotors or for specifying the bolt pattern of a flange Attachment of chain rings for bicycle cranksets are also specified by a bolt circle br br br Examples br br br Racing wheels br On steering wheels for cars utilizing bolt circles this usually measures mm Some racing wheels attach to the car via a quick release hub and this hub then usually has a corresponding bolt circle of mm Example of other less used patterns include in mm in mm mm and in mm br br br Servomotors br br Servomotors in the industry are often mounted via a flange like coupling to give the shortest possible leverage for high torque uses Industrial servomotors often use standardised mounting patterns of which one example is a bolt circle of mm diameter approximately corresponds to a square pattern of mm mm br br br Car rims br br The mounting pattern of most car rims are described using bolt patterns and this pattern is one of many factors which determine whether a rim will fit a given car Here the bolt circle indicates the number of wheel nuts and associated hub bolts or alternatively just wheel bolts br An example of a bolt circle is which indicates nuts placed on a circle with a diameter of mm Some of the most common bolt circle diameters on modern cars are mm mm and mm The bolt circle of a car is one of several parameters that must be checked before buying new rims to make sure they will fit the car along with wheel offset hub diameter and finally the diameter and width of the rim and tire Over the years over different bolt circles patterns have been used by car manufacturers most of which are not compatible with each other br br br See also br Pitch diameter a dimension of a screw thread br br br Referanser
