American provincial and state licensing agencies In some jurisdictions such as British Columbia vanity plates have a different color scheme and design br br br North America br br Vanity plates are issued by every U S state and the District of Columbia and every Canadian province except Newfoundland and Labrador br In the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators AAMVA and Stefan Lonce author of License to Roam Vanity License Plates and the Stories They Tell conducted North America s first state by state and province by province survey of vanity plates revealing that there are million vehicles with personalized vanity license plates The survey ranked jurisdictions by vanity plate penetration rate which is the percentage of registered motor vehicles that are vanitized

characters on many of its optional plates In some states a motorist may also check the availability of a desired combination online In New Jersey which uses six alphanumeric characters on its plates drivers can order vanity plates with seven characters br All U S states and Canadian provinces that issue vanity plates have a blue list of vanity plates that contains banned words phrases or letter number combinations The U S state of Florida for example has banned such plates as PIMPALA while the state of New York bans any plates with the letters FDNY NYPD or GOD among others Often the ban is to eliminate confusion with plates used on governmental vehicles or plates used on other classes of vehicles However a licensing authority s discretion to deny or revoke offensive vanity plates is finite as some U S motorists have successfully sued their state governments on that issue under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution The blue list is not definitive in general the agent processing an application for a vanity plate can reject a plate if it is deemed offensive even if the phrase does not match a banned word exactly State DMVs have received complaints about offensive vanity plates In this case the DMV can revoke a plate if it is deemed offensive even if it had been previously approved The blue list may be limited to genuine vanity plates not covering computer generated accidents For example Florida s famous A RGY license plate with the standard drawing of an orange in the middle looks like ASS ORGY The state of Georgia banned the word covfefe a misspelling of the word coverage that was coined by U S President Donald Trump on his Twitter to its customized plates br br br United Kingdom br br In the United Kingdom number plates are issued by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency DVLA They do not approve personalised registrations often also called private number plates and cherished number plates in the UK if they contain words which are offensive in any widely used language One registration to slip the net was PEN The DVLA however lately have released more and more previously banned combinations such as SEX and DAM UK plates have to match certain very strict letter number combinations see vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom br Registrations can be sold or transferred from one vehicle to another with some restrictions Registrations can also be held on a retention document issued by the DVLA this is perfect for dealers or if the owner is in between vehicles Only the registered owner registered keeper of the vehicle can be awarded the V Retention Document when making an online application However the V form postal application allows the number to be retained in someone else s name allocating them as new Grantee on the issued V retention document so the seller can transfer the plate to whoever is receiving the private number plate Usually the Cherished Number Agent handling the sale will arrange all this for the seller making it hassle free The trade of number plates was started by private dealers entrepreneurs who saw an opportunity to sell something in demand Originally the only vanity plates allowed to be transferred were ordinary registrations that had been transferred The DVLA began selling personalised registrations unrelated to the registration districts in More than million registrations were sold during the first years of this initiative raising over billion for the UK Treasury br There is some additional flexibility available by using numbers that resemble letters e g S for or by using large black yellow or white headed screws to fix the plate to the car to fill in or create a gap e g in the middle of H to make it look like two s or Is However the font style size and spacing is mandated by law making the practice illegal The font that is used on all new number plates is the Charles Wright version of the Mandatory typeface and was first introduced in September to coincide with the DVLA release of new style DVLA number plates br br br Other countries territories br br In Australia the various states offer personalised plate schemes with some states having a yearly fee to maintain the cherished number In the Australian states of Victoria and Queensland the proceeds from the sale of custom plates and personalised plates go towards road safety activities br

license plates such as these but it is possible to select the two letters after the district designation and up to four numbers thereafter for a small fee It is common in Germany for car owners to register license plates with their initials and a year or number of significance to them For example a man by the name of Jimmy Wales living in Berlin and born in might opt to register B JW providing it is still available Japan and Brazil have a similar system br On November Dutch Member of Parliament Paul de Krom proposed that vanity plates be introduced in the Netherlands as well after having seen them while visiting the United States One barrier his proposal would have to overcome would be that the RDW Netherlands Vehicle Authority links license plates to the actual cars as opposed to their owners Additionally vowels are not allowed on Dutch license plates specifically because otherwise license plates could unintentionally spell a word so allowing vanity plates would be a strange match with current law On January the PVV again proposed that vanity plates may be introduced in the country as well The vanity plate idea comes closer and closer in the Netherlands br In Poland there is an option to buy an individual number plate for an extra charge The plate looks the same as an ordinary one there is a letter showing the country district then one number and then up to five
