title: Trunk (car)
id: 2109472
The trunk North American English or boot British English of a car is the vehicle s main storage or cargo compartment often a hatch at the rear of the vehicle It can also be called a tailgate br In Indian English the storage area is known as a dickey also spelled dicky dickie or diggy and in Southeast Asia as a compartment br br br Designs br br The trunk or luggage compartment is most often at the rear of the vehicle Early designs had an exterior rack on the rear of the vehicle to attach a luggage trunk Later designs integrated the storage area into the vehicle s body and eventually became more streamlined The main storage compartment is normally provided at the end of the vehicle opposite to which the engine is located br br Some vehicles have the trunk in front of the passenger compartment e g rear engined cars like Volkswagen Beetle and Porsche or electric vehicles like Ford F Lightning This is known as a frunk a portmanteau of the words front and trunk The alternative term froot a combination of front and boot is also occasionally used br br There are also vehicles with both front and rear trunks either with low profile rear drivetrains e g Volkswagen Type or Tesla Model S or with a mid engine e g Porsche and Boxster Toyota MR and Fiat X br Sometimes during the design life of the vehicle the lid may be restyled to increase the size or improve the practicality and usefulness of the trunk s shape Examples of this include the Beetle redesign to the s Super Beetle and the pre war and s post war Citro n Traction Avant br br br Openings br br br Door br br The door or opening of a cargo area may be hinged at the top side or bottom br If the door is hinged at the bottom it is called a tailgate particularly in the United States They are used on station wagons and pickup trucks as well as on some sport utility vehicles SUV Traditional drop down station wagon and pickup tailgates can also serve as a mount for a workbench br Traditional U S station wagons included a roll down window retracting into the tailgate to load small items or to allow the tailgate to be opened down on its bottom mounted hinges Because of the potential for carbon monoxide fumes the tailgate window on station wagons should be closed whenever the engine is running br Two way station wagon tailgates may be hinged at the side and the bottom so they can be opened sideways like a regular door or drop downwards as load platform extenders They are designed with special handle s for opening in the selected direction on special hinges after the window is lowered br A three way design that was also used by Ford allows for the tailgate to be opened like a door with the window up br General Motors developed a clam shell style disappearing design where the rear window rolls up into the roof and the tailgate slides down and beneath the load floor br If the door is hinged at the top it is termed a hatch and a car with a rear hatch a hatchback A bottom opening door is now common on SUVs br br br Lid br br The trunk lid in the U S automotive industry sometimes also called decklid or deck lid is the cover that allows access to the main storage or luggage compartment Hinges allow the lid to be raised Devices such as a manually positioned prop rod can keep the panel up in the open position Counterbalancing torsion or other spring s can also be used to help elevate and hold open the trunk lid On cars with their trunk in the rear lids sometimes incorporate a center mounted third brake light A rear lid may also have a decorative air spoiler On many modern cars the trunk lids can be unlocked with the car s key fob br br br Design history br In Ford introduced a trigger catch to allow for one handed lifting until the trunk lid was automatically caught in the open position br In Buick marketed its counterbalanced trunk lid that practically raises itself and the automatic locking mechanism br In the Packard Predictor show car designed by Dick Teague debuted at the Chicago Auto Show featuring innovations such as a power operated trunk lid br In the remote activated electric trunk release was introduced by U S automakers in production vehicles br The AMC Cavalier concept car featured a trunk lid with dual action scissor type hinges allowing the panel to be opened like a normal trunk lid or to be horizontally elevated even to the height of the car s roof line for greater utility when hauling large and bulky items Both the hood and trunk lid were made from identical stampings and interchangeable br br br Locks br br The locking of the trunk may be achieved together with the passenger compartment br Some cars include a function to remotely open the trunk This may be achieved through a variety of means br br release of the latch whereby the door seals push the decklid away from the lock the trunk is then open and the lid may not have revealed the opening br release of the latch whereby a spring pushes the decklid away from the lock and open the trunk is then open and the lid reveals the opening br release of the latch and actuation of a drive whether hydraulic BMW Series or electric BMW X which pushes the decklid away from the lock the trunk is then open and the lid reveals the opening This may then be electrically closed again br br br Etymology br br The usage of the word trunk comes from it being the word for a large travelling chest as such trunks were often attached to the back of the vehicle before the development of integrated storage compartments in the s while the usage of the word boot comes from the word for a built in compartment on a horse drawn coach originally used as a seat for the coachman and later for storage The usage of the word dickie comes from the British word for a rumble seat as such seats were often used for luggage before cars had integrated storage br In France from onwards the luggage maker Moynat became a market leader in automobile luggage for which the company developed a number of patented products including the rear attached limousine trunk with custom fitted suitcases In came the side or lateral sliding trunk a mechanism that foreshadowed the development of integrated trunks in vehicles from the s onwards br br br Classification br br br Open or closed compartments br Open compartments are those found in station wagons and SUVs while closed compartments have a trunk lid and are typically found in saloon sedan or coup bodies Closed compartments are separated from the passenger compartment by rigid body elements or seats and are generally trimmed in simple materials whereas many station wagons are trimmed with better looking materials as the space is an extension of the passenger compartment In order to hide the compartment content of station wagons or hatchbacks from thieves or sunlight a cover may be fitted On hatchbacks this often has the form of a rigid parcel shelf or a flexible sheet with hooks on the corners while station wagons and many SUVs have a roller blind in a removable cassette br br br Increased variability br To give the space more flexibility many cars have foldable rear seats which can increase the size of the trunk when needed br br br Safety br br br Active safety by luggage retention br The trunk space can contribute to the active and passive safety of the vehicle Active safety may be promoted in vehicles that are partially loaded Here the use of lashing eyes to restrain luggage can prevent or reduce damage to the vehicle and its occupants in severe maneuvers In driving while cornering in extremis the prevention of sudden weight transfer due to poorly loaded luggage can be enough to prevent the vehicle from losing grip and potentially avoiding thereby an accident active safety br br br Passive safety by luggage retention br If a crash should occur lashing eyes can reduce the severity of the outcome of the accident by keeping the luggage in the loadspace compartment and thereby preventing projectiles from harming correctly restrained passengers in the passenger compartment br These lashing features may be in the form of fixed or foldable loops or in the case of certain European vehicles combine sliding loops in a rail system to allow optimal positioning of the lashing eyes At the same time this eases the integration of accessories for loadspace management dividers bike carriers etc into the interior of the vehicle a principle that has been applied in cargo vans and air transport for many years br br br Barrier nets grids br In vehicles with open luggage compartments some are fitted with metal grids or guards to retain loose items in case of collision or to simply create a bulkhead between the load in the trunk for example animals separated from the otherwise unprotected passenger space br Another solution for items that have not been restrained is the loadspace barrier net These may be directly attached to the body structure or in vehicles with loadspace cover cassettes as a combined loadspace cover and barrier net The net confines luggage to the loadspace in case of emergency braking and minor traffic collisions These nets have the advantage over metal guards in that they can be rolled up when not in use taking up much less space than a comparable guard A guard may however be tailored for an even tighter fit to the body interior contours than a roll away net br br br Inside trunk release br Children and sometimes adults who climb inside to work on the vehicle who become trapped in trunks can die of suffocation or heat stroke Once in the trunk they may not be able to get out even if they entered through the interior because many rear seats release to the trunk only from inside the passenger area Beginning with the models a glow in the dark inside trunk release is required on all vehicles with conventional trunks sold in the United States Hatchbacks wagons vans and SUVs are exempt from this requirement because it is assumed a trapped person can kick out any cargo cover or parcel shelf to gain access to the main interior and passenger doors br br br Riding in the trunk br Riding in the trunk is dangerous and illegal Teenagers in the U S may attempt to avoid laws which prohibit new car drivers from driving with passengers by riding in the trunk br br br Additional functions br Beyond carrying luggage the trunk of most passenger vehicles commonly contains various other components often behind the trimmed surfaces of the interior These components may be accessed by the customer or the service personnel through in some cases lockable hatches in the trim or by removing carpet and support boards etc Typical components br br Emergency supplies br Spare tire br Jack and lug wrench br On board tool kit for do it yourself repairs br Electronics for sound video satellite navigation etc br Battery and hybrid energy store see plug in hybrids br Fuse boxes br CNG LPG tanks for bivalent engines br Additional folding or third row seating increasingly in open loadspaces br Some vehicles offer configurable cargo conveniences such as a shelf or board They often serve various purposes In addition to its split fold down and removable rear seat the multiposition rear shelf on the Chrysler PT Cruiser can be used as a table for a picnic a second cargo layer or a security screen The Citro n C has a foldable segmented false floorboard that compartmentalizes the cargo area makes loading easier and evens out the load floor when the back of the rear seat is folded down br br br See also br Car boot liner br Car boot sale br Continental
