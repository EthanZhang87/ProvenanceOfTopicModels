A spoiler is an automotive aerodynamic device whose intended design function is to spoil unfavorable air movement across the body of a vehicle in motion usually manifested as lift turbulence or drag Spoilers on the front of a vehicle are often called air dams Spoilers are often fitted to race and high performance sports cars although they have become common on passenger vehicles as well Spoilers are added to cars primarily for styling purposes and either have little aerodynamic benefit or even worsen the aerodynamics br The term spoiler is often mistakenly used interchangeably with wing An automotive wing is a device designed to generate downforce as air passes around it not simply disrupt existing airflow patterns As such rather than decreasing drag automotive wings actually increase drag br br br Operation br br Since spoiler is a term describing an application the operation of a spoiler varies depending on the particular effect it is trying to spoil Common spoiler functions include disrupting airflow passing over and around a moving vehicle A standard spoiler diffuses air by increasing amounts of turbulence flowing over the shape spoiling the laminar flow and providing a cushion for the laminar boundary layer However other types of airflow may require the spoiler to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics br br br In racing cars br While a mass travels at increasing speeds the environment s air affects its movement Spoilers in racing are combined with other features on the body or chassis of race cars to change the handling characteristics that are affected by the air of the environment br Often these devices are designed to be highly adjustable to suit the needs of racing on a given track or to suit the talents of a particular driver with the overall goal of reaching faster times br br br Passenger vehicles br br The goal of many spoilers used in passenger vehicles is to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency Passenger vehicles can be equipped with front and rear spoilers Front spoilers found beneath the bumper are mainly used to decrease the air going underneath the vehicle to reduce the drag coefficient and lift br Sports cars are most commonly seen with front and rear spoilers Even though these vehicles typically have a more rigid chassis and a stiffer suspension to aid in high speed maneuverability a spoiler can still be beneficial This is because many cars have a relatively steep downward angle going from the rear edge of the roof down to the vehicle s trunk or tail which may cause airflow separation The flow of air becomes turbulent and a low pressure zone is created increasing drag and instability see Bernoulli effect Adding a rear spoiler could be considered to make the air see a longer gentler slope from the roof to the spoiler which helps to delay flow separation and the higher pressure in front of the spoiler can help reduce the lift on the car by creating downforce This may reduce drag in certain instances and generally increase high speed stability due to the reduced rear lift br Due to their association with racing spoilers are often viewed as sporty by consumers However the spoilers that feature on more upmarket models rarely provide further aerodynamic benefit br br br Material types br br Spoilers are usually made of lightweight polymer based materials including br br ABS plastic Most original equipment manufacturers produce spoilers by casting ABS plastic with various admixtures typically granular fillers which introduce stiffness to this inexpensive material Frailness is the main disadvantage of plastic which increases with product age and is caused by the evaporation of volatile phenols br Fiberglass Used in car parts production due to the low cost of the materials Fiberglass spoilers consist of fiberglass cloth infiltrated with a thermosetting resin such as epoxy Fiberglass is sufficiently durable and workable but has become unprofitable for large scale production because of the labor involved br Silicone Some auto accessory manufacturers have recently used silicon organic polymers The main benefit of this material is its phenomenal plasticity Silicone possesses extra high thermal characteristics and provides a longer product lifetime br Carbon fiber Carbon fiber is lightweight durable and expensive Due to a large amount of manual labor large scale production cannot widely use carbon fiber in automobile parts currently br br br Other common spoiler types br Front spoilers A front spoiler air dam is positioned under or integrated with the front bumper In racing this spoiler controls the dynamics of handling related to the air in front of the vehicle This can be to improve the drag coefficient of the vehicle s body at speed or generate downforce In passenger vehicles the focus shifts to directing the airflow into the engine bay for cooling purposes br Pickup truck bed spoiler This attaches only to the top of the truck bed rails near the rear Used with a bed cover this spoiler is intended to reduce the air profile of the steep drop off from the tailgate br Pickup truck cab spoiler This works the same as above except focusing on the drop off from the truck s cab to the cargo bed br br br Active spoilers br An active spoiler dynamically adjusts while the vehicle operates based on the conditions presented changing the spoiling effect intensity or other performance attributes Found most often on sports cars and other passenger cars the most common form is a rear spoiler that retracts and hides partially or entirely into the rear of the vehicle then extends upwards when the vehicle exceeds a specific speed such as the active spoiler in the Bugatti Veyron Active front spoilers have also been implemented on specific models in which the front spoiler or air dam extends further toward the road below to reduce drag at high speed In most cases the spoiler deployment is achieved with an electric motor controlled automatically by the onboard computer or other electronics usually based on vehicle speed driver setting or other inputs Often the driver can manually deploy the spoiler if desired but may not be able to retract the spoiler above a certain speed because doing so could dangerously diminish the high speed handling qualities of the vehicle br Active spoilers can offer additional benefits over fixed spoilers Cosmetically they can allow a cleaner or less cluttered appearance when the vehicle is parked or traveling at low speeds when it is most likely to be observed A spoiler that hides may be appealing to vehicle designers who are seeking to improve high speed aerodynamics for example the Porsche or Audi TT without drastically changing its appearance Hiding a spoiler at low speeds can improve aerodynamics as well At low speeds a fixed spoiler may increase drag and does little to improve the vehicle s handling due to having little airflow over it A retractable front spoiler can reduce the scraping of the car on curbs or other road imperfections while still reducing drag at high speeds br Powered fans such as in the Chaparral J do the equivalent of spoilers and increase the downforce hence the traction and handling of the vehicle See ground effect Research continues on the use of fans to alter the aerodynamics of vehicles br br br Other vehicles br br Heavy trucks like long haul tractors may also have a spoiler on the top and sides of the cab to lessen drag caused by air resistance from the trailer it is towing which may be taller than the cab and reduce the aerodynamics of the vehicle dramatically without the use of this spoiler The trailers they pull can also be fitted with under side spoilers that angle outward to deflect passing air from the rear axle s wheels br Trains may use spoilers to induce drag like an air brake A prototype Japanese high speed train the Fastech is designed to reach speeds of kilometres per hour mph Its nose is specifically designed to spoil a wind effect associated with passing through tunnels and it can deploy ears that slow the train in case of emergency by increasing its drag br Some modern race cars employ a passive situational spoiler called a roof flap The body of the car is designed to generate downforce while driving forward These roof flaps deploy when the car s body is rotated to travel in reverse a condition where the body generates lift instead The roof flaps deploy because they are recessed into a pocket in the roof The low pressure above this pocket will cause the flaps to deploy and counteract some of the lift generated by the car making it more resistant to coming out of contact with the ground These devices were introduced in in NASCAR following Rusty Wallace s crash at Talladega br br br Whale tail br br When the Porsche Turbo debuted in August with large flared rear spoilers they were immediately dubbed whale tails Designed to reduce rear end lift and so keep the car from oversteering at high speeds the rubber edges of the whale tail spoilers were thought to be pedestrian friendly The Turbo with its whale tail became recognizable From the rear spoiler was redesigned and dubbed tea tray because of its raised sides br The Porsche whale tails were used in conjunction with a chin spoiler attached to the front valence panel which according to some sources did not enhance aerodynamic stability br It is less effective in multiplying downforce than newer technologies like an airfoil rear wing running across the base of the tailgate window or an electronically controlled wing that deploys at about mph km h br br br History br br The whale tail came on the heels of the duck tail or B rzel in German as a part of the E program a smaller and less flared rear spoiler fitted to Carrera RS meaning Rennsport or race sport in German optional outside Germany The whale tail was originally designed for Porsche and Porsche race cars in and introduced to the Turbo in as a part of the H program it was also an option on non turbo Carreras from Both types of spoilers were designed while Dr Ernst Fuhrmann was serving as the Technical Director of Porsche AG In a rubber front chin spoiler was also introduced to offset the more effective spoiler By Porsche introduced another design for the rear spoiler the teatray a boxier enclosure which accommodated the intercooler and was also an option for the SC br br br Other vehicles br The whale tail car spoilers of the Porsche caught on as a fashion statement and the term has been used to refer to large rear spoilers on a number of automobiles including Ford Sierra RS Focus Chevrolet Camaro and Saab Whale tail spoilers also appear at the rear of tricycles trucks boats and other
