id: 1445706
An automotive navigation system is part of the automobile controls or a third party add on used to find direction in an automobile It typically uses a satellite navigation device to get its position data which is then correlated to a position on a road When directions are needed routing can be calculated On the fly traffic information road closures congestion can be used to adjust the route br Dead reckoning using distance data from sensors attached to the drivetrain an accelerometer a gyroscope and a magnetometer can be used for greater reliability as GNSS signal loss and or multipath can occur due to urban canyons or tunnels br Mathematically automotive navigation is based on the shortest path problem within graph theory which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria shortest cheapest fastest etc between two points in a large network br Automotive navigation systems are crucial for the development of self driving cars br br br History br Automotive navigation systems represent a convergence of a number of diverse technologies many of which have been available for many years but were too costly or inaccessible Limitations such as batteries display and processing power had to be overcome before the product became commercially viable br br Hidetsugu Yagi designed a wireless based navigation system This design was still primitive and intended for military use br General Motors Research GMR was working on a non satellite based navigation and assistance system called DAIR Driver Aid Information Routing After initial tests GM found that it was not a scalable or practical way to provide navigation assistance Decades later however the concept would be reborn as OnStar founded br Compact Cassette based navigation following pre determined routes instructious would be read followed by a tone that would tell a controller to continue the cassette after the distance denoted by the tone had been reached br Japan s Ministry of International Trade and Industry MITI and Fuji Heavy Industries sponsored CATC Comprehensive Automobile Traffic Control a Japanese research project on automobile navigation systems br MITI established JSK Association of Electronic Technology for Automobile Traffic and Driving in Japan br Electronic Auto Compass with new mechanism on the Toyota Crown br The earlier research of CATC led to the first generation of automobile navigation systems from Japanese companies Honda Nissan and Toyota They used dead reckoning technology br Honda s Electro Gyrocator was the first commercially available car navigation system It used inertial navigation systems which tracked the distance traveled the start point and direction headed It was also the first with a map display br Navigation computer on the Toyota Celica NAVICOM br Etak was founded It made an early system that used map matching to improve on dead reckoning instrumentation Digital map information was stored on standard cassette tapes br Toyota introduced the World s first CD ROM based navigation system on the Toyota Crown br Gregg Howe of Design Works USA applied Hunter Systems navigational computer to the Magna Torrero Concept Car Originally developed to locate hydrants for fire departments this system utilized both satellite signals dead reckoning improving overall system accuracy due to civilian GPS limitations This system also boast a color raster scan monitor rather than the monochromatic vector mapping displays used by predecessors br Mazda Eunos Cosmo became the first production car with built in GPS navigation system br General Motors partnered with the American Automotive Association Florida Department of Transportation as well as the city of Orlando to create TravTek short for Travel Technology which was a computerized in car navigation system A fleet of Oldsmobile Toronados were rolled out with the system with available for rent through Avis Orlando International Airport office the other were test driven by local drivers A computer system was installed in the trunk of the vehicle with a special antenna mounted in the back and was hooked up to the video screen in the Oldsmobile Toronado an option in the standard Toronado to display the navigation TravTek covered a square mile area in Orlando and its metro areas as well as contained listings for restaurants AAA approved hotels and attractions br Toyota introduced GPS car navigation on the Toyota Soarer br Mitsubishi introduced GPS car navigation on the Mitsubishi Debonair MMCS Mitsubishi Multi Communication System br Voice assisted GPS navigation system on the Toyota Celsior br The Austrian channel ORF airs a presentation of the software company bitMAP and its head Werner Liebig s invention an electronic city map including street names and house numbers using a satellite based navigation system bitMAP attends Comdex in Las Vegas the same year but doesn t manage to market itself properly br BMW series E first European model featuring GPS navigation The navigation system was developed in cooperation with Philips Philips CARIN br Oldsmobile introduced the first GPS navigation system available in a United States production car called GuideStar The navigation system was developed in cooperation with Zexel Zexel partnered with Avis Car Rental to make the system widely available in rental cars This provided many in the United States general public with their first opportunity to use car navigation br Device called Mobile Assistant or short MASS produced by Munich based company ComRoad AG won the title Best Product in Mobile Computing on CeBit by magazine Byte It offered turn by turn navigation via wireless internet connection with both GPS and speed sensor in the car br Acura introduced the first hard disk drive based navigation system in the RL br Navigation system using Differential GPS developed as a factory installed option on the Toyota Prius br First DVD based navigation system introduced on the Toyota Progres br The United States made a more accurate GPS signal available for civilian use br Toyota introduced the first Hard disk drive based navigation system and the industry s first DVD based navigation system with a built in Electronic throttle control br Toyota introduced Map on Demand a technology for distributing map updates to car navigation systems developed as the first of its kind in the world br World s first navigation system linked brake assist function and Navigation system linked to Adaptive Variable Suspension System NAVI AI AVS on Toyota Crown br With a release of mobile navigation app from Sygic for iOS new era of a mobile device navigation systems had begun gaining in popularity since br br br Technology br br The road database is a vector map Street names or numbers and house numbers as well as points of interest waypoints are encoded as geographic coordinates This enables users to find a desired destination by street address or as geographic coordinates See map database management br Map database formats are almost uniformly proprietary with no industry standards for satellite navigation maps although some companies are trying to address this with SDAL Shared Data Access Library and Navigation Data Standard NDS Map data vendors such as Tele Atlas and Navteq create the base map in a GDF Geographic Data Files format but each electronics manufacturer compiles it in an optimized usually proprietary manner GDF is not a CD standard for car navigation systems GDF is used and converted onto the CD ROM in the internal format of the navigation system CDF CARiN Database Format is a proprietary navigation map format created by Philips br SDAL is a proprietary map format developed by Navteq which was released royalty free in the hope that it would become an industry standard for digital navigation maps has not been very widely adopted by the industry Vendors who used this format include br br Microsoft br Magellan br Pioneer br Panasonic br Clarion br InfoGation br br br Navigation Data Standard NDS br The Navigation Data Standard NDS initiative is an industry grouping of car manufacturers navigation system suppliers and map data suppliers whose objective is the standardization of the data format used in car navigation systems as well as allow a map update capability The NDS effort began in and became a registered association in Standardization would improve interoperability specifically by allowing the same navigation maps to be used in navigation systems from manufacturers Companies involved include BMW Volkswagen Daimler Renault ADIT Aisin AW Alpine Electronics Navigon Navis AMS Bosch DENSO Mitsubishi Harman International Industries Panasonic Preh Car Connect formerly TechniSat PTV Continental AG Clarion Navteq Navinfo Archived at the Wayback Machine TomTom and Zenrin br br br Media br The road database may be stored in solid state read only memory ROM optical media CD or DVD solid state flash memory magnetic media hard disk or a combination A common scheme is to have a base map permanently stored in ROM that can be augmented with detailed information for a region the user is interested in A ROM is always programmed at the factory the other media may be preprogrammed downloaded from a CD or DVD via a computer or network connection or directly using a card reader br Some navigation device makers provide free map updates for their customers These updates are br often obtained from the vendor s website which is accessed by connecting the navigation device to a PC br br br Real time data br br Some systems can receive and display information on traffic congestion using either TMC RDS or by GPRS G data transmission via mobile phones br In practice Google has updated Google Maps for Android and iOS to alert users when a faster route becomes available in This change helps integrate real time data with information about the more distant parts of a route br br br Integration and other functions br The color LCD screens on some automotive navigation systems can also be used to display television broadcasts or DVD movies br A few systems integrate or communicate with mobile phones for hands free talking and SMS messaging i e using Bluetooth or Wi Fi br Automotive navigation systems can include personal information management for meetings which can be combined with a traffic and public transport information system br br br Original factory equipment br Many vehicle manufacturers offer a satellite navigation device as an option in their vehicles Customers whose vehicles did not ship with GNSS can therefore purchase and retrofit the original factory supplied GNSS unit In some cases this can be a straightforward plug and play installation if the required wiring harness is already present in the vehicle However with some manufacturers new wiring is required making the installation more complex br The primary benefit of this approach is an integrated and factory standard installation Many original systems also contain a gyrocompass and or an accelerometer and may accept input from the vehicle s speed sensors and reverse gear engagement signal output thereby allowing them to navigate via dead reckoning when a GPS signal is temporarily unavailable However the costs can be considerably higher than other options br br br SMS br Establishing points of interest in real time and transmitting them via GSM cellular telephone networks using the Short Message Service SMS is referred to as Gps sms Some vehicles and vessels are equipped with hardware that is able to automatically send an SMS text message when a particular event happens such as theft anchor drift or breakdown The receiving party e g a tow truck can store the waypoint in a computer system draw a map indicating the location or see it in an automotive navigation system br br br See also br Augmented reality br Automatic vehicle location br Autonomous car br Electronic
