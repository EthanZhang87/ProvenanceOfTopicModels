title: Body-on-frame
id: 1399124
Body on frame is a traditional motor vehicle construction method whereby a separate body or coach is mounted on a strong and relatively rigid vehicle frame or chassis that carries the powertrain the engine and drivetrain and to which the wheels and their suspension brakes and steering are mounted While this was the original method of building automobiles body on frame construction is now used mainly for pickup trucks large SUVs and heavy trucks br In the late th century the frames like those of the carriages they replaced might be made of wood commonly ash reinforced by steel flitch plates but in the early th century steel ladder frames or chassis rapidly became standard Mass production of all metal bodies began with the Budd Company and the Dodge Brothers Mass production of all metal bodies became general in the s but Europe with exceptions followed almost a decade later Europe s custom made or coachbuilt cars usually contained some wood framing or used aluminium alloy castings Towards the beginning of international automobile assembly and construction most manufacturers created rolling chassis consisting of a powertrain suspension steering column and a fuel tank that was then sent to a coachbuilder that added the body interior and upholstery to the customers specific requests br In contrast unibody or monocoque designs where panels within the body supported the car on its suspension were developed by European manufacturers in the late s with Budd USA which had a number of large factories in Europe and its technical knowhow Because of the high cost of designing and developing these structures and the high cost of specialised machinery to make the large pressings required by this style of construction it is not used by low volume manufacturers who might construct an equivalent by welding steel tube to form a suitable space frame br br br History br br The Ford Model T carried the tradition of body on frame over from horse drawn buggies helping to facilitate high volume manufacturing on a moving assembly line The use of steel ladder and X frame chassis allowed numerous vehicles to share a chassis and drivetrain while making changes to bodywork and interiors relatively easy thus keeping costs down and minimizing design time Over time the technology for unibody construction became economically feasible assisted in recent decades by computer aided design in addition modern creature comforts luxury and power assisted features and extensive safety reinforcement of vehicles have all added substantial weight the ability to offset this with unibody construction has proven advantageous br A handful of small passenger vehicles switched to unibody construction by the end of the s The trend had started with cars like the Citro n Traction Avant and Opel Olympia a General Motors design introduced in and the short lived aborted Chrysler Airflow Trucks bus manufacturers and large low volume cars or those made in the United States continued to use separate bodies on conventional frames Body on frame remains the preferred construction method for heavy duty commercial vehicles especially those intended to carry or pull heavy loads such as trucks and some sport utility vehicles SUVs but as production volumes rise increasing numbers of SUVs and crossover SUVs are switching to unibody frames Mass market manufacturers Ford General Motors and Chrysler are abandoning true body on frame SUVs opting when sales volume permits for more efficient unibody construction Toyota currently manufactures the most body on frame SUVs with the Runner
