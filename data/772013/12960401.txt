id: 12960401
The automotive steering column is a device intended primarily for connecting the steering wheel to the steering mechanism br br br Secondary functions br A steering column may also perform the following secondary functions br br energy dissipation management in the event of a frontal collision br provide mounting for the multi function switch column lock column wiring column shroud s transmission gear selector gauges or other instruments as well as the electro motor and gear units found in EPAS and SbW systems br offer height and or length adjustment to suit driver preference br br br Steering lock br Modern vehicles are fitted with a steering lock which is an anti theft device It is fitted to the steering column usually below the steering wheel The lock is combined with the ignition switch and engaged and disengaged either by a mechanical ignition key or electronically from the vehicles electronic control unit These locks were introduced on many General Motors products in drastically reducing thefts of these GM models and on Ford Chrysler and AMC products in br br br Collapsible column br A common device to enhance car safety is the collapsible steering column This is designed to collapse in the event of a collision to protect the driver from harm The column can collapse after impact with a tolerance ring inserted between the inner shaft of the steering column and the external housing The wavelike protrusions on the circumference of the tolerance ring act as a spring to hold the two parts in place in normal driving conditions At a specific level of force for example in the event of a collision the tolerance ring allows the inner shaft to slip inside the housing so the column can collapse absorbing energy from the impact br In virtually all modern vehicles the lower section of the inner shaft is articulated with universal joints which helps control movement of the column in a frontal impact and also gives engineers freedom in mounting the steering gear itself br br br Regulatory requirements br In the United States steering columns are governed by several federal regulatory requirements notably FMVSS and The Chinese directive GB obligates Chinese car manufacturers to incorporate anti theft mechanisms in their vehicles European Union Commission Directive EC mandates all cars exported to European markets must be fitted with anti theft security devices This regulation also requires that a steering lock must be able to withstand forces of Nm applied to the steering wheel without failing br br br
