Magnesium is a chemical element it has symbol Mg and atomic number It is a shiny gray metal having a low density low melting point and high chemical reactivity Like the other alkaline earth metals group of the periodic table it occurs naturally only in combination with other elements and it almost always has an oxidation state of It reacts readily with air to form a thin passivation coating of magnesium oxide that inhibits further corrosion of the metal The free metal burns with a brilliant white light The metal is obtained mainly by electrolysis of magnesium salts obtained from brine It is less dense than aluminium and is used primarily as a component in strong and lightweight alloys that contain aluminium br In the cosmos magnesium is produced in large aging stars by the sequential addition of three helium nuclei to a carbon nucleus When such stars explode as supernovas much of the magnesium is expelled into the interstellar medium where it may recycle into new star systems Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth s crust and the fourth most common element in the Earth after iron oxygen and silicon making up of the planet s mass and a large fraction of the planet s mantle It is the third most abundant element dissolved in seawater after sodium and chlorine br This element is the eleventh most abundant element by mass in the human body and is essential to all cells and some enzymes Magnesium ions interact with polyphosphate compounds such as ATP DNA and RNA Hundreds of enzymes require magnesium ions to function Magnesium compounds are used medicinally as common laxatives and antacids such as milk of magnesia and to stabilize abnormal nerve excitation or blood vessel spasm in such conditions as eclampsia br br br Characteristics br br br Physical properties br Elemental magnesium is a gray white lightweight metal two thirds the density of aluminium Magnesium has the lowest melting K C and the lowest boiling point K C of all the alkaline earth metals br Pure polycrystalline magnesium is brittle and easily fractures along shear bands It becomes much more malleable when alloyed with small amounts of other metals such as aluminium The malleability of polycrystalline magnesium can also be significantly improved by reducing its grain size to ca micron or less br When finely powdered magnesium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas br br Mg s H O g Mg OH aq H g kJ mol br However this reaction is much less dramatic than the reactions of the alkali metals with water because the magnesium hydroxide builds up on the surface of the magnesium metal and inhibits further reaction br br br Chemical properties br br br Oxidation br The principal property of magnesium metal is its reducing power One hint is that it tarnishes slightly when exposed to air although unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals an oxygen free environment is unnecessary for storage because magnesium is protected by a thin layer of oxide that is fairly impermeable and difficult to remove br Direct reaction of magnesium with air or oxygen at ambient pressure forms only the normal oxide MgO However this oxide may be combined with hydrogen peroxide to form magnesium peroxide MgO and at low temperature the peroxide may be further reacted with ozone to form magnesium superoxide Mg O br Magnesium reacts with water at room temperature though it reacts much more slowly than calcium a similar group metal When submerged in water hydrogen bubbles form slowly on the surface of the metal this reaction happens much more rapidly with powdered magnesium The reaction also occurs faster with higher temperatures see Safety precautions Magnesium s reversible reaction with water can be harnessed to store energy and run a magnesium based engine Magnesium also reacts exothermically with most acids such as hydrochloric acid HCl producing magnesium chloride and hydrogen gas similar to the HCl reaction with aluminium zinc and many other metals Although it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk magnesium metal will ignite br Magnesium may also be used as an igniter for thermite a mixture of aluminium and iron oxide powder that ignites only at a very high temperature br br br Organic chemistry br br Organomagnesium compounds are widespread in organic chemistry They are commonly found as Grignard reagents formed by reaction of magnesium with haloalkanes Examples of Grignard reagents are phenylmagnesium bromide and ethylmagnesium bromide The Grignard reagents function as a common nucleophile attacking the electrophilic group such as the carbon atom that is present within the polar bond of a carbonyl group br A prominent organomagnesium reagent beyond Grignard reagents is magnesium anthracene which is used as a source of highly active magnesium The related butadiene magnesium adduct serves as a source for the butadiene dianion br Complexes of dimagnesium I have been observed br br br Detection in solution br The presence of magnesium ions can be detected by the addition of ammonium chloride ammonium hydroxide and monosodium phosphate to an aqueous or dilute HCl solution of the salt The formation of a white precipitate indicates the presence of magnesium ions br Azo violet dye can also be used turning deep blue in the presence of an alkaline solution of magnesium salt The color is due to the adsorption of azo violet by Mg OH br br br Forms br br br Alloys br br As of magnesium alloys consumption was less than one million tonnes per year compared with million tonnes of aluminium alloys Their use has been historically limited by the tendency of Mg alloys to corrode creep at high temperatures and combust br br br Corrosion br In magnesium alloys the presence of iron nickel copper or cobalt strongly activates corrosion In more than trace amounts these metals precipitate as intermetallic compounds and the precipitate locales function as active cathodic sites that reduce water causing the loss of magnesium Controlling the quantity of these metals improves corrosion resistance Sufficient manganese overcomes the corrosive effects of iron This requires precise control over composition increasing costs Adding a cathodic poison captures atomic hydrogen within the structure of a metal This prevents the formation of free hydrogen gas an essential factor of corrosive chemical processes The addition of about one in three hundred parts arsenic reduces the corrosion rate of magnesium in a salt solution by a factor of nearly ten br br br High temperature creep and flammability br Magnesium s tendency to creep gradually deform at high temperatures is greatly reduced by alloying with zinc and rare earth elements Flammability is significantly reduced by a small amount of calcium in the alloy By using rare earth elements it may be possible to manufacture magnesium alloys that are able to not catch fire at higher temperatures compared to magnesium s liquidus and in some cases potentially pushing it close to magnesium s boiling point br br br Compounds br br Magnesium forms a variety of compounds important to industry and biology including magnesium carbonate magnesium chloride magnesium citrate magnesium hydroxide milk of magnesia magnesium oxide magnesium sulfate and magnesium sulfate heptahydrate Epsom salts br As recently as Magnesium hydride was under investigation as a way to store hydrogen br br br Isotopes br br Magnesium has three stable isotopes Mg Mg and Mg All are present in significant amounts in nature see table of isotopes above About of Mg is Mg The isotope Mg is radioactive and in the s to s was produced by several nuclear power plants for use in scientific experiments This isotope has a relatively short half life hours and its use was limited by shipping times br The nuclide Mg has found application in isotopic geology similar to that of aluminium Mg is a radiogenic daughter product of Al which has a half life of years Excessive quantities of stable Mg have been observed in the Ca Al rich inclusions of some carbonaceous chondrite meteorites This anomalous abundance is attributed to the decay of its parent Al in the inclusions and researchers conclude that such meteorites were formed in the solar nebula before the Al had decayed These are among the oldest objects in the Solar System and contain preserved information about its early history br It is conventional to plot Mg Mg against an Al Mg ratio In an isochron dating plot the Al Mg ratio plotted is Al Mg The slope of the isochron has no age significance but indicates the initial Al Al ratio in the sample at the time when the systems were separated from a common reservoir br br br Production br br br Occurrence br br Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element in the Earth s crust by mass and tied in seventh place with iron in molarity It is found in large deposits of magnesite dolomite and other minerals and in mineral waters where magnesium ion is soluble br Although magnesium is found in more than minerals only dolomite magnesite brucite carnallite talc and olivine are of commercial importance br The Mg cation is the second most abundant cation in seawater about the mass of sodium ions in a given sample which makes seawater and sea salt attractive commercial sources for Mg To extract the magnesium calcium hydroxide is added to the seawater to precipitate magnesium hydroxide br br MgCl Ca OH Mg OH CaCl br Magnesium hydroxide brucite is poorly soluble in water and can be collected by filtration It reacts with hydrochloric acid to magnesium chloride br br Mg OH HCl MgCl H O br From magnesium chloride electrolysis produces magnesium br br br Production quantities br World production was approximately kt in with the bulk being produced in China kt and Russia kt The United States was in the th century the major world supplier of this metal supplying of world production even as recently as Since the Chinese mastery of the Pidgeon process the US market share is at with a single US producer left as of US Magnesium a Renco Group company located on the shores of the Great Salt Lake br In September China took steps to reduce production of magnesium as a result of a government initiative to reduce energy availability for manufacturing industries leading to a significant price increase br br br Pidgeon and Bolzano processes br br The Pidgeon process and the Bolzano process are similar In both magnesium oxide is the precursor to magnesium metal The magnesium oxide is produced as a solid solution with calcium oxide by calcining the mineral dolomite which is a solid solution of calcium and magnesium carbonates br br CaCO MgCO MgO CaO CO br Reduced occurs at high temperatures with silicon Instead of pure silicon a ferrosilicon alloy is used because it is cheaper The iron component is innoncuouse The reaction can be represented by the following simplified equation br br MgO CaO Si Mg Ca SiO br The calcium oxide combines with silicon as the oxygen scavenger yielding the very stable calcium silicate The Mg Ca ratio of the precursors can be adjusted by the addition of MgO or CaO br The Pidgeon and the Bolzano process differ in the details of the heating and the configuration of the reactor Both generate gaseous Mg that is condensed and collected The Pidgeon process dominates the worldwide production The Pidgeon method is less technologically complex and because of distillation vapour deposition conditions a high purity product is easily achievable China is almost completely reliant on the silicothermic Pidgeon process br br br Dow process br br Besides the Pigeon process the second most used process for magnesium production is electrolysis This is a two step process The first step is to prepare feedstock containing magnesium chloride and the second step is to dissociate the compound in electrolytic cells as magnesium metal and chlorine gas The basic reaction is as follows br br MgCl Mg g Cl g br The temperatures at which this reaction is operated is between and C br The magnesium chloride can be obtained using the Dow process a process that mixes sea water and dolomite in a flocculator or by dehydration of magnesium chloride brines The electrolytic cells are partially submerged in a molten salt electrolyte to which the produced magnesium chloride is added in concentrations between This process does have its share of disadvantages including production of harmful chlorine gas and the overall reaction being very energy intensive creating environmental risks The Pidgeon process is more advantageous regarding its simplicity shorter construction period low power consumption and overall good magnesium quality compared to the electrolysis method br In the United States magnesium was once obtained principally with the Dow process in Corpus Christi TX by electrolysis of fused magnesium chloride from brine and sea water A saline solution containing Mg ions is first treated with lime calcium oxide and the precipitated magnesium hydroxide is collected br br Mg aq CaO s H O l Ca aq Mg OH s br The hydroxide is then converted to magnesium chloride by treatment with hydrochloric acid and heating of the product to eliminate water br br Mg OH HCl MgCl H O br The salt is then electrolyzed in the molten state At the cathode the Mg ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal br br Mg e Mg br At the anode each pair of Cl ions is oxidized to chlorine gas releasing two electrons to complete the circuit br br Cl Cl g e br br br Carbothermic process br The carbothermic route to magnesium has been recognized as a low energy yet high productivity path to magnesium extraction The chemistry is as follows br br C MgO CO Mg br A disadvantage of this method is that slow cooling the vapour can cause the reaction to quickly revert To prevent this from happening the magnesium can be dissolved directly in a suitable metal solvent before reversion starts happening Rapid quenching of the vapour can also be performed to prevent reversion br br br YSZ process br br A newer process solid oxide membrane technology involves the electrolytic reduction of MgO At the cathode Mg ion is reduced by two electrons to magnesium metal The electrolyte is yttria stabilized zirconia YSZ The anode is a liquid metal At the YSZ liquid metal anode O is oxidized A layer of graphite borders the liquid metal anode and at this interface carbon and oxygen react to form carbon monoxide When silver is used as the liquid metal anode there is no reductant carbon or hydrogen needed and only oxygen gas is evolved at the anode It was reported in that this method provides a reduction in cost per pound over the electrolytic reduction method br br br History br The name magnesium originates from the Greek word for locations related to the tribe of the Magnetes either a district in Thessaly called Magnesia or Magnesia ad Sipylum now in Turkey It is related to magnetite and manganese which also originated from this area and required differentiation as separate substances See manganese for this history br In a farmer at Epsom in England attempted to give his cows water from a local well The cows refused to drink because of the water s bitter taste but the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes The substance obtained by evaporating the water became known as Epsom salts and its fame spread It was eventually recognized as hydrated magnesium sulfate MgSO H O br The metal itself was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in England in He used electrolysis on a mixture of magnesia and mercuric oxide Antoine Bussy prepared it in coherent form in Davy s first suggestion for a name was magnium but the name magnesium is now used in most European languages br br br Uses br br br Magnesium metal br br Magnesium is the third most commonly used structural metal following iron and aluminium The main applications of magnesium are in order aluminium alloys die casting alloyed with zinc removing sulfur in the production of iron and steel and the production of titanium in the Kroll process br Magnesium is used in lightweight materials and alloys For example when infused with silicon carbide nanoparticles it has extremely high specific strength br Historically magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II The Germans coined the name Elektron for magnesium alloy a term which is still used today In the commercial aerospace industry magnesium was generally restricted to engine related components due to fire and corrosion hazards Magnesium alloy use in aerospace is increasing in the st century driven by the importance of fuel economy Magnesium alloys can act as replacements for aluminium and steel alloys in structural applications br Rieke et al developed a general approach for preparing highly reactive metal powders by reducing metal salts in ethereal or hydrocarbon solvents using alkali metals as reducing agents known to us as the Rieke process In he told about Rieke magnesium Rieke followed this up in with the identification of Rieke metals br br br Aircraft br Wright Aeronautical used a magnesium crankcase in the WWII era Wright R Duplex Cyclone aviation engine This presented a serious problem for the earliest models of the Boeing B Superfortress heavy bomber when an in flight engine fire ignited the engine crankcase The resulting combustion was as hot as F C and could sever the wing spar from the fuselage br br br Automotive br br Mercedes Benz used the alloy Elektron in the bodywork of an early model Mercedes Benz SLR these cars competed in the World Sportscar Championship including a win at the Mille Miglia and at Le Mans where one was involved in the Le Mans disaster when spectators were showered with burning fragments of elektron br Porsche used magnesium alloy frames in the that won Le Mans in and continues to use magnesium alloys for its engine blocks due to the weight advantage br Volkswagen Group has used magnesium in its engine components for many years br Mitsubishi Motors uses magnesium for its paddle shifters br BMW used magnesium alloy blocks in their N engine including an aluminium alloy insert for the cylinder walls and cooling jackets surrounded by a high temperature magnesium alloy AJ A The engine was used worldwide between and in various and series models as well as the Z X X and X br Chevrolet used the magnesium alloy AE in the Corvette Z br Both AJ A and AE are recent developments in high temperature low creep magnesium alloys The general strategy for such alloys is to form intermetallic precipitates at the grain boundaries for example by adding mischmetal or calcium br br br Electronics br Because of low density and good mechanical and electrical properties magnesium is used for manufacturing of mobile phones laptop and tablet computers cameras and other electronic components It was used as a premium feature because of its light weight in some laptops br br br Other br Magnesium being readily available and relatively nontoxic has a variety of uses br br br Source of light br When burning in air magnesium produces a brilliant white light that includes strong ultraviolet wavelengths Magnesium powder flash powder was used for subject illumination in the early days of photography Later magnesium filament was used in electrically ignited single use photography flashbulbs Magnesium powder is used in fireworks and marine flares where a brilliant white light is required It was also used for various theatrical effects such as lightning pistol flashes and supernatural appearances br br Magnesium is flammable burning at a temperature of approximately C K F and the autoignition temperature of magnesium ribbon is approximately C K F Magnesium s high combustion temperature makes it a useful tool for starting emergency fires Other uses include flash photography flares pyrotechnics fireworks sparklers and trick birthday candles Magnesium is also often used to ignite thermite or other materials that require a high ignition temperature Magnesium continues to be used as an incendiary element in warfare br Flame temperatures of magnesium and magnesium alloys can reach C F although flame height above the burning metal is usually less than mm in Once ignited such fires are difficult to extinguish because they resist several substances commonly used to put out fires combustion continues in nitrogen forming magnesium nitride in carbon dioxide forming magnesium oxide and carbon and in water forming magnesium oxide and hydrogen which also combusts due to heat in the presence of additional oxygen This property was used in incendiary weapons during the firebombing of cities in World War II where the only practical civil defense was to smother a burning flare under dry sand to exclude atmosphere from the combustion br br br Chemical reagent br In the form of turnings or ribbons to prepare Grignard reagents which are useful in organic synthesis br br br Other br As an additive agent in conventional propellants and the production of nodular graphite in cast iron br As a reducing agent to separate uranium and other metals from their salts br As a sacrificial galvanic anode to protect boats underground tanks pipelines buried structures and water heaters br Alloyed with zinc to produce the zinc sheet used in photoengraving plates in the printing industry dry cell battery walls and roofing br Alloyed with aluminium with aluminium magnesium alloys being used mainly for beverage cans sports equipment such as golf clubs fishing reels and archery bows and arrows br Many car and aircraft manufacturers have made engine and body parts from magnesium br Magnesium batteries have been commercialized as primary batteries and are an active topic of research for rechargeable batteries br br br Compounds br Magnesium compounds primarily magnesium oxide MgO are used as a refractory material in furnace linings for producing iron steel nonferrous metals glass and cement Magnesium oxide and other magnesium compounds are also used in the agricultural chemical and construction industries Magnesium oxide from calcination is used as an electrical insulator in fire resistant cables br Magnesium reacts with haloalkanes to give Grignard reagents which are used for a wide variety of organic reactions forming carbon carbon bonds br Magnesium salts are included in various foods fertilizers magnesium is a component of chlorophyll and microbe culture media br Magnesium sulfite is used in the manufacture of paper sulfite process br Magnesium phosphate is used to fireproof wood used in construction br Magnesium hexafluorosilicate is used for moth proofing textiles br br br Biological roles br br br Mechanism of action br The important interaction between phosphate and magnesium ions makes magnesium essential to the basic nucleic acid chemistry of all cells of all known living organisms More than enzymes require magnesium ions for their catalytic action including all enzymes using or synthesizing ATP and those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA The ATP molecule is normally found in a chelate with a magnesium ion br br br Nutrition br br br Diet br Spices nuts cereals cocoa and vegetables are good sources of magnesium Green leafy vegetables such as spinach are also rich in magnesium br br br Dietary recommendations br In the UK the recommended daily values for magnesium are mg for men and mg for women In the U S the Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs are mg for men ages and mg for older for women mg for ages and mg for older br br br Supplementation br Numerous pharmaceutical preparations of magnesium and dietary supplements are available In two human trials magnesium oxide one of the most common forms in magnesium dietary supplements because of its high magnesium content per weight was less bioavailable than magnesium citrate chloride lactate or aspartate br br br Metabolism br An adult body has grams of magnesium with in the skeleton intracellular in skeletal muscle and extracellular Serum levels are typically mmol L or mEq L Serum magnesium levels may be normal even when intracellular magnesium is deficient The mechanisms for maintaining the magnesium level in the serum are varying gastrointestinal absorption and renal excretion Intracellular magnesium is correlated with intracellular potassium Increased magnesium lowers calcium and can either prevent hypercalcemia or cause hypocalcemia depending on the initial level Both low and high protein intake conditions inhibit magnesium absorption as does the amount of phosphate phytate and fat in the gut Unabsorbed dietary magnesium is excreted in feces absorbed magnesium is excreted in urine and sweat br br br Detection in serum and plasma br Magnesium status may be assessed by measuring serum and erythrocyte magnesium concentrations coupled with urinary and fecal magnesium content but intravenous magnesium loading tests are more accurate and practical A retention of or more of the injected amount indicates deficiency As of no biomarker has been established for magnesium br Magnesium concentrations in plasma or serum may be monitored for efficacy and safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose The newborn children of mothers who received parenteral magnesium sulfate during labor may exhibit toxicity with normal serum magnesium levels br br br Deficiency br Low plasma magnesium hypomagnesemia is common it is found in of the general population From to percent of the United States population consumed less magnesium than recommended in the Dietary Reference Intake Other causes are increased renal or gastrointestinal loss an increased intracellular shift and proton pump inhibitor antacid therapy Most are asymptomatic but symptoms referable to neuromuscular cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunction may occur Alcoholism is often associated with magnesium deficiency Chronically low serum magnesium levels are associated with metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus type fasciculation and hypertension br br br Therapy br Intravenous magnesium is recommended by the ACC AHA ESC Guidelines for Management of Patients With Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death for patients with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome and for the treatment of patients with digoxin induced arrhythmias br Intravenous magnesium sulfate is used for the management of pre eclampsia and eclampsia br Hypomagnesemia including that caused by alcoholism is reversible by oral or parenteral magnesium administration depending on the degree of deficiency br There is limited evidence that magnesium supplementation may play a role in the prevention and treatment of migraine br Sorted by type of magnesium salt other therapeutic applications include br br Magnesium sulfate as the heptahydrate called Epsom salts is used as bath salts a laxative and a highly soluble fertilizer br Magnesium hydroxide suspended in water is used in milk of magnesia antacids and laxatives br Magnesium chloride oxide gluconate malate orotate glycinate ascorbate and citrate are all used as oral magnesium supplements br Magnesium borate magnesium salicylate and magnesium sulfate are used as antiseptics br Magnesium bromide is used as a mild sedative this action is due to the bromide not the magnesium br Magnesium stearate is a slightly flammable white powder with lubricating properties In pharmaceutical technology it is used in pharmacological manufacture to prevent tablets from sticking to the equipment while compressing the ingredients into tablet form br Magnesium carbonate powder is used by athletes such as gymnasts weightlifters and climbers to eliminate palm sweat prevent sticking and improve the grip on gymnastic apparatus lifting bars and climbing rocks br br br Overdose br Overdose from dietary sources alone is unlikely because excess magnesium in the blood is promptly filtered by the kidneys and overdose is more likely in the presence of impaired renal function In spite of this megadose therapy has caused death in a young child and severe hypermagnesemia in a woman and a young girl who had healthy kidneys br The most common symptoms of overdose are nausea vomiting and diarrhea other symptoms include hypotension confusion slowed heart and respiratory rates deficiencies of other minerals coma cardiac arrhythmia and death from cardiac arrest br br br Function in plants br Plants require magnesium to synthesize chlorophyll essential for photosynthesis Magnesium in the center of the porphyrin ring in chlorophyll functions in a manner similar to the iron in the center of the porphyrin ring in heme Magnesium deficiency in plants causes late season yellowing between leaf veins especially in older leaves and can be corrected by either applying epsom salts which is rapidly leached or crushed dolomitic limestone to the soil br br br Safety precautions br br Magnesium metal and its alloys can be explosive hazards they are highly flammable in their pure form when molten or in powder or ribbon form Burning or molten magnesium reacts violently with water When working with powdered magnesium safety glasses with eye protection and UV filters such as welders use are employed because burning magnesium produces ultraviolet light that can permanently damage the retina of a human eye br Magnesium is capable of reducing water and releasing highly flammable hydrogen gas br br Mg s H O l Mg OH s H g br Therefore water cannot extinguish magnesium fires The hydrogen gas produced intensifies the fire Dry sand is an effective smothering agent but only on relatively level and flat surfaces br Magnesium reacts with carbon dioxide exothermically to form magnesium oxide and carbon br br Mg s CO g MgO s C s br Hence carbon dioxide fuels rather than extinguishes magnesium fires br Burning magnesium can be quenched by using a Class D dry chemical fire extinguisher or by covering the fire with sand or magnesium foundry flux to remove its air source br br br See also br List of countries
