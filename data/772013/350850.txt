title: Chevrolet Corvair
id: 350850
The Chevrolet Corvair is a rear engined air cooled compact car manufactured by Chevrolet in two generations between A response to the Volkswagen Beetle it was produced in door sedan door coupe convertible door station wagon passenger van commercial van and pickup truck body styles in its first generation and as a door coupe convertible or door hardtop in its second Total production was approximately million vehicles from until br The name Corvair was first applied in to a Corvette based concept with a hardtop fastback styled roof part of the Motorama traveling exhibition When applied to the production models the air part referenced the engine s cooling system br A prominent aspect of the Corvair s legacy derives from controversy surrounding its handling raised aggressively by Ralph Nader s Unsafe at Any Speed and tempered by a Texas A M University safety commission report for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA which found that the Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control in extreme situations than contemporary compacts br Chevrolet would more directly compete with imports the size of the Volkswagen Beetle with the subcompact Chevrolet Vega a year after Corvair production ended from to Today the Corvair has a devoted following among owners and collectors as average prices for Corvairs from any year have reached an all time high br br br History br br In Ed Cole was promoted to chief engineer of the Chevrolet Motor Division of General Motors Four years later in July he was named general manager of Chevrolet GM s largest automotive division and became a GM vice president At Chevrolet Cole pushed for many of the major engineering and design advancements introduced in the Chevrolet car and truck lines between and He was completely involved in the development and production of the air cooled rear engine Corvair a ground breaking car in its day As chief engineer Cole was also heavily involved in the development of the Corvette sports car He is also known as the father of the small block Chevy V one of the most celebrated engines in American automotive history br The first time Chevrolet manufactured an air cooled engine was briefly in with the Chevrolet Series M Copper Cooled which due to engineering challenges was deemed a failure br By the late s the physical size of the entry level models offered by the Big Three American domestic auto manufacturers General Motors Ford and Chrysler had grown considerably effectively abandoning the market for the smaller vehicles that had been available in the past A successful modern compact car market segment was established in the U S by the Nash Rambler Growing sales of imports from Europe such as Volkswagen Renault Fiat and others showed that demand existed in the U S market for small cars often as a second car or an alternative for budget minded consumers While the Big Three continued to introduce ever larger cars during the s the new American Motors Corporation AMC focused its business strategy on smaller sized and fuel efficient automobiles years before a real need for them existed AMC a far smaller company than the Big Three positioned itself as an underdog its compact Rambler models helped push AMC to third place in domestic automobile sales American Motors also reincarnated its predecessor company s smallest Nash model as the new Rambler American for a second model run an almost unheard of phenomenon in automobile history In Studebaker followed AMC s formula by restyling its mainstream economy model sedan calling it the Lark and billing it as a compact The Lark success helped give Studebaker a respite for several years before the company ceased automobile production in br During and the Big Three automakers planned to introduce their own compact cars Ford and Chrysler s designs were scaled down versions of the conventional American car using industry default inline six cylinder engines and with bodies about smaller than their standard cars br An exception to this strategy was the Chevrolet Corvair Chevrolet designed a car that deviated from traditional American norms of design powered by an air cooled horizontally opposed six cylinder engine with many major components in aluminum The engine was mounted in the rear of the car driving the rear wheels through a compact transaxle The suspension was independent on all four wheels Bodywork used monocoque rather than body on frame construction The tires were a wider low profile design mounted on wider wheels The clean boxy styling was unconventional for Detroit with no tail fins or chrome grille as the car had no radiator Its engineering earned numerous patents and it was highly praised and very warmly received upon its introduction and well thereafter br br br Reception br Time featured Ed Cole and the Corvair on its cover for the Corvair introduction in and Motor Trend named the Corvair as the Car of the Year br Said Time its fresh engineering is hailed as the forerunner of a new age of innovation in Detroit Time reported in Chevrolet sold Corvairs its first two days on the market taking over of Chevy s two day total of Chevrolet had intended to sell one Corvair for every five Chevrolets By March the Corvair comprised of Chevrolet s sales Shortly after its introduction the Corvair faced competition from the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet and was plagued by problems although according to a Time report many were the minor bugs that often afflict a completely new car Problems included an engine cooling fan belt that tended to pop off its axis pulleys unless the fan ran constantly the air cooled engine would overheat and seize carburetor icing and poor fuel mileage which sometimes runs well under m p g The model gasoline heater was cited as a problem which itself could consume up to a quart of gas an hour with Chevrolet engineers quickly modifying the Corvair s carburetors to improve economy br The Corvair and designers William L Bill Mitchell and styling staff received an Industrial Designers Institute IDI of NY award br br br Generations br br br Overview br The Corvair was sold in two generations the first from to the second from to It sold more than units in each of its first six model years and in all br Chevrolet positioned the under car as an economy compact and highlighted its rear engine design which offered a low silhouette flat passenger compartment floor and spacious interior There was excellent traction no need for power assisted steering or brakes good ride quality and balanced braking The design also attracted customers of other makes primarily imports The Corvair stood out being larger more powerful and offering more features than comparable imports and engineering unique from other American offerings It used GM s Z body with design and engineering that advanced the rear engine rear wheel drive layout which at the time had recently been popularized by the exploding success of the Volkswagen Beetle br The Corvair s engine was an overhead valve aluminum air cooled hp kW PS cu in L flat six later enlarged first to cubic inches L and then to cubic inches L Power peaked with the turbocharged hp kW PS Corsa engine option The first generation model s swing axle rear suspension which offered a comfortable ride The design was replaced in model year with a fully independent trailing arm rear suspension similar to that of the Corvette Sting Ray br br br First generation br br br br br The Corvair Body Styles and four door sedans were conceived as economy cars offering few amenities to keep the price competitive with the Series selling for in dollars Powered by the Chevrolet Turbo Air engine with hp kW and mated to a three speed manual or optional extra cost two speed Powerglide automatic transmission RPO the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six cylinder full sized Chevrolet Biscayne The Corvair s unique design included the Quadri Flex independent suspension and Unipack Power Team of engine transmission and rear axle combined into a single unit Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche Volkswagen Mercedes Benz and others Quadri Flex used coil springs at all four wheels with independent rear suspension arms incorporated at the rear Specially designed by inch four ply tires mounted on by inch wheels were standard equipment Available options included RPO the Powerglide two speed automatic transmission RPO a gasoline heater RPO an AM tube radio and by February the rear folding seat formerly was made standard Chevrolet produced of the model and model deluxe sedans in br br In January two door coupe models were introduced designated as the and body styles Despite their late January introduction of the coupe these cars sold well about base model coupes model deluxe coupes Following the success of the upmarket Mr and Mrs Monza styling concept cars at the Chicago Auto Show management approved the neatly appointed bucket seat DeLuxe trim of the series Monza as a two door club coupe only The new Monza began arriving at Chevrolet dealers in April with sales of Monza club coupes making the coupe one of the most popular Corvairs br The success of the Monza model showed Chevrolet management that the compact Corvair was viewed as more of a specialty car than a competitor in the economy segment to the conventionally designed Ford Falcon or Chrysler s Valiant Chevrolet began a design program that resulted in the Chevy II a conventional layout compact br The option of a more powerful engine for the Corvair was introduced in February The RPO marketed as Super Turbo Air included a hotter camshaft revised dual spring cylinder heads and a lower restriction inch muffler to deliver hp kW at rpm and lb ft N m of torque at rpm In its first year it was available on any Corvair model with a manual transmission br The advertised February introduction of a full synchromesh four speed transmission RPO was postponed until the model year This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising of the potential for differential failure due to external leaks at the front of the transmission s counter gear shaft The revision of the four speed transmission designated for introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case These are among many of the improvements undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the model year br The Corvair was Motor Trend magazine s Car of the Year for br br br br br In Chevrolet introduced the Monza upscale trim to the four door sedans and the club coupe body styles With its newly introduced four speed floor mounted transmission DeLuxe vinyl bucket seats and upscale trim the Monza Club Coupe gained in sales as nearly were produced along with Monza four door sedans The four speed Monza caught the attention of the younger market and was sometimes referred to as the poor man s Porsche in various car magazines The Monza series contributed to about half of the Corvair sales in br br A station wagon marketed as the Lakewood joined the lineup in with its engine located under the cargo floor and offering ft m of cargo room ft in the main passenger compartment and another ft in the front trunk The Corvair engine received its first size increase to cu in L via a slight increase in bore size and was rated at hp kW The base engine was still rated at hp kW when paired with the manual transmissions but this increased to hp kW when mated to the optional automatic transmission in Monza models To increase luggage capacity in the front trunk the spare tire was relocated to the engine compartment in cars without air conditioning and new direct air heater directed warmed air from the cylinders and heads to the passenger compartment The gasoline heater remained available as an option through Factory air conditioning was offered as a mid option introduction The condenser lay flat atop the horizontal engine fan A large green painted reverse rotation version of the standard GM Frigidaire air conditioning compressor was used and an evaporator housing was added under the dash with integrated outlets surrounding the radio housing Air conditioning was not available on wagons Greenbrier Corvair or the turbocharged models introduced later due to space constraints Chevrolet also introduced the Corvair line of light duty trucks and vans using the Corvair Powerpack with forward control or cab over with the driver sitting over the front wheels as in the Volkswagen Type br The Greenbrier Sportswagon used the same body as the Corvan panel van with the side windows option but was marketed as a station wagon and was available with trim and paint options similar to the passenger cars The Corvan model was also built in pickup versions the Loadside was a fairly typical pickup of the era except for the rear engine forward controls and a pit in the middle of the bed The more popular Rampside had a unique large fold down ramp on the side of the bed for ease of loading wheeled items br br br br br In Chevrolet introduced the Corvairs with few changes at the beginning of the year The bottom line series station wagon was dropped and the became the base station wagon The Lakewood name was dropped The ever popular Monza line then took on a wagon model to round out the top of the line In spring of Chevrolet committed itself to the sporty image they had created for the Corvair by introducing a convertible version then offering a high performance hp kW turbocharged Spyder option for Monza coupes and convertibles making the Corvair the second production automobile supplied with a turbocharger as a factory option with the Oldsmobile F Turbo Jetfire having been released earlier in Corvair station wagons were discontinued at that point in favor the new Corvair Convertible and Chevy II built at the same assembly plant The slow selling Loadside pickup was discontinued at the end of the model year The rest of the Corvair line of Forward Control vehicles continued Optional equipment on all passenger cars except wagons included metallic brake linings and a heavy duty suspension consisting of a front anti roll bar rear axle limit straps revised spring rates and recalibrated shock absorbers These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a multi gauge instrument cluster which included a tachometer cylinder head temperature and intake manifold pressure gauges Spyder fender script and Turbo logo deck emblems in addition to the high performance engine br The Monza Coupe was the most popular model with produced out of total Corvair passenger car production for John Fitch chose the Corvair as the basis for Sprint models These included various performance improvements along with appearance modifications Individual components were available to customers and several Chevrolet dealers became authorized to install the Sprint conversions br br br br The model year had the optional availability of a long gear for improved fuel economy but the Corvair otherwise remained largely carryover with minor trim and engineering changes Self adjusting brakes were new for Of all the Corvairs sold in fully were Monzas The convertible model accounted for over of all the Monzas sold br br br br Significant engineering changes were introduced for while the model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged The engine displacement was increased from to cu in to L by an increase in stroke The base engine power increased from to hp to kW and the high performance engine increased from to hp to kW The Spyder engine rating remained at hp kW despite the displacement increase of the engine In an improvement in the car s swing axle rear suspension occurred with the addition of a transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models The heavy duty suspension was no longer optional although all models now had a front anti roll bar as standard Brakes were improved with finned rear drums The remaining pickup the Rampside was discontinued at the end of the model year br Despite a vastly improved model Corvair sales declined by close to units that year This was attributed to a number of factors including the basic styling being years old the lack of a pillarless hardtop which virtually all competing compact models had the lack of a V engine and the introduction of the Ford Mustang on April which broke all records for sales of a new car and cut into Corvair sales br br br Second generation br br br br br The Corvair second generation arrived for model year noted for its lack of a B pillar and a new fully independent suspension replacing the original swing axle rear suspension The Corvair used coil springs at each wheel br Car and Driver magazine s David E Davis Jr showed enthusiasm for the Corvair in their October issue br br And it is here too that we have to go on record and say that the Corvair is in our opinion the most important new car of the entire crop of models and the most beautiful car to appear in this country since before World War II When the pictures of the Corvair arrived in our offices the man who opened the envelope actually let out a great shout of delight and amazement on first seeing the car and in thirty seconds the whole staff was charging around each wanting to be the first to show somebody else each wanting the vicarious kick of hearing that characteristic war whoop from the first time viewer Our ardor had cooled a little by the time we got to drive the cars then we went nuts all over again The new rear suspension the new softer spring rates in front the bigger brakes the addition of some more power all these factors had us driving around like idiots zooming around the handling loop dragging with each other standing on the brakes until we had to reluctantly turn the car over to some other impatient journalist The Corvair is an outstanding car It doesn t go fast enough but we love it br The standard hp kW PS and optional hp kW PS engines were carried forward from The previous hp kW PS Spyder engine was replaced by the normally aspirated hp kW PS for the new Corsa The engine was unusual in offering four single throat carburetors to which were added larger valves and a dual exhaust system A hp kW PS turbocharged engine was optional on the Corsa which offered either standard three speed or optional US four speed manual transmissions The hp kW PS engine was optional on and Monza models with manual or Powerglide transmissions All engines got some of the heavy duty internal parts from the Turbocharged engine for better durability br New refinements appeared on the redesign The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a mph km h speedometer with resettable trip odometer a rpm tachometer cylinder head temperature gauge analog clock with a sweeping second hand a manifold vacuum pressure gauge and fuel gauge A much better heater system larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle a stronger differential ring gear an alternator replacing the generator and significant chassis refinements were made A new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated the danger of the previous generation s swing axles and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf Additionally an AM FM stereo radio in dash All Weather Air Conditioning telescopically adjustable steering column and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment Z handling package consisting of a special performance suspension and quick ratio steering box were new options for The Monza and Corvair Sport Sedans were the only compact cars ever available in the U S as pillarless four door hardtops br The station wagon panel van and pickup body styles had all been dropped and was the last year for the Greenbrier window van which was retained mainly for fleet orders with being built In all Corvairs were built in an increase of units over Chevrolet replaced the Corvair based vans with the Chevrolet Sportvan GMC Handi Van which used a traditional front engine rear drive axle borrowed from the Chevy II br br br br br The lineup remained essentially unchanged from One change of note was a new four speed synchromesh transmission using the standard Saginaw gear set with first gear ratio used by other GM cylinder vehicles The steering column was changed to a two piece design with a universal joint lessening the danger of intrusion during a front end collision actually a mid running change A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the front suspension and underbody and lessen crosswind sensitivity In front The lock door emblem covering the lockset for the trunk lock was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar At the rear new larger taillight lenses were used featuring a thin chrome ring around the center of the light Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted in front of the engine eliminating the previous unit mounted atop the engine requiring its removal for most engine service The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver s side headlight bezel Sales began a decline as a result of Ralph Nader s book highlighting the Corvair s deficiencies and the new Mustang offering V s up to hp kW PS compared to the Corvair s hp kW PS top powertrain Rumors of the upcoming Panther the code name for the forthcoming Camaro slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang further undercut sales A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair Production for the model year was down to br br br br In the Corvair line was trimmed to the and Monza Hardtop Coupes and Hardtop Sedans and the Monza Convertible This model year was the first with a collapsible steering column A dual circuit master cylinder with warning light nylon reinforced brake hoses stronger steel instead of aluminum door hinges mushroomed instrument panel knobs and a vinyl edged day night mirror were all made standard equipment Bucket seats in Monza models were now of the same Astro style as those on the new for Camaro featuring a new thin shell design Chevrolet introduced a mi km engine warranty on all Chevrolet models including the Corvair Chevrolet was still actively marketing the Corvair in including color print ads and an I Love My Corvair bumper sticker campaign by dealers but production and sales continued to fall off drastically Only copies were built The chrome rings around the center of the taillights were made thicker br br br br In the four door hardtop was discontinued leaving three models the and Monza Hardtop Coupes and the Monza Convertible Air conditioning was dropped as an option due to concerns about thermal loading added by the now standard Air Injection Reactor smog pump which probably hurt sales as factory air became more popular generally in automobiles The GM multiplex stereo system was also discontinued when new units changed wiring adapters the Corvair s pin connector would no longer fit the new units Additional safety features including side marker lights and shoulder belts for closed models were fitted per the federal government s requirements The steering wheel for s was the same as the base Nova s while Monzas got the same wheel as the Camaro An Impala style Deluxe steering wheel was optional All advertising was stopped and sales were down to br br br br The final model year Corvairs were assembled with the Nova in Willow Run Michigan the same facility Corvairs had been built from the beginning A total of Corvairs were produced of which only were Monza Convertibles The Corvair was the only GM car in that did not get a locking steering column Demand for Novas was high and a decision was made in November to move Corvair assembly to a special off line area in the plant dubbed the Corvair Room making Corvairs produced between that time and May essentially hand built by a dedicated Corvair team Assembled bodies arrived from Fisher Body and awaited final assembly in the off line area br br br End of production br While the Corvair was received as a well engineered high performance driver s car that accomplishment was overshadowed by the phenomenal market success of the Ford Mustang GM saw advantages to the route adopted by Ford with the Mustang a four seat semi coupe body on a standard compact Falcon chassis with a small block V motor and four on the floor offered as power options The Corvair was not cheap to produce developing and marketing a Mustang style model based on the Nova platform had cost advantages Unlike the Corvair a derivative model could evolve within GM s standard lines of manufacturing technology The publication of Unsafe at Any Speed sullied the reputation of the Corvair line although the issues had nothing to do with the current model Under competition from the Mustang and the publicity hit of Unsafe Corvair sales plummeted by over half in GM saw the advantages of developing the Camaro not the Corvair br According to GM historian Dave Newell Chevrolet had planned on ending Corvair production after the model year Development and engineering changes were halted in on the year old redesigned second generation cars with mainly federally mandated emissions and safety changes made thereafter An increasing lack of interest from the company especially from Chevrolet s general manager John DeLorean and a complete absence of Corvair advertising after reflected the company s priorities including promotion of three redesigned models for the Corvette Chevelle and Chevy II Nova The Corvair was referred to as the phantom by Car Life magazine in their Monza road test and by Chevrolet s Corvair four page brochure was by request only During its final year of production cars were produced br Chevrolet had proposed a third generation onward Corvair essentially a re skin of the model resembling the GM A Body intermediates particularly the Pontiac Grand Am retaining Corvair proportions Having passed the point of full scale clay models Chevrolet stopped developing the model in early Unlike the Turbo Hydramatic the Turbo Hydramatic transmission introduced in the Camaro and later adopted by most Chevrolet models had been configured for use in the third generation

term that applied to all Corvair van models indicating that the driver and controls were forward of the front wheels br br br Handling issues br br The first generation Corvair featured a rear engine swing axle design similar to that of the Renault Dauphine and Volkswagen Beetle a design which eliminates universal joints at the wheels and keeps the rear wheels perpendicular to the half shafts rather than the road surface The design can allow rear tires to undergo large camber angle changes during fast cornering due to side g forces causing rebound camber and decreasing the tread contact with the road surface leading to a loss of rear wheel grip and oversteer a dynamically unstable condition where a driver can lose control and spin The problem is most severe in combinations having the engine and swing axle at the same end of the car in most cases this is at the rear and the Corvair is no exception The rebound camber is worse because of the greater inertial mass over the rear wheels with this combination the higher center of gravity during rebound causes additional problems A station wagon body also exacerbates the tendency because it increases the weight at the rear and raises the center of gravity Oversteer is exacerbated by deceleration during cornering due to increased side g force and lightened load on rear tires lift off oversteer Understeer is common in front engine cars due to more weight and inertia on the front tires Both conditions are dangerous when a car is driven at its cornering limits Design options to ameliorate swing axle handling br br Anti roll bar As a production option engineers had advocated but management rejected the inclusion of a front anti roll bar on the original Corvair which would have ameliorated the car s handling shifting weight transfer to the front outboard tire considerably reducing rear slip angles thereby avoiding potential oversteer br Tire pressure differential As with the Renault Dauphine and pre Volkswagen Beetle Corvair engineers relied on a cost free tire pressure differential to eliminate oversteer characteristics low front and high rear tire pressure a strategy which induced understeer increasing front slip angles faster than the rear Nonetheless the strategy offered a significant disadvantage owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re introduce oversteer characteristics by over inflating the front tires e g to typical pressures for other cars with other more prevalent suspension systems The recommended low front tire pressure also compromised the tire load capacity br While the Corvair sedan offered competent handling the average buyer more accustomed to front engined cars did not take into account the car s different handling characteristics Chevrolet made a succession of improvements to the first generation Corvair suspension For the model year the front anti roll bar became available as an option For the model year the front anti roll bar became standard equipment and the rear suspension was modified to include a camber compensating transverse mounted leaf spring extending between the rear wheels to limit rear wheel camber change and carrying much of the rear weight combined with softer coil springs Also in two Corvairs were tested around Riverside for hours one managed to survive the test despite crossing the finish line with no fuel at an average speed of mph km h and burned a quart of oil while the other one crashed around the esses br For the model year the Corvair received a fully independent rear suspension closely resembling that of the contemporary Corvette The redesigned suspension reduced the rear roll center to half its previous height using fully articulated half axles that offered constant camber on the rear tires in all driving situations This eliminated the handling problems of the first generation models br br br Legal fallout br Consumer protection activist Ralph Nader addressed the handling issues of the first generation Corvair in his book Unsafe at Any Speed GM had over lawsuits pending in connection with crashes involving the Corvair which subsequently became the initial material for Nader s investigations The book highlighted crashes related to the Corvair s suspension and identified the Chevrolet suspension engineer who had fought management s decision to omit for cost reasons the front anti roll bar installed on later models Nader said during subsequent Congressional hearings the Corvair is the leading candidate for the un safest car title Subsequently Corvair sales fell from in to in By production fell to Public response to the book played a role in the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in br A safety commission report conducted by Texas A M University concluded that the Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations The U S Department of Transportation DOT issued a press release in describing the findings of NHTSA testing from the previous year NHTSA had conducted a series of comparative tests in studying the handling of the Corvair and four contemporary cars a Ford Falcon Plymouth Valiant Volkswagen Beetle and Renault Dauphine along with a second generation Corvair with its completely redesigned independent rear suspension The page report reviewed NHTSA s extreme condition handling tests national crash involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors internal documentation regarding the Corvair s handling NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests This review panel concluded that the Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests the handling and stability performance of the Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic Former GM executive and automotive engineer John DeLorean asserted in his book On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors that Nader s criticisms were valid br Journalist David E Davis in a article in Automobile Magazine noted that despite Nader s claim that swing axle rear suspension was dangerous Porsche Mercedes Benz Tatra and Volkswagen all used similar swing axle concepts during that era The handling of other rear engine swing axle cars particularly the Volkswagen Type I and II has been criticized as well Some contend that Nader s lack of an automotive engineering degree or a driver s license at the time he wrote Unsafe at Any Speed disqualifies him as a critic of automotive safety In response to Nader s book Mechanix Illustrated reviewer Tom McCahill tried to get a Corvair to flip at one point sliding sideways into a street curb but could not turn over the vehicle br br br Vindication br The Corvair s reputation and legacy as well as those of General Motors were tarnished by accusations about its handling ability the car was scrutinized in Ralph Nader s book Unsafe at Any Speed Ralph Nader s accusations were proven false by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety commission report Support for the tests conducted at College Station Texas was provided by the Texas Transportation Institute TTl Texas A M University Research Foundation The investigation concluded br br The Corvair understeers in the same manner as conventional passenger cars up to about g lateral acceleration makes a transition from understeer through neutral steer to oversteer in a range from about g to g lateral acceleration This transition does not result in the abnormal potential for loss of control The limited accident data available indicates that the rollover rate of the Corvair is comparable to other light domestic cars The Corvair compared favorably with the other contemporary vehicles used in the NHTSA Input Response Tests The handling and stability performance of the Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic br br br Legacy br br br Design influence br The first generation Corvair has been credited with influencing car design worldwide Styled in GM s advanced styling studio in under the leadership of then director Ned Nickels the compact design was made using cues from earlier Oldsmobile and Chevrolet models The most notable design feature its high wrap around beltline was borrowed by other carmakers not long after the Corvair s release These cars included the BMW NSU Prinz Hillman Imp Fiat Volkswagen Type Karmann Ghia and the Mazda br The Corvair s combination of power and light weight introduced European manufacturers to an American market niche for small popular priced sedans with more power and driveability than the contemporary European economy sedans and a more versatile and practical design than European sports cars That overall concept was exemplified by Volkswagen s Type Karmann Ghia and Type notchback in and BMW s New Class sedans in BMW developed the concept further by mass marketing higher performance high quality sedans setting the trend of the sport sedan category that would soon include offerings from a variety of European and eventually Japanese manufacturers br br br Concept cars br br The Corvair spawned a number of innovative concept vehicles including the Corvair SS Monza GT Monza SS and Astro I In Europe Italian coachbuilder Bertone designed a very advanced one off prototype for the Geneva Motor Show the Chevrolet Testudo This was among the first designs of Giorgetto Giugiaro the chief designer at Bertone at the time The Testudo later suffered a collision with another Bertone concept car the Alfa Romeo Canguro while on track at the Monza circuit There was also a Pininfarina built concept called the Corvair Speciale and two other Pininfarina concepts known as Coupe I and Coupe II br The Chevrolet Corvair Monza GT coupe toured together with the Monza SS Spyder in early making a public appearance at the New York International Auto Show Although both cars were based on the Corvair drivetrain each represented a futuristic development of the Corvair design In the SS convertible the engine with a four carburetor setup was left in its stock location behind the transaxle allowing for a shorter in mm wheelbase The Monza GT is housed at the GM s Heritage Center in Detroit br A concept vehicle the Electrovair II was a Monza door hardtop modified with a volt hp kW electric motor replacing the gasoline engine following a version known as Electrovair I With the model silver zinc batteries were used and placed in the trunk and engine compartment and the body was slightly modified to accept the conversion The car was handicapped by the high cost of the batteries a limited driving range mi km and short battery life br br br Racing and modified Corvairs br br br Yenko Stinger br br Don Yenko who had been racing Corvettes could not compete successfully against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene Yenko decided to race modified Corvairs beginning with the model As the stock Corvair did not fit into any of the SCCA categories Yenko modified four carburetor Corsas into sports cars by removing the back seat and introducing various performance improvements As the SCCA required cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing Yenko completed Stingers in one month in Although all were white as the SCCA required for American cars at the time the normal competition trim for U S built cars was white with blue stripes there was a great deal of variety between individual cars some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers some did not some received engine upgrades developing or hp or kW All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension four speed transmission quicker steering ratio positraction limited slip differentials with gears and with after Chevrolet discontinued the and dual brake master cylinders the first application of this by Chevrolet to become standard equipment the next year Because most of the engine cooling in air cooled engines is done by circulating oil an oil cooler was necessary for competition use this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel br The Stingers competed in Class D production dominated by the Triumph TR In its first race in January the Stinger finished in second by only one second By the end of the season Jerry Thompson had won the Central Division Championship and placed fifth in the Nationals Dick Thompson a successful Corvette race driver had won the Northeast Division Championship and Jim Spencer had won the Central Division Championship with Dino Milani taking second place The next year Chevrolet dropped the Corsa line The Monza line was initially not available with the carburetor engine These were eventually offered as a special performance option along with the differential The Monza instrumentation did not have a tachometer or head temperature gauges which had to be separately installed The SCCA on the other hand had relaxed its ruling regarding color and the cars were available in red or blue It is
