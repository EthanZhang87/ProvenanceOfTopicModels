Rambler is an automobile brand name that was first used by the Thomas B Jeffery Company between and br Charles W Nash bought Jeffery in and Nash Motors reintroduced the name to the automobile marketplace from through The Rambler trademark registration for use on automobiles and parts was issued on March for Nash Kelvinator br Nash merged with the Hudson Motor Car Company to form American Motors Corporation AMC in The Rambler line of cars continued through the model year in the United States and in international markets br Rambler cars were often nicknamed the Kenosha Cadillac after the original location and their most significant place of manufacture in the city of Kenosha Wisconsin br br br Rambler br br The first use of the name Rambler for an American made automobile dates to when Thomas B Jeffery of Chicago Illinois builder of the Rambler bicycle constructed his prototype automobile br After receiving positive reviews at the Chicago International Exhibition Tournament and the first National Automobile Show in New York City Jeffery entered the automobile business Following the sudden death of his Rambler partner R Philip Gormully Jeffery sold their bicycle business to the American Bicycle Company but retained rights to the Rambler name In he bought the old Sterling Bicycle Co factory in Kenosha Wisconsin and set up shop br Thomas Jeffery and his son Charles experimented with such early technical innovations as a steering wheel as opposed to a tiller left hand driving and the engine placement under a hood instead of under the seat but they was decided that such features were too advanced for the motoring public of the day The first Ramblers were tiller steered right hand drive and the single cylinder engine was positioned under the seat Rambler innovated various design features and was the first to equip cars with a spare wheel and tire assembly This allowed the driver when experiencing a flat tire to exchange the spare wheel and tire for the flat one rather than patching br Jeffery started commercially mass producing automobiles in By the end of the year the company had produced motor cars priced at equivalent to in one sixth of all cars that were manufactured in the U S during that year The Thomas B Jeffery Company was the second largest auto manufacturer at that time behind Oldsmobile br In Jeffery built Ramblers Higher powered two cylinder versions with front mounted engines and steering wheels were now available In the single cylinder was discontinued and three larger two cylinder models priced from to were offered A Rambler four cylinder was introduced in br New employee Edward S Jordan who would later become Jeffery s secretary and general manager provided advertisement copy such as The Right Car at the Right Price June Time Is Rambler Time and other evocative phrases By Rambler was considered an industry leader with one of the best equipped automobile factories Thomas Jeffery was not interested in increasing mass production and settled into a pattern of producing Ramblers a year br In all Ramblers were now four cylinder medium priced cars While on vacation in Thomas B Jeffery died of a heart attack and his son Charles took over the newly incorporated Thomas B Jeffery Company Charles increased annual production by about cars and in introduced new Ned Jordan model names such as Cross Country Country Club Knickerbocker and Valkyrie For the last Rambler branded models were the Cross Country roadster and touring car an Inside Drive coupe and the Gotham Limousine priced from equivalent to in to equivalent to in br In Charles T Jeffery Thomas B Jeffery s son replaced the Rambler brand name with Jeffery in honor of his now deceased father br In the Thomas B Jeffery Company was purchased by Charles W Nash and became Nash Motors Company in The Jeffery brand name was dropped at the time of the sale The manufacture of Nash branded automobiles commenced In the concern became the Nash Kelvinator Corporation through a merger with the major appliance maker br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Rambler br br Under the direction of Charles Nash s successor George W Mason Nash Kelvinator Corporation began the development of a small car that could be produced inexpensively for the post World War II economy Both General Motors and Ford had plans to develop smaller sized cars after the war but did not realize them Moreover steel shortages following the war limited the amount of raw materials that Nash could obtain Hence Mason ordered the development of a compact car that would have greater appeal to consumers because the Crosley in production at that time was considered too small to be practical The new Nash compact featured a unique convertible design It included many standard features that were typically options on other cars This approach maximized profits for the company Nash Kelvinator trademarked Rambler in the same nameplate as was used by its predecessor company in the early s br When introduced the Rambler was an immediate success for Nash As the steel quotas related to the Korean War eased the Rambler line was broadened in its model types first a station wagon and two door hardtop no B pillar named Country Club and later a two door sedan A further expansion of the line for included a four door sedan and station wagon called Cross Country on a stretched wheelbase which proved to be as successful as the first generation of two door sedan convertibles The Rambler became the most successful of the early post Second World War American compacts compared to the Henry J and rebadged Allstate version Willys Aero and Hudson Jet br The first generation of modern Ramblers carried a modified version of Nash s Airflyte styling which included closed wheel openings While the wheel openings of any car are a major source of wind resistance the design was rather primarily an engineering design to increase the strength of the car for impact resistance The engine is positioned between massive inner fender bulges to allow for the skirted front fenders along with a narrow in mm front track to provide a turning circle of ft m Ramblers continued to use this styling until when the front wheels were revealed by a periodic design update br In the Rambler offered the first combination heating and air conditioning unit available on American cars The unit could be an add on or could be installed at the factory for which at that time was about the lowest cost unit available in an American car br In American Motors Corporation AMC was formed from the merger of Nash Kelvinator and the Hudson Motor Car Company Following the merger and Ramblers were badged as both Nashes and Hudsons with no visible differences Rambler became a marque in its own right for the model year The Nash and Hudson makes continued as a senior model only through after which all AMC s offerings were marketed as Ramblers except the imported Metropolitan br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Rambler br br At the start of the s George Romney made a marketing decision that more fully unified the Rambler model names under the Rambler brand In the Ambassador a top trim level model was officially brought under the Rambler name it had previously been named the Ambassador by Rambler The former Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V were renamed the Rambler Classic While the top line models for were advertised as the Ambassador V by Rambler but on the cars themselves the badging was Rambler Ambassador br In AMC re introduced America s first successful compact car the Rambler American after a three year hiatus This car was essentially the no frills economical Nash Rambler but slightly restyled and modernized with a new grille and full cut out wheel openings The Recession of hurt all carmakers except AMC whose economy oriented Ramblers saw high demand The American was an instant success and lost sales only after the Big Three GM Ford and Chrysler each introduced compact cars of their own in the s GM X body Ford Falcon and Chrysler A platform br Romney also put into play his plan to slash production costs which involved more common parts sharing between the Ambassador and Classic models Beginning in all senior Rambler models would share the same automobile platform with identical wheelbase and body parts However the engines trims and equipment levels distinguished the Classic from the Ambassador The Rambler s compact size by U S standards also made it an international competitor and between and AMC opened thirteen foreign assembly plants from Costa Rica to the Philippines br In the entire Rambler line received the Motor Trend Car of the Year award However Romney s departure to become Michigan governor opened the door for his successor Roy Abernethy to redirect the company towards a strategy of competing head to head with the Big Three General Motors Chrysler Corporation and Ford Motor Company with a variety of bodies and automobile platforms This new plan also included marketing the various models apart from the Rambler brand name which Abernethy thought would be a hindrance in the market segments he hoped to pursue br One of the first moves in that direction was the development of the line of Ramblers which visually split the Classic from the Ambassador while still sharing many parts Once again the Ambassador had a unique extended wheelbase In addition AMC introduced the Marlin a hardtop fastback intended to enter AMC in the youth and personal luxury market segments as well as also positioning it as a halo vehicle br AMC chief stylist Richard Teague introduced a restyled and attractive Rambler American in which was a sales success This basic body remained in its original shape through br Backed by marketing reports Abernethy next made a persuasive argument to the AMC board that the Rambler name had not only acquired a stodgy image and hindered increasing sales but that consumers associated it with compact cars In what hindsight would show to be an ill conceived decision American Motors began to phase it out in favor of an AMC marque starting with the model year as it attempted to become a multiplatform automobile manufacturer br By the only vehicle produced by AMC to carry the Rambler marque was the compact Rambler American Although designed as a basic economy car the American spawned the audacious SC Rambler developed with Hurst Performance While AMC planned to produce only for the model year the Scrambler proved popular so two more groups of about each were built All featured the same cu in L V four barrel carburetor and close ratio four speed transmission of the AMX plus Hurst shifter Twin Grip limited slip differential and cold air hood br For the final year in the American line was called Rambler The Rambler and Chevrolet Corvair and Dodge Dart were the only U S compact cars available that year in a two door hardtop body style Ford compacts were only available as sedans br The last U S built Rambler of over million cars that carried the Rambler name that rolled off the assembly line in Kenosha was produced on June br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Rambler br

Trademark br American Motors stopped producing cars using the Rambler trademark in In Action Age Incorporated wanted to register Scrambler for an off highway vehicle and in a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board contended that the trademark Rambler had been abandoned This registration was opposed by AMC and the court determined that even though the manufacturing of Ramblers ended the trademark was not abandoned because AMC continued to have commercial activities such as parts with the Rambler name on the boxes as well as franchising dealers that retained Rambler in their name or marketed used cars under the Rambler trademark br The Rambler trademark registration expired on December because Chrysler the company that acquired AMC in did not file an affidavit of continued use However it was claimed by Chrysler as a retro or heritage mark that had built an affinity and emotional connection with the consumer as a result of the original product that was in the marketplace and continues to have nostalgia appeal with consumers who are still interested in acquiring products built around the mark s core values and replicates the markets and the mark itself In a case before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board the United States Patent and Trademark Office determined that Chrysler continued to have products licensed in connection with the Rambler mark for automobiles and thus sufficiently related to automobiles so that consumers would ascribe a single source to the products Chrysler as the successor company was able to prove non abandonment by demonstrating that there were many Rambler cars and related supplies bearing the mark still in use The board ruled that Chrysler has priority of use at the very least with respect to key rings calendars decals specification sheets
