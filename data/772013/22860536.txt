title: Automotive night vision
id: 22860536
An automotive night vision system uses a thermographic camera to increase a driver s perception and seeing distance in darkness or poor weather beyond the reach of the vehicle s headlights Such systems are offered as optional equipment on certain premium vehicles The technology was first introduced in the year on the Cadillac Deville This technology is based on the night vision devices NVD which generally denotes any electronically enhanced optical devices operate in three modes image enhancement thermal imaging and active illumination The automotive night vision system is a combination of NVDs such as infrared cameras GPS Lidar and Radar among others to sense and detect objects br br br Display type br Instrument cluster using a high resolution liquid crystal display LCD newest type br navigation system or information screen least expensive and with display s location further away from driver s field of vision used exclusively by BMW and the W E class br windshield via head up display earliest type dimmer knob can reduce brightness display nearest to driver s line of sight br There are two types of systems either passive or active systems both have advantages and disadvantages when compared to the other The passive system pertains to the technologies that detect thermal radiation emitted by humans animals and other objects in the road while the active systems illuminate objects as a significant distance ahead using infrared light sources br br br Active systems br Active systems use an infrared light source built into the car to illuminate the road ahead with light that is invisible to humans There are two kinds of active systems gated and non gated The gated system uses a pulsed light source and a synchronized camera that enable long ranges m and high performance in rain and snow br Near Infrared wavelength is m is smaller and can pass between the typical fog particles Fog particles sizes are typically to microns and ranges is sizes from to microns Far infrared has a wavelength of micrometers m to mm During night time operations police officers with range gated near infrared cameras can read license plates at a distance of up to km Near Infrared NIR cameras are available to see km through fog haze smoke rain br br Pros higher resolution image superior picture of inanimate objects works better in warmer conditions smaller sensor can be mounted to rearview mirror br Cons does not work as well in fog or rain lower contrast for animals shorter range of meters or feet br br br Mercedes Benz br br Night View Assist prototype was shown in on the Mercedes Benz F concept br Series production Night View Assist system introduced in on the redesigned Mercedes Benz S Class W It was the first system to use the instrument cluster s LCD as a display br Night View Assist Plus added a pedestrian detection function calling the revised system on the redesigned Mercedes Benz E Class W and refreshed S class however the E class uses the navigation screen s display br Night View Assist Plus with Spotlight Function premiere the Mercedes Benz CL Class C became the first series production car with night vision guided pedestrian spotlighting HID version can flash at any pedestrians it detects in order to warn both the driver and the pedestrians The flashing light is directed in such a way that vehicles in front and oncoming traffic are not dazzled br Night View Assist Plus with animal detection on the W S Class br br br Toyota br br In Toyota Night View was the first worldwide series production active automotive night vision system introduced on the Toyota Landcruiser Cygnus or Lexus LX This system uses the headlight projectors emitting near infrared light aimed like the car s highbeam headlights and a CCD camera then captures that reflected radiation this signal is then processed by computer which produces a black and white image which is projected on the lower section of the windshield br In February the Toyota Crown Hybrid added a feature which highlights pedestrians and presents them in a box on an LCD display in front of the driver This was the first pedestrian detection feature for an active system br In Lexus introduced Night View on the LS but only in Japan br In Lexus introduced Night View worldwide on LS and GS The Night View system combines a windshield mounted near infra red camera and near infra red projectors within the headlamps with a Night View ECU to display an image of the br road ahead on center console display screen Moving the image from the driver s instrument display to the center console offers drivers a larger display and an easier viewing angle With the camera constantly in operation and the near infra red projectors activating at speeds over MPH to enhance system efficiency night view will display an area up to feet in front of the vehicle This system was discontinued for in the US br br br Passive systems br Passive infrared systems do not use an infrared light source instead they capture thermal radiation already emitted by the objects using a thermographic camera br br Pros greater range of about meters or feet higher contrast for living objects br Cons grainy lower resolution image works poorly in warmer weather conditions larger sensor br br br Audi br br Night Vision Assistant was introduced in on the Audi A It uses a thermal imaging camera behind the four rings at the front of the car which can see meters ft ahead The display in the instrument cluster highlights humans with yellow markings More importantly the computer can determine if the person on the road moves in a way that could lead to a collision with the car In that case the pedestrian is being marked in red color and the driver of the car receives an audible warning br update added animal detection and Pedestrian Marker Lights As soon as a pedestrian is detected by the Night Vision Assistant in a critical range in front of the vehicle individual Matrix LEDs flash briefly times in succession to alert that person who is then clearly visible to the driver br br br BMW br BMW Night Vision introduced in on the BMW Series E This system processes far infrared radiation which minimizes non essential information placing a greater emphasis on pedestrians and animals allows for a range of meters or nearly feet and avoids dazzle from headlights road lights and similar intense light sources br update added pedestrian detection system on the redesigned BMW Series F which flashes a caution symbol on the navigation information screen and automotive head up display when it detects pedestrians br update added Dynamic Light Spot br update added animal detection The system provides a real time video image that also depicts on the Control Display persons animals and other objects emitting heat when they are outside of the light beam and warns in the event of an impending collision The Dynamic Light Spot is produced by a special headlight that directs the light beam onto the recognised persons or animals respectively thus drawing the driver s attention to possible hazards in good time As soon as the remote infrared detects pedestrians or larger animals on course for collision in the dark the system directs two separately controlled Dynamic Light Spots at them without creating an unpleasant glare In the event of an acute risk an acoustic warning signal is also sounded and the brakes are set to maximum standby For the model year the BMW Series will also have these new features br br br Cadillac br First worldwide series production automotive night vision on Cadillac Deville Night Vision however it was discontinued in This system was developed with Raytheon and worked by using a passive infrared sensor camera mounted behind the vehicle s grille Infrared radiation is picked up by the sensor processed by computer and then displayed on the windshield using a head up display Information is displayed as a black and white image with warmer objects in white while cooler objects appear black Because this system outputs a standard NTSC composite video signal and the used parts are somewhat easy and inexpensive to find it has become a popular choice for fitting thermal night vision to other vehicles After a long hiatus the flagship Cadillac CT was equipped with an improved version of the Enhanced Night Vision in which the images are displayed and embedded in the instrument panel instead of being displayed as a reflection on the windshield br br br Honda br In Honda introduced first worldwide system with pedestrian detection on redesigned Honda Legend Intelligent Night Vision It detected far infrared radiation The pedestrian detection feature alerted the driver with an audio warning and visually enclosed the pedestrian in a box on the display which was presented via head up display The night vision system uses a separate heads up type display projected on the center bottom of the windshield The infrared cameras do not require a light source and the software is able to detect human like figures surround the image with a red box and give audible caution tones br br br DS Automobiles br DS Night Vision offers road visibility by night An infrared camera in the front grill identifies objects pedestrians and animals on the road at a distance of up to m A digital instrument cluster shows the driver the area around the car in infrared with a yellow line around any sources of potential danger For critical danger the line becomes red allowing the driver to react to the situation The DS Crossback is the first DS vehicle to include Night Vision br br br Peugeot br On the Peugeot an optional night vision system helps to see pedestrians and animals during the night and alert the driver
