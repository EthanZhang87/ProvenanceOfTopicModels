title: Crumple zone
id: 236721
Crumple zones crush zones or crash zones are a structural safety feature used in vehicles mainly in automobiles to increase the time over which a change in velocity and consequently momentum occurs from the impact during a collision by a controlled deformation in recent years it is also incorporated into trains and railcars br Crumple zones are designed to increase the time over which the total force from the change in momentum is applied to an occupant as the average force applied to the occupants is inversely related to the time over which it is applied The physics involved can be expressed by the equation br br br br br br F br br avg br br br br t br br m br br v br br br displaystyle F text avg Delta t m Delta v br br br where br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br is the force br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br is the time br br br br m br br br displaystyle m br br is the mass and br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br is the velocity of the body In SI units force is measured in Newtons time in seconds mass in kilograms velocity in metres per second and the resulting impulse is measured in newton seconds N s br Typically crumple zones are located in the front part of the vehicle to absorb the impact of a head on collision but they may be found on other parts of the vehicle as well According to a British Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre study of where on the vehicle impact damage occurs were front impacts rear impacts left side and right side Some racing cars use aluminium composite carbon fibre honeycomb or energy absorbing foam to form an impact attenuator that dissipates crash energy using a much smaller volume and lower weight than road car crumple zones Impact attenuators have also been introduced on highway maintenance vehicles in some countries br On September the ABC News programs Good Morning America and World News showed a U S Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash test of a Chevrolet Malibu in an offset head on collision with a Chevrolet Bel Air sedan It dramatically demonstrated the effectiveness of modern car safety design over s design particularly of rigid passenger safety cells and crumple zones br br br Early development history br The crumple zone concept was originally invented and patented by the Hungarian Mercedes Benz engineer B la Bar nyi in before he worked for Mercedes Benz and in a more developed form in The Mercedes Benz Ponton was a partial implementation of his ideas by having a strong deep platform to form a partial safety cell patented in br The Mercedes Benz patent number granted in describes the decisive feature of passive safety Bar nyi questioned the opinion that had prevailed until then that a safe car had to be rigid He divided the car body into three sections the rigid non deforming passenger compartment and the crumple zones in the front and the rear br The first Mercedes Benz carbody developed using the patent was the Mercedes W Tail Fin Saloon The safety cell and crumple zones were achieved primarily by the design of the longitudinal members these were straight in the centre of the vehicle and formed a rigid safety cage with the body panels the front and rear supports were curved so that they deformed in the event of an accident absorbing part of the collision energy br A more recent development for these curved longitudinal members is to be weakened by vertical and lateral ribs to form telescoping crash can or crush tube deformation structures br br br Function br br Crumple zones work by managing crash energy and increasing the time over which the deceleration of the occupants of the vehicle occurs while also preventing intrusion into or deformation of the passenger cabin This better protects car occupants against injury This is achieved by controlled weakening of sacrificial outer parts of the car while strengthening and increasing the rigidity of the inner part of the body of the car making the passenger cabin into a safety cell by using more reinforcing beams and higher strength steels Impact energy that does reach the safety cell is spread over as wide an area as possible to reduce its deformation Volvo introduced the side crumple zone with the introduction of the SIPS Side Impact Protection System in the early s br When a vehicle and all its contents including passengers and luggage are travelling at speed they have inertia momentum which means that they will continue forward with that direction and speed Newton s first law of motion In the event of a sudden deceleration of a rigid framed vehicle due to impact unrestrained vehicle contents will continue forwards at their previous speed due to inertia and impact the vehicle interior with a force equivalent to many times their normal weight due to gravity The purpose of crumple zones is to slow down the collision to increase the time over which the occupants decelerate so as to decrease the peak force imparted on the occupants over a given time br Seatbelts restrain the passengers so they don t fly through the windshield and are in the correct position for the airbag and also increase the time over which the occupants decelerate Seat belts also absorb passenger inertial energy by being designed to stretch during an impact again to increase the time over which an occupant decelerates In short a passenger whose body is decelerated more slowly due to the crumple zone and other devices over a longer time survives much more often than a passenger whose body indirectly impacts a hard undamaged metal car body which has come to a halt nearly instantaneously This difference in deceleration is analogous to the difference between slamming someone into a wall headfirst fracturing their skull and shoulder first bruising their flesh slightly the arm being softer takes tens of times longer to slow its speed than the hard skull which must deal with extremely high pressure the moment it comes in contact with the wall As seatbelts stretch while restraining occupants during an impact it is necessary to replace them if a vehicle is repaired and put back on the road after a collision They should also be replaced if their condition has deteriorated e g through fraying or mechanical or belt mounting faults In New Zealand it is officially mandatory to replace worn inertia reel type seatbelts only with webbing grabber type belts that have less play and are more effective on older cars Newer cars have electronically fired pre tension seatbelts that are timed to work with the airbag firing Buying used seatbelts is not a good idea even in countries where it is legal to do so because they may have already been stretched in an impact event and may not protect their new users as they should br The final impact after a passenger s body hits the car interior airbag or seat belts is that of the internal organs hitting the ribcage or skull due to their inertia The force of this impact is the way by which many car crashes cause disabling or life threatening injury Other ways are skeletal damage and blood loss because of torn blood vessels or damage caused by sharp fractured bone to organs and or blood vessels The sequence of speed reducing technologies crumple zones seat belt airbags padded deformable interior are designed to work together as a system to reduce the peak force of the impact on the outside of the passenger s body by lengthening the time over which this force is imparted In a collision slowing down the deceleration of the human body by even a few tenths of a second drastically reduces the peak force imparted br br A misconception about crumple zones sometimes voiced is that they reduce safety for the occupants of the vehicle by allowing the body of the vehicle to collapse therefore risking crushing the occupants In fact crumple zones are typically located in front of and behind the main body of the car which forms a rigid safety cell compacting within the space of the engine compartment or boot trunk Modern vehicles utilizing crumple zones provide far superior protection for their occupants in severe tests against other vehicles with crumple zones and solid static objects than older car models or SUVs that use a separate chassis frame and have no crumple zones br Modern vehicles with crumple zones do tend to come off worse when involved in accidents with SUVs without crumple zones because most of the energy of the impact is absorbed by the vehicle with the crumple zone however while the worse off vehicle may end up more damaged the occupants of the car are often less affected by the collision The result of two vehicles without crumple zones colliding will usually be more hazardous to both vehicles occupants than a collision that is at least partly buffered br Another problem is impact incompatibility where the hard points of the ends of chassis rails of SUVs are higher than the hard points of cars causing the SUV to override the engine compartment of the car In order to tackle this problem more recent SUV off roaders incorporate structures below the front bumper designed to engage lower height car crumple zones Volvo XC low level front safety cross members shown here Volvo s press release about this feature br Lower cross member that helps protects lower cars The front suspension subframe in the new Volvo XC is supplemented with a lower cross member positioned at the height of the beam in a conventional car The lower cross member strikes the oncoming car s protective structure activating its crumple zone as intended so the occupants can be given the maximum level of protection br br br Low speed impact absorption br The front of the bumper is designed to withstand low speed collisions e g as in parking bumps to prevent permanent damage to the vehicle This is achieved by elastic elements such as the front apron In some vehicles the bumper is filled with foam or similar elastic substances This aspect of design has received more attention in recent years as NCAP crash assessment has added pedestrian impacts to its testing regime The reduction of rigid support structures in pedestrian impact areas has also been made a design objective br In the case of less severe collisions up to approx km h the bumper and outer panel design should ensure that the crumple zone and the load bearing structure of the vehicle is damaged as little as possible and repairs can be carried out as cheaply as possible For this purpose so called crash tubes or crash boxes are used for mounting bumpers Crashtubes consist of a hollow steel profile which transforms the incident energy by rolling up the profile br br br Computer modelled crash simulation br br In the early s using technology developed for the aerospace and nuclear industries German car makers started complex computer crash simulation studies using finite element methods simulating the crash behaviour of individual car body components component assemblies and quarter and half cars at the body in white BIW stage These experiments culminated in a joint project by the Forschungsgemeinschaft Automobil Technik FAT a conglomeration of all seven German car makers Audi BMW Ford Mercedes Benz Opel GM Porsche and Volkswagen which tested the applicability of two emerging commercial crash simulation codes These simulation codes recreated a frontal impact of a full passenger car structure Haug and they ran to completion on a computer overnight Now that turn around time between two consecutive job submissions computer runs did not exceed one day engineers were able to make efficient and progressive improvements of the crash behaviour of the analyzed car body structure The drive for improved crashworthiness in Europe has accelerated from the s onwards with the advent of Euro NCAP with the involvement of Formula One motor racing safety expertise br br br Sleds inside safety cells br The Pininfarina Nido Experimental Safety Vehicle locates crumple zones inside the survival cell Those interior crumple zones decelerate a sled mounted survival cell Volvo has also been developing this idea for use in small cars Their driver s seat is mounted to what is basically a sled on a rail with shock absorbers in front of it In an impact the whole sled of driving seat and belted in driver slides forward up to inches and the shock absorbers dissipate the peak shock energy of the impact lengthening the deceleration time for the driver Simultaneously the steering wheel and the driver s side dashboard slide forward to make room for the driver as they are thrown forwards stretching the seatbelt Combined with a front crumple zone and airbag this system could greatly reduce the forces acting on the driver in a frontal impact br br br See also br
