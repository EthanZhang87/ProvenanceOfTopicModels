A shaker scoop sometimes called a shaker hood scoop or a shaker hood is an automobile term for an air intake for combustion air that is mounted directly on top of the engine s air cleaner and protrudes through a hole in the hood Since it is fastened directly to the engine it moves with the engine s movement and vibration on its mountings thus the shaker name br br br Design br Like all such scoops its purpose is to increase performance by a ram air effect taking advantage of the vehicle s speed to deliver high pressure cool air to the engine over a shorter less restrictive flow path However because engines draw air in hundreds of cubic feet per minute scoops do not raise intake pressures significantly Additional claimed benefits of a shaker hood include elevation to prevent water from being drawn on flooded terrain being a source of cooler denser air and having a more direct path to the engine s throttle plate br br br Aftermarket br br Hot rod and drag race enthusiasts have modified automotive engines to increase power via supercharger forced induction since the s in some cases a blower scoop is added to the top of the supercharger as an aid to air intake br A vehicle also can be equipped with an aftermarket engine mounted scoop that is mounted directly to the carburetor and protrudes through the hood which is known as a carb scoop Carb scoops are sometimes mistaken for blower scoops but the presence or lack of a belt to drive the supercharger is one way to distinguish these scoops Both carb and blower scoops are sometimes called bugcatchers Like the shaker scoop both a blower scoop and a carb scoop will vibrate in response to engine motions because they are attached to the engine br Some aftermarket scoops include butterfly valves which act as secondary throttle bodies br br br Factory fitted br br Larry Shinoda of Ford is credited with introducing the shaker hood scoop as a factory fitted option and campaigning to make it functional first available exclusively for the model year Mustang equipped with the Cobra Jet engine the option was expanded to other Ford Mustang engines for and imitated quickly by competitors Chrysler Plymouth cuda and Dodge Challenger and Pontiac Firebird Trans Am which used a backwards facing scoop to draw air from the high pressure area at the base of the windshield Some official Chrysler literature referred to this popular hood style as the Incredible Quivering Exposed Cold Air Grabber This lengthy title has since been shortened by enthusiasts and collectors to the less tongue twisting shaker hood br br In the s factory fitted shaker scoops were reintroduced with the Ford Mustang Mach and Dodge Challenger Shaker package br br br Examples br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Such scoops were fitted to a variety of cars including br br Ford Mustang Cobra Jet br Boss Mustang br Plymouth Barracuda br Dodge Challenger br Ford Torino br Pontiac GTO br Pontiac Firebird Trans Am br Pontiac Can Am Grand Am br Ford Falcon XY GT Phase III br Ford Mustang Mach br br br
