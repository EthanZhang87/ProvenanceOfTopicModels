The Jaguar XK is a sports car manufactured by Jaguar between and It was Jaguar s first sports car since SS production ended in br The XK is a highly desirable model In Bonhams sold a matching numbers left hand drive alloy bodied roadster one of only for This marks the highest price achieved for an XK at auction thus far br br br History br The XK was launched in open two seater or US roadster form at the London Motor Show as a testbed and show car for the new Jaguar XK engine designed by Jaguar Chief Engineer William Heynes The display car was the first prototype chassis number It looked almost identical to the production cars except that the straight outer pillars of its windscreen were curved on the production version The sports car caused a sensation which persuaded Jaguar founder and Chairman William Lyons to put it into production br Beginning in the first cars were wood framed open seater bodies with aluminium panels Production switched to the cwt or lb kg heavier all steel in early The in the name referred to the aluminium car s mph km h top speed faster with the windscreen removed which made it the world s fastest production car at the time of its launch In the first production car chassis number was delivered to Clark Gable br br The XK was ultimately available in three body styles all two seaters and available either as Left LHD or Right Hand Drive RHD an open seater described in the US market as a roadster OTS a fixed head coup FHC from and a drophead coup DHC from Certain Special Equipment roadster and fixed head coupe cars were produced were sold between and as an early production build for enthusiasts denoted by an S preceding the chassis number br A version with a smaller engine litre cylinder designated the XK and intended for the UK market was cancelled prior to production br On May on the empty Ostend Jabbeke motorway in Belgium a prototype XK timed by the officials of the Royal Automobile Club of Belgium achieved an average of runs in opposing directions of mph with the windscreen replaced by just one small aero screen and a catalogued alternative top gear ratio and mph with a passenger side tonneau cover in place In and at Autodrome de Linas Montlh ry a banked oval track in France open XK s averaged over mph for hours and over mph for an hour In a fixed head coup took numerous world records for speed and distance when it averaged mph for a week br XK s were also highly successful in racing and rallying br br br Construction br br The first production XK s hand built with aluminium bodies on ash framing were constructed between late and early To meet demand and beginning with the model year all subsequent XK s were mass produced with pressed steel bodies Aluminium doors bonnet and boot lid were retained The DHC and FHC versions more luxuriously appointed than the constantly exposed open cars had wind up windows and wood veneers on the dashboard and interior door caps br The XK s steel chassis was mostly copied from the Jaguar Mark V using many of the same parts br br The dual overhead cam L straight XK engine was highly advanced for a mass produced unit of the time featuring a high temperature high strength aluminum alloy cylinder head hemispherical combustion chambers inclined valves and twin side draft SU carburetors Using octane fuel a standard compression ratio developed bhp kW Most of the early cars were exported a low compression version with commensurately reduced performance was reserved for the UK market where the post war austerity measures then in force restricted buyers to octane Pool petrol The Jaguar factory s access to octane fuel allowed it to provide cars with the higher compression ratio to the press enabling journalists to test the model s optimum performance in Belgium on a long straight stretch of road between Jabbeke and Ostend The XK engine s basic design by William Heynes later modified into and litre versions survived until br All XK s had independent Heynes designed torsion bar front suspension semi elliptic leaf springs at the rear recirculating ball steering telescopically adjustable steering column and all round inch drum brakes which were prone to fade Some cars were fitted with Alfin ALuminium FINned brake drums to help overcome the fade br br The open two seater provided little weather protection Its lightweight folding canvas top and detachable sidescreens stowed out of sight behind the seats The doors had no external handles they were opened by an interior pull cord accessed through a flap in the sidescreens when the weather equipment was in place The windscreen could be removed for aeroscreens to be fitted br br The drophead coup DHC had a padded lined canvas top which folded onto the rear deck behind the seats when retracted and roll up windows with opening quarter lights The flat glass two piece windscreen was set in a steel frame that was integrated with the body and painted the same colour Dashboards and door caps in both the DHC and the closed coup FHC were wood veneered whereas the open cars were leather trimmed All models had removable spats fender skirts in America covering the rear wheel arches which enhanced the streamlined look On cars fitted with optional centre lock wire wheels available from the spats were omitted as they gave insufficient clearance for the chromed two eared Rudge Whitworth knockoff hubs Chromium plated wire wheels were optional from Factory standard inch cross ply tyres were fitted on K solid wheels Pre with VR Pirelli Cinturato radial tyres available as a later option br In addition to wire wheels upgrades on the Special Equipment SE version called the M version for Modified in the United States included increased power stiffer suspension and dual exhaust system br br br Engine specifications br br br Performance br The Motor magazine road tested an XK in November This pre production car chassis number road registered as HKV was the first prototype built It was also the London Motor Show display model and had been driven by Prince Bira in the Silverstone Production Car Race When tested it had the compression ratio was fitted with an aerodynamic undertray and ran with hood and sidescreens in place The magazine reported a top speed of mph km h acceleration from mph km h in seconds and fuel consumption of miles per imperial gallon L km mpg US The car as tested cost including taxes br The XK M for US market accelerated from mph km h in seconds top speed was mph km h by the speedometer but actual top speed was about mph km h br br br Racing and rallying br XK s were active in racing and rallying br br br br First race victory In the Daily Express sponsored One Hour Production Car Race held on August at Silverstone Circuit England Leslie Johnson drove the Jabbeke car to the XK s first ever race victory despite an early collision with a spinning Jowett Javelin which dropped the Jaguar to fifth The car road registered HKV was converted to right hand drive for Silverstone Two other XK s took part One driven by Peter Walker finished second and the other driven by Prince Bira spun out of contention when a tyre punctured br br br br First victory in America In January Johnson also scored the model s first competition success in America winning the production class in a race at Palm Beach Shores Florida with the car that had finished second at Silverstone The Jaguar lost its brakes but finished fourth overall John Lea Jaguar s Experimental Department mechanic who attended the race reported The conditions at Palm Beach were wet windy and sandy Water and sand gained entry into the brake drums at the front and the mixture had the effect of accelerating the wear very considerably Our car finished with no linings and with the steel shoes bearing on the brake drums br Pebble Beach Cup In May XK s driven by Phil Hill and Don Parkinson finished first and second in this event at the inaugural Pebble Beach Road Races in br In Jaguar allocated six alloy bodied XK s to drivers Leslie Johnson Peter Walker Nick Haines Clemente Biondetti Ian Appleyard and Tommy Wisdom br br Le Mans Three of the allocated cars extensively modified entered the Le Mans Hours race Johnson who spearheaded this factory supported assault on the race with co driver Bert Hadley never ran lower than seventh place and held second for two hours but in the st hour had to retire from third place with clutch failure caused by using the gears to slow the car in the absence of brakes As a result the clutch was revised to a more robust design for production models The Jaguar had been closing the gap to leader Louis Rosier whose Talbot s pace was significantly slower at a rate that would have secured victory Haines with co driver Peter Clark finished th and Walker s car driven by Peter Whitehead and John Marshall was th The results convinced William Lyons and Chief Engineer William Heynes that it was worth investing in future success at Le Mans br Targa Florio Biondetti s car the first XK to contest the Targa Florio lay second to Alberto Ascari s Ferrari when a connecting rod broke ending the Jaguar s run br Mille Miglia Johnson took fifth place in the Mille Miglia with John Lea as his riding mechanic while Biondetti and co driver Gino Bronzoni finished eighth Fifth was an outstanding achievement for a production car with Johnson s Jaguar beaten only by Fangio s works Alfa Romeo and the works Ferraris of Serafini Bracco and winner Marzotto It was Jaguar s best ever finish in the Mille Miglia also the best by a British car and driver combination a feat that only Reg Parnell ever equalled driving an Aston Martin DB in br Silverstone Production Car Race Five XK s entered the race which Peter Walker won from Tony Rolt with Johnson recovering to eighth after spinning on oil Jaguar won the team prize br Tourist Trophy XK s also achieved a victory in the TT held at Dundrod in heavy rain On the eve of his st birthday Stirling Moss drove Tom Wisdom s car to a brilliant win ahead of Whitehead and Johnson and Jaguar once again took the team prize br br Alpine Rally Ian Appleyard s XK road registered as NUB won the Alpine Rally with his wife Pat who was the daughter of Sir William Lyons navigating They also won a coveted Coupe des Alpes br br br br Alpine Rally NUB and the Appleyards repeated their previous year s success br Tulip Rally The Appleyards took first place in the Tulip Rally with Swiss fighter pilot Rolf Habisreutinger s XK finishing second br br br br Alpine Rally Although the Appleyards XK did not win its third Alpine it completed the rally without incurring a single penalty point winning the first ever Coupe d Or Gold Cup br br br br Mount Druitt Hours Road Race On

banned from this series after this race br br br High speed runs and records br br br br mph km h through the flying mile in May Jaguar demonstrated an XK to the press on the high speed autoroute between Jabbeke and Aalter in Belgium The road was closed for the occasion The white left hand drive car chassis number was the second XK built Jaguar s development engineer Walter Hassan was to have driven but fell ill so Jaguar test driver Ron Soapy Sutton substituted With hood and sidescreens erected and the airflow under the car improved by the addition of a full length aluminium undertray the Jaguar was timed through the flying mile by the Royal Automobile Club of Belgium at mph km h With hood sidescreens and windscreen removed a metal airflow deflector fitted in front of the driver and a tonneau cover fastened over the passenger side of the cockpit the speed improved to mph km h The Observer s Book of Automobiles said it was the fastest production car in the world The Special
