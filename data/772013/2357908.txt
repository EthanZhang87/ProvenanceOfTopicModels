title: Automotive lighting
id: 2357908
A motor vehicle has lighting and signaling devices mounted to or integrated into its front rear sides and in some cases top Various devices have the dual function of illuminating the road ahead for the driver and making the vehicle visible to others with indications to them of turning slowing or stopping etc with lights also indicating the size of some large vehicles br Many emergency vehicles have distinctive lighting equipment to warn drivers of their presence br br br History br Early road vehicles used fuelled lamps before the availability of electric lighting The first Ford Model T used carbide lamps for headlights and oil lamps for tail lights It did not have all electric lighting as a standard feature until several years after its introduction Dynamos for automobile headlights were first fitted around and became commonplace in s automobiles br Trafficators signalling arms that flipped up which later were lighted were introduced in about Silent film star Florence Lawrence is credited with introducing an innovative version of the signalling arm in a predecessor to the modern turn signal and a mechanical brake signal She did not patent these inventions however and received no credit or profit from them Tail lights and brake lights were introduced around and by low beam or dipped beam headlights were available Sealed beam headlights were introduced in and standardized as the only acceptable type in the US in Self cancelling turn signals were developed in By headlights and signal lights were integrated into the body styling Halogen headlights were developed in Europe in High intensity discharge HID headlights were produced starting in In the first LED tail lights were installed on mass production automobiles with LED headlights subsequently being introduced in the s as more powerful LEDs became available br br br Colour of light emitted br The colour of light emitted by vehicle lights is largely standardized by established conventions first codified in the Geneva Convention on Road Traffic and later specified in the United Nations Vienna Convention on Road Traffic With some regional exceptions lights facing rearward must emit red light side facing lights and all turn signals must emit amber light and lights facing forward must emit white or selective yellow light No other colours are permitted except on emergency vehicles Vehicle lighting colour specifications can differ somewhat in countries that have not signed the and or Conventions examples include turn signals and side marker lights in North America as described in those lights sections later in this article br br br Forward illumination br Forward illumination is provided by high main full driving and low dip dipped passing beam headlights which may be augmented by auxiliary fog lights driving lights or cornering lights br br br Headlights br br br Low beam dipped beam passing beam meeting beam br br Low beam also called dipped beam passing beam or meeting beam headlights provide adequate forward and lateral illumination without dazzling other road users with excessive glare This beam is specified for use whenever other vehicles are present ahead br UN ECE regulations for dipped beam headlights specify a beam with a sharp asymmetric cut off the half of the beam closest to oncoming drivers is flat and low while the half of the beam closest to the outside of the road slopes up and towards the near side of the roadway This permits a functional compromise where it is possible to substantially prevent glare for oncoming drivers while still allowing adequate illumination for drivers to see pedestrians road signs hazards etc on their side of the road br The United States and Canada use proprietary FMVSS CMVSS standards instead of UN ECE regulations These standards contain regulations for dipped beam headlights that also specify a beam with a sharp asymmetric cut off the half of the beam closest to oncoming drivers is also flat and low but not as low as prescribed in UN ECE regulations The half of the beam closest to the outside of the road is also flat but higher than the half closest to oncoming vehicles This results in substantially increased glare for oncoming drivers and also poorer illumination of the near side of the roadway in comparison to headlights conforming to UN ECE regulations br br br High beam main beam driving beam full beam br br High beam also called main beam driving beam or full beam headlights provide an intense centre weighted distribution of light with no particular glare control Therefore they are only suitable for use when alone on the road as the glare they produce will dazzle other drivers br UN ECE Regulations permit higher intensity high beam headlights than allowed under U S and Canadian FMVSS CMVSS standards br br br Auxiliary lights br br br Driving lights br br Auxiliary high beam lights may be fitted to provide high intensity light to enable the driver to see at longer range than the vehicle s high beam headlights Such lights are most notably fitted on rally cars and are occasionally fitted to production vehicles derived from or imitating such cars They are common in countries with large stretches of unlit roads or in regions such as the Nordic countries that receive fewer daylight hours during winter br Driving light is a term hailing from the early days of night time driving when it was relatively rare to encounter an opposing vehicle Only on occasions when opposing drivers passed each other would the low dipped or passing beam be used The high beam was therefore known as the driving beam and this terminology is still found in international UN Regulations which do not distinguish between a vehicle s primary mandatory and auxiliary optional upper driving beam lights The driving light term has been supplanted in US regulations by the functionally descriptive term auxiliary high beam light br Many countries regulate the installation and use of driving lights For example in Russia each vehicle may have no more than three pairs of driving lights including the original lights and in Paraguay auxiliary driving lights must be off and covered with opaque material when the vehicle is operated in urban areas br br br Front fog lights br br Front fog lights provide a wide bar shaped beam of light with a sharp cutoff at the top and are generally aimed and mounted low They may produce white or selective yellow light and were designed for use at low speed to increase the illumination directed towards the road surface and verges in conditions of poor visibility due to fog dust or snow br br They are sometimes used in place of dipped beam headlights reducing glare from fog or falling snow although the legality of using front fog lights without low beam headlights varies by jurisdiction br In most countries weather conditions rarely necessitate the use of front fog lights and there is no legal requirement for them so their primary purpose is frequently cosmetic They are often available as optional extras or only on higher trim levels of many cars Since as early as the s several car manufacturers have noticeably omitted the front fog lights from many of their latest models as more recent high tech lighting technologies such as DRLs and LEDs connected to automatic high beam systems negate the use of fog lights However some manufacturers who still offer fog lights as standard equipment in certain model trims have diversified its use to function also as an automatic lighting delay for vehicles to light up surroundings and roadside curbs after being parked br An SAE study has shown that in the United States more people inappropriately use their fog lights in dry weather than use them properly in poor weather Because of this use of the fog lights when visibility is not seriously reduced is often prohibited in most jurisdictions for example in Australia The driver of a vehicle must not use any fog light fitted to the vehicle unless the driver is driving in fog mist or under other atmospheric conditions that restrict visibility br The respective purposes of front fog lights and driving lights are often confused due in part to the misconception that fog lights are always selective yellow while any auxiliary light that makes white light is a driving light Automakers and aftermarket parts and accessories suppliers frequently refer interchangeably to fog lights and driving lights or fog driving lights br br br Cornering lights br br On some models cornering lights provide steady intensity white light for lateral illumination in the direction of an intended turn or lane change They are generally actuated in conjunction with the turn signals and they may be wired to also illuminate when the vehicle is shifted into reverse gear Some modern vehicles activate the cornering light on one or the other side when the steering wheel input reaches a predetermined angle in that direction regardless of whether a turn signal has been activated br American technical standards contain provisions for front cornering lights as well as rear cornering lights Cornering lights have traditionally been prohibited under international UN Regulations though provisions have recently been made to allow them as long as they are only operable when the vehicle is travelling at less than kilometres per hour about mph br br br Spotlights br Police cars emergency vehicles and vehicles competing in road rallies are sometimes equipped with an auxiliary spotlight sometimes called an alley light in a swivel mounted housing attached to one or both A pillars aimed by a handle protruding through the pillar into the vehicle br br br Conspicuity signal and identification lights br Conspicuity devices are lights and reflectors that make a vehicle conspicuous and visible with respect to its presence position direction of travel change in direction or deceleration Such lights may light steadily blink or flash depending on their intended and regulated function Most must be fitted in pairs one left and one right though some vehicles have multiple pairs such as two left and two right stop lights and or redundant light sources such as one left and one right stop light each containing two bulbs br br br Front br br br Front position lights br br Front position lights known as parking lights in North America and front sidelights in the UK provide nighttime standing vehicle conspicuity They are designed to use little electricity so they can be left on when parked for prolonged periods of time Despite the UK term these are not the same as the side marker lights described below The front position lights on any vehicle must emit white light with the exception of motorcycles which may have amber front position lights In the US Canada Mexico Iceland Japan New Zealand and Australia only if combined with a side marker South Korea North Korea Vietnam China Thailand Cambodia Laos and much of the Middle East they may emit amber light on any vehicle The city light terminology for front position lights derives from the practice formerly adhered to in cities like Moscow London and Paris of driving at night in urban areas using these low intensity lights rather than the vehicle s headlights br In Germany the StVZO Road Traffic Licensing Regulations calls for a different function provided by these lights with the vehicle s ignition switched off the operator may activate a low intensity white light at the front and red light at the rear on either the left or right side This function is used when parking in narrow unlit streets to provide parked vehicle conspicuity to approaching drivers This function which is optional under UN and US regulations is served passively in the United States by mandatory side marker retroreflectors br br br Daytime running lights br br br Installation br br Some countries permit or require vehicles to be equipped with daytime running lights DRLs Depending on the regulations of the country for which the vehicle is built these may be functionally dedicated lights or the function may be provided by the low beam or high beam headlights the front turn signals or the front fog lights br Passenger cars and small delivery vans first type approved to UN Regulation on or after February and large vehicles trucks and buses type approved since August must be equipped with DRLs Functional piggybacking such as using the headlights front turn signals or fog lights as DRLs is not permitted the EU Directive requires functionally specific daytime running lights compliant with UN Regulation and mounted to the vehicle in accord with UN Regulation br Prior to the DRL mandate countries requiring daytime lights permitted low beam headlights to provide that function National regulations in Canada Sweden Norway Slovenia Finland Iceland and Denmark require hardwired automatic DRL systems of varying specification DRLs are permitted in many countries where they are not required but prohibited in other countries not requiring them br Front side and rear position lights are permitted required or forbidden to illuminate in combination with daytime running lights depending on the jurisdiction and the DRL implementation Likewise according to jurisdictional regulations DRLs mounted within a certain distance of turn signals are permitted or required to extinguish or dim down to parking light intensity individually when the adjacent turn signal is operating br br br Intensity and colour br UN Regulation stipulates that DRLs must emit white light with an intensity of at least candela on axis and no more than candela in any direction br In the US daytime running lights may emit either amber or white light and may produce up to candela This has provoked a large number of complaints about glare br br br Dim dip lights br UK regulations briefly required vehicles first used on or after April to be equipped with a dim dip device or special low intensity running lights except such vehicles as complying fully with UN Regulation regarding the installation of lighting equipment A dim dip device operates the dipped beam headlights at between and of normal low beam intensity Running lights permitted as an alternative to dim dip were required to emit at least candela straight ahead and no more than candela in any direction In practice most vehicles were equipped with the dim dip option rather than dedicated running lights br The dim dip systems were not intended for daytime use as DRLs Rather they operated if the engine was running and the driver switched on the position lights called sidelights in the UK Dim dip was intended to provide a nighttime town beam with intensity between that of contemporary parking lights commonly used in city traffic after dark and dipped beams the former were considered insufficiently intense to provide improved conspicuity in conditions requiring it while the latter were considered too glaring for safe use in built up areas The UK was the only country to require such dim dip systems though vehicles so equipped were sold in other Commonwealth countries with left hand traffic br In the European Commission successfully prosecuted the UK government in the European Court of Justice arguing that the UK requirement for dim dip was illegal under EC directives prohibiting member states from enacting vehicle lighting requirements not contained in pan European EC directives As a result the UK requirement for dim dip was quashed Nevertheless dim dip systems remain permitted and while such systems are not presently as common as they once were dim dip functionality was fitted on many new cars well into the s br br br Lateral br br br Side marker lights and reflectors br br In the United States amber front and red rear side marker lights and retroreflectors are required The law initially required lights or retroreflectors on vehicles manufactured after January This was amended to require lights and retroreflectors on vehicles manufactured after January These side facing devices make the vehicle s presence position and direction of travel clearly visible from oblique angles The lights are wired to illuminate whenever the vehicles parking lights and tail lights are on including when the headlights are being used Front amber side markers in the United States may be wired to flash in synchronous phase or opposite phase with the turn signals nevertheless they are not required to flash at all Side markers are permitted but not required on cars and light passenger vehicles outside the United States and Canada If installed they are required to be brighter and visible through a larger horizontal angle than US side markers may flash only in synchronous phase with the turn signals but are not required to flash and they must be amber at the front and rear except rear side markers may be red if they are grouped combined or reciprocally incorporated with another rear lighting function that is required to be red br Australian Design Rule provides for two different kinds of side marker light a type for trucks and other large vehicles producing amber light to the front and red to the rear with no requirement to emit light to the side intended for showing the overall length of long vehicles from in front and behind a combination and the U S type amber front red rear lights for passenger cars br Side marker lights can be seen as the successor to cowl lights used on vehicles during the s to s which were a pair of small lights installed at the top edges of the cowl between the hood and the windshield and would serve as a reference point for oncoming traffic where the widest part of the body was These were sometimes used in tandem with fender lights during the same time period when fenders were separate from the body and only covered the wheels br br br Turn signals br br Direction indicator lights or turn signals informally known as directional signals directionals blinkers or indicators are blinking lights mounted near the left and right front and rear corners of a vehicle and sometimes on the sides or on the side mirrors of a vehicle where they are called repeaters They are activated by the driver on one side of the vehicle at a time to advertise intent to turn or change lanes towards that side or used simultaneously as a hazard warning signal to warn other drivers of a vehicle parked on the road see below br For many years turn signals on off operation was activated by a thermal flasher unit which used a heating element leaf spring and a bimetallic strip When activated by the stalk switch on the steering column the signal lights and heating element turned on The heat caused the bimetallic strip to bend such that it threw the leaf spring over centre opening the circuit and breaking power to the heating element and the signal lights When the bimetallic strip cooled down it would pull the leaf spring back over centre in the other direction closing the contacts and again sending power to the lights and heating element The cycle would repeat until the power to the thermal flasher was switched off by the stalk switch br Thermal flashers gradually gave way to electromechanical relays one of many control strategies with relay type flashers is to use a relaxation oscillator chip to generate square waves to the relay coil causing the relay contacts to open and close br Modern cars now use a relaxation oscillator and solid state relay built into the body control module to flash the lights and use speakers to produce the distinctive clicking sound associated with turn signals which was previously made by a relay or the leaf spring in a thermal flasher If the stalk switch is not moved beyond the fixed left right position and allowed to flip back the control module will only flash the lights three times br br br History br Electric turn signal lights date from as early as Possibly the first factory installation of illuminated turn signals was on the Talbot as well as the and which used them at the front as well as at the rear from until The modern flashing turn signal was patented in and shortly after most major automobile manufacturers offered this optional feature before it became mandatory in As of most countries require turn signals on all new vehicles that are driven on public roadways Alternative systems of hand signals were used earlier and remain common for bicycles Hand signals are also sometimes used when regular vehicle lights are malfunctioning or for older vehicles without turn signals br br Some cars from about to through used retractable semaphores called trafficators rather than flashing lights They were commonly mounted high up behind the front doors and swung out to a horizontal position They were fragile and could be easily broken off and also had a tendency to stick in the closed or open position They could be fitted with a fixed or flashing light br After turn signals were introduced regulations were brought in requiring them and laying out specifications that had to be met Ultimately standards governed minimum and maximum permissible intensity levels minimum horizontal and vertical angles of visibility and minimum illuminated surface area to ensure that they are visible at all relevant angles do not dazzle those who view them and are suitably conspicuous in all conditions ranging from full darkness to full direct sunlight br br br Side turn signals br br In most countries cars must be equipped with side mounted turn signal repeaters to make the turn indication visible laterally i e to the sides of the vehicle rather than just to the front and rear of the vehicle These are permitted but not required in the United States and Canada As an alternative in both the United States and Canada the front amber side marker lights may be wired to flash with the turn signals but this is not mandatory Mercedes Benz introduced side turn signal repeaters integrated into the side view mirrors in starting with its facelifted E Class W Since then many automakers have been incorporating side turn signal devices into the mirror housings rather than mounting them on the vehicle s fenders Some evidence suggests that mirror mounted turn signals may be more effective than fender mounted ones br br br Electrical connection and switching br br Turn signals are required to blink on and off or flash at a steady rate of between and pulses per minute Hz International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite phase An audio and or visual tell tale indicator is required to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating This usually takes the form of one green light on the dashboard on cars from the s or older or two green indicator lights on cars from the s to the present and a rhythmic ticking sound generated electromechanically or electronically by the flasher It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster or slower than normal flashing in the event a turn signal light fails br Turn signals are in almost every case activated by a horizontal stalk protruding from the side of the steering column though on some vehicles it protrudes from the dashboard The driver raises or lowers the outboard end of the stalk in accord with the clockwise or anticlockwise direction the steering wheel is about to be turned br In left hand drive vehicles the turn indicator stalk is usually located to the left of the steering wheel In right hand drive vehicles there is less consistency it may be located to the left or to the right of the steering wheel Regulations do not specify a mandatory location for the turn signal control only that it be visible and operable by the driver and at least in North America that it be labelled with a specific symbol if it is not located on the left side of the steering column The international UN Regulations do not include analogous specifications br Virtually all vehicles except many motorcycles and commercial semi tractors have a turn indicator self cancelling feature that returns the lever to the neutral no signal position as the steering wheel approaches the straight ahead position after a turn has been made Beginning in the late s using the direction indicator lights to signal for a lane change was facilitated by the addition of a spring loaded momentary signal on position just shy of the left and right detents The signal operates for however long the driver holds the lever partway towards the left or right turn signal detent Some vehicles have an automatic lane change indication feature tapping the lever partway towards the left or right signal position and immediately releasing it causes the applicable turn indicators to flash three to five times br Some transit buses such as those in New York have turn signals activated by floor mounted momentary contact footswitches on the floor near the driver s left foot on left hand drive buses The foot activated signals allow bus drivers to keep both hands on the steering wheel while watching the road and scanning for passengers as they approach a bus stop New York City Transit bus drivers among others are trained to step continuously on the right directional switch while servicing a bus stop to signal other road users they are intentionally dwelling at the stop allowing following buses to skip that stop This method of signalling requires no special arrangements for self cancellation or passing br br br Sequential turn signals br br Sequential turn signals are a feature on some cars wherein the turn signal function is provided by multiple lit elements that illuminate sequentially rather than simultaneously The visual effect is one of outward motion in the direction of the intended turn or lane change Sequential turn signals were factory fitted to model Ford Thunderbirds Mercury Cougars Shelby Mustangs between and Imperials the Japanese market Nissan Cedric Nissan Laurel and Nissan Bluebird some Volkswagen Audi SEAT koda and Porsche models Toyota C HR some Peugeots and Ford Mustangs since br Two different systems were employed The earlier fitted to the through Ford built cars and the Nissan Cedric employed an electric motor driving through reduction gearing a set of three slow turning cams These cams would actuate switches to turn on the lights in sequence Later Ford cars and the Imperial used a transistorised control module with no moving parts to wear break or go out of adjustment br FMVSS has been officially interpreted as requiring all light sources in an active turn signal to illuminate simultaneously Some vehicles such as the and later Ford Mustang are designed such that the first lit segment of the multi unit light is considered as the official turn signal with the segments illuminated afterward considered as auxiliary lights Other US vehicles with sequential turn signals comply by illuminating all elements of the turn signal simultaneously before sequentially turning them off br br br Turn signal colour br br Until the early s most front turn signals worldwide emitted white light and most rear turn signals emitted red light The American auto industry voluntarily adopted amber front turn signals for most vehicles beginning in the model year though the advent of amber signals was accompanied by legal stumbles in some states and front turn signals were still legally permitted to emit white light until FMVSS took effect for the model year whereupon amber became the only permissible front turn signal colour Currently most countries outside the United States and Canada require that all front side and rear turn signals produce amber light br br In Belgium Brazil Canada the GCC countries Israel Luxembourg the Netherlands Switzerland and the US the rear signals may be amber or red Additionally red turn signals can also be found in countries with trade agreements with the US such as Mexico and South Korea and New Zealand Proponents of red rear turn signals have claimed that they are less costly to manufacture and automakers use the turn signal colour as a styling element to differentiate vehicles of different model years Proponents of amber rear turn signals say they are more easily discernible as turn signals It has been recognised since the s that amber turn signals are more quickly spotted than red ones A US study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests vehicles with amber rear signals rather than red ones are up to less likely to be involved in certain kinds of collisions a followup NHTSA study determined there to be a significant overall safety benefit to amber rather than red rear turn signals US studies in the early s demonstrated improvements in the speed and accuracy of drivers reactions to the stop lights of vehicles ahead when the turn signals were amber rather than red and NHTSA determined in that amber rear turn signals can be provided at comparable cost to red ones br There is some evidence that turn signals with colourless clear lenses and amber bulbs may be less conspicuous in bright sunlight than those with amber lenses and colourless bulbs br br br Colour durability br br The amber bulbs commonly used in turn signals with colourless lenses are no longer made with cadmium glass since various regulations worldwide including the European RoHS directive banned cadmium because of its toxicity Amber glass made without cadmium is relatively costly so most amber bulbs are now made with clear glass dipped in an amber coating With accumulated heat cool cycles though some of these coatings may flake off the bulb glass or the colour may fade This causes the turn signal to emit white light rather than the required amber light br The international regulation on motor vehicle bulbs requires manufacturers to test bulbs for colour endurance However no test protocol or colour durability requirement is specified Discussion is ongoing within the Groupe des Rapporteurs d clairage the UNECE working group on vehicular lighting regulation to develop and implement a colour durability standard br Rather than using an amber bulb some signal lights contain an inner amber plastic enclosure between a colourless bulb and the colourless outer lens br br br Rear br br br Rear position lights tail lights br br Conspicuity for the rear of a vehicle is provided by rear position lights also called tail lights These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lights are lit including when the headlights are on Rear position lights may be combined with the vehicle s stop lights or be separate from them In combined function installations the lights produce brighter red light as stop lights and dimmer red light as rear position lights Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright stop and dim position modes so that a vehicle displaying rear position lights will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lights and vice versa br br br Stop lights brake lights br br Red steadily lit rear lights brighter than the rear position lights are activated when the driver applies the vehicle s brakes and warn vehicles behind to prepare to stop These are formally called stop lamps in technical standards and regulations and in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic though they are often informally called brake lights They are required to be fitted in multiples of two symmetrically at the left and right edges of the rear of every vehicle International UN regulations No specify a range of acceptable intensity for a stop light of to candela In North America where the UN regulations are not recognised the acceptable range for a single compartment stop light is to candela br br br Center high mount stop lamp CHMSL br In the United States and Canada since in Australia and New Zealand since and in Europe and other countries applying UN Regulation since a central stop brake light mounted higher than the vehicle s left and right stop lights is also required The so called centre high mount stop lamp or CHMSL pronounced is sometimes informally called the centre brake light the third brake light the eye level brake light the safety brake light or the high level brake light The CHMSL may use one or more filament bulbs or LEDs or a strip of neon tubing as its light source br The CHMSL is intended to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle s left and right stop lights is blocked by interceding vehicles It also provides a redundant stop light signal in the event of a stop light malfunction In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights br The CHMSL is generally required to illuminate steadily and not permitted to flash though US regulators granted Mercedes Benz a temporary month exemption in January to the steady light requirement to evaluate whether a flashing CHMSL provides an emergency stop signal that effectively reduces the likelihood of a crash br br On passenger cars the CHMSL may be placed above the back glass affixed to the vehicle s interior just inside the back glass or integrated into the vehicle s deck lid or into a spoiler Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the spare wheel carrier Trucks vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle s roof The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle though UN Regulation permits lateral offset of up to cm if the vehicle s lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel but instead separates movable components such as doors Such an offset can be seen on the third generation Renault Master and first generation Ford Transit Connect vans The height of the CHMSL is also regulated both in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle s conventional left and right stop lights Depending on the left and right lights height the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lights upper edge br The Volkswagen Bus was equipped with only one stop light mounted centrally and higher than the left and right rear lights which did not produce a stop light function The Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high mounted stop and turn signal lights integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the rear glass The Oldsmobile Toronado from to and the Buick Riviera from to had similar dual high mounted supplemental stop turn lights as standard equipment these were located on the outside of the vehicle below the bottom of the rear glass This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time Car and lighting manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high mount supplemental stop lights in the early s but this effort too failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support br Effective with the model year the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada mandated that all new passenger cars come equipped with a CHMSL The requirement was extended to light trucks and vans for the model year Early studies involving taxicabs and other fleet vehicles found that a third high level stop light reduced rear end collisions by about Once the novelty effect wore off as most vehicles on the road came to be equipped with a CHMSL the crash avoidance benefit declined However said benefit has not declined to zero and a CHMSL has become so inexpensive to incorporate into a vehicle that it remains a cost effective collision avoidance feature even at the long term enduring crash reduction benefit of br A NHTSA report suggests that a vehicle equipped with a CHMSL has less risk to be involved as a lead vehicle in a chain collision and less risk to be involved as a middle vehicle in such a collision br br br Emergency stop signal ESS br Emergency stop signalling is a lighting function wherein the vehicle s stop brake lights and or hazard turn indicators flash in phase at to Hz under heavy or urgent braking The emergency stop signal is automatically activated if the vehicle speed is greater than km h mph and the emergency braking logic defined by regulation No heavy vehicles H light vehicles or motorcycles is activated the ESS may be displayed when a light vehicle s deceleration is greater than m s ft s or a heavy vehicle s deceleration is greater than m s ft s and the ESS must be discontinued once the vehicle s deceleration drops below m s ft s br In February members of the European Parliament approved rules making emergency stop signals mandatory on new vehicles sold in the European Union br Toyota Mercedes Benz Volvo and BMW were among the earlier automakers to begin equipping vehicles with ESS In Kia introduced the concept on some of their Australian market models br Other methods of severe braking indication have also been implemented some Volvo models make the stop lights brighter and some BMWs have Adaptive Brake Lights that effectively increase the size of the stop lights under severe braking by illuminating them at brighter than normal intensity As long as the brighter than normal stop lights are within the regulated maximum intensity for stop lights in general this kind of implementation does not require specific regulatory approval since the stop lights continue to operate in accord with general stop light regulations br The idea behind such emergency braking indicator systems is to catch following drivers attention with increased urgency However there remains considerable debate over whether the system offers a measurable increase in safety To date studies of vehicles with ESS have not shown significant improvement The systems used by BMW Volvo and Mercedes differ not only in operational mode growing vs intensifying vs flashing respectively but also in such parameters as the deceleration threshold of activation Data is being collected and analyzed in an effort to determine how such a system might be implemented to maximize a safety benefit if such a benefit can be realized with visual emergency braking displays An experimental study at the University of Toronto has tested stop lights which gradually and continuously grow in illuminated area with increasing braking br The ESS is not expensive because it reuses existing warning and stop signals br One potential problem with flashing stop lights in the United States and Canada is regulations that permit flashing stop lights to be used as rear turn signal and hazard lights in lieu of separate dedicated lights br br br Rear fog lights br br In Europe and other countries adhering to UN Regulation vehicles must be equipped with one or two bright red rear fog lamps which serve as high intensity rear position lights to be activated in poor visibility conditions to make the vehicle more visible from the rear The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog light is to candela within the range of a US stop light Rear fog lights are not required equipment in the US but they are permitted and they are found almost exclusively on European brand vehicles in North America Audi Jaguar Mercedes Benz Mini Land Rover Porsche Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models Some vehicles from non European brands which are adaptions of European market offerings such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect have come standard with rear fog lights or vehicles with European market counterparts such as the second generation Chrysler have an option for them The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment br br Most jurisdictions permit rear fog lights to be installed either singly or in pairs If a single rear fog is fitted most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver s side of the vehicle s centreline whichever side is the prevailing driver s side in the country in which the vehicle is registered This is to maximise the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog light In many cases a single reversing light is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle positionally symmetrical with the rear fog If two rear fog lights are fitted they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle s centreline Proponents of twin rear fog lights say two lights provide vehicle distance information not available from a single light Proponents of the single rear fog light say dual rear fog lights closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lights which are mandatorily installed in pairs reducing the conspicuity of the stop lights message when the rear fogs are activated To provide some safeguard against rear fog lights being confused with stop lights UN Regulation requires a separation of at least cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop light and any rear fog light br br br Reversing backup lights br br To warn adjacent vehicle operators and pedestrians of a vehicle s rearward motion and to provide illumination to the rear when reversing each vehicle must be equipped with one or two rear mounted rear facing reversing or backup lights br Reversing lights are required to produce white light by US and international UN regulations However some countries have at various times permitted amber reversing lights In Australia and New Zealand for example vehicle manufacturers were faced with the task of localizing American cars originally equipped with combination red brake turn signal lights and white reversing lights Those countries regulations permitted the amber rear turn signals to light up steadily as reversing lights so automakers and importers were able to combine the mandatorily amber rear turn signal and optionally amber reversing light function and so comply with the regulations without the need for additional lighting devices Both countries now require white reversing lights and the combination amber turn reverse light is no longer permitted on new vehicles The US state of Washington currently permits reversing lights to emit white or amber light br Some car models have white reversing lights in the front turn indicators that switch on with the rear reversing lights br br br Rear registration plate light br The rear registration plate is illuminated either by a single or a pair of yellow or white light s affixed within the indentation of the trunk or bumper It is designed to light the surface of the plate without creating light directly visible to the rear of the vehicle and must be illuminated whenever the position lights are lit br br br On large vehicles br Large vehicles such as trucks and buses are in many cases required to carry additional lighting devices beyond those required on passenger vehicles The specific requirements vary according to the regulations in force where the vehicle is registered br br br Identification lights br In the US and Canada vehicles over inches m wide must be equipped with three amber front and three red rear identification lights spaced inches cm apart at the centre of the front and rear of the vehicle as high as practicable The front identification lights are typically mounted atop the cab of the vehicle The purpose of these lights is to alert other drivers to the presence of a wide and usually tall vehicle br br br End outline marker lights br br UN Regulation requires vehicles exceeding metres in in width to be equipped with white front and red rear end outline marker lights on both the left and right which like North American identification lights are intended to indicate a vehicle s overall width and height The front clearance lights may be amber in Australia and New Zealand br br br Intermediate side marker lights and reflectors br US and Canadian regulations require large vehicles to be equipped with amber side marker lights and reflectors mounted midway between the front and rear side markers Australian Design Rule provides for side marker lights on trucks and other large vehicles producing amber light to the front and red to the rear with no requirement to emit light to the side br br br Rear overtake lights br br Until about the s in France Spain Morocco and possibly other countries many commercial vehicles and some Soviet Sovtransavto road trains had a green light mounted on the rear offside This could be operated by the driver to indicate that it was safe for the following vehicle to overtake br br br Emergency warning devices br br br Hazard warning signal br br The hazard warning signal sometimes called hazard warning flashers hazard warning lights emergency lights way flashers hazards or flashers is provided by flashing all of a vehicle s left and right turn signals simultaneously and in phase Hazard warning signals first appeared as aftermarket accessories in the early s by the late s regulations around the world came to require all new vehicles to be so equipped Operation of the hazard flashers must be from a control independent of the turn signal control and an audiovisual tell tale must be provided to the driver br This function is meant to indicate a hazard such as a vehicle stopped in or near moving traffic a disabled vehicle a vehicle moving substantially slower than the flow of traffic such as a truck climbing a steep grade the presence of stopped or slow traffic ahead on a high speed road and or the presence of stopped or slow traffic ahead on unpredictable natural disasters like earthquakes floods landslides br In vehicles with separate left and right green turn signal tell tale on the dashboard both left and right indicators may flash to provide a visual indication of the hazard flashers operation In vehicles with a single green turn signal tell tale on the dashboard a separate red tell tale must be provided for hazard flasher indication Because the hazard flasher function operates the vehicle s left and right turn signals a left or a right turn signal function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating br Apart from its use as emergency lighting a single flash of the hazard lights is used to show gratitude to yielding drivers in several countries However in the United Kingdom they must not be used except to warn others of either a temporary obstruction when the vehicle is stationary or a hazard ahead on a dual carriageway with a speed limit of at least mph br br br Retroreflectors br br Retroreflectors also called reflex reflectors produce no light of their own but rather reflect incident light towards its source such as another driver s headlights They are regulated as automotive lighting devices and specified to account for the separation between a vehicle s headlights and its driver s eyes Thus vehicles can remain conspicuous even with their lights off Regulations worldwide require all vehicles and trailers to be equipped with rear facing red retroreflectors in countries where UN Regulation No is applied these must be triangular on trailers and non triangular on vehicles other than trailers Since US regulations also require side facing retroreflectors amber in front and red in the rear Sweden South Africa and other countries have at various times required white front facing retroreflectors br br br Variable intensity signal lights br International UN Regulations explicitly permit vehicle signal lights with intensity automatically increased during bright daylight hours when sunlight reduces the effectiveness of the stop lights and automatically decreased during hours of darkness when glare could be a concern Regulations in the US and by the UN contain provisions for determining the minimum and maximum acceptable intensity for lights that contain more than a single light source br br br Experimental systems br br br Multicolour auxiliary signals br Some jurisdictions such as the US states of Washington Oregon and Idaho permit vehicles to be equipped with auxiliary rear signal systems displaying green light when the accelerator is depressed yellow light when the vehicle is coasting and red light when the brake is depressed Such systems have in the past been sold as aftermarket accessories but are today seldom seen in traffic br br br Front brake lights br Since the late s there have been proposals to introduce a front mounted brake light where green or blue lights would indicate to pedestrians at crossings that an approaching vehicle is slowing down A small subjective survey was undertaken in the US in br In the idea was suggested by Slovakian Lubomir Marjak of manufacturing company Lumaco which makes front brake lights to German EU parliamentarian Dieter Lebrecht Koch Field tests were done in Germany in as well as in Slovakia in and More tests are planned in Italy Expert analysts have found severe flaws in these tests and the accompanying safety claims br Front brake lights were demonstrated in concept cars including the Explorer IV and the and Explorer V designed by Rohm Haas to showcase the potential applications for their plexiglas material as well as in the GFG Style Sibylla GG designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and shown at the Mondial Paris Motor Show in The only production car to feature a built in front brake light as of was the Bricklin SV of br br br Research and development br The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration among other bodies has commissioned studies of vehicle signal systems and configurations to determine the most promising avenues and best practices for enhanced crash avoidance via optimized vehicle conspicuity and signal lighting systems br br br Interior and convenience lights br Most cars have at least one dome light or courtesy light located in or near the ceiling of the passenger compartment to provide illumination by which to fasten seatbelts and enter or exit the car These often have an option to automatically switch on when the front or any passenger doors are opened Many vehicles have expanded this feature causing the overhead interior light to remain on after all doors are closed allowing passengers to fasten seat belts with added illumination The extended lighting cycle usually ends when the vehicle s ignition has begun or a gradual reduction in light emitted after a couple of minutes if the car is not started called theater lighting Interior lighting has been added on some vehicles at the bottom edge of the dashboard illuminating the floor for front passengers or underneath the front seats at the rear illuminating the floor for rear passengers This type of convenience lighting approach is also sometimes used to illuminate interior or exterior door handles exterior step running boards or electric window switches br LED light sources appear increasingly as interior convenience lights in various locations especially with finely focused lighting on console control surfaces and in cabin storage areas br Map lights are aimed at specific passenger positions and allow for reading without glare distraction to the driver Some vehicles have approach lighting or puddle lights lights that illuminate the ground outside the doors in the exterior mirrors or lower edges of the doors as well as interior lighting activated via key fob Many cars have lights in the trunk the engine compartment the glove box and other storage compartments Modern pickup trucks usually have one or more white cargo lights that illuminate the bed of the truck often controlled in conjunction with the interior dome lighting br Most gauges and controls on a dashboard in modern vehicles are illuminated when the headlights are turned on and the intensity of light can be adjusted by the driver for comfort Saab automobiles for example have an aircraft style night panel function that shuts off all interior illumination save for the speedometer unless attention is called to a critical situation on another gauge to improve the driver s night vision br br br On service vehicles br br br Emergency vehicle lights br br Emergency vehicles such as fire engines ambulances police cars snow removal vehicles and tow trucks are usually equipped with intense warning lights of particular colours These may be motorised rotating beacons xenon strobes or arrays of LEDs br The prescribed colours differ by jurisdiction in most countries blue and red special warning lights are used on police fire and medical emergency vehicles In the United States and some other jurisdictions amber lights are for tow trucks private security personnel construction vehicles and other nonofficial special service vehicles while volunteer firefighters use red blue or green depending on jurisdiction In the US it is a violation of the DOT Department of Transportation Uniform Vehicle Code for any non emergency vehicle Police Fire Ambulance to operate forward facing red lights of any kind Cars in the US only have red tail lights and no blue lights a vehicle displaying a red forward facing light flashing or not coming towards a driver or from behind the driver in rearview mirror indicates that an official emergency vehicle is coming requiring the driver to yield pull off to the side of the road or otherwise get out of its way Some US states allow emergency vehicles to have blue lights that can be turned on to warn drivers of an emergency vehicle in action blue and red lights can be combined forward and or rear facing In the UK doctors may use green warning lights although these do not allow the user to claim any exemption from road traffic regulations compared to the blue lights used by statutory emergency services when responding to calls Special warning lights usually amber are also sometimes mounted on slow or wide vehicles such as mobile cranes excavators tractors and even mobility scooters in certain conditions br br br Taxi displays br br Standard taxicabs for street hire are distinguished by special lights affixed to the vehicle s roof in accordance with local regulations br They may have an illuminated Taxi sign a light to signal that they are ready to take passengers or off duty or an emergency panic light the driver can activate in the event of a robbery to alert passersby to call the police Depending on local regulations the Taxi sign may also be required to display a number identifying the vehicle br br br Light sources br br br Incandescent lights br The incandescent light bulb was for a long time the only light source used in automotive lighting Incandescent bulbs are still commonly used in turn signals to stop hyper flashing of the turn signal flashers Many types of bulbs have been used Standardized type numbers are used by manufacturers to identify bulbs with the same specifications Bases may be bayonet type with one or two contacts plastic or glass wedges or dual wire loops or ferrules used on tubular festoon lights Screw base lights are never used in automobile applications due to their loosening under vibration Signal lights with internal or external coloured lenses use colourless bulbs conversely lights with colourless lenses may use red or amber bulbs to provide light of the required colours for the various functions br Typically bulbs of to watts producing to lumens to mean spherical candlepower are used for stop turn reversing and rear fog lights while bulbs of to W producing to lm to mscp are used for tail lights parking lights side marker lights and side turn signal repeaters br Tungsten halogen lights are a very common light source for headlights and other forward illumination functions Some recent vehicles use small halogen bulbs for exterior signalling and marking functions as well The first halogen light approved for automotive use was the H which used Watts producing lumens and was introduced in Europe in br br br Light emitting diodes LED br br Since light emitting diodes LEDs have increasingly been used in automotive lighting They offer a very long service life extreme vibration resistance high colour durability high efficiency lumen Watt and can benefit from considerably more compact packaging compared to most bulb type assemblies LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in stop lights when power is applied they rise to full intensity approximately milliseconds second faster than incandescent bulbs This effectively instant rise time theoretically provides following drivers more time to react to the stop light signal but has not been shown to make cars with LED stop lights less likely to be struck from behind br LEDs were first applied to automotive lighting in centre high mount stop lamps CHMSLs beginning with the Chevrolet Corvette Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates The first car registered to drive on the road with full LED rear lights was Land Rover s LCV concept car in the s At the time the only light function that was difficult to reproduce was the reverse light as white LEDs did not yet exist The reverse function was only achievable with the introduction of blue LEDs by mixing red green and blue LEDs in a defined distributed pattern behind a lens white light was produced that conformed to the legal requirements of a reverse light br In North America the Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights The Kia Opirus was an early adopter of LED front turn signals The Audi R used two strips of optically focused high intensity LEDs for its daytime running lights Optional on the R outside North America were the world s first LED headlights made by AL Automotive Lighting The low and high beams along with the position parking light and front turn signal all use LEDs The Lexus LS h features LED low beam position and side marker lights in North America and the Cadillac Escalade Platinum used LEDs for the low and high beams as well as for the position and side marker lights The Mercedes Benz S Class W used entirely LED lights even in the most basic trim level br LED lights are used for flashing beacon lights on vehicles such as maintenance trucks Previously traditional light sources required the engine to continue running to ensure that the battery would not become depleted if the lights were to be used for more than a few hours The energy efficient nature of LEDs allows them to continue flashing with the engine off br LED lighting systems are sensitive to heat Due to the negative influences of heat on the stability of photometric performance and the light transmitting components the importance of thermal design stability tests usage of low UV type LED modules and UV resistance tests of internal materials has increased dramatically For this reason LED signal lights must remain compliant with the intensity requirements for the functions they produce after one minute and after thirty minutes of continuous operation In addition UN Regulation contains a set of tests for LED modules including colour rendering UV radiation and temperature stability tests According to UN Regulations and mechanical electromechanical or other devices for headlights must withstand endurance tests and function failure tests br br br High intensity discharge HID br br High intensity discharge or HID lights sometimes referred to as xenon lights are modified metal halide lights employing xenon fill gas Traditional HID lights such as those used for general lighting have a long warm up time Headlights must provide light very shortly after they are turned on and the xenon gas serves to reduce warm up time br br br Neon tubes br Neon light tubes were introduced into series production for the centre high mount stop light on the Ford Explorer Notable later uses included the Lincoln Mark VIII with a neon tube spanning the width of the trunk decklid and the BMW Z which made extensive use of neon br Neon lights offer the same nearly instant rise time as LEDs but require a high voltage ballast br br br Self Driving br br In December Mercedes Benz received approval in California and Nevada the only states where it is legal to operate their self driving vehicles for turquoise lights in accordance with SAE standard J to indicate to outside observers that the car s self driving system is engaged Mercedes is the first car manufacturer to equip their self driving vehicles with such lights br br br Distributive lighting br In distributive light systems the light from a single source is sent via optical fibres or light guides to wherever it is needed in the automobile Light guides are commonly used to distributivity light dashboard displays and premium vehicles are beginning to use distributive systems for lighting such items as door locks window controls and cup holders Distributive exterior lighting has also been explored with high intensity central light sources br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Turn signal
