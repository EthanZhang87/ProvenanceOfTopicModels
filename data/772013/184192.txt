Studebaker was an American wagon and automobile manufacturer based in South Bend Indiana with a building at Broadway Times Square Midtown Manhattan New York City Founded in and incorporated in as the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company the firm was originally a coachbuilder manufacturing wagons buggies carriages and harnesses br Studebaker entered the automotive business in with electric vehicles and in with gasoline vehicles all sold under the name Studebaker Automobile Company Until its automotive division operated in partnership with the Garford Company of Elyria Ohio and after with the E M F Company and with the Flanders Automobile Company The first gasoline automobiles to be fully manufactured by Studebaker were marketed in August Over the next years the company established a reputation for quality durability and reliability br After an unsuccessful merger with Packard the Studebaker Packard Corporation and failure to solve chronic postwar cashflow problems the Studebaker Corporation name was restored in but the South Bend plant ceased automobile production on December and the last Studebaker automobile rolled off the Hamilton Ontario Canada assembly line on March Studebaker continued as an independent manufacturer before merging with Wagner Electric in May and then Worthington Corporation in November to form Studebaker Worthington br br br

Studebaker son of Clement Studebaker and Sarah Rensel was born February Westmorland PA and died in in South Bend St Joseph IN John Studebaker moved to Ohio in with his wife Rebecca n e Mohler br br br The five brothers br br The five sons were in order of birth Henry Clement John Mohler Peter Everst and Jacob Franklin The boys had five sisters Photographs of the brothers and their parents are reproduced in the company history which was written by Erskine after he became president in memory of John M whose portrait appears on the front cover br br br th century colonial family business br In Peter Studebaker built his home on a property known as Bakers Lookout The home still stands in Hagerstown Maryland The first Studebaker wagon factory was built in the same year next to the home On Bakers Lookout Peter master of the German Cutler Guild built the first Studebaker home the first Studebaker wagon factory where he began forging and tempering steel and seasoning wood in the colonies Peter Studebaker built the first Studebaker mill and a wagon road Broadfording Wagon Road was built to run through the property Peter owned property on both sides of the Conococheague Creek so he built a bridge over the creek in Peter began the family business on the Bakers Lookout property where he made his home and built the first Studebaker wagon factory In this factory Peter manufactured everything all necessities including products he made in Solingen Germany and naturally wagons Bakers Lookout the acre land patent Hagerstown Maryland was the first of many land patents to be acquired by Peter Studebaker Peter purchased approximately acres in what is now known state of Maryland The home still stands today and is proof of the advanced technology of Peter Studebaker see Bakers Lookout Peter Studebakers home website br In Peter Studebaker built a road through his owned properties known as Broadfording Wagon Road The road he built carried heavy traffic to Bakers Lookout s wagon and forging services that were instrumental to expand the west The Maryland Historical Trust WA I writes that this road was One of Washington County s earliest thoroughfares Broadfording Wagon Road was already in existence in see Exhibit I The wagon transportation industry boomed On the property Broadfording Wagon Road built in by Peter Studebaker went directly through the property to allow access from the home to the factory and to the mill br Although Peter Studebaker s life in the colonies was short less than years the family business flourished through his descendants see Exhibit M and apprentices expanded the vast land holdings enlarging the Studebaker family business and its industrious wagon making region Peter s trade secrets were passed from father to son generation to generation The Studebaker family business plan purchasing again and again vast amounts of land on which they built industrious farms with mills and wagon making facilities and wagon selling facilities each identical to the Bakers Lookout situation industrious farms much acreage on which one finds the necessary resources lumber iron ore oil shale and land selected with stream spring or river to hydropower factories mills and equipment Peter s technology enabled expansion of the family business through the famous Conestoga and Prairie Schooner wagon designs Peter s trade was the stepping stone that expanded the transportation industry Thomas E Bonsall wrote Much more than the story of a family business it is also in microcosm the story of the industrial development of America Peter Studebaker died in the mid s br br br End of horse drawn era br John M Studebaker had always viewed the automobile as complementary to the horse drawn wagon pointing out that the expense of maintaining a car might be beyond the resources of a small farmer In when Erskine s history of the firm was published the annual capacity of the seven Studebaker plants was automobiles horse drawn vehicles and about worth of automobile and vehicle spare parts in dollars In the preceding seven years horse drawn vehicles had been sold as against automobiles but the trend was all too clear The regular manufacture of horse drawn vehicles ended when Erskine ordered the removal of the last wagon gear in To its range of cars Studebaker would now add a truck line to replace the horse drawn wagons Buses fire engines and even small rail locomotive kits were produced using the same powerful six cylinder engines br br br Studebaker automobiles br br br In the beginning br br In John M Studebaker s son in law Fred Fish urged for development of a practical horseless carriage When on Peter Studebaker s death Fish became chairman of the executive committee in the firm had an engineer working on a motor vehicle At first Studebaker opted for electric battery powered over gasoline propulsion While manufacturing its own Studebaker Electric vehicles from to the company entered into body manufacturing and distribution agreements with two makers of gasoline powered vehicles Garford of Elyria Ohio and the Everitt Metzger Flanders E M F Company of Detroit and Walkerville Ontario Studebaker began making gasoline engined cars in partnership with Garford in br br br Studebaker marque established in br br In it was decided to refinance and incorporate as the Studebaker Corporation which was concluded on February under New Jersey laws p The company discontinued making electric vehicles that same year The financing was handled by Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs who provided board representatives including Henry Goldman whose contribution was especially esteemed br After taking over E M F s Detroit facilities Studebaker sought to remedy customer dissatisfaction complaints by paying mechanics to visit each disgruntled owner and replace defective parts in their vehicles at a total cost of US million in dollars The worst problem was rear axle failure Hendry comments that the frenzied testing resulted in Studebaker s aim to design for life and the consequent emergence of a series of really rugged cars the famous Big Six and Special Six listed at in dollars From that time Studebaker s own marque was put on all new automobiles produced at the former E M F facilities as an assurance that the vehicles were well built br In the company experienced the first major labor strike in the automotive industry the Studebaker strike br br br Engineering advances from WWI br The corporation benefited from enormous orders cabled by the British government at the outbreak of World War I They included transport wagons sets of artillery harness artillery saddles and ambulances as well as hundreds of cars purchased through the London office Similar orders were received from the governments of France and Russia br The six cylinder models were the first cars to employ the important advancement of monobloc engine casting which became associated with a production economy drive in the years of the war At that time a year old university graduate engineer Fred M Zeder was appointed chief engineer He was the first of a trio of brilliant technicians with Owen R Skelton and Carl Breer who launched the successful models and were known as The Three Musketeers They left in to form a consultancy later to become the nucleus of Chrysler Engineering The replacement chief engineer was Guy P Henry who introduced molybdenum steel an improved clutch design and presided over the six cylinders only policy favored by new president Albert Russel Erskine who replaced Fred Fish in July br br br First auto proving ground br In the corporation s most successful distributor and dealer Paul G Hoffman came to South Bend as vice president in charge of sales In Studebaker became the first automobile manufacturer in the United States to open a controlled outdoor proving ground on which in would be planted pine trees in a pattern that spelled STUDEBAKER when viewed from the air Also in the last of the Detroit plant was moved to South Bend under the control of Harold S Vance vice president in charge of production and engineering That year a new small car the Erskine Six was launched in Paris resulting in sales abroad and many more in America By the sales list had been expanded to models and business was so good that of earnings were being paid out as dividends to shareholders in a highly competitive environment However the end of that year ushered in the Great Depression that resulted in many layoffs and massive national unemployment for several years br br br Facilities in the s br br Studebaker s total plant area in Indiana was acres km spread over three locations with buildings occupying million square feet of floor space Annual production capacity was cars requiring employees br The original South Bend vehicle plant continued to be used for small forgings springs and making some body parts Separate buildings totaling over one million square feet were added in for the Light Special and Big Six models At any one time bodies were in process South Bend s Plant made chassis for the Light Six and had a foundry of sq ft m producing tons of castings daily br Plant at Detroit made complete chassis for Special and Big Six models in over sq ft m of floor space and was located between Clark Avenue and Scotten Avenue south of Fort Street Plant was the service parts store and shipping facility plus the executive offices of various technical departments The Detroit facilities were moved to South Bend in except that the Piquette Avenue Plant Plant was retained for assembly of the Erskine between and and the Rockne br Plant was at Walkerville Ontario Canada where complete cars were assembled from components that had been shipped from South Bend and Detroit factories or locally made in Canada and is in close proximity to the current Ford Windsor Engine Factory Output was designated for the Canadian left hand drive and British Empire right hand drive trade By locating it there Studebaker could advertise the cars as British built and qualify for reduced tariffs This manufacturing facility had been acquired from E M F in see above By it had been the subject of million investment and was providing employment that supported families br br br Impact of the s depression br br Few industrialists were prepared for the Wall Street Crash of October Though Studebaker s production and sales had been booming the market collapsed and plans were laid for a new small low cost car the Rockne However times were too bad to sell even inexpensive cars Within a year the firm was cutting wages and laying off workers Company president Albert Russel Erskine maintained faith in the Rockne and rashly had the directors declare huge dividends in and He also acquired of the White Motor Company s stock at an inflated price and in cash By the banks were owed million in dollars though current assets exceeded that figure On March Studebaker entered receivership Erskine was pushed out of the presidency in favor of more cost conscious managers Erskine committed suicide on July leaving successors Harold Vance and Paul Hoffman to deal with the problems br By December the company was back in profit with million working capital and new Studebaker dealers while the purchase of White was cancelled With the substantial aid of Lehman Brothers full refinancing and reorganization was achieved on March A new car was put on the drawing boards under chief engineer Delmar Barney Roos the Champion Its final styling was designed by Virgil Exner and Raymond Loewy The Champion doubled the company s previous year sales when it was introduced in br br br World War II br From the s to the s the South Bend company had originated many style and engineering milestones including the Light Four Light Six Special Six Big Six models the Dictator the record breaking Commander and President followed by the Champion During World War II Studebaker produced the Studebaker US truck in great quantity and the unique M Weasel cargo and personnel carrier Studebaker ranked th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts An assembly plant in California Studebaker Pacific Corporation built engine assemblies and nacelles for B s and PV Harpoons After cessation of hostilities Studebaker returned to building automobiles br br br Post WWII styling br br Studebaker prepared well in advance for the anticipated postwar market and launched the slogan First by far with a post war car This advertising premise was substantiated by Virgil Exner s designs notably the Studebaker Starlight coup which introduced innovative styling features that influenced later cars including the flatback trunk instead of the tapered look of the time and a wrap around rear window For and the Champion and Commander adopted a polarizing appearance from Exner s concepts and were applied to the Studebaker Starlight coupe The new trunk design prompted a running joke that one could not tell if the car was coming or going and appeared to be influenced by the Lockheed P Lightning particularly by the shortened fuselage with wrap around canopy During the war the Studebaker Chippewa Factory was the primary location for aircraft engines used in the Boeing B Flying Fortress and the marketing department attempted to evoke a reference to their contribution to the war effort br br br Industry price war brings on crisis br Studebaker s strong postwar management team including president Paul G Hoffman and Roy Cole vice president engineering had left by and was replaced by more cautious executives who failed to meet the competitive challenge brought on by Henry Ford II and his Whiz Kids Massive discounting in a price war between Ford and General Motors which began with Ford s massive increase in production in the spring of part of Ford s postwar expansion program aimed at restoring it to the position of the largest car maker which GM had held since could not be equalled by the independent carmakers for whom the only hope was seen as a merger of Studebaker Packard Hudson and Nash into a fourth giant combine after Chrysler This had been unsuccessfully attempted by George W Mason In this scheme Studebaker had the disadvantage that its South Bend location would make consolidation difficult Its labor costs were also the highest in the industry br br br Merger with Packard br Ballooning labor costs the company had never had an official United Auto Workers UAW strike and Studebaker workers and retirees were among the highest paid in the industry quality control issues and the new car sales war between Ford and General Motors in the early s wrought havoc on Studebaker s balance sheet Professional financial managers stressed short term earnings rather than long term vision Momentum was sufficient to keep going for another years but stiff competition and price cutting by the Big Three doomed the enterprise br From Studebaker declined rapidly and by was losing money It negotiated a strategic takeover by Packard a smaller but less financially troubled car manufacturer However the cash position was worse than it had led Packard to believe and by the company renamed Studebaker Packard Corporation and under the guidance of CEO James J Nance was nearly bankrupt though it continued to make and market both Studebaker and Packard cars until The Packard element was retained until when the name reverted to Studebaker Corporation br br br Contract with Curtiss Wright br A three year management contract was made by CEO Nance with aircraft maker Curtiss Wright in with the aim of improving finances due to Studebaker s experience building aircraft engines during the war and military grade trucks C W s president Roy T Hurley attempted to reduce labor costs Under C W s guidance Studebaker Packard also sold the old Detroit Packard plant and returned the then new Packard plant on Conner Avenue where Packard production had moved in at the same time Packard took its body making operations in house after its longtime body supplier Briggs Manufacturing Company was acquired by Chrysler in late to its lessor Chrysler The company became the American importer for Mercedes Benz Auto Union and DKW automobiles and many Studebaker dealers sold those brands as well C W gained the use of idle car plants and tax relief on their aircraft profits while Studebaker Packard received further working capital to continue car production br br br Last automobiles produced br The automobiles that came after the diversification process began including the redesigned compact Lark and the Avanti sports car were based on old chassis and engine designs The Lark in particular was based on existing parts to the degree that it even used the central body section of the company s cars but was a clever enough design to be popular in its first year selling over units and delivering a million profit to the automaker in dollars S P rose from units in to in br However Lark sales began to drop precipitously after the Big Three manufacturers introduced their own compact models in and the situation became critical once the so called senior compacts debuted for The Lark had provided a temporary reprieve but nothing proved enough to stop the financial bleeding br A labor strike occurred at the South Bend plant starting on January and lasting days The strike came to an end after an agreement was reached between company president Sherwood H Egbert and Walter P Reuther president of the UAW Despite a sales uptick in continuing media reports that Studebaker was about to leave the auto business became a self fulfilling prophecy as buyers shied away from the company s products for fear of being stuck with an orphan NBC reporter Chet Huntley made a television program called Studebaker Fight for Survival which aired on May By all of the company s automobiles and trucks were selling poorly br br br Exit from auto business br br br Closure of South Bend plant br After insufficient initial sales of the models and the ousting of president Sherwood Egbert on December the company announced the closure of the South Bend plant The last Larks and Hawks were assembled on December and the last Avanti was assembled on December To fulfill government contracts production of military trucks and Zip Vans for the United States Postal Service continued into early The engine foundry remained open until the union contract expired in May The supply of engines produced in the first half of supported Zip Van assembly until the government contract was fulfilled and automobile production at the Canadian plant until the end of the model year The Avanti model name tooling and plant space were sold off to Leo Newman and Nate Altman a longtime South Bend Studebaker Packard dealership They revived the car in under the brand name Avanti II See main article Avanti car They likewise purchased the rights and tooling for Studebaker s trucks along with the company s vast stock of parts and accessories The plant alongside Studebaker s General Products Division was bought by Kaiser Jeep Corporation who used it to produce military vehicles That unit formed the nucleus for what would later become AM General Corporation which today is the world s largest producer of tactical wheeled vehicles Nevertheless as Newman and Altman decided not to progress with any Studebaker truck production the tooling was then sold off again to Kaiser Jeep in late which continued producing parts for Studebaker trucks for a few more years Some model Champ trucks were built in South America using completely knocked down kits and left over parts These models used a different grille from all previous Champ models br The closure of the South Bend plant hit the community particularly hard since Studebaker was the largest employer in St Joseph County Indiana Nearly a quarter of the South Bend work force was African American br br br Closure of Hamilton plant br br Limited automotive production was consolidated at the company s last remaining production facility in Hamilton Ontario which had always been profitable and where Studebaker produced cars until March under the leadership of Gordon Grundy It was projected that the Canadian operation could break even on production of about cars a year and Studebaker s announced goal was models While production was just shy of the figure the company s directors felt that the small profits were not enough to justify continued investment Rejecting Grundy s request for funds to tool up for models Studebaker left the automobile business on March after an announcement on March A turquoise and white Cruiser sedan was the last of fewer than models manufactured of which were built in the calendar year In reality the move to Canada had been a tactic by which production could be slowly wound down and remaining dealer franchise obligations honored The and Studebaker cars used McKinnon engines sourced from General Motors Canada Limited which were based on Chevrolet s cubic inch six cylinder and cubic inch V engines when Studebaker built engines were no longer available br The closure adversely affected not only the plant s employees who had developed a sense of collegiality around group benefits such as employee parties and day trips but the city of Hamilton as a whole Studebaker had been Hamilton s th largest employer br br br Potential link with Nissan and Toyota br In Gordon Grundy of Studebaker Canada was sent by Studebaker management to Japan to investigate potential links with Nissan and Toyota to sell their vehicles badged as Studebakers While Grundy was negotiating with Nissan to possibly import the Nissan Cedric the Studebaker board found out about the Toyota Century which was not introduced until November and then the attorney representing the board former United States Vice President Richard Nixon asked Grundy to contact Toyota as well Toyota was insulted at being Studebaker s second choice and when word got out to Nissan that Grundy was also speaking with Toyota executives Nissan ended negotiations leaving Grundy empty handed br br br Network and other assets br Many of Studebaker s dealers either closed took on other automakers product lines or converted to Mercedes Benz dealerships following the closure of the Canadian plant Studebaker s General Products Division which built vehicles to fulfill defense contracts was acquired by Kaiser Industries which built military and postal vehicles in South Bend In American Motors AMC purchased the division which still exists today as AM General br The grove of trees planted on the proving grounds in spelling out the Studebaker name still stands and has proven to be a popular topic on such satellite photography sites as Google Earth The proving grounds were acquired by Bendix in and Bosch in After Bosch closed its South Bend operation in a part of the proving ground was retained and as of April has been restored to use under the name New Carlisle Test Facility br For many years a rumor persisted of the existence of a Studebaker graveyard The rumor was later confirmed to be true when the remains of many prototype automobiles and a few trucks were discovered at a remote heavily wooded site bounded by the proving grounds high speed oval Most of the prototypes were left to rot in direct contact with the ground and full exposure to the weather and falling trees Attempts to remove some of these rusting bodies resulted in the bodies crumbling under their own weight as they were moved so now they exist only in photographs br However there were a few notable exceptions A few of the prototypes were rescued The only example of a never produced Champion wood sided station wagon was restored and is on display at the Studebaker National Museum br Another prototype initially slated for disposal at the proving grounds escaped the fate of the others In late Studebaker produced one Commander convertible as an engineering study to determine if the model could be profitably mass produced The car was based on the door hardtop coupe The car was later modified to model specifications and was occasionally driven around South Bend by engineers Additional structural reinforcements were needed to reduce body flexure Even though the car was equipped with the cu in V the added structural weight increased the car s mph acceleration time to an unacceptable level In addition the company did not have the financial resources to add another body type to the model line The company s leadership mistakenly thought the door sedans door sedans and Conestoga wagon would sell better than the door coupes so the company s resources were focused on production of the sedans and the wagon When the prototype convertible was no longer needed engineer E T Reynolds ordered the car to be stripped and the body sent to the secret graveyard at the proving grounds A non engineering employee requested permission to purchase the complete car rather than see it rot away with the other prototypes Chief engineer Gene Hardig discussed the request with E T Reynolds They agreed to let the employee purchase the car on the condition that the employee never sell it In the s the car was re discovered behind a South Bend gas station and no longer owned by the former employee After eventually passing through several owners the car is now in a private collection of Studebaker automobiles br In May Studebaker and its diversified units were merged with Wagner Electric In November Studebaker was merged with the Worthington Corporation to form Studebaker Worthington The Studebaker name disappeared from the American business scene in when McGraw Edison acquired Studebaker Worthington except for the still existing Studebaker Leasing based in Jericho NY McGraw Edison was itself purchased in by Cooper Industries which sold off its auto parts divisions to Federal Mogul some years later As detailed above some vehicles were assembled from left over parts and identified as Studebakers by the purchasers of the Avanti brand and surplus material from Studebaker at South Bend br br br Diversified activities br By the early s Studebaker had begun to diversify away from automobiles Numerous companies were purchased bringing Studebaker into such diverse fields as the manufacture of tire studs and missile components br The company s annual report listed the following divisions br br Clarke Floor Machine Division Muskegon Michigan br CTL Missile Space Technology Division Cincinnati Ohio br Franklin Appliance Division Minneapolis Minnesota home office

expanded into the manufacture of complete wagons At this time John M was making wheelbarrows in Placerville California The site of his business is California Historic Landmark at Main St Placerville br The first major expansion in Henry and Clem s South Bend business came from their being in the right place to meet the needs of the California Gold Rush that began in From his wheelbarrow enterprise at Placerville John M had amassed in dollars In April he quit and moved out to apply this to financing the vehicle manufacturing of H C Studebaker which was already booming because of an order to build wagons for the US Army In they had also built their first carriage Fancy hand worked iron trim the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would be proud to be seen in br That was when John M bought out Henry s share of the business Henry was deeply religious and had qualms about building military equipment The Studebakers were Dunkard Brethren conservative German Baptists a religion that viewed war as evil Longstreet s official company history simply says Henry was tired of the business He wanted to farm The risks of expanding were not for him Expansion continued from manufacture of wagons for westward migration as well as for farming and general transportation During the height of westward migration and wagon train pioneering half of the wagons used were Studebakers They made about a quarter of them and manufactured the metal fittings for other builders in Missouri for another quarter century br The fourth brother Peter E was running a successful general store in Goshen Indiana which was expanded in to include a wagon distribution outlet A major leap forward came from supplying wagons for the Union Army in the Civil War By annual sales had reached in dollars That year the three older brothers formed the Studebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company Clem president Peter secretary and John M treasurer By this time the factory had a spur line to the Lake Shore railroad and with the Union Pacific Railroad finished most wagons were now dispatched by rail and steamship br br br World s largest vehicle house br br In the youngest brother year

high were said to be the largest polished monolithic shafts in the country Three years later Jacob died the first death among the brothers br In incoming President Harrison ordered a full set of Studebaker carriages and harnesses for the White House As the th century approached the South Bend plant covered nearly acres km with big boilers dynamos large stationary engines pulleys wood and iron working machines mi km of belting dozens of steam pumps and arc and incandescent lamps making white light over all The worldwide economic depression of caused a dramatic pause in sales and the plant closed down for five weeks but industrial relations were good and the organized workforce declared faith in their employer Studebaker would end the nineteenth century as the largest buggy and wagon
