A sim racing wheel is a control device for use in racing games racing simulators and driving simulators They are usually packaged with a large paddle styled as a steering wheel along with a set of pedals for the accelerator brake and clutch as well as transmission controls An analog wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and pedal control that is required to properly manage a simulated car as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard The relatively large range of motion further allows the user to more accurately apply the controls Racing wheels have been developed for use with arcade games game consoles personal computers and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers br One of the earliest racing wheels for the PC mass market was the Thrustmaster Formula T released in It had no force feedback only some form of spring based centering resistance proportional to the steering angle Two of the earliest FFB wheels for the consumer PC market were the Microsoft Sidewinder Force Feedback Wheel released in and the Logitech Wingman Formula Force br br br Force feedback br Force feedback sim wheels have motors to simulate steering kickback Racing wheels started off as simple plastic wheels hooked up to a rotary potentiometer which were sprung by springs or bungees These spring based wheels had a reactive torque that increased proportionally only to the steering angle without regard for the simulated vehicle dynamics br Eventually manufacturers began to use electric motors in the controllers in place of springs in order to achieve a level of force feedback sometimes abbreviated FFB first seen in Microsoft s Sidewinder wheel At first this technology simply provided the centering force and other artificial effects such as shaking the wheel in a crash or other vibrations However as driving simulations have evolved their physics engines have become more elaborate allowing also for linking the force feedback close to the simulated vehicle dynamics of the in game physics This allows the user to truly feel what forces go through the steering rack instead of just artificial effects and genuinely enhance the realism of the game A fundamental factor for an adequate subjective steering feel and perception of drivability from a force feedback wheel is the transfer function from steering torque to steering angle br In a preliminary comparison of gear driven and direct drive wheels in the Hz frequency range for a study on hard real time multibody simulation and high fidelity steering wheel force feedback concluded that direct drive wheels are preferable br br br Buttons br br Sim racing wheels like real world racing steering wheels can have many buttons Some examples are cruise control or pit lane limiter for the pit lane button for flashing lights windscreen wipers radio communication with the team adjustments to the racing setup such as brake balance brake migration differential braking entry mid exit hi speed to make use of torque effectively at different points in a corner traction control amplitude and sensitivity anti roll bar adjustment front and rear engine program strat mode engine mode to get extra power or conserve fuel and engine life engine braking the engine s throttle or absence of throttle when there is no input from the gas pedal i e whether the engine contributes to the car slowing down or is keeping its speed etc seeing sideways or in the mirror or to browse various menus for example using a way funky switch br br br Comparison of racing wheels br Subsections by motor type no FFB gear or belt driven and direct drive wheels br br br No FFB br br br Gear and or belt driven br br br Earlier products br br br Gear driven br br br Hybrid gear and belt driven br br br Belt driven br br br Direct drive bases or wheel base combos br br br Other types uncategorized br br br Pedals br Other features by which pedals can be compared are whether they can be inverted hanging pedals build material plastic aluminum adjustability position pressure travel measured pressure travel length sensor resolution br br br Potentiometer based and magnetic brake br br br Loadcell brake br br br Shifters br br br Notes br br br See also br HOTAS hands on throttle and stick br Linkage mechanical br Sim racing br Sim racing pedals br Sawtooth wave br br br
