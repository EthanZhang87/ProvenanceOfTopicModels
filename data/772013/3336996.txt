id: 3336996
A parabolic aluminized reflector lamp PAR lamp or simply PAR is a type of electric lamp that is widely used in commercial residential and transportation illumination It produces a highly directional beam Usage includes theatrical lighting locomotive headlamps aircraft landing lights and residential and commercial recessed lights cans in the United States br Many PAR lamps are of the sealed beam variety with a parabolic reflector one or more filaments and a glass or plastic lens sealed permanently together as a unit Originally introduced for road vehicle headlamp service sealed beams have since been applied elsewhere Halogen sealed beam lamps incorporate a halogen lamp within a quartz or hard glass envelope br br br Construction br br A PAR lamp consists of a light source with lens and a parabolic reflector with a smooth aluminium surface determining the spread of the beam The most common sealed beam type combines these three elements into an integral unit The light source usually approximates a point source that can be focused on tungsten filaments and halogen lamps are common but some theatrical usage that requires a higher color temperature may use hydrargyrum medium arc iodide HMI instead br br br Sizes br PAR lamps come in a variety of standardized sizes The size of a round PAR lamp is expressed as the nominal diameter of the mouth of the reflector in eighths of an inch so the approximate nominal lamp bell diameter in inches can be found by dividing the PAR size by A PAR for example is eighths of an inch inches in diameter a PAR is eighths inches in diameter and so on Similarly the diameter in millimeters can be found by multiplying the PAR designation by For example a PAR lamp is approximately inches or mm in diameter br The size of rectangular PAR lamps is expressed as the letters REC followed by the reflector s mouth height the letter X and the reflector s mouth width with both dimensions in millimeters For example REC X lamps are high and mm wide br br br Light beams br Depending on the parabolic reflector geometry the configuration of the filament and its placement within the paraboloid PAR lamps can achieve a wide range of beams from narrow spot to wide flood The following suffixes are commonly used with PAR lamps to indicate their beam width PAR lamps are also manufactured to produce beam patterns specific to the needs of particular applications such as low beam and high beam headlamps and fog and driving lights for vehicles and warning lamps for school buses br br The suffixes given are for Watt PAR lamps only The focused beam can be oval and is sometimes specified in two numbers br br br Uses br br br Automotive headlamps br br In the United States of America sealed beam headlamps were introduced in becoming standard equipment across all American market vehicles starting in and remaining the only type allowed for almost four and a half decades until the model year Before and after those years vehicles could have model specific nonstandard shape headlamps using any of a wide variety of replaceable light bulbs Between and all U S cars had to have two inch mm round headlamps with dual filaments so each lamp provided both a high and a low beam light distribution In a system of four sealed beam headlamps two per side of inches mm diameter was allowed in some U S states The following year in all states allowed the new system Two of the lamps contained two filaments and served as low and high beam while the other two lamps contained only one filament and were active only during high beam operation br From the model year a rectangular version of the four lamp system was legalized The new lamps were mm in wide and mm in tall For a rectangular version of the two lamp system became legal these measured mm in wide and mm in tall br With only two round and two rectangular lamp sizes allowed the sealed beam headlamp mandate greatly restricted styling possibilities for automobiles br Halogen sealed beam headlamps appeared on U S cars in to enable greater high beam intensity newly permitted by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard without unreasonably high lamp wattage Eventually halogen sealed beam lights came to dominate the U S automotive lamps market br br br Aircraft br br Aircraft landing ACL lights are often sealed beams that have a very narrow beam spread They typically have a size of PAR or PAR and run on V DC They have found some use in stage lighting as well br br br Outdoor and stage lighting br PAR lamps and their fixtures are widely used in theatre concerts and motion picture production when a substantial amount of flat lighting is required for a scene They are often mounted in can shaped fixtures known as PARCANs which can be used to generate colours by fitting them with colored sheets called gels The cans are arranged into rows of different colours and identical rows placed on different sides of the stage such assemblies made from aluminum bars are known as PARbars Due to their affordability they are ideal for colour washes in several different colours However because of the lack of dynamic control over the beam diameter shape and sharpness PARs are rarely used as Front of House lights other than for front washes but can be used for special effect lighting such as lighting from directly above or from extreme angles as well as general wash lights overhead above stage If used cleverly par cans can provide low budget productions with good effects br PAR sealed beam lamps are often used for these purposes they are typically available with or watt power ratings Beam spreads are designated as FL flood SP spot NSP narrow spot and VNSP very narrow spot as stamped on the back of the lamp s reflector br PAR lamps with an E base and with ratings up to W were often used for domestic outdoor floodlight illumination for patios backyards and often combined with a PIR sensor switch as a security convenience light for example in a driveway Coloured versions were popular with discos and mobile DJs however were usually only available up to w in coloured form and were considerably more expensive than standard PAR globes In domestic applications halogen and later on LED largely replaced the incandescent PAR br In situations where sunlight or other specular light is available a white foam reflector is often used to accomplish the same effect as a PAR array PAR cans are being replaced in some stage applications by LED stage lighting which use less electric power and produce a wide array of saturated colors without the use of color filters when white light is not needed br br br Indoor lighting br Smaller sealed beam PAR lamps PAR and smaller with an Edison screw base are common in indoor lighting They can be found in recessed fixtures mounted in the ceiling or on tracks br br br Lighthouses br Sealed beam lamp arrays are also in use by modern lighthouses br br br Electrical connector br High power mains voltage theatrical PARs usually use the bi pin GX d Mogul lamp connector G and variants are common too Theater metal halide lamps use G In addition to being used on light bulbs themselves the G connectors are also found as a part of the Raylite reflector assembly although some Raylite reflectors have tails which then require connection to the mains flex with the use of a ceramic connector block ideally fixed to the can s body br In residential and office use the usual connector for the lamp s voltage is often used This includes Edison screw or a bayonet connector for mains supplied PARs or small bi pin connectors for low voltage applications br br br Variations br br br LED br br LED retrofit equipment that match PAR lamp dimensions is made by some manufacturers As with the case of LED MR lamps LED PAR lamps generally use an array of individual LED elements that are unsuitable for reflector operation Nevertheless some degree of beam control can be obtained with aperture or lens and LED PAR replacements with a spread is common br Models built for stage lighting may use less similar dimensions They often use a RGB color model for color tuning abilities though some higher end fixtures use a primary colour system with cool and warm white LEDs instead for better color reproduction br br br PAR moving lights br Intelligent moving PARs allow for the ability to pan and tilt the instruments through a lighting control console These have been generally superseded by dedicated intelligent lighting fixtures which use a different light source and offer more control over the colour and shape of the beam
