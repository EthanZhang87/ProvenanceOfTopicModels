Windshield washer fluid also called windshield wiper fluid wiper fluid screen wash in the UK or washer fluid is a fluid for motor vehicles that is used in cleaning the windshield with the windshield wiper while the vehicle is being driven br br br Delivery system br A control within the car can be operated to spray washer fluid onto the windshield typically using an electrical pump via jets mounted either beneath the windshield or beneath the wiper blade s The windshield wipers are automatically turned on cleaning dirt and debris off the windshield Some vehicles use the same method to clean the rear window or the headlights The first windshield cleaner unit offered for automobiles was in as an aftermarket option to be installed on cars after they were bought In General Motors installed windshield washers on all their vehicles as an extra cost option while Chrysler offered the feature optionally in and Ford offered them for br Washer fluid may sometimes be preheated before being delivered onto the windshield This is especially desirable in colder climates when a thin layer of ice or frost accumulates on the windshield s surface as it eliminates the need to manually scrape the windshield or pour warm water on the glass Although there are a few aftermarket preheat devices available many automobile makers offer this feature factory installed on at least some of their vehicles For example General Motors had begun equipping vehicles with heated washer fluid systems from the factory beginning in with the Buick Lucerne sedan The system emits a fine mist of heated water that clears frost without damaging the windshield itself GM also claims heated washer fluid helps in removing bug splatters and other road accumulation The company halted the production of these mechanisms after they found that it was prone to start engine fires Mercedes Benz has used a thermostatically controlled heating element with the engine coolant as the heat source since the mid s on certain models Many other manufacturers have employed electrically heated washer nozzles primarily to prevent them from freezing closed not in an attempt to heat the fluid itself br br br Varieties br Windshield washer fluid is sold in many formulations some are pre mixed and others require dilution before use Common washer fluid solutions are given labels such as All Season Bug Remover or De icer br Typical formulations include a surfactant water softener and an antifreeze Alkyl sulfates and fatty alcohol ethers are typical surfactants br Dilution factors will vary depending on season for example in winter the dilution factor may be whereas during summer the dilution factor may be It is sometimes sold as sachet of crystals which is also diluted with water Distilled or deionised water is the preferred diluent since it will not leave trace mineral deposits on the glass br Anti freeze may be added to a mixture to give the product a lower freezing temperature Antifreezes are typically ethanol and ethylene glycol br br Many cars display a warning when the fluid level is low and some car makers have replaced the float sensor generating this signal with a simple two pin probe in the tank This requires a slightly conductive fluid but most common windshield washer fluid mixtures will work Mercedes Benz sells a special fluid for their cars br br br Concerns br Consumer advocacy groups and auto enthusiasts believe that the solvents present in some windshield washer fluid can damage the vehicle Critics point to the corrosive effects of ethanol methanol and other components on paint rubber car wax and plastics and groups propose various alternatives and homemade recipes to protect the finish and mechanics of the motor vehicle br br br See also br Antifreeze br br br br br br Further reading br Becalski A Bartlett KH Methanol exposure to car occupants from windshield washing fluid a pilot study Indoor Air doi j x PMID INIST br Chong C Hamersma B Automobile radiator antifreeze and windshiled washer fluid as IBA carriers for rooting woody cuttings HortScience doi HORTSCI INIST br Davis LE Hudson D Benson BE Jones Easom LA Coleman JK Methanol poisoning exposures in the United States Journal of Toxicology Clinical Toxicology doi CLT PMID S CID INIST br Glazer M Dross P Necrosis of the putamen caused by methanol intoxication MR findings American Journal of Roentgenology doi ajr PMID INIST br Jackson MH Payne HA Bittering agents their potential application in reducing ingestions of engine coolants and windshield wash Veterinary and Human Toxicology PMID INIST br Knibbs LD de Dear RJ Atkinson SE Field study of air change and flow rate in six automobiles PDF Indoor Air doi j x PMID INIST br Mullins ME Zane Horowitz B Was it necessary to add Bitrex denatonium benzoate to automotive products Veterinary and Human Toxicology PMID INIST br br br External links br Media related to Windshield washer fluid reservoirs at Wikimedia Commons
