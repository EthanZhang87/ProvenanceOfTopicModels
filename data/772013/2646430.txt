Arthur Constantin Krebs November in Vesoul France March in Quimperl France was a French officer and pioneer in automotive engineering br br br Life br Collaborating with Charles Renard Krebs piloted the first fully controlled free flight made in the French Army airship La France which was designed in The flight covered km mi in minutes The flight landed back at its starting point On its seven flights the La France dirigible returned five times to its starting point br Krebs and Renard shared the Ponti prize of the French Acad mie des sciences for their contribution to aerostation br Krebs inspired Jules Verne In Verne s novel Robur The Conqueror he writes of the striking experiments of Captain Krebs and Captain Renard br In Krebs and Gustave Z d designed the first modern French submarine the Gymnote The submarine was fitted with the first naval periscope and the first naval electric gyrocompass The latter allowed the Gymnote to force a naval block in br From to Arthur Krebs modernized the Ville de Paris fire department not only its equipment but its organisation as well His work left a lasting impression in this elite corps br In May Arthur Krebs patented a new automobile fitted with an electromagnetic gearbox and a layout of the front wheels which re centred them when the steering wheel was left alone Today this is known as the Castor angle The Panhard et Levassor company acquired a license to build cars under the name of Clement Panhard between and featuring this innovation br Krebs succeeded Levassor as Panhard et Levassor s general manager from to He transformed the Panhard et Levassor Company into one of the largest and most profitable automobile manufacturers before World War I br In Krebs replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard et Levassor car he designed for the Paris Amsterdam race which ran from the to July Fernand Charron won that race on a four cylinder Panhard et Levassor br At the end of C S Rolls introduced the first car in Britain fitted with wheel steering when he imported a hp Panhard et Levassor from France br In Krebs invented the automatic diaphragm carburettor which gave cars continuous power during acceleration by providing a constant air fuel ratio at all times this also led to dramatic improvement in fuel economy br In Krebs traveled to the United States to plead in the Selden Case associated with Henry Ford br br Krebs introduced many improvements in car design the steering wheel non reversible steering engine balance nickel steel alloys and other special steel alloys the shock absorber multi disc clutch the electric brake dynamometer for testing high performance engines the enveloping globoid worm gear differential br Also Krebs contributed significantly to improve the Systeme Panhard engine in front rear wheel drive which became universally adopted before World War II br In he became interested in the Knight patent sleeve valve engine and was first in France to build that type of engine which Panhard et Levassor would produce during the thirty years leading up to World War II br He made contributions to automotive racing with his powerful cars and motorboats br In Krebs invented the first elastomeric flexible coupling cf John Piotrowski It is known in French as the Flector joint This device is still widely used today in industry for power transmission as a tyre coupling br The truck was meant for military and civil purposes In jointly with the Chatillon Co Krebs designed the Tracteur Chatillon Panhard all terrain truck The truck had four wheel drive and four wheel steering and many were used during World War I as artillery tractors br Krebs also utilized his former military membership to supply the French Army with engines and vehicles including the Genty Armored car the St Chamond tank the Chatillon Panhard x truck and others br In the United Kingdom Antarctic Place Names Committee UK APC named Krebs Glacier a glacier flowing west into the head of Charlotte Bay on the west coast of Graham Land in the Antarctic continent after Krebs br br br Papers presented to the French Acad mie des sciences br August Krebs and Renard About the La France Dirigible br Krebs and Renard The La France Dirigible br Krebs Closed Magnetic Field system of the Telephone br Krebs Electric Engine Trials for a Submarine Boat br Krebs The First Electric Gyrocompass presented par M Dumoulin Froment br November Krebs The Automatic Carburettor br November Krebs The Electric Dynamometric Brake br January Krebs The Progressive Shock Absorber br Krebs The liquid flow measurement apparatus br In several months before Arthur Krebs s death he was made a Commandeur of the Legion of Honor for his work in Aeronautics and for his contributions to the
