force against its owner or operator In most places this is the most serious form of vehicle theft because assault also occurs and the method of taking over the vehicle is essentially a robbery a more serious form of theft In some carjackings the operators and passengers are forced from the vehicle while the thief is driving it In other incidents the operator and or passenger s are held hostage in it In still others which are less common the assailant forces the lawful operator to drive in accordance with the demands of the assailant who rides as a passenger br Fraudulent theft illegal acquisition of a vehicle from a seller through fraudulent transfer of funds that the seller will ultimately not receive such as by identity theft or counterfeiting a cashier s check or through the use

different jurisdictions Car rental companies and car dealerships are also defrauded by car thieves into renting selling financing or leasing them cars with fake identification checks and credit cards

making it impossible to unlock the car Car thieves extend the signal from the owner s key with the help of simple signal amplifiers and then all they have to do is open the door hit the start button and drive away unnoticed The car s alarm system is totally blind to this br br br Auto theft tools and paraphernalia br A thin metal strap or rod that slips inside a door s cavity at the base of the

most recent year of reported data For the people these countries represent there were a total cars stolen New Zealand has the highest auto theft rate for any fairly large country in the world at per residents in However Bermuda in its most recent year of reported auto thefts reported a rate of per people But the population of Bermuda is smaller than many cities in countries such as the US and Canada Some cities have higher rates than Bermuda such as Richmond California which had an auto theft rate of in br The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime notes that when using the figures any cross national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offenses in countries or the different methods of offense counting and recording Crime rates in certain neighborhoods or areas in each country may also be higher or lower than the nationwide rate Furthermore because the vehicle theft rates shown in the table below are per population not per vehicles countries with low vehicle ownership rates will appear to have lower theft rates even if the theft rate per vehicle is relatively high br br br Europe br According to Europol in motor vehicle crime networks were the most active in Germany Poland Portugal and Serbia with Serbia being the country where most stolen vehicles are stored and cloned before being
