The Chevrolet Corvette C is the second generation of the Corvette sports car produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors GM for the through model years br br br History br br br Origin and development br br The Sting Ray production car s lineage can be traced to two separate GM projects the Q Corvette and Bill Mitchell s racing Sting Ray The Q Corvette exercise of envisioned a smaller more advanced Corvette as a coupe only model boasting a rear transaxle independent rear suspension and four wheel disc brakes with the rear brakes mounted inboard Exterior styling was purposeful with peaked fenders a long nose and a short bobbed tail br Meanwhile Zora Arkus Duntov and other GM engineers had become fascinated with mid and rear engine designs Duntov explored the mid rear engine layout with the lightweight open wheel single seat CERV I concept of A rear engined Corvette was briefly considered during progressing as far as a full scale mock up designed around the Corvair s entire rear mounted power package including its air cooled flat six as an alternative to the Corvette s usual water cooled V By the fall of elements of the Q Corvette and the Sting Ray Special racer would be incorporated into experimental project XP which was the design program that led directly to the production Corvette Sting Ray The XP sought to deliver improved passenger accommodation more luggage space and superior ride and handling over previous Corvettes br While Duntov was developing an innovative new chassis for the Corvette designers were adapting and refining the basic look of the racing Sting Ray for the production model A fully functional space buck a wooden mock up created to work out interior dimensions was completed by early production coupe styling was locked up for the most part by April and the interior instrument panel included was in place by November Only in the fall of did the designers turn their creative attention to a new version of the traditional Corvette convertible and still later its detachable hardtop For the first time in the Corvette s history wind tunnel testing influenced the final shape as did practical matters like interior space windshield curvatures and tooling limitations Both body styles were extensively evaluated as production ready scale models at the Caltech wind tunnel br The vehicle s inner structure received as much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior Fiberglass outer panels were retained but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the Corvette The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer br br br Design and engineering br br The first ever production Corvette coupe sported a fastback body with a long hood and a raised windsplit that ran the length of the roof and continued down the back on a pillar that bisected the rear window into right and left halves The split backlite is usually attributed to Mitchell who claimed to have been inspired by the SC Bugatti Atlantique coupe The feature actually predated both the C Corvette and Bob McLean s Q Corvette having been used by Harley Earl on both his Oldsmobile Golden Rocket show car and his own more traditional design studies for the C Corvette some of which had progressed to full scale models Earl s inspiration was said to have been a Scaglione bodied Alfa Romeo coup shown at the Turin Auto Show A similar design would be used by the third generation Buick Riviera that ran from to br Quad headlamps were retained but newly hidden the first American car so equipped since the DeSoto The lamps were mounted in rotating housings that blended with the sharp edged front end when closed Hidden headlamps would be a feature of the Corvette until the C model debuted in Coupe doors were cut into the roof which made entry exit easier in such a low slung closed car Faux vents were located in the hood and on the coupe s rear pillars functional ones had been intended but were cancelled due to cost considerations br br The Sting Ray s interior carried a re interpretation of the twin cowl Corvette dash motif used since but a more practical one incorporating a roomy glovebox an improved heater and the cowl ventilation system A full set of round gauges included a huge speedometer and tachometer The control tower center console returned somewhat slimmer but now containing the clock and a vertically situated radio Luggage space was improved as well although due to the lack of an external trunklid cargo had to be loaded behind the seats The spare tire was located at the rear in a drop down fiberglass housing beneath the gas tank which now held US gal L imp gal instead of US gal L imp gal The large round deck emblem was newly hinged to double as a fuel filler flap replacing the previous left flank door br Though not as obvious as the car s radical styling the new chassis was just as important to the Sting Ray s success Maneuverability was improved thanks to the faster recirculating ball or Ball Race steering and a shorter wheelbase The latter might ordinarily imply a choppier ride but the altered weight distribution partly compensated for it Less weight on the front wheels also meant easier steering and with some additional pounds on the rear wheels the Sting Ray offered improved traction Stopping power improved too Four wheel cast iron inch drum brakes remained standard but were now wider for an increase in effective braking area Sintered metallic linings segmented for cooling were again optional So were Al Fin brake drums which not only provided faster heat dissipation and thus better fade resistance but less unsprung weight Power assist was available with both brake packages Evolutionary engineering changes included positive crankcase ventilation a smaller flywheel and an aluminum clutch housing A more efficient alternator replaced the old fashioned generator br br The independent rear suspension created by Duntov was derived from the CERV I concept and included a frame mounted differential with U jointed half shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring Rubber cushioned struts carried the differential which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion especially on rougher roads The transverse spring was bolted to the rear of the differential case A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it The half shafts functioned like upper control arms The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion while the trailing rods took care of fore aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame Shock absorbers were conventional twin tube units Considerably lighter than the old solid axle the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight which was important since the model would retain the previous generation s outboard rear brakes The new model s front suspension would be much as before with unequal length upper and lower A arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks plus a standard anti roll bar Steering remained the conventional recirculating ball steering design but it was geared at a higher overall ratio previously Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper essentially a shock absorber which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel What s more hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette except on cars with the two most powerful engines and offer a faster ratio which reduced lock to lock turns from to just br Drivetrains were carried over from the previous generation comprising four cu in cc small block V s three transmissions and six axle ratios Carbureted engines came in hp kW hp kW and hp kW versions As before the base and optional units employed hydraulic lifters a mild camshaft forged steel crankshaft compression single point distributor and dual exhausts The bhp engine produced its extra power via a larger four barrel carburetor Carter AFB instead of the s Carter WCFB plus larger intake valves and exhaust manifold Again topping the performance chart was a hp kW fuel injected V available for an extra The car s standard transmission remained the familiar three speed manual though the preferred gearbox continued to be the Borg Warner manual four speed changing over to the Muncie M during the model year delivered with wide ratio gears when teamed with the base and bhp engines and close ratio gearing with the top two powerplants Standard axle ratio for the three speed manual or two speed Powerglide automatic was The four speed gearbox came with a final drive but and gearsets were available The last was quite rare in production however br br Corvette s designers and engineers Ed Cole Duntov Mitchell and others knew that after years in its basic form albeit much improved it was time to move on By decade s end the machinery would be put into motion to fashion a fitting successor to debut for the model year After years of tinkering with the basic package Mitchell and his crew would finally break the mold of Harley Earl s original design once and for all He would dub the Corvette s second generation Sting Ray after the earlier race car of the same name br The C was designed by Larry Shinoda Pete Brock was also instrumental on the C under the direction of GM chief stylist Bill Mitchell Inspiration was drawn from several sources the contemporary Jaguar E Type one of which Mitchell owned and enjoyed driving frequently the radical Sting Ray Racer Mitchell designed in as Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing and a Mako shark Mitchell caught while deep sea fishing Duntov disliked the split rear window which also raised safety concerns due to reduced visibility and it was discontinued in as were the fake hood vents br br br Model year changes br br br br br The Corvette Sting Ray not only had a new design but also newfound handling prowess The Sting Ray was also a somewhat lighter Corvette so acceleration improved despite unchanged horsepower For the model year units would be built which was up percent from the record setting version Production was divided almost evenly between the convertible and the new coupe and respectively and more than half the convertibles were ordered with the optional lift off hardtop Nevertheless the coupe wouldn t sell as well again throughout the Sting Ray years The closed Corvette did not outsell the open one until by which time the coupe came with a T top featuring removable roof panels Equipment installations for began reflecting the market s demand for more civility in sporting cars The power brake option went into percent of production power steering into percent On the other hand only buyers specified the air conditioning leather upholstery a mere was ordered on only cars The cast aluminum knock off wheels manufactured for Chevy by Kelsey Hayes cost a set but few buyers checked off that option However almost Sting Rays left St Louis with the four speed manual gearbox better than four out of every five br All cars had cid engines which made hp standard with optional variants that made hp hp and hp The most powerful engine was the Rochester fuel injected engine Options available on the C included AM FM radio mid air conditioning and leather upholstery Also available for the first time ever on a Corvette was a special performance equipment package the RPO Z for These Corvettes came to be known as the Big Tanks because the package initially had a US gallon L imp gal gas tank versus the standard gallon for races such as Sebring and Daytona At first the package was only available on coupes because the oversized tank would not fit in the convertible br In only Z Corvettes were produced usually reserved for racing and of the a total of six were specifically created for Le Mans racing by Chevrolet One of the six Z Sting Rays was built late in to race at Riverside on October They were destined to compete in a different sort of race for sports cars a NASCAR sanctioned event on the famous Daytona Oval the Daytona American Challenge Cup This meant the cars needed to be prepared to a different set of rules the same as those for the big Grand National stock cars The chassis was modified extensively and an experimental cu in cc engine installed The car was lightened in every way possible and weighed just over lb kg Further prep was done by Mickey Thompson Among other changes Thompson replaced the fiberglass Z Big Tank with an even larger US gal L imp gal metal tank Driven by Junior Johnson plagued by rain in the race substitute driver Billy Krause finished third behind Paul Goldsmith s Pontiac Tempest and A J Foyt in another Corvette br New for the model year was an optional electronic ignition the breakerless magnetic pulse triggered Delcotronic first offered by Pontiac on some models br br br br br For Chevrolet made only evolutionary changes to the Corvette Due to concerns over rear visibility the coupe s two piece split rear window was dropped in favor of a single piece of arched glass Besides the coupe s backbone window the two simulated air intakes were eliminated from the hood though their indentations remained Also the decorative air exhaust vent on the coupe s rear pillar was made functional but only on the left side The car s rocker panel trim lost some of its ribs and gained black paint between those ribs that remained wheel covers were simplified and the fuel filler deck emblem gained concentric circles around its crossed flags insignia Inside the original color keyed steering wheel rim was now done in simulated walnut br A few suspension refinements were made for The front coil springs were changed from constant rate to progressive or variable rate and were more tightly wound at the top while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end The Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of Freon gas that absorbed heat Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the Corvette It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation br Drivetrain choices remained basically as before but the high performance pair received several noteworthy improvements The solid lifter unit was driven with a high lift long duration camshaft to produce hp kW and breathed through a big four barrel Holley carburetor instead of the base engine s Carter unit The fuel injected engine also gained horsepower kilowatts bringing its total to hp kW but at a then hefty Although transmission options remained ostensibly the same for the two Borg Warner T four speeds gave way to a similar pair of gearboxes built at GM s Muncie Indiana transmission facility Originally a Chevy design it had an aluminum case like the Borg Warner box but came with stronger synchronizers and wider ratios for better durability and drivability If enthusiast publications liked the first Sting Ray they loved the though some writers noted the convertible s tendency to rattle and shake on rough roads Sales of the Sting Ray reached another new Corvette record if up only a little from banner year Coupe volume dropped to units but convertible sales more than compensated rising to br br br br br For its third season the Corvette Sting Ray further cleaned up style wise and was muscled up with the addition of an all new braking system and larger power plants br styling alterations were subtle confined to a smoothed out hood now devoid of scoop indentations a trio of working vertical exhaust vents in the front fenders that replaced the previous nonfunctional horizontal speedlines restyled wheel covers and rocker panel moldings and minor interior trim revisions The Corvette Sting Ray became ferocious with the mid year debut of the Big Block cu in cc engine producing hp kW Ultimately this spelled the end for the Rochester fuel injection system as the carbureted ci hp option cost to the fuel injected ci hp s Few buyers could justify more for hp kW less even if the FI cars offered optional bigger brakes not available on carbureted models After only fuel injected cars were built in Chevrolet discontinued the option It would be years until it returned br also added another hp small block engine Option L which used hydraulic rather than solid lifters a milder camshaft and a modestly redesigned smaller oil pan Otherwise the hp engine was cosmetically and mechanically identical to the hp engine Option L solid lifter engine The smaller oil pan allowed this high output small block hp engine to be ordered with optional Power Steering for the first time amongst the optional stable of higher output small block engines Power steering was previously only available with the lower hp and hp engines br Four wheel disc brakes were also introduced in The brakes had a four piston design with two piece calipers and cooling fins for the rotors Pads were in frequent contact with the rotors but the resulting drag was negligible and did not affect fuel economy Further the light touching kept the rotors clean and did not diminish pad life which was in fact quite high a projected mi km for the front brakes and about twice that distance for the rear binders Total swept area for the new system was sq in cm a notable advance on the sq in cm of the previous all drum system Per pending federal regulation there was also a dual master cylinder with separate fluid reservoirs only on models with power brakes for for the front and rear lines Road testers rightly applauded the all disc brakes Testers found that repeated stops from mph km h produced no deterioration in braking efficiency and even the most sudden stops were rock stable The drum brakes remained available however as a credit option but only of the Corvettes built that year came with drums A side exhaust system appeared as an option as did a telescopic steering wheel Also available were alloy spinner wheels at US a set br br br br br For the Corvette the big block V came in two forms hp kW on compression and bhp via compression larger intake valves a bigger Holley four barrel carburetor on an aluminum manifold mechanical lifters and four instead of two hole main bearing caps Though it had no more horsepower than the previous high compression the cubic inch cc hp kW V packed a lot more torque lb ft N m vs lb ft N m In the s engine outputs were at times deliberately understated This happened for two reasons to placate nervous insurance companies and to allow the cars to qualify for lower NHRA brackets based on horsepower and weight Estimates of up to hp kW for the have been suggested as being closer to the truth Conversely power ratings in the sixties were done in SAE Gross Horsepower which is measured on an engine without accessories or air filter or restrictive stock exhaust manifold invariably giving a significantly higher rating than the engine actually produces when installed in the automobile SAE Net Horsepower is measured with all accessories air filters and factory exhaust system in place this is the standard that all US automobile engines have been rated at since With big block V s being the order of the day there was less demand for the so small block offerings were cut from five to two for and only the basic and bhp versions were retained Both required premium fuel on compression ratios well over and they didn t have the rocket like thrust of the s but their performance was impressive all the same As before both could be teamed with the Powerglide automatic the standard three speed manual or either four speed option br The model s frontal appearance was mildly altered with an eggcrate grille insert to replace the previous horizontal bars and the coupe lost its roof mounted extractor vents which had proven inefficient Corvettes also received an emblem in the corner of the hood for Head rests were a new option one of the rarest options was the Red Red Automatic option with power windows and air conditioning from factory which records show production numbered only convertibles and coupes This relative lack of change reflected plans to bring out an all new Corvette for It certainly did not reflect a fall off in the car s popularity however In fact would prove another record busting year with volume rising to units up some over s sales br br br br The Corvette Sting Ray was the last Corvette of the second generation and five years of refinements made it the best of the line Although it was meant to be a redesign year its intended successor the C was found to have some undesirable aerodynamic traits Duntov demanded more time in the wind tunnel to devise fixes before it went into production br Changes were again modest Five smaller front fender vents replaced the three larger ones and flat finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower less chunky appearance New was a single backup light mounted above the license plate The previous models wheel covers gave way to slotted six inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats The convertible s optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover which was a fad among all cars at the time br The was available with a ft min L s Rochester X barrel carburetors arrangement which the factory called Tri Power producing bhp PS kW at rpm and lb ft N m at rpm of torque The ultimate Corvette engine for was coded L even wilder than the L and was as close to a pure racing engine as Chevy had ever offered in regular production Besides the lightweight heads and bigger ports it came with an even hotter camshaft stratospheric compression an aluminum radiator small diameter flywheel and a single huge Holley four barrel carburetor Although the factory advertised L rating was bhp at rpm the true rating was said to be about bhp at rpm The very high compression ratio required octane racing fuel which was available only at select service stations Clearly this was not an engine for the casual motorist When the L was ordered Chevy made several individual options mandatory including Positraction the transistorized ignition heavy duty suspension and power brakes as well as RPO C which deleted the standard heater and defroster to cut down on weight and discourage the car s use on the street As costly as it was powerful at an additional over the base price the L engine and required options were sold to a mere buyers that year With potential buyers anticipating the car s overdue redesign sales for the Sting Ray s final year totaled down over units from results Meanwhile Chevrolet readied its third generation Corvette for the model year br br br Engines br br br Reviews br The Sting Ray was lauded in the automotive press almost unanimously for its handling road adhesion and sheer power br Car Life magazine bestowed its annual Award for Engineering Excellence on the Sting Ray Chevy s small block V the most consistent component of past Corvette performance was rated by the buff books to be even better in the Sting Ray The was noted to have an edge over past models in both traction and handling because the new independent rear suspension reduced wheel spin compared to the live axle cars br Motor Trend tested a four speed fuel injected version with axle They reported a mph in seconds and a second standing quarter mile at mph The magazine also recorded better than miles per gallon at legal highway speeds and mpg overall br Motor Trend timed a fuel injected four speed coupe with the rear axle aluminum knock off wheels perfected at last and available from the factory the sintered metallic brakes and Positraction through the quarter mile in seconds at mph and the to mph in seconds br Road Track tested the bhp Powerglide automatic setup in a coupe and recorded a mph time of seconds a quarter mile in seconds at mph and average fuel consumption of mpg br In Sports Car International named the Sting Ray number five on the list of Top Sports Cars of the s br br br Production notes br br br Gallery br br br Z br br Duntov first conceived of the Z in Despite GM s ongoing support of the AMA ban on factory racing involvement Duntov knew that individual customers would continue to race Corvettes so during the planning of the Sting Ray project he suggested that it would be a good idea to continue with parts development in order to benefit racers and as a way of surreptitiously circumventing the racing ban When GM management eventually withdrew their support of the ban Duntov and his colleagues created RPO Z as a special performance equipment package for the Corvette The Regular Production Option RPO was a GM internal ordering code designation The package was specifically designed for competition minded buyers so they could order a race ready Corvette straight from the factory with just one check of an option box Previously the optional racing parts were literally hidden in the order form so that only the most knowledgeable and perceptive customers could find them The Z package was first offered on the Corvette and included br br Front anti roll bar with a larger diameter br Vacuum brake booster br Dual master cylinder br Sintered metallic brake linings br Power assisted Al Fin drums cooled by front air scoops and vented backing plates br Larger diameter shocks and springs nearly twice as stiff as those on the standard Corvette br These Corvettes came to be known as Big Tanks because the package initially replaced the US gal L imp gal gas tank with a US gal L imp gal tank for races such as Sebring and Daytona At first the package was available only on coupes as the oversized tank would not fit in the convertible although the rest of the Z option package was later made available on convertibles as well br Thus the Corvette was technically the first Corvette that could be designated as Z The only engine option on the Z was the L cu in L engine using Rochester fuel injection With factory exhaust manifolds required to run the cars in the SCCA production classes Chevrolet rated the engine at hp kW The Z option cost an additional over the base coupe price of Chevrolet later lowered the package price and eliminated the larger gas tank from the Z package though it remained available as an add on option for any coupe All told Chevrolet produced of these original Z s br br br Grand Sport br br In Duntov initiated a program to produce a lightweight version based on a prototype that mirrored the new Corvette Concerned about Ford and the Shelby Cobra Duntov s program included plans to build examples of the Corvette Grand Sport to allow the model to be homologated for international Grand Touring races After the GM executives learned of the secret project the program was stopped and only five cars were built three coupes and two convertibles All five cars have survived and are in private collections They are among the most coveted and valuable Corvettes ever built not because of what they accomplished but because of what might have been br The cars were driven by famed contemporary race drivers such as Roger Penske A J Foyt Jim Hall and Dick Guldstrand among others Dick Thompson was the first driver to win a race in the Grand Sport He won a Sports Car Club of America race at Watkins Glen on August driving Grand Sport br Chassis is owned by former banker and car collector Harry Yeaggy of Cincinnati Ohio It was purchased for million in br Chassis is a part of the permanent collection at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia Pennsylvania The car is in running condition and is the only Grand Sport body which is original and unrestored Also on display are a replica body and a spare cubic inch engine which were commissioned by the car s previous owner Jim Jaeger for participation in vintage racing without damaging the original components br Chassis is owned by car collector Larry Bowman It was bought in for an undisclosed sum br Chassis is part of the Miles Collier Collection on display at The Revs Institute in Naples Florida This chassis was used in the Rolex Monterrey Motorsport Reunion in br Chassis is in the private collection of Bill Tower of Plant City Florida He was a former Corvette development engineer and also owns several historically significant Corvettes in his collection br The Corvette Grand Sports were raced with several different engines but the most serious factory engine actually used was a cubic inch displacement all aluminum small block with four Weber side draft carburetors and a cross ram intake rated hp kW at rpm Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure birdcage was aluminum rather than steel The ladder type frame utilized large seamless steel tubular side members connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes Another crossmember was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick up anchored the integral roll cage The frame was slightly stiffer than the Corvette production frame and was lb kg lighter A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about pounds less than the production coupe Initially the Grand Sport project was known simply as The Lightweight br br br Concept car br br The Corvette Rondine Ron di nay Italian for Swallow is a concept car based on a C chassis that was built for the Paris Auto Show It was designed by Tom Tjaarda of Pininfarina Originally fitted with a reverse slant rear windshield la the Citro n Ami and various large Mercurys this design was heavily criticized and in the winter of Tjaarda redesigned the rear part of the greenhouse with a more conventional windscreen The Rondine sold at Barrett Jackson for million dollars br br br See also br Corvette
