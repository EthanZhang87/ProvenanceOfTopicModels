id: 5977757
A backup camera also called a reversing camera or rear view camera is a video camera specifically designed to be attached to the rear of a vehicle to aid in reversing and reduce the rear blind spot The rear blind spot has been described as a killing zone due to the accidents it contributes to Backup cameras are usually connected to the vehicle s head unit display A common variant is a surround view system which assembles a synthetic but positionally accurate top down view of the vehicle and its surroundings br Backup cameras have been regulated by law in Canada and the United States since Since May of that year backup cameras have been required on all new vehicles sold in the United States br br br Function br The design of a backup camera is distinct from other cameras because the image is horizontally flipped to produce a mirror image This is necessary because the camera and the driver face opposite directions without this adjustment the camera s right would be on the driver s left and vice versa A mirrored image makes the orientation of the display consistent with the physical mirrors installed on the vehicle A backup camera typically utilizes a wide angle or fish eye lens Although such lenses may limit the camera s ability to capture distant objects they allow the camera to see an uninterrupted horizontal path from one rear corner to the other The camera is typically pointed at a downward angle to view potential obstacles on the ground br Backup cameras use dashboard screens that are also used with GPS navigation systems Inside the vehicle the display is typically wired to automatically activate when the transmission is set to reverse showing the backup view on the dashboard screen while the vehicle is in reverse and or providing grid guidelines to aid the driver br br br Variations br Backup cameras are produced in different varieties depending on the application br br Aftermarket additions Backup cameras can be added to vehicles that do not come with factory fitted systems They are available in both wired and wireless versions br Large vehicle systems For large vehicles such as motorhomes camera systems with built in servomechanisms allow the driver to remotely pan and tilt the camera br Wireless Backup Cameras These come with a wireless camera and receiver making them easier and cheaper to install br Built in audio intercoms Used in addition to the camera system for communicating with a spotter outside the vehicle common when backing large trailers or launching boats br Night vision cameras Use a series of infrared lights for backing in the dark when the vehicle s white reverse lights are insufficient br br Portable or semi permanent all in one camera systems Also known as dashboard cameras or dashcams these are typically sold for vehicles that don t have displays permanently installed in the dashboard Such systems consist of a small portable screen that can be affixed on the dashboard or on a rearview mirror and a length of wire to reach the cameras including a backup camera br Some backup and rear cameras are connected to displays on the rearview mirror and are used in vehicles to detect activity behind the car to avoid the tooling software hardware and testing costs associated with integrating the display feature in other areas of the vehicle br License plate frame versions Permit installation without any permanent vehicle modifications br Custom cameras Brake light cameras combine a camera with brake light functionality Some backup cameras also use LEDs surrounding the camera lens to illuminate the surroundings while in use br br br History br The first backup camera was used in the Buick Centurion concept car presented in January at the General Motors Motorama The vehicle had a rear mounted television camera that sent images to a TV screen on the dashboard in place of the rear view mirror br The Volvo Experimental Safety Car VESC also had a backup camera but this feature did not make it into the subsequent Volvo model br The first production automobile to incorporate a backup camera was the Toyota Soarer Limited UZZ and UZZ which was only available in Japan The Toyota system used a color EMV screen with a rear spoiler mounted CCD camera This system was discontinued in In April Nissan s Infiniti division introduced the Rear View Monitor on the Infiniti Q flagship sedan Using colored on screen guide lines as a parking distance parameter the Rear View Monitor operated from a license plate mounted camera in the trunk that transmitted a mirrored image to an inch in dash LCD screen It was available as optional equipment at the North American launch in March The Nissan Primera introduced the Rear View Monitor backup camera system to territories outside Japan and North America br Aftermarket options for cars have been available for some time with electronics manufacturers offering multiple car upgrades that can be installed by professionals without replacing the car s center console br br br Others types of camera Systems br br br Surround view cameras br br Infiniti introduced the first surround view cameras making the system available on the EX and marketing it as the Around View Monitor The system used four cameras located at the front back and sides of the vehicle feeding images to an image processing unit to create a synthetic but positionally accurate top down view of the car and its surroundings In most modern systems the pictures appear in such detail that it s difficult to believe they were not taken from above the vehicle br Other manufacturers have since offered similar systems such as Bird s Eye View Camera Toyota and Surround Vision Chevrolet br br br Side mirror cameras br First offered in October the Japanese market Lexus ES can be optioned with cameras as side view mirrors This feature is also offered on the Audi Q e tron and Hyundai Ioniq br br br Wireless backup camera br These advanced cameras do not require cables between the camera and the display functioning remotely They typically switch on automatically when the reverse gear is engaged Some models used solar energy for power The display can be powered from the volt socket on the car s dashboard and some models sync directly with a mobile phone via an app br br br Blind spot monitors and other technology br br Blind spot monitors may include Cross Traffic Alert which alerts drivers when traffic is approaching from the sides while backing out of a parking space br br br Mandates br In the United States the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of required the United States Department of Transportation to issue backup collision safety regulations within three years and require full compliance within four years after final rulemaking br The statutory deadline for issuing the final regulations was February However the USDOT repeatedly extended the deadline to analyze costs and benefits of the requirement In September Greg Gulbransen the father of the child after whom the law was named along with a group of consumers and advocates submitted a petition to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals demanding that the USDOT implement regulations on backup cameras within days About half of model year automobiles were equipped with backup cameras br On March three years past its deadline the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it would require all automobiles sold in the United States built beginning in May to include backup cameras On October Transport Canada issued a similar mandate beginning at the same time br br br See also br br br Notes br br br External links br br The danger of blind zones The area behind your vehicle can be a killing zone Consumer Reports Consumers Union March
