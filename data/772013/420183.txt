The McLaren F is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars and powered by the BMW S V engine The original concept was conceived by Gordon Murray who successfully convinced Ron Dennis to back the project and hired car designer Peter Stevens to design the exterior and interior of the car On March the XP prototype with a modified rev limiter set the Guinness World Record for the world s fastest production car reaching mph km h surpassing the modified Jaguar XJ s mph km h record from br The car features numerous proprietary designs and technologies it is lighter and has a more streamlined structure than many modern sports cars despite having one seat more than most similar sports cars with the driver s seat located in the centre and slightly forward of two passengers seating positions providing driver visibility superior to that of a conventional seating layout It was conceived as an exercise in creating what its designers hoped would be considered the ultimate road car Despite not having been designed as a track machine a modified race car edition of the vehicle won several races including the Hours of Le Mans where it faced purpose built prototype race cars Production began in and ended in In all cars were manufactured with some variations in the design br In the British car magazine Autocar stated in a road test regarding the F The McLaren F is the finest driving machine yet built for the public road They further stated The F will be remembered as one of the great events in the history of the car and it may possibly be the fastest production road car the world will ever see In Channel placed the car at number one on their list of the greatest cars calling it the greatest automotive achievement of all time In popular culture the McLaren F has earned its spot as The greatest automobile ever created and The Most Excellent Sports Car of All Time amongst a wide variety of car enthusiasts and lovers Notable past and present McLaren F owners include Lewis Hamilton Elon Musk Rowan Atkinson Jay Leno George Harrison Ralph Lauren Nick Mason and the Sultan of Brunei br In the April issue of Top Gear Magazine the McLaren F was listed as one of the fastest naturally aspirated cars currently available in the world and in the same league as more modern vehicles such as the Ferrari Enzo and Aston Martin One despite being produced and engineered years prior to the Ferrari Enzo and years prior to the Aston Martin One br br br Design and conception br br Chief engineer Gordon Murray s design concept was a common one among designers of high performance cars low weight and high power This was achieved through the use of high tech and expensive materials such as carbon fibre titanium kevlar magnesium and gold The F was the first production car to use a carbon fibre monocoque chassis br br Gordon Murray had been thinking of a three seat sports car since his youth When Murray was waiting for a flight home from the Italian Grand Prix in he drew a sketch of a three seater sports car and proposed it to Ron Dennis He pitched the idea of creating the ultimate road car a concept that would be heavily influenced by the company s Formula One experience and technology and thus reflect that skill and knowledge through the McLaren F br Murray declared that During this time we were able to visit Honda s Tochigi Research Centre with Ayrton Senna The visit related to the fact that at the time Honda powered McLaren s F Grand Prix chassis Although it s true I had thought it would have been better to put a larger engine the moment I drove the Honda NSX all the benchmark cars Ferrari Porsche Lamborghini I had been using as references in the development of my car vanished from my mind Of course the car we would create the McLaren F needed to be faster than the NSX but the NSX s ride quality and handling would become our new design target Being a fan of Honda engines I later went to Honda s Tochigi Research Centre on two occasions and requested that they consider building for the McLaren F a litre V or V I asked I tried to persuade them but in the end could not convince them to do it and the McLaren F ended up equipped with a BMW engine br A pair of Ultima MK kit cars chassis numbers and Albert and Edward the last two MK s were used as mules to test various components and concepts before the first cars were built Number was used to test the gearbox with a litre Chevrolet V plus various other components such as the seats and the brakes Number was the test of the V plus the exhaust and cooling system When McLaren was done with the cars they destroyed both of them to keep away the specialist magazines and because they did not want the car to be associated with kit cars br The car was first unveiled at a launch show on May at The Sporting Club in Monaco The production version remained the same as the original prototype XP except for the wing mirror which on the XP was mounted at the top of the A pillar This car was deemed not road legal as it had no indicators at the front McLaren was forced to make changes to the car as a result some cars including Ralph Lauren s were sent back to McLaren and fitted with the prototype mirrors The original wing mirrors also incorporated a pair of indicators which other car manufacturers would adopt several years later br The car s safety levels were first proved during testing in Namibia in April when a test driver wearing just shorts and a T shirt hit a rock and rolled the first prototype car several times and still managed to escape unscathed Later in the year the second prototype XP was specially built for crash testing and passed with the front wheel arch untouched br br br Engine br br br History br br Gordon Murray insisted that the engine for this car be naturally aspirated to increase reliability and driver control Turbochargers and superchargers increase power but they increase complexity and can decrease reliability as well as introduce an additional aspect of latency and loss of feedback The ability of the driver to maintain maximum control of the engine is thus compromised Murray initially approached Honda for a power plant rated at kW hp PS with mm in of block length and a total weight of kg lb it was required to be derived from the Formula One power plant in the then dominating McLaren Honda cars When Honda refused Isuzu then planning an entry into Formula One had a litre V engine being tested in a Lotus chassis The company was very interested in having the engine fitted into the F However the designers wanted an engine with a proven design and a racing pedigree br br br Specifications br Gordon Murray then approached BMW which took an interest and the motorsport division BMW M headed by engine expert Paul Rosche designed and built Murray a cc L cu in V engine called the BMW S br At kW hp PS and kg lb the BMW engine ended up more powerful and kg lb heavier than Gordon Murray s original specifications with the same block length br It has an aluminium alloy block and heads with bore x stroke of mm mm in in DOHC with variable valve timing a relatively new and unproven technology for the time for maximum flexibility of control over the valves per cylinder and a chain drive for the camshafts br The engine uses a dry sump oil lubrication system The carbon fibre body panels and monocoque required significant thermal insulation in the engine compartment so Murray s solution was to line the engine bay with a highly efficient heat reflector gold foil Approximately g ounce of gold was used in each car br The road version of the engine used a compression ratio of to produce a maximum power output of kW hp PS at rpm and N m lb ft of torque at rpm The engine s rev limiter is set at rpm In contrast to raw engine power a car s power to weight ratio is a better method of quantifying acceleration performance than the peak output of the vehicle s power plant The standard F achieves hp ton kW tonne or just hp lb br The cam carriers covers oil sump dry sump and housings for the camshaft control are made of magnesium castings The intake control features twelve individual butterfly valves and the exhaust system has four Inconel catalysts with individual Lambda Sondion controls The camshafts are continuously variable for increased performance using a system very closely based on BMW s VANOS variable valve timing system for the BMW M it is a hydraulically actuated phasing mechanism which retards the inlet cam relative to the exhaust cam at low revs which reduces the valve overlap and provides for increased idle stability and increased low speed torque At higher rpm the valve overlap is increased by computer control to degrees compare to degrees on the M for increased airflow into the cylinders and thus increased performance br To allow the fuel to atomise fully the engine uses two Lucas injectors per cylinder with the first injector located close to the inlet valve operating at low engine rpm while the second is located higher up the inlet tract operating at higher rpm The dynamic transition between the two devices is controlled by the ECU br Each cylinder has its own miniature ignition coil The closed loop fuel injection is sequential The engine has no knock sensor as the predicted combustion conditions would not cause this to be a problem The pistons are forged in aluminium br Every cylinder bore has a Nikasil coating giving it a high degree of wear resistance br From to the Le Mans winning BMW V LMR sports car used a similar S engine The engine was given a short development time causing the BMW design team to use only trusted technology from prior design and implementation experience The engine does not use titanium valves or connecting rods Variable intake geometry was considered but rejected on grounds of unnecessary complication br As for fuel consumption the engine achieves on average mpg L km at worst mpg L km and at best mpg L km br It was later revealed that BMW had used an E M Touring as a test mule in order to test the engine The existence of such a test mule was revealed when David Clark the director of McLaren road and race cars from disclosed this fact to motoring journalist Chris Harris in a podcast Clark also revealed that the prototype was kept out of the public eye and that BMW is still in possession of the prototype where it has been kept in their top secret prototype storage facility br br br Chassis and body br br The McLaren F was an early example of a production road car using a complete carbon fibre reinforced polymer CFRP monocoque chassis structure Aluminium and magnesium were used for attachment points for the suspension system inserted directly into the CFRP br The car features a central driving position the driver s seat is located in the middle ahead of the fuel tank and ahead of the engine with a passenger seat slightly behind and on each side The vehicle doors move up and out when opened and are thus of the butterfly or dihedral type Gordon Murray s design for the doors was inspired by the Toyota Sera br The engine produces high temperatures under full application and thus causes a high temperature variation in the engine bay from no operation to normal and full operation CFRP becomes mechanically stressed over time from high heat transfer effects and thus the engine bay was not constructed from CFRP br br br Aerodynamics br The overall drag coefficient on the standard McLaren F is Cd compared with Cd for the faster Bugatti Veyron and Cd for the SSC Ultimate Aero TT which was the fastest production car from to The vehicle s frontal area is CdA square metres sq ft and the S Cd figure is Because the McLaren F features active aerodynamics these are the figures presented in the most streamlined configuration br The standard McLaren F road car features no fixed wing to produce downforce compare to the LM and GTR editions however the overall design of the underbody of the McLaren F in addition to a rear diffuser exploits ground effect to improve downforce which is increased through the use of two electric Kevlar fans to further decrease the pressure under the car A high downforce mode can be turned on and off by the driver At the top of the vehicle there is an air intake to direct high pressure air to the engine with a low pressure exit point at the top of the very rear Under each door is a small air intake to provide cooling for the oil tank and some of the electronics The airflow created by the electric fans not only increases downforce but the airflow that is created is further exploited through design by being directed through the engine bay to provide additional cooling for the engine and the ECU At the front there are ducts assisted by a Kevlar electric suction fan for cooling the front brakes br There is a small dynamic rear spoiler on the tail of the vehicle which will adjust dynamically and automatically attempt to balance the centre of gravity of the car under braking which will be shifted forward when the brakes are applied Upon activation of the spoiler a high pressure zone is created in front of the flap and this high pressure zone is exploited two air intakes are revealed upon application that will allow the high pressure airflow to enter ducts that route air to aid in cooling the rear brakes The spoiler increases the overall drag coefficient from Cd to Cd and is activated at speeds equal to or above mph km h by brake line pressure br br br Suspension br Steve Randle who was the car s dynamicist was appointed responsible for the design of the suspension system of the McLaren F It was decided that the ride should be comfortable yet performance oriented but not as stiff and low as that of a true track machine as that would imply a reduction in practical use and comfort as well as increasing noise and vibration which would be a contradictory design choice in relation to the former set premise the goal of creating the ultimate road car br From inception the design of the F had a strong focus on weight distribution by extensive manipulation of placement of among other things the engine fuel and driver allowing for a low polar moment of inertia in yaw The F has of its weight at the front and at the rear this figure changes less than with the fuel load br The distance between the mass centroid of the car and the suspension roll centre was designed to be the same front and rear to avoid unwanted weight transfer effects Computer controlled dynamic suspension was considered but not applied due to the inherent increase in weight complexity and loss of predictability of the vehicle br Damper and spring specifications mm in bump mm in rebound with bounce frequency at Hz at the front and Hz at the rear Despite being sports oriented these figures imply a soft ride and inherently decrease track performance As can be seen from the McLaren F LM and the McLaren F GTR track variants the track performance potential is much higher than that in the standard F road car due to the fact that the car should be comfortable and usable in everyday conditions br The suspension is a double wishbone system with an unusual design Longitudinal wheel compliance is included without loss of wheel control which allows the wheel to travel backwards when it hits a bump increasing the comfort of the ride br Caster wind off at the front during braking is handled by McLaren s proprietary Ground Plane Shear Centre the wishbones on either side in the subframe are fixed in rigid plane bearings and connected to the body by four independent bushings which are times more stiff radially than axially This solution provides for a caster wind off measured to degrees per g of braking deceleration Compare the Honda NSX at degrees per g the Porsche S at degrees per g and the Jaguar XJ at degrees per g respectively The difference in toe and camber values is also very small under lateral force application The Inclined Shear Axis is used at the rear of the machine and provides measurements of degrees per g of change in toe in under braking and degrees per g of toe out under traction br When developing the suspension system the facility of electro hydraulic kinematics and compliance at AB Dynamics was employed to measure the performance of the suspension on a Jaguar XJR a Porsche S and a Honda NSX to use as references br Steering knuckles and the top wishbone bell crank are also specially manufactured in an aluminium alloy The wishbones are machined from a solid aluminium alloy with CNC machines br br br Tyres br The McLaren F uses ZR front tyres and ZR rear tyres These are specially designed and developed solely for the McLaren F by Goodyear Michelin Avon and Pirelli The tyres are mounted on by in by mm front and by in by mm rear five spoke cast magnesium wheels coated with a protective paint and secured by magnesium retention pins br The turning circle from kerb to kerb is m ft allowing the driver turns from lock to lock br br br Brakes br The F features unassisted vented and cross drilled brake discs made by Brembo The Front size is mm in and the rear mm in The calipers are all four pot opposed piston types and are made of aluminium The rear brake calipers do not feature any handbrake functionality however there is a mechanically actuated fist type calipers which is computer controlled and thus serve as a handbrake br To increase caliper stiffness the calipers are machined from a single solid piece of metal in contrast to the more common being bolted together from two halves Pedal travel is slightly over one inch Activation of the rear spoiler will allow the air pressure generated at the back of the vehicle to force air into the cooling ducts located at either end of the spoiler which become uncovered upon application of it br Servo assisted ABS brakes were ruled out as they would imply increased mass complexity and reduced brake feel however at the cost of increasing the required skill of the driver br Gordon Murray attempted to utilise carbon brakes for the F but found the technology to be not advanced enough at the time with one of the major culprits being that of a proportional relationship between brake disc temperature and friction i e stopping power thus resulting in relatively poor brake performance without an initial warm up of the brakes before use br Since carbon brakes have a more simplified application envelope in pure racing environments this allows for the racing edition of the car the F GTR to feature ceramic carbon brakes br br br Gearbox and powertrain br The standard McLaren F has a transverse speed manual gearbox with an AP carbon triple plate clutch contained in an aluminium housing The gearbox was developed in collaboration with Weismann transmissions in California The second generation GTR edition has a magnesium housing Both the standard edition and the McLaren F LM have the following gear ratios with a final drive of although the final gear is offset from the side of the clutch The Torsen Limited Slip Differential has a lock The sixth gear ratio allows for a longer cruise at km h mph per rpm br The McLaren F has an aluminium flywheel that has only the dimensions and mass absolutely needed to allow the torque from the engine to be transmitted This is done in order to decrease rotational inertia and increase the responsiveness of the drivetrain resulting in faster gear changes and better throttle feedback This is possible due to the F engine lacking secondary vibrational couples and featuring a torsional vibration damper by BMW br br br Interior and equipment br br Standard equipment for the McLaren F includes full cabin air conditioning a rarity on most sports cars and a system design which Murray again credited to the Honda NSX a car he had owned and driven himself for years without ever needing to change the AC automatic setting Further comfort features included SeKurit electric defrost demist windscreen and side glass electric window lifts remote central locking Kenwood disc CD stereo system cabin access release for opening panels cabin storage compartment four lamp high performance headlight system rear fog and reversing lights courtesy lights in all compartments map reading lights and a gold plated Facom titanium tool kit and first aid kit both stored in the car In addition tailored proprietary luggage bags specially designed to fit the vehicle s carpeted storage compartments including a tailored golf bag were standard equipment Airbags are not present in the car Each customer was given a special edition TAG Heuer Chronometer wristwatch with its serial number scripted below the centre stem br All features of the F were according to Gordon Murray obsessed over including the interior The metal plates fitted to improve the aesthetics of the cockpit are claimed to be thousandths of an inch mm thick to save weight br The driver s seat of the McLaren F is custom fitted to the specifications desired by the customer for optimal fit and comfort the seats are handmade from CFRP and covered in light Connolly leather By design the F steering column cannot be adjusted however prior to production each customer specifies the exact preferred position of the steering wheel and thus the steering column is tailored by default to those owner settings The same holds true for the pedals which are not adjustable after the car has left the factory but are tailored to each specific customer br During its pre production stage McLaren commissioned Kenwood the team s supplier of radio equipment to create a lightweight car audio system for the car Kenwood between and used the F to promote its products in print advertisements calendars and brochure covers Each car s audio system was specially designed to tailor to an individual s listening taste however radio was omitted because Murray felt it wasn t necessary br br br Purchase and maintenance br Only cars were manufactured prototypes XP XP XP XP XP road versions F tuned developmental prototype XP LM tuned versions LM longtail developmental prototype XPGT longtail versions GT and racecars GTR Production began in and ended in At the time of production each car took around three and a half months to make br Although production stopped in McLaren still maintains an extensive support and service network for the F Every standard F has a modem which allows customer care to remotely fetch information from the ECU of the car in order to assist the customer in the event of a mechanical vehicle failure There are eight authorised service centres throughout the world and McLaren will on occasion fly a specialised technician to the owner of the car or the service centre All of the technicians have undergone dedicated training in service of the McLaren F In cases where major structural damage has occurred the car can be returned to McLaren directly for repair br br br Performance br The F remains one of the fastest production cars ever made as of October it is outmatched by very few cars including the Bugatti Veyron and the Bugatti Chiron br However all of the higher top speed machines use forced induction to reach their respective top speeds whereas the McLaren F is naturally aspirated To date the F holds the record for fastest naturally aspirated production car a record it has held for almost years br br br Braking and handling br mph km

Record claims br In August McLaren tested the XP prototype which was limited to kW hp PS at the Nard Ring They calculated a top speed of mph km h from the data recording inside the car br The British magazine Autocar was given access and tested the XP prototype in May They wrote Had we enough tarmac we have no doubt that it would finally stop accelerating at its rev limiter in top which taking tyre growth into account would be somewhere the far side of mph km h br Car and Driver wrote in their August issue Courtesy of Autocar Motor written in the box with performance numbers br Top speed The F runs into the rpm redline in sixth at mph km h but it s still accelerating Gordon Murray the F s designer is convinced that with taller gearing the car is capable of at least mph km h br On March Andy Wallace drove the five year old XP prototype at Volkswagen s test track in Ehra Lessien setting a new production car world record The record consisted of an independently measured mph km h two way average peak speed mph km h measured by McLaren with the rev limiter raised to rpm br As of the F remains the fastest naturally aspirated production car in the world a record that has been held for years Although its speed record has been passed the cars that have surpassed it use forced induction engines br br br Motorsports br br Following its initial launch as a road car motorsports teams convinced McLaren to build racing versions of the F to compete in international series Three different versions of the race car were developed from to br Some of the F GTRs after the cars were no longer eligible for international racing series were converted to street use By adding mufflers and passenger seats adjusting the suspension for more ground clearance for public streets and removing the air restrictors the cars were able to be registered for road use br br br F GTR br br Built at the request of race teams such as those owned by Ray Bellm and Thomas Bscher in order to compete in the BPR Global GT Series the McLaren F GTR was a custom built race car which introduced a modified engine management system that increased power output however air restrictors mandated by racing regulations reduced the power back to kW hp PS at rpm The car s list of modifications included changes to body panels suspension aerodynamics and the interior The F GTR would go on to take its greatest achievement with first third fourth fifth and th places in the Hours of Le Mans beating out custom built prototype sports cars When Mark Blundell who finished fourth in the race was asked what the F GTR was like to drive during the wet race he said Well it was never designed to be a race car so in many respects it wasn t the best balanced car in the world The saving grace of the car was the BMW V engine It was incredibly impressive in that you could be in th gear at rpm and the thing would just pull like a train And in the wet that is great as you can run a higher gear and it cuts out some of that traction issue But in terms of balance overall it was always a bit top heavy so the centre of gravity wasn t ideal And aerodynamically it wasn t quite there but it did the job br In total nine F GTRs were built for the season br The F GTR created so much downforce that it was claimed to be able to drive upside down along a ceiling at mph km h br br br F GTR br br To follow up on the success of the F GTR in McLaren further developed the model leading to a size increase but a weight decrease Nine more F GTRs were built to spec while some cars were still campaigned by privateers F GTR chassis R is notable as being the first non Japanese car to win a race in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship JGTC The car was driven by David Brabham and John Nielsen The weight was reduced to around kg lb from the GTR but the engine was kept de tuned at kW hp PS to comply with racing regulations br br br F GTR br br With three F GT homologation street versions produced McLaren could now develop the F GTR for the season Weight was further reduced and a sequential gearbox was added The engine was slightly destroked to L instead of the previous L Due to the heavily modified bodywork the F GTR is often referred to as the Longtail thanks to the rear bodywork being extended to increase downforce A total of ten F GTRs were built for the season The weight was reduced to a total of kg lb br br br Variants br br The McLaren F road car of which were originally sold saw several different modifications over its production span which were badged as different models The company maintains a database to match up prospective sellers and buyers of the cars br br br Prototypes br br Prior to the sale of the first McLaren F s five prototypes were built carrying the numbers XP through XP These cars carried minor subtle differences between each other as well as between the production road cars Contrary to common misunderstanding XP the first ever running prototype was never publicly unveiled The XP was never painted with a bare carbon fibre exterior and was later destroyed in an accident in Namibia The car unveiled at the Monaco event was actually a Clinic Model aesthetically convincing but without a powertrain XP was used for crash testing sporting a blue colour during the test and also destroyed As it was a crash test car it didn t have full interior equipment or a powertrain XP did durability testing XP stress tested the gearbox system and XP was a publicity car The XP used to be owned by Gordon Murray before being sold to a private buyer XP was seen by viewers of Top Gear when reviewed by Tiff Needell in the mid s and later on sold to a private owner while XP went on to be used in McLaren s famous top speed run and is still owned by McLaren br br br Ameritech br Seven McLaren F s were imported by Ameritech and modified in order to be federalized for road use in the United States These modifications include the deletion of side seats the replacement of headlights a heightened bumper and dampened performance figures including handling and braking compared to the European F due to road legality issues It weighs in at kg lb br br br Performance br Performance figures are lower than a regular F in all aspects apart from mph km h relating to performance As Mario Andretti noted in a top speed comparison test after hitting the rev limiter at mph km h on Ameritech F the Ameritech F is fully capable of pulling a seventh gear thus with a higher gear ratio or a seventh gear the car would probably be able to reach an even greater top speed br br br F LM br br The McLaren F LM LM for Le Mans is a series of five special cars which were built in honour of the five McLaren F GTRs which finished the Hours of Le Mans including the winning car br The weight was reduced by approximately kg lb to a total of kg lb achieved by having no interior noise suppression no audio system a stripped down base interior no fan assisted ground effect and no dynamic rear wing The car also had a different transaxle various aerodynamic modifications specially designed in mm magnesium alloy wheels and an upgraded gearbox The F LM used the same engine as the F GTR but without race mandated restrictors to produce kW hp PS It had a top speed of mph km h which is less than the standard version because of added aerodynamic drag despite identical gear ratios In the place of the small dynamic rear wing there is a considerably larger fixed CFRP rear wing mounted on the back of the vehicle br The LM has the following specifications br br Peak torque of N m lbf ft at rpm br Peak power of kW hp PS at rpm br A redline at rpm br Total weight of kg lb which gives the car an kW hp PS per litre ratio br While McLaren has never claimed specific acceleration figures for the LM Motor Trend recorded traction limited times of mph in seconds and mph in seconds The LM was once the holder of the mph record which it completed in seconds when driven by Andy Wallace at the disused airbase RAF Alconbury in Cambridgeshire br The F LMs can be identified by their Papaya Orange paint They were painted in this colour in memory of and tribute to Bruce McLaren whose race colour was Papaya Orange Two of the chassis were painted in Black with Grey trim similar to the Ueno Clinic sponsored Le Mans Hours winning car These cars were bought by the Sultan of Brunei and as such also feature horizontal stripes down the sides in yellow red and blue br Although only five F LMs were sold a sixth chassis exists in the form of XP LM the prototype for modifications to the existing F to form the new F LM This car is also painted Papaya Orange and is retained by McLaren br br br F High Downforce Kit HDK br br Two standard F s were upgraded to LM specification These have chassis numbers and The engines were upgraded to unrestricted GTR specification resulting in a power output of kW hp PS and had the High Downforce Kit HDK added to them Their interiors were made more comfortable over the F LM The car having chassis number had upgrades to the air conditioning units the headlamps changed to a gas discharge type and the steering wheel changed to a inch unit Moreover race specification dampers and springs set to the softest settings for comfortable road use were added inch GTR wheels were used instead of the standard inch and the tyres used are Michelin Pilot Sport units br br br F GT br br The final and rarest incarnation of the road car the F GT was meant as a homologation special With increased competition from homologated sports cars from Porsche and Mercedes Benz in the former BPR Global GT Series and the new FIA GT Championship McLaren required extensive modification to the F GTR in order to remain competitive These modifications were so vast that McLaren would be required to build a production road legal car on which the new race cars would be based br The F GT featured the same extended rear bodywork as the GTRs for increased downforce and reduced drag yet lacked the rear wing that had been seen on the F LM The downforce generated by the longer tail was found to be sufficient to not require the wing The front end was also similar to the racing car with extra louvers and the wheel arches widened to fit larger wheels The interior was modified and a racing steering wheel was included in place of the standard unit br The F GTs were built from standard F road car chassis retaining their production numbers The developmental prototype GT known as XPGT was F chassis XP was painted dark green Silverstone green and is owned by a private collector in Switzerland The company technically only needed to build one car and did not even have to sell it However demand from customers drove McLaren to build two production versions that were sold the customer F GTs were chassis and was painted black and is owned by the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah while was painted burgundy and is owned by the ZAZ Museum in Japan It weighs kg lb kg lb lighter than the standard F and has a top speed of over mph km h although this was never tested br br br See also br Production
