Overhangs are the lengths of a road vehicle which extend beyond the wheelbase at the front and rear They are normally described as front overhang and rear overhang Practicality style and performance are affected by the size and weight of overhangs br br br Characterization br Along with clearance length of overhangs affects the approach and departure angles which measure the vehicle s ability to overcome steep obstacles and rough terrain The longer the front overhang the smaller is the approach angle and thus lesser the car s ability to climb or descend steep ramps without damaging the front bumpers Typically the rear overhang is larger on rear wheel drive cars while the front overhang is larger on front wheel drive cars br br Overhangs in the case of rolling stock are the lengths from the bogie pivots to the ends of the car or in the case of two axles the distances outside of the wheelbase to the ends of the car br Journalist Paul Niedermeyer has proposed an overhang ratio OHR to characterize the combined size of the front and rear overhangs normalized to vehicle length computed as br br br br O br H br R br br br br br br br l br e br n br g br t br h br br w br h br e br e br l br b br a br s br e br br br br br l br e br n br g br t br h br br br br br br displaystyle OHR frac left length wheelbase right length br br Because most vehicles are styled so the wheelbase is typically equal to four wheel tyre diameters the minimum OHR with no bodywork projecting beyond the front or rear wheels is approximately br br br Advantages br Large overhangs contribute to large vehicle dimensions and the associated advantages of size On front engined saloon sedans measuring rear overhang is helpful in predicting the size of the trunk For these same vehicles large front overhangs can accommodate larger engines Large overhangs also contribute to safety due to increased bulk as well as space for crumple zones that provide defense for passengers in frontal and rear collisions br br The Porsche produced since has always contained its entire flat engine within its rear overhang with the center of mass of the engine outside of the wheelbase In the case of the the rear mounted engine allows for increased practicality in the form of a small rear row of seats that would be impossible with a mid engined sports car br br br Disadvantages br br Excessive weight that is concentrated outside of the wheelbase can interfere with accurate negotiation of corners at high speed The rear engined Porsche with its engine far in the rear was notorious for dangerous oversteer in its early days and cars with engines far in the front often suffered from the opposite problem of understeer for which many old American cars with heavy V engines were infamous Front engined Ferraris such as the Ferrari Scaglietti place their engines within the wheelbase so as to avoid the problem of understeer Reducing overhanging weight in sports cars is usually a priority with the notable exception of the br br In contrast the excellent handling of the Mini with its wheels pushed far out at each corner can be partly credited to its small overhang The classic Mini and New MINI are both automobiles with very little overhang and thus handle very well under extreme conditions The minimal overhang gives the Mini its bulldog like stance br Rear overhang may present a problem in large vehicles such as buses Long rear overhang would require the driver to pay attention to nearby vehicles when turning at degrees Since the rear overhang is outside the wheelbase it may hit a vehicle in the adjacent lane especially when turning degrees right in a right hand drive country br Also some specialized vehicles such as the AM General HMMWV and the related Hummer H are designed with no frontal overhang allowing it to possess incredible abilities such as climbing vertical walls This does however place these vehicles front wheels as the furthest forward point of the vehicle which can lead to disastrous results in the event of a frontal collision br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Ideal handling characteristics
