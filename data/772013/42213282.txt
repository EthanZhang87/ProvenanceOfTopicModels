title: Breakover angle
id: 42213282
Breakover angle or rampover angle is the maximum possible supplementary angle usually expressed in degrees that a vehicle with at least one forward wheel and one rear wheel can drive over without the apex of that angle touching any point of the vehicle other than the wheels This definition is contingent upon the wheels being in continuous contact with the supporting surface s Breakover angle differs from ground clearance which is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle br br br Relevance br br Breakover angle is a relevant performance metric in many common vehicle scenarios including br br Off roading br Loading a vehicle onto a higher surface with a ramp br Going over raised railroad crossings br Going over speed bumps br Going over linkspans and ferry slips br If a vehicle drives over a breakover angle larger than what it is capable of clearing the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from continuing any further in its direction of travel possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle br br br Calculation br Assuming no tire deflection and assuming an ideal breakover angle scenario two flat surfaces coming to a point a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection etc an approximation for the breakover angle of a vehicle can be calculated as follows br br br br br br br breakover angle br br br a br p br p br r br o br x br i br m br a br t br e br br br br br br arctan br br br br br br br br br br ground clearance br br br wheelbase br br br br br br br displaystyle text breakover angle approximate cdot arctan left frac cdot text ground clearance text wheelbase right br br br br See also br br br br br br External links br HowStuffWorks The Physics of Off Roading
