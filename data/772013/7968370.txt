id: 7968370
Dry steering is the act of turning the steering wheel of a vehicle while the vehicle is stationary This can be exceptionally difficult in the absence of power steering br For the wheel s that steer the vehicle most often the front this causes increased wear to the area of the tyre in contact with the ground compared with the typical wear when driving in motion This is because whilst the wheels are not rotating turning the steering causes one spot of the tyre to scrape against the ground in a rotational manner br Due to the increased tyre wear from dry steering it is considered poor driving practice to do this unless completely necessary Usually the only time it s required is for precise manoeuvring of the vehicle when there is not much space The most common example is when parallel parking br Sometimes called tyre scrubbing it also occurs during tight steering at low speeds and can be identified by a high pitched noise from the tyres scraping against the ground similar to the sound of wheelspin br This term should not be confused with the racing technique of scrubbing in fresh tyres which are afterwards referred to as scrubbed tyres br You can see the result of dry steering as concentric circular rubber marks on the ground around parallel parking bays and car parks as well as a similar wear pattern on the tyre br br br br Keith Lane Automotive A Z Lane s Complete Dictionary of Automotive Terms Veloce Publishing Ltd pp ISBN
