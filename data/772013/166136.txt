id: 166136
A vehicle identification number VIN also called a chassis number or frame number is a unique code including a serial number used by the automotive industry to identify individual motor vehicles towed vehicles motorcycles scooters and mopeds as defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO content and structure and ISO location and attachment br There are vehicle history services in several countries that help potential car owners use VINs to find vehicles that are defective or have been written off br br br History br VINs were first used in in the United States From to there was no accepted standard for these numbers so different manufacturers and even divisions within a manufacturer used different formats By GM had settled on a digit VIN and standardized its VIN format across its divisions in br In the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the United States standardized the format It required all on road vehicles sold to contain a character VIN which does not include the letters O o I i and Q q to avoid confusion with numerals and br After the introduction of the ISO norm the manufacturers which produced vehicles for the American market very quickly adjusted to this standard The ISO introduced recommendations for applying the VIN standard and its structure and the VIN was also used in Europe However the sets of information contained in it were introduced gradually For example Volkswagen started to encode bigger chunks of information during and the control digit during for selected models from the group The VIN control digit is also used although not in all brand models In the European vehicles it can be found e g in Audi A br br br Classification br There are at least four competing standards used to calculate the VIN br br FMVSS Part Used in United States and Canada br ISO Used in Europe and many other parts of the world br SAE J Very similar to the ISO standard br ADR used in Australia referring to ISO and br br br Components br Modern VINs are based on two related standards originally issued by the International Organization for Standardization ISO in and ISO and ISO respectively Compatible but different implementations of these ISO standards have been adopted by the European Union and the United States br The VIN comprises the following sections br br br World manufacturer identifier br The first three characters uniquely identify the manufacturer of the vehicle using the world manufacturer identifier or WMI code A manufacturer who builds fewer than vehicles per year uses a as the third digit and the th th and th position of the VIN for a second part of the identification Some manufacturers use the third character as a code for a vehicle category e g bus or truck a division within a manufacturer or both For example within G assigned to General Motors in the United States G represents Chevrolet passenger cars G Pontiac passenger cars and GC Chevrolet trucks br The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE in the US assigns WMIs to countries and manufacturers br The first character of the WMI is typically the region in which the manufacturer is located although there are exceptions e g the WMI SA was assigned to Tesla Inc in the United States in In practice each is assigned to a country of manufacture although in Europe the country where the continental headquarters is located can assign the WMI to all vehicles produced in that region Example Opel Vauxhall cars whether produced in Germany Spain the United Kingdom or Poland carry a WMI of W L because Adam Opel AG is based in R sselsheim Germany br In the notation below assume that letters precede numbers and that zero is the last number For example X denotes the range X Y Z excluding br br br Country or region codes br br br Vehicle descriptor section br The fourth to ninth positions in the VIN are the vehicle descriptor section or VDS This is used according to local regulations to identify the vehicle type and may include information on the automobile platform used the model and the body style Each manufacturer has a unique system for using this field Most manufacturers since the s have used the eighth digit to identify the engine type whenever there is more than one engine choice for the vehicle Example for the Chevrolet Corvette U is for a liter V engine and E is for a liter V br br br North American check digits br One element that is inconsistent is the use of position nine as a check digit compulsory for vehicles in North America and China but not Europe br br br Vehicle identifier section br The th to th positions are used as the vehicle identifier section or VIS This is used by the manufacturer to identify the individual vehicle in question This may include information on options installed or engine and transmission choices but often is a simple sequential number br br br Model year encoding br The North American implementation of the VIS uses the th digit to encode the model year of the vehicle Besides the three letters that are not allowed in the VIN itself I O and Q the letters U and Z and the digit are not used for the model year code Outside North America the th digit is usually br The year was encoded by some manufacturers especially General Motors and Chrysler as A since the digit VIN was not mandatory until and the A or zero was in the manufacturer s pre placement in the VIN yet Ford and AMC still used a zero for Subsequent years increment through the allowed letters so that Y represents the year to are encoded as the digits to and subsequent years are encoded as A B C etc br br On April the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a final rule amending CFR Part so that the current character vehicle identification number VIN system which has been in place for almost years can continue in use for at least another years in the process making several changes to the VIN requirements applicable to all motor vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States There were three notable changes to the VIN structure that affect VIN deciphering systems br br The make may only be identified after looking at positions one through three and another position as determined by the manufacturer in the second section or fourth to eighth segment of the VIN br In order to identify the exact year in passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of or less one must read position as well as position For passenger cars and for multipurpose passenger vehicles and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of lb kg or less if position seven is numeric the model year in position of the VIN refers to a year in the range If position seven is alphabetic the model year in position of VIN refers to a year in the range br The model year for vehicles with a GVWR greater than lb kg as well as buses motorcycles trailers and low speed vehicles may no longer be identified within a year range VIN characters and that were assigned from to can be repeated beginning with the model year br br br Plant code br Compulsory in North America and China is the use of the th character to identify the assembly plant at which the vehicle was built Each manufacturer has its own set of plant codes br br br Production number br In the United States and China the th to th digits are the vehicle s serial or production number This is unique to each vehicle and every manufacturer uses its own sequence br br br Check digit calculation br A check digit validation is used for all road vehicles sold in the United States and Canada br When trying to validate a VIN with a check digit first either a remove the check digit for the purpose of calculation or b use a weight of zero see below to cancel it out The original value of the check digit is then compared with the calculated value If the calculated value is the check digit must match the calculated value If the calculated value is the check digit must be X If the two values do not match and there was no error in the calculation then there is a mistake in the VIN However a match does not prove the VIN is correct because there is still a chance that any two distinct VINs have a matching check digit for example the valid VINs GZCZ D S correct with leading five and SGZCZ D S incorrect with leading character S The VINs in the Porsche image WP ZZZ ZTS and the GM T body image KLATF Y VB do not pass the North American check digit verification br br br Transliterating the numbers br Transliteration consists of removing all of the letters and replacing them with their appropriate numerical counterparts These numerical alternatives based on IBM s EBCDIC are in the following chart I O and Q are not allowed in a valid VIN for this chart they have been filled in with N A not applicable Numerical digits use their own values br br S is and not There is no left alignment linearity br br br Weights used in calculation br The following is the weight factor for each position in the VIN The th position is that of the check digit It has been substituted with a which will cancel it out in the multiplication step br br br Worked example br Consider the hypothetical VIN M GDM A KP where the underscore will be the check digit br br The VIN s value is calculated from the above transliteration table This number is used in the rest of the calculation br Copy the weights from the weight factor row above br The products row is the result of the multiplication of the columns in the Value and Weight rows br The products are all added together to yield a sum br Find the remainder after dividing by MOD br The remainder is the check digit If the remainder is the check digit is X In this example the remainder is so the check digit is transliterated as X br With a check digit of X the VIN M GDM A KP is written M GDM AXKP br A VIN with straight ones seventeen consecutive s has the nice feature that its check digit matches the calculated value This is because a value of one multiplied by sum of weights is and divided by is with remainder thus is the check digit This is a way to test a VIN check algorithm br br br VIN scanning br The VIN is marked in multiple locations normally in the lower corner of the windshield on the driver s side under the bonnet next to latch at the front end of the vehicle frame and inside the door pillar on the driver s side On newer vehicles VINs may be optically read with barcode scanners or digital cameras or digitally read via OBD II There are smartphone applications that can pass the VIN to websites to decode the VIN br br br List of common WMI br The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE assigns the WMI world manufacturer identifier to countries and manufacturers The following
