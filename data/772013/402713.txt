A windscreen wiper Commonwealth English or windshield wiper American English is a device used to remove rain snow ice washer fluid water or debris from a vehicle s front window Almost all motor vehicles including cars trucks buses train locomotives and watercraft with a cabin and some aircraft are equipped with one or more such wipers which are usually a legal requirement br A wiper generally consists of a metal arm one end pivots and the other end has a long rubber blade attached to it The arm is powered by a motor often an electric motor although pneumatic power is also used for some vehicles The blade is swung back and forth over the glass pushing water other precipitation or any other impediments to visibility from its surface The speed is usually adjustable on vehicles made after with several continuous rates and often one or more intermittent settings Most personal automobiles use two synchronized radial type arms while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms br On some vehicles a windscreen washer system is also used to improve and expand the function of the wiper s to dry or icy conditions This system sprays water or an antifreeze window washer fluid at the windscreen using several well positioned nozzles This system helps remove dirt or dust from the windscreen when used in concert with the wiper blades When antifreeze washer fluid is used it can help the wipers remove snow or ice For these types of winter conditions some vehicles have additional heaters aimed at the windows embedded heating wire s in the glass or embedded heating wire s in the wiper blade these defroster systems can melt ice or help to keep snow and ice from building up on the windscreen Less frequently miniature wipers are installed on headlights to ensure they function optimally br br br History br br br Early versions br br One of the earliest recorded patents for the windscreen wiper is by George J Capewell of Hartford Connecticut which was filed on August His invention was for windows of slow moving craft but it is more particularly adapted and intended for windows of rapidly moving vehicles such as high speed locomotives and cars with which it is necessary that the observer or driver should have a clear view of the path or track Similar to current automotive wiper designs his invention involves usually two of these wipers and they can be secured to the frame below the front board of the vehicle or behind the housing surrounding the window in position to be out of sight and in such manner that one will scrape off the heaviest part of the substance collected upon the glass His patent illustration shows a circular window although the patent notes it is not essential that the glass be circular in form br Other early designs for the windscreen wiper are credited to Polish concert pianist J zef Hofmann and to Mills Munitions Birmingham who also claimed to have been the first to patent windscreen wipers in England br At least three inventors patented windscreen cleaning devices at around the same time in Mary Anderson Robert Douglass and John Apjohn In April a patent for windscreen wipers was registered by Sloan Lloyd Barnes patent agents of Liverpool England for Gladstone Adams of Whitley Bay br br American inventor Mary Anderson is popularly credited with devising the first operational windscreen wiper in In Anderson s patent she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle her version of windscreen wipers closely resembles the windscreen wiper found on many early car models Anderson had a model of her design manufactured then filed a patent US on June that was issued to her by the US Patent Office on November br br Irish born inventor James Henry Apjohn patented an Apparatus for Cleaning Carriage Motor Car and other Windows which was stated to use either brushes or wipers and could be either motor driven or hand driven The brushes or wipers were intended to clean either both up and down or in just one direction on a vertical window Apjohn s invention had a priority date in the UK of October br John R Oishei formed the Tri Continental Corporation in This company introduced the first windscreen wiper Rain Rubber for the slotted two piece windscreens found on many of the automobiles of the time Today Trico Products is one of the world s largest manufacturers of windscreen wipers Bosch has the world s biggest windscreen wiper factory in Tienen Belgium which produces wiper blades every day The first automatic electric wiper arms were patented in by Charlotte Bridgwood br Inventor William M Folberth and his brother Fred applied for a patent for an automatic windscreen wiper apparatus in which was granted in It was the first automatic mechanism to be developed by an American but the original invention is attributed by others to Hawaiian Ormand Wall Trico later settled a patent dispute with Folberth and purchased Folberth s Cleveland company the Folberth Auto Specialty Co The new vacuum powered system quickly became standard equipment on automobiles and the vacuum principle was in use until about In the late s a feature common on modern vehicles first appeared operating the wipers automatically for two or three passes when the windscreen washer button was pressed making it unnecessary to manually turn the wipers on as well Today an electronic timer is used but originally a small vacuum cylinder mechanically linked to a switch provided the delay as the vacuum leaked off br br br Intermittent wipers br The inventor of intermittent wipers non continuous now including variable rate wipers might have been Raymond Anderson who in proposed an electro mechanical design US Patent In Oishei et al filed a patent application describing not only electro mechanical but also thermal and hydraulic designs US Patent Then in John Amos an engineer for the UK automotive engineering company Lucas Industries filed the first patent application in the UK for a solid state electronic design US patent br In another form of intermittent wiper was invented by Robert Kearns an engineering professor at Wayne State University in Detroit Michigan United States Patent filing date Kearns s design was intended to mimic the function of the human eye which blinks only once every few seconds In Kearns built his first intermittent wiper system using off the shelf electronic components The interval between wipes was determined by the rate of current flow into a capacitor when the charge in the capacitor reached a certain voltage the capacitor would be discharged activating one cycle of the wiper motor and then repeating the process Kearns showed his wiper design to the Ford Motor Company and proposed that they manufacture the design Ford executives rejected Kearns proposal at the time but later offered a similar design as an option on the company s Mercury line beginning with the models Kearns sued Ford in a multi year patent dispute that Kearns eventually won in court inspiring the feature film Flash of Genius based on a New Yorker article that covered the legal battle br In March French automotive manufacturer Citro n introduced more advanced rain sensitive intermittent windscreen wipers on its SM model When the intermittent function was selected the wiper would make one sweep If the windscreen was relatively dry the wiper motor drew high current which would set the control circuit timer to a long delay for the next wipe If the motor drew little current it indicated that the glass was still wet and would set the timer to minimize the delay br br br Power br br Wipers may be powered by a variety of means although most in use today are powered by an electric motor through a series of mechanical components typically two bar linkages in series or parallel br Vehicles with air operated brakes sometimes use pneumatic wipers powered by tapping a small amount of pressurized air from the brake system to a small air operated motor mounted on or just above the windscreen These wipers are activated by opening a valve which allows pressurized air to enter the motor br Early wipers were often driven by a vacuum motor powered by manifold vacuum This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position and is almost non existent under wide open throttle when the wipers would slow down or even stop That problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel vacuum booster pump br Some cars mostly from the s and s had variable speed hydraulically driven wipers most notably the Lincoln Continental Lincoln Continental Mark III but not all models and Ford Thunderbird These were powered by the same hydraulic pump also used for the power steering mechanism br On the earlier Citro n CV the windscreen wipers were powered by a purely mechanical system a cable connected to the transmission to reduce cost this cable also powered the speedometer The wipers speed was therefore variable with car speed When the car was stationary the wipers were not powered but a handle under the speedometer allowed the driver to power them by hand br br br Shape br br Most early wipers used a rubber blade attached to a flat metal base But as aerodynamic and styling concerns introduced curved windshields these proved insufficient In John W Anderson founder of Trico rival Anco filed a patent for a wiper with branched arms to keep the blade pressed uniformly against both curved and flat glass adaptable to almost any windscreen curvature As curved windshields became more popular and widespread following the debut of the Studebaker Starlight Coupe these soon became standard equipment While they have been superseded by beam type wipers with bodies made of flexible material this type still remains the most popular br Wiper blades are made of natural rubber EPDM rubber or ethylene propylene rubber or a combination of both as natural rubber performs better in cold weather but EPDM rubber doesn t set and resists better to thermal aging UV ozone and tearing Some manufacturers coat them with graphite br br br Geometry br br Most wipers are of the pivot or radial type they are attached to a single arm which in turn is attached to the motor These are commonly found on many cars trucks trains boats airplanes etc br Modern windscreen wipers usually move in parallel Fig below However various Mercedes Benz models and other cars such as the Volkswagen Sharan employ wipers configured to move in opposite directions Fig which is mechanically more complex but can avoid leaving a large unwiped corner of the windscreen in front of the front seat passenger A cost benefit to the auto maker occurs when wipers configured to move in opposite directions do not need to be repositioned for cars exported to right hand drive countries such as the UK and Japan br Another wiper design Fig is pantograph based used on many commercial vehicles especially buses with large windscreens Pantograph wipers feature two arms for each blade with the blade assembly itself supported on a horizontal bar connecting the two arms One of the arms is attached to the motor while the other is on an idle pivot The pantograph mechanism while being more complex allows the blade to cover more of the windscreen on each wipe However it also usually requires the wiper to be parked in the middle of the windscreen where it may partially obstruct the driver s view when not in use A few models of automobile sometimes employ a pantograph arm on the driver s side and a normal arm for the passenger The Triumph Stag Lexus and several US makes employ this method to cover more glass area where the windscreen is quite wide but also very shallow The reduced height of the windscreen would need the use of short wiper arms which would not have the reach to the edge of the windscreen br A simple single blade setup with a center pivot Fig is commonly used on rear windscreens as well as on the front of some cars Mercedes Benz pioneered a system Fig called the Monoblade based on cantilevers in which a single arm extends outward to reach the top corners of the windscreen and pulls in at the ends and middle of the stroke sweeping out a somewhat M shaped path This way a single blade is able to cover more of the windscreen displacing any residual streaks away from the centre of the windscreen br Some larger cars in the late s and early s especially LH driver American cars had a pantograph wiper on the driver s side with a conventional pivot on the passenger side Asymmetric wiper arrangements are usually configured to clear more windscreen area on the driver s side and so are mostly mirrored for left and right hand drive vehicles for example Fig vs Fig One exception is found on the second generations of the Renault Clio Twingo and Sc nic as well as BMW s E Series and E Series the Peugeot and the Nissan Almera Tino where the wipers always sweep towards the left On right hand drive models a linkage allows the right hand wiper to move outwards towards the corner of the windscreen and clear more area br br br

window wipers are typically found on hatchbacks station wagons estates sport utility vehicles minivans and other vehicles with more vertically oriented rear windows that tend to accumulate dust First offered in the s they achieved widespread popularity in the s after their introduction on the Porsche in and the Volvo in br br br Headlight wipers br In the s as interest in auto safety grew engineers began researching various headlamp cleaning systems In late Chevrolet introduced high pressure fluid headlamp washers on a variety of their models In Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism with a single motor They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism with individual motors on each headlamp In headlamp cleaning systems became mandatory in Sweden br Headlamp wipers have all but disappeared today with most modern designs relying solely on pressurized fluid spray to clean the headlights This reduces manufacturing cost minimizes aerodynamic drag and complies with EU regulations limiting headlamp wiper use to glass lensed units only the majority of lenses today are made of plastic br br br Other features br br br Windscreen washer br br Most windscreen wipers operate together with a windscreen washer a pump that supplies a mixture of water alcohol and detergent a blend called windscreen washer fluid from a tank to the windscreen The fluid is dispensed through small nozzles mounted on the hood Conventional nozzles are usually used but some designs use a fluidic oscillator to disperse the fluid more effectively br In warmer climates water may also work but it can freeze in colder climates damaging the pump Although automobile antifreeze is chemically similar to windscreen wiper fluid it should not be used because it can damage paint The earliest documented idea for having a windscreen wiper unit hooked up to a windscreen washer fluid reservoir was in Richland Auto Parts Co Mansfield Ohio Uruguayan racecar driver and mechanic H ctor Suppici Sedes developed a windscreen washer in the late s br Since nozzles are replaced on some cars Tesla Volvo XC Citroen C Cactus by a system called AquaBlade developed by the company Valeo This system supplies the washing liquid directly from the spoiler element of the wiper blade This system suppresses visual disturbances during driving and so reduces the reaction time of the driver in case of incident br br br Hidden wipers br Some larger cars are equipped with hidden wipers or depressed park wipers When wipers are switched off in standard non hidden designs a parking mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area near the bottom of the windscreen but still in sight For designs that hide the wipers the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the bonnet The wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen but out of sight Late model vehicles that hide wiper blades under the windscreen need to be placed in a service position in order to lift the wiper blade from the windscreen using the wiper service position br br br Rain sensing wipers br Some vehicles are now available with automatic or driver programmable windscreen wipers that detect the presence and amount of rain using a rain sensor The sensor automatically adjusts the speed and frequency of the blades according to the amount of rain detected These controls usually have a manual override br Rain sensing windscreen wipers appeared on various models in the late th century one of the first being the Citro n SM As of early rain sensing wipers are optional or standard on all Cadillacs and most Volkswagens and are available on many other mainstream manufacturers br The rain sensing wipers system currently employed by most car manufacturers today was originally invented and patented in by Australian Raymond J Noack see U S Patents and The original system automatically operated the wipers lights and windscreen washers br br br Bladeless alternatives br br A common alternative design used on ships called a clear view screen avoids the use of rubber wiper blades A round portion of the windscreen has two layers the outer one of which is spun at high speed to shed water br High speed aircraft may use bleed air which uses compressed air from the turbine engine to remove water rather than mechanical wipers to save weight and drag Effectiveness of this method also depends on water repellent glass treatments similar to Rain X br br br Legislation br Many jurisdictions have legal requirements that vehicles be equipped with windscreen wipers Windscreen wipers may be a required safety item in auto safety inspections Some US states have a wipers on lights on rule for cars br br br In popular culture br In the television commercial Synchronicity for the Volkswagen Jetta automobile windscreen wipers were synchronized with events seen through the car windows and with the song Jung at Heart which was commissioned for the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide and composed by Peter du Charme under the name Master Cylinder br br br
