Vehicle audio is equipment installed in a car or other vehicle to provide in car entertainment and information for the occupants Until the s it consisted of a simple AM radio Additions since then have included FM radio track tape players cassette players record players CD players DVD players Blu ray players navigation systems Bluetooth telephone integration and audio streaming and smartphone controllers like CarPlay and Android Auto Once controlled from the dashboard with a few buttons they can be controlled by steering wheel controls and voice commands br Initially implemented for listening to music and radio vehicle audio is now part of car telematics telecommunication in vehicle security handsfree calling navigation and remote diagnostics systems The same loudspeakers may also be used to minimize road and engine noise with active noise control or they may be used to augment engine sounds for example making a small engine sound bigger br br br History br br br Radio br br In before commercially viable technology for mobile radio was in place American inventor and self described Father of Radio Lee de Forest demonstrated a car radio at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis br Around vacuum tube technology had matured to the point where the availability of radio receivers made radio broadcasting viable A technical challenge was that the vacuum tubes in the radio receivers required to volt direct current but car batteries ran at V Voltage was stepped up with a vibrator that provided a pulsating DC which could be converted to a higher voltage with a transformer rectified and filtered to create higher voltage DC br In Kelly s Motors in NSW Australia installed its first car radio br In the American Galvin Manufacturing Corporation marketed a Motorola branded radio receiver for It was expensive the contemporary Ford Model A cost A Plymouth sedan wired for Philco Transitone radio without extra cost was advertised in Ladies Home Journal in In in Germany the Blaupunkt AS medium wave and longwave radio was marketed for Reichsmark about one third of the price of a small car Because it took nearly litres of space it could not be located near the driver and was operated via a steering wheel remote control In Crossley Motors offered a factory fitted car radio for By the late s push button AM radios were considered a standard feature In there were an estimated million AM car radios in use br An FM receiver was offered by Blaupunkt in In Becker introduced the AM FM Becker Mexico with a Variometer tuner basically a station search or scan function br In April the Chrysler Corporation announced that it was offering a Mopar model HR branded Philco all transistor car radio as a option for its Chrysler and Imperial car models Chrysler Corporation had decided to discontinue its all transistor car radio option at the end of due to it being too expensive and replaced it with a cheaper hybrid transistors and low voltage vacuum tubes car radio for its new car models In Becker introduced the Monte Carlo a tubeless solid state radio with no vacuum tubes br From to the Autofahrer Rundfunk Informationssystem was used by the German ARD network Developed jointly by the Institut f r Rundfunktechnik and Blaupunkt it indicated the presence of traffic announcements through manipulation of the kHz subcarrier of the station s FM signal ARI was replaced by the Radio Data System br The AM FM radio combined with a CD player has remained a mainstay of car audio despite being obsolescent in non car applications br In the s internet radio satellite radio streaming and podcasting came into competition with AM FM radio By this time some models were offering surround sound br In several automobile manufacturers including Ford Motor Company announced plans to discontinue offering the AM radio band in new vehicles starting with the model year Ford later reversed its announcement with chief executive offer Jim Farley citing the importance of AM s emergency alert system Audi BMW Volvo and Tesla had already started to not offer the AM band on their entertainment systems specifically on their electric vehicles The previous announcement had several lawmakers introduce bipartisan legislation to require that automobile manufactures include the AM band on their audio entertainment systems br br br Physical media and connectivity br Mobile players for physical media have been provided for vinyl records track tapes cassette tapes compact discs and MP s The increased sophistication of the vehicle audio system to accommodate such media has made the audio unit a common target of car break ins so these are equipped with anti theft systems too br Attempts at providing mobile play from media were first made with vinyl records beginning in the s The first such player was offered by Chrysler as an option on Chrysler Desoto Dodge and Plymouth cars The player was developed by CBS Labs and played a limited selection of specially provided inch discs at RPM The unit was an expensive option and was dropped after two years Cheaper options using commonly available rpm records were made by RCA Victor available only in and Norelco All of these players required extra pressure on the needle to avoid skipping during vehicle movement which caused accelerated wear on the records br In Muntz introduced the Wayfarer track cartridge tape player Celebrities including Frank Sinatra had these units installed in their cars br In Ford and Motorola jointly introduced the in car track tape player as optional equipment for Ford car models In a dashboard car radio with a built in cassette tape player was introduced by Philips In subsequent years cassettes supplanted the track and improved the technology with longer play times better tape quality auto reverse and Dolby noise reduction They were popular throughout the s and s Cassette players were still found in vehicles as late as the Honda CR V and Acura TL There have also been vehicle audio units that accept both compact cassettes and CDs br Pioneer introduced the CDX the first car CD compact disc player in It was known for its improved sound quality instant track skipping and the format s increased durability over cassette tapes Car CD changers started to gain popularity in the late s and continued throughout the s with the earlier devices being trunk mounted and later ones being mounted in the head unit some able to accommodate six to ten CDs Stock and aftermarket CD players began appearing in the late s competing with the cassette The first car with an OEM CD player was the Lincoln Town Car and the last new cars in the American market to be factory equipped with a cassette deck in the dashboard was the Lexus SC and the Ford Crown Victoria A car cassette adapter allowed motorists to plug in a portable music player CD player MP player into an existing installed cassette tape deck br In the early st century compact digital storage media Bluetooth enabled devices thumb drives memory cards and dedicated hard drives came to be accommodated by vehicle audio systems Around this time auxiliary input jacks and USB ports were added to connect MP players to the vehicle s speakers Minivans and three row SUVs have an available rear entertainment system with a DVD player to entertain passengers br The automobile head unit became increasingly important as a housing for front and backup dashcams navis and operating systems with multiple functions such as Android Auto CarPlay and MirrorLink allowing a smartphone s music library and navigation apps to be controlled via the vehicle s infotainment system Latest models are coming equipped with features like Bluetooth technology along with HDMI port for better connectivity Screen size varies from inch to inch for the double Din car stereos br br br Active noise control and noise synthesis br The automobile sound system may be part of an active noise control system which reduces engine and road noise for the driver and passengers One or more microphones are used to pick up sound from various places on the vehicle especially the engine compartment underside or exhaust pipes and these signals are handled by a digital signal processor DSP and then sent to the loudspeakers in such a way that the processed signal reduces or cancels out the outside noise heard inside the car An early system focused only on engine noise was developed by Lotus and licensed for the Nissan Bluebird models sold in Japan Lotus later teamed with Harman in to develop a more complete noise reduction system including road and tire noise as well as chassis vibrations One benefit of active noise control is that the car can weigh less with less sound deadening material used and without a heavy balance shaft in the engine Removing the balance shaft also increases fuel efficiency The Honda Accord used an active noise control system as did the Lincoln luxury line and the Ford C Max and Fusion models Other operating data may also play a part in the DSP data such as the engine s speed in revolutions per minute RPM or the car s highway speed A multiple source reduction system may reach as much as of the noise removed br The same system may also be used to synthesize or augment engine noise to make the engine sound more powerful to the driver For the Ford Mustang EcoBoost Fastback and EcoBoost Fastback Premium an Active Noise Control system was developed that amplifies the engine sound through the car speakers A similar system is used in the F pickup truck Volkswagen uses a Soundaktor a special speaker to play sounds in cars such as the Golf GTi and Beetle Turbo BMW plays a recorded sample of its motors through the car speakers using different samples according to the engine s load and power br br br Components and terms br The stock system is the OEM application that the vehicle s manufacturer specified to be installed when the car was built br Aftermarket components can also be used br br Head unit Headunit products includes the screen and buttons and are manufactured mainly in DIN form factor which refers to ISO Head units come as single DIN or double DIN br Connectors for car audio where ISO Harness Adapter is used br Capacitors br Mobile audio power amplifiers br Amplifiers increase the power level of audio signals Some head units have built in stereo amplifiers Other car audio systems use a separate stand alone amplifier Every amplifier has a rated power level sometimes noted on the head unit with the built in amplifier or on the label of a stand alone unit br br Coaxial speakers These are the most common type of car speakers and are often factory installed They usually consist of a woofer and a tweeter mounted on the same axis and are designed to reproduce a wide range of frequencies br Component speakers These speakers are designed for higher end car audio systems and typically consist of separate woofers tweeters and crossovers This allows for more precise sound tuning and a higher level of sound quality br Subwoofers These speakers are designed to reproduce low frequency sounds particularly bass They come in various sizes and power levels and can be used to enhance the bass in a car audio system br Mid range speakers These speakers are designed to reproduce mid range frequencies such as vocals and instruments like guitars and pianos br Tweeters These speakers are designed to reproduce high frequency sounds such as cymbals and other high pitched instruments br Sound deadening material is often used in the door cavities and boot area to dampen excess vibration of the panels in the car in response to loud subwoofer bass tones especially the boot trunk br Optical drives with slot loading mechanism br br br Legality br Excessively loud sound systems in automobiles violate the noise ordinance of municipalities some of which have outlawed them In the U S Department of Justice issued a guide to police officers on how to deal with problems associated with loud audio systems in cars br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
