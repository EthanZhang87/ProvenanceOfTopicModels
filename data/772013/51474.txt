title: Seat belt
id: 51474
A seat belt also known as a safety belt or spelled seatbelt is a vehicle safety device designed to secure the driver or a passenger of a vehicle against harmful movement that may result during a collision or a sudden stop A seat belt reduces the likelihood of death or serious injury in a traffic collision by reducing the force of secondary impacts with interior strike hazards by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the airbag if equipped and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over br When in motion the driver and passengers are traveling at the same speed as the vehicle If the vehicle suddenly stops or crashes the occupants continue at the same speed the vehicle was going before it stopped A seat belt applies an opposing force to the driver and passengers to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car especially preventing contact with or going through the windshield Seat belts are considered primary restraint systems PRSs because of their vital role in occupant safety br br br Effectiveness br br An analysis conducted in the United States in compared a variety of seat belt types alone and in combination with air bags The range of fatality reduction for front seat passengers was broad from to as was the range of major injury from to More recently the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has summarized these data by stating seat belts reduce serious crash related injuries and deaths by about half Most malfunctions are a result of there being too much slack in the seat belt at the time of the accident br It has been suggested that although seat belt usage reduces the probability of death in any given accident mandatory seat belt laws have little or no effect on the overall number of traffic fatalities because seat belt usage also disincentivizes safe driving behaviors thereby increasing the total number of accidents This idea known as compensating behavior theory is not supported by the evidence br In case of vehicle rollover in a U S passenger car or SUV from to wearing a seat belt reduced the risk of fatalities or incapacitating injuries and increased the probability of no injury br br In case of vehicle rollover in a U S passenger car there are fatalities in and in when user is restrained There are fatalities in and in when the user is unrestrained br In case of vehicle rollover there are incapacitating injury in and in when the user is restrained There are incapacitating injury in and in when user is unrestrained br The probability of no injury is in and in when the user is restrained There were no injury in and in when the user is unrestrained br br br History br Seat belts were invented by English engineer George Cayley to use on his glider in the mid th century br In C Hunter Shelden opened a neurological practice at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena California In the early s Shelden made a major contribution to the automotive industry with his idea of retractable seat belts This came about from his care of the high number of head injuries coming through the emergency room He investigated the early seat belts with primitive designs that were implicated in these injuries and deaths br Nash was the first American car manufacturer to offer seat belts as a factory option in its models They were installed in cars but buyers did not want them and requested that dealers remove them The feature was met with insurmountable sales resistance and Nash reported that after one year only had been used by customers br Ford offered seat belts as an option in These were not popular with only of Ford buyers choosing to pay for seat belts in br To reduce the high level of injuries Shelden was seeing he proposed in late retractable seat belts recessed steering wheels reinforced roofs roll bars automatic door locks and passive restraints such as air bags be made mandatory br Glenn W Sheren of Mason Michigan submitted a patent application on March for an automotive seat belt and was awarded U S patent in This was a continuation of an earlier patent application that Sheren had filed on September br The first modern three point seat belt the so called CIR Griswold restraint commonly used in consumer vehicles was patented in U S patent by the Americans Roger W Griswold and Hugh DeHaven br Saab introduced seat belts as standard equipment in After the Saab GT was introduced at the New York Motor Show in with safety belts fitted as standard the practice became commonplace br Vattenfall the Swedish national electric utility did a study of all fatal on the job accidents among their employees The study revealed that the majority of fatalities occurred while the employees were on the road on company business In response two Vattenfall safety engineers Bengt Odelgard and Per Olof Weman started to develop a seat belt Their work was presented to Swedish manufacturer Volvo in the late s and set the standard for seat belts in Swedish cars The three point seat belt was developed to its modern form by Swedish inventor Nils Bohlin for Volvo which introduced it in as standard equipment In addition to designing an effective three point belt Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of accidents in Sweden Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below mph No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact Bohlin was granted U S patent for the device br Subsequently in Congress passed the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act requiring all automobiles to comply with certain safety standards br The first compulsory seat belt law was put in place in in the state of Victoria Australia requiring their use by drivers and front seat passengers This legislation was enacted after trialing Hemco seat belts designed by Desmond Hemphill in the front seats of police vehicles lowering the incidence of officer injury and death Mandatory seat belt laws in the United States began to be introduced in the s and faced opposition with some consumers going to court to challenge the laws Some cut seat belts out of their cars br br br Material br The belt part of the typical seatbelt seen in vehicles worldwide is referred to as the webbing Modern seat belt webbing has a high tensile strength about lbs to resist tearing at high loads such as during high speed collisions or while restraining larger passengers br While nylon was used in some early seat belts and is still used for lap belts it was replaced by polyester due to its better UV resistance lower extensibility and higher stiffness Nylon was also prone to stretching much more than polyester and was prone to wear and tear with tiny abrasions drastically reducing tensile strength causing a lack of reliability in one of the most important safety measures in a vehicle Seat belts are commonly or mm wide with a herringbone twill weaving pattern to maximize the thread density Modern seatbelt weaves also feature snag proof selvedges reinforced with strong polyester threads to prevent the wear and tear while remaining flexible The weave features about warp threads for every mm wide webbing leading to around ends per inch of webbing br Accident investigators often examine the webbing of a seatbelt to determine if an occupant of a vehicle was wearing their seatbelt during a collision The material of the webbing may contain traces of the occupant s clothing Certain materials such as nylons may become permanently affixed or melted onto the fabric as a result of heat produced by friction whereas fiber based clothing leaves no remains on modern webbing br br br Types br br br Two point br A two point belt attaches at its two endpoints A simple strap was first used March by pilot Benjamin Foulois a pioneering aviator with the Aeronautical Division U S Signal Corps so he might remain at the controls during turbulence br The Irvin Air Chute Company made the seat belt for use by professional race car driver Barney Oldfield when his team decided the daredevil should have a safety harness for the Indianapolis br br br Lap br br A lap belt is a strap that goes over the waist This was the most common type of belt prior to legislation requiring three point belts and is found in older cars Coaches are equipped with lap belts although many newer coaches have three point belts as are passenger aircraft seats br University of Minnesota professor James J Crash Ryan was the inventor of and held the patent for the automatic retractable lap safety belt Ralph Nader cited Ryan s work in Unsafe at Any Speed and following hearings led by Senator Abraham Ribicoff President Lyndon Johnson signed two bills in requiring safety belts in all passenger vehicles starting in br Until the s three point belts were commonly available only in the front outboard seats of cars the back seats were often only fitted with lap belts Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis or seat belt syndrome led to the progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require three point belts first in all outboard seating positions and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles Since September all new cars sold in the U S require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat In addition to regulatory changes seat belt syndrome has led to a liability for vehicle manufacturers One Los Angeles case resulted in a million jury verdict against Ford the resulting million judgment after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial was affirmed on appeal in br While lap belts are exceedingly rare to spot in modern cars they are the standard in commercial airliners The lift lever style of commercial aircraft buckles allows for the seatbelt to be easily clasped and unclasped accessible quickly in case of an emergency where a passenger must evacuate and fulfills the minimum safety requirements provided by the FAA while remaining low cost to produce Furthermore in case of any collision a passenger in economy class has only around inches for their head to travel forward meaning restraining the torso and head is relatively unnecessary as the head has little room to accelerate before collision br br br Sash br br A sash or shoulder harness is a strap that goes diagonally over the vehicle occupant s outboard shoulder and is buckled inboard of their lap The shoulder harness may attach to the lap belt tongue or it may have a tongue and buckle completely separate from those of the lap belt Shoulder harnesses of this separate or semi separate type were installed in conjunction with lap belts in the outboard front seating positions of many vehicles in the North American market starting at the inception of the shoulder belt requirement of the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration s NHTSA Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard on January However if the shoulder strap is used without the lap belt the vehicle occupant is likely to submarine or slide forward in the seat and out from under the belt in a frontal collision In the mid s three point belt systems such as Chrysler s Uni Belt began to supplant the separate lap and shoulder belts in American made cars though such three point belts had already been supplied in European vehicles such as Volvo Mercedes Benz and Saab for some years br br br Three point br br A three point belt is a Y shaped arrangement similar to the separate lap and sash belts but unified Like the separate lap and sash belt in a collision the three point belt spreads out the energy of the moving body over the chest pelvis and shoulders Volvo introduced the first production three point belt in The first car with a three point belt was a Volvo PV that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August The first car model to have the three point seat belt as a standard item was the Volvo first outfitted with a two point belt at initial delivery in replaced with the three point seat belt the following year The three point belt was developed by Nils Bohlin who had earlier also worked on ejection seats at Saab Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free br br br Belt in Seat br The Belt in Seat BIS is a three point harness with the shoulder belt attached to the seat itself rather than to the vehicle structure The first car using this system was the Range Rover Classic which offered BIS as standard on the front seats from Some cars like the Renault Vel Satis use this system for the front seats A General Motors assessment concluded seat mounted three point belts offer better protection especially to smaller vehicle occupants though GM did not find a safety performance improvement in vehicles with seat mounted belts versus belts mounted to the vehicle body br Belt in Seat type belts have been used by automakers in convertibles and pillarless hardtops where there is no B pillar to affix the upper mount of the belt Chrysler and Cadillac are well known for using this design Antique auto enthusiasts sometimes replace original seats in their cars with BIS equipped front seats providing a measure of safety not available when these cars were new However modern BIS systems typically use electronics that must be installed and connected with the seats and the vehicle s electrical system in order to function properly br br br and point br br Five point harnesses are typically found in child safety seats and in racing cars The lap portion is connected to a belt between the legs and there are two shoulder belts making a total of five points of attachment to the seat A point harness is similar but without the strap between the legs while a point harness has two belts between the legs In NASCAR the point harness became popular after the death of Dale Earnhardt who was wearing a five point harness when he suffered his fatal crash As it was first thought that his belt had broken and broke his neck at impact some teams ordered a six point harness in response br br br Seven point br Aerobatic aircraft frequently use a combination harness consisting of a five point harness with a redundant lap belt attached to a different part of the aircraft While providing redundancy for negative g maneuvers which lift the pilot out of the seat they also require the pilot to unlatch two harnesses if it is necessary to parachute from a failed aircraft br br br Technology br br br Locking retractors br The purpose of locking retractors sometimes called ELR belts for Emergency Locking Retractors is to provide the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment while providing a method of limiting this movement in the event of a crash Starting in all passenger vehicles were required to lock pre crash meaning they have a locking mechanism in the retractor or in the latch plate Seat belts are stowed on spring loaded reels called retractors equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration br There are two main types of inertial seat belt locks A webbing sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by the rapid acceleration of the strap webbing from the reel The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it A sudden rapid pull of the belt as in a sudden braking or collision event causes the reel to lock restraining the occupant in position The first automatic locking retractor for seat belts and shoulder harnesses in the U S was the Irving Dynalock safety device These Auto lock front lap belts were optional on AMC cars with bucket seats in br A vehicle sensitive lock is based on a pendulum swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover a pawl is engaged the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position Dual sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism br br br Pretensioners and webclamps br br Seat belts in many newer vehicles are also equipped with pretensioners or web clamps or both br Pretensioners preemptively tighten the belt to prevent the occupant from jerking forward in a crash Mercedes Benz first introduced pretensioners on the S Class In the event of a crash a pretensioner will tighten the belt almost instantaneously This reduces the motion of the occupant in a violent crash Like airbags pretensioners are triggered by sensors in the car s body and many pretensioners have used explosively expanding gas to drive a piston that retracts the belt Pretensioners also lower the risk of submarining which occurs when a passenger slides forward under a loosely fitted seat belt br Some systems also pre emptively tighten the belt during fast accelerations and strong decelerations even if no crash has happened This has the advantage that it may help prevent the driver from sliding out of position during violent evasive maneuvers which could cause loss of control of the vehicle These pre emptive safety systems may prevent some collisions from happening as well as reduce injuries in the event an actual collision occurs Pre emptive systems generally use electric pretensioners which can operate repeatedly and for a sustained period rather than pyrotechnic pretensioners which can only operate a single time br Webclamps stop the webbing in the event of an accident and limit the distance the webbing can spool out caused by the unused webbing tightening on the central drum of the mechanism These belts also often incorporate an energy management loop rip stitching in which a section of the webbing is looped and stitched with special stitching The function of this is to rip at a predetermined load which reduces the maximum force transmitted through the belt to the occupant during a violent collision reducing injuries to the occupant br A study demonstrated that standard automotive three point restraints fitted with pyrotechnic or electric pretensioners were not able to eliminate all interior passenger compartment head strikes in rollover test conditions Electric pretensioners are often incorporated on vehicles equipped with precrash systems they are designed to reduce seat belt slack in a potential collision and assist in placing the occupants in a more optimal seating position The electric pretensioners also can operate on a repeated or sustained basis providing better protection in the event of an extended rollover or a multiple collision accident br br br Inflatable br The inflatable seat belt was invented by Donald Lewis and tested at the Automotive Products Division of Allied Chemical Corporation Inflatable seat belts have tubular inflatable bladders contained within an outer cover When a crash occurs the bladder inflates with gas to increase the area of the restraint contacting the occupant and also shortening the length of the restraint to tighten the belt around the occupant improving the protection The inflatable sections may be shoulder only or lap and shoulder The system supports the head during the crash better than a web only belt It also provides side impact protection In Ford began offering rear seat inflatable seat belts on a limited set of models such as the Explorer and Flex br br br Automatic br br Seat belts that automatically move into position around a vehicle occupant once the adjacent door is closed and or the engine is started were developed as a countermeasure against low usage rates of manual seat belts particularly in the United States The Volkswagen ESVW Experimental Safety Vehicle presented passive seat belts Volvo tried to develop a passive three point seat belt In Volkswagen announced they had a functional passive seat belt The first commercial car to use automatic seat belts was the Volkswagen Golf br Automatic seat belts received a boost in the United States in when Brock Adams United States Secretary of Transportation in the Carter Administration mandated that by every new car should have either airbags or automatic seat belts There was strong lobbying against the passive restraint requirement by the auto industry Adams was criticized by Ralph Nader who said that the deadline was too late The Volkswagen Rabbit also had automatic seat belts and VW said that by early cars had sold with them br General Motors introduced a three point non motorized passive belt system in to comply with the passive restraint requirement However it was used as an active lap shoulder belt because of unlatching the belt to exit the vehicle Despite this common practice field studies of belt use still showed an increase in wearing rates with this door mounted system General Motors began offering automatic seat belts on the Chevrolet Chevette However the company reported disappointing sales because of this feature For the model year the new Toyota Cressida became the first car to offer motorized automatic passive seat belts br A study released in by the United States Department of Transportation said that cars with automatic seat belts had a fatality rate of per million miles compared with for cars with regular manual belts br In Drew Lewis the first Transportation Secretary of the Reagan Administration influenced by studies done by the auto industry dropped the mandate the decision was overruled in a federal appeals court the following year and then by the Supreme Court In the Reagan Administration reversed its course though in the meantime the original deadline had been extended Elizabeth Dole then Transportation Secretary proposed that the two passive safety restraints be phased into vehicles gradually from vehicle model year to vehicle model year when all vehicles would be required to have either automatic seat belts or driver side air bags Though more awkward for vehicle occupants most manufacturers opted to use less expensive automatic belts rather than airbags during this time period br When driver side airbags became mandatory on all passenger vehicles in model year most manufacturers stopped equipping cars with automatic seat belts Exceptions include the Ford Escort Mercury Tracer and the Eagle Summit Wagon which had automatic safety belts along with dual airbags br br br Systems br Manual lap belt with automatic motorized shoulder belt When the door is opened the shoulder belt moves from a fixed point near the seat back on a track mounted in the door frame of the car to a point at the other end of the track near the windshield Once the door is closed and the car is started the belt moves rearward along the track to its original position thus securing the passenger The lap belt must be fastened manually br Manual lap belt with automatic non motorized shoulder belt This system was used in American market vehicles such as the Hyundai Excel and Volkswagen Jetta The shoulder belt is fixed to the aft upper corner of the vehicle door and is not motorized The lap belt must be fastened manually br Automatic shoulder and lap belts This system was mainly used in General Motors vehicles though it was also used on some Honda Civic hatchbacks and Nissan Sentra coupes When the door is opened the belts go from a fixed point in the middle of the car by the floor to the retractors on the door Passengers must slide into the car under the belts When the door closes the seat belt retracts into the door The belts have normal release buttons that are supposed to be used only in an emergency but in practice are routinely used in the same manner as manual seat belt clasps This system also found use by American Specialty Cars when they created the convertible special edition of the Nissan SX a car that traditionally had a motorized shoulder belt br br br Disadvantages br Automatic belt systems generally offer inferior occupant crash protection In systems with belts attached to the door rather than a sturdier fixed portion of the vehicle body a crash that causes the vehicle door to open leaves the occupant without belt protection In such a scenario the occupant may be thrown from the vehicle and suffer greater injury or death br Because many automatic belt system designs compliant with the U S passive restraint mandate did not meet the anchorage requirements of Canada CMVSS which were not weakened to accommodate automatic belts vehicle models that had been eligible for easy importation in either direction across the U S Canada border when equipped with manual belts became ineligible for importation in either direction once the U S variants obtained automatic belts and the Canadian versions retained manual belts Two particular models affected were the Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim br Automatic belt systems also present several operational disadvantages Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt thus rendering redundant the automation of the shoulder belt Those who do not fasten the lap belt wind up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt In a crash without a lap belt such a vehicle occupant is likely to submarine be thrown forward under the shoulder belt and be seriously injured Motorized or door affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle making it difficult to enter and exit particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance when entering and exiting the vehicle leaving only a lap belt for crash protection Also many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats or only compatible with special modifications br br br Homologation and testing br br Starting in and ending in the United States conducted a research project on seat belt effectiveness on a total of vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time Of these occupants were reported wearing lap belts or two point safety belts were reported wearing a three point safety belt and the remaining were reported as wearing no safety belt The results concluded that users of the two point lap belt had a lower fatality rate a lower serious injury rate and a lower injury rate than the occupants that were reported unrestrained Similarly users of the three point safety belt had a lower serious injury rate and a lower rate of all other injuries Out of the described as wearing a three point safety belt no fatalities were reported br This study and others led to the Restraint Systems Evaluation Program RSEP started by the NHTSA in to increase the reliability and authenticity of past studies A study as part of this program used data taken from tow away accidents that involved only car models made between and The study found that for injuries considered moderate or worse individuals wearing a three point safety belt had a lower injury rate than those wearing no safety belt The study also concluded that the effectiveness of the safety belt did not differ with the size of a car It was determined that the variation among results of the many studies conducted in the s and s was due to the use of different methodologies and could not be attributed to any significant variation in the effectiveness of safety belts br Wayne State University s Automotive Safety Research Group as well as other researchers are testing ways to improve seat belt effectiveness and general vehicle safety apparatuses Wayne State s Bioengineering Center uses human cadavers in their crash test research The Center s director Albert King wrote in that the vehicle safety improvements made possible since by the use of cadavers in research had saved nearly lives each year and indicated that improvements made to three point safety belts save an average of lives every year br The New Car Assessment Program NCAP was put in place by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in The NCAP is a government program that evaluates vehicle safety designs and sets standards for foreign and domestic automobile companies The agency developed a rating system and requires access to safety test results As of September manufacturers are required to place an NCAP star rating on the automobile price sticker br In The European New Car Assessment Program Euro NCAP started testing seat belts and whiplash safety on all test cars at the Thatcham Research Centre with crash test dummies br br br Experimental br Research and development efforts are ongoing to improve the safety performance of vehicle seat belts Some experimental designs include br br Criss cross Experimental safety belt presented in the Volvo SCC It forms a cross brace across the chest br Point Experimental safety belt from Autoliv similar to the criss cross The improves protection against rollovers and side impacts br Four point belt and suspenders An experimental design from Ford where the suspenders are attached to the backrest not to the frame of the car br point Adjustable Experimental safety belt from GWR Safety Systems that allowed the car Hiriko designed by MIT to fold without compromising the safety and comfort of the occupants br br br In rear seats br br In as a package Ford offered lap only seat belts in the rear seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package In Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats In Volvo upgraded the rear seat belts to a three point belt br In crashes unbelted rear passengers increase the risk of belted front seat occupants death by nearly five times br br br Child occupants br br As with adult drivers and passengers the advent of seat belts was accompanied by calls for their use by child occupants including legislation requiring such use Generally children using adult seat belts suffer significantly lower injury risk when compared to non buckled children br The UK extended compulsory seat belt wearing to child passengers under the age of in It was observed that this measure was accompanied by a increase in fatalities and a increase in injuries among the target population In crashes small children who wear adult seat belts can suffer seat belt syndrome injuries including severed intestines ruptured diaphragms and spinal damage There is also research suggesting that children in inappropriate restraints are at significantly increased risk of head injury One of the authors of this research said The early graduation of kids into adult lap and shoulder belts is a leading cause of child occupant injuries and deaths br As a result of such findings many jurisdictions now advocate or require child passengers to use specially designed child restraints Such systems include separate child sized seats with their own restraints and booster cushions for children using adult restraints In some jurisdictions children below a certain size are forbidden to travel in front car seats br br br Automated reminders and engine start interlocks br br In Europe the U S and some other parts of the world most modern cars include a seat belt reminder light for the driver and some also include a reminder for the passenger when present activated by a pressure sensor under the passenger seat Some cars will intermittently flash the reminder light and sound the chime until the driver and sometimes the front passenger if present fasten their seat belts br In in Sweden of all cars that were newly registered were equipped with seat belt reminders for the driver Since November seat belt reminders are mandatory for the driver s seat on new cars sold in Europe br Two specifications define the standard of seat belt reminder UN Regulation Section and the Euro NCAP assessment protocol Euro NCAP br br br European Union seat belt reminder br In the European Union seat belt reminders are mandatory in all new passenger cars for the driver seat In EC Regulation made UN Regulation applicable br Amendment of UN Regulation made seat belt reminders mandatory in br br all front and rear seats of passenger cars and vans br all front seats of buses and trucks br This improvement applies from September for new types of motor vehicles and from September for all new motor vehicles br br br U S regulation history br The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard FMVSS was amended by the NHTSA to require a seat belt starter interlock system to prevent passenger cars from being started with an unbelted front seat occupant This mandate applied to passenger cars built after August i e starting with the model year The specifications required the system to permit the car to be started only if the belt of an occupied seat were fastened after the occupant sat down so pre buckling the belts would not defeat the system br The interlock systems used logic modules complex enough to require special diagnostic computers and were not entirely dependable an override button was provided under the hood of equipped cars permitting one but only one free starting attempt each time it was pressed However the interlock system spurred severe backlash from an American public who largely rejected seat belts In Congress acted to prohibit NHTSA from requiring or permitting a system that prevents a vehicle from starting or operating with an unbelted occupant or that gives an audible warning of an unfastened belt for more than seconds after the ignition is turned on This prohibition took effect on October shortly after the model year began br In response to the Congressional action NHTSA once again amended FMVSS requiring vehicles to come with a seat belt reminder system that gives an audible signal for to seconds and a warning light for at least seconds after the ignition is turned on if the driver s seat belt is not fastened This is called a seat belt reminder SBR system In the mid s the Swedish insurance company Folksam worked with Saab and Ford to determine the requirements for the most efficient seat belt reminder One characteristic of the optimal SBR according to the research is that the audible warning becomes increasingly penetrating the longer the seat belt remains unfastened br br br Efficacy br In Congress directed NHSTA to study the benefits of technology meant to increase the use of seat belts NHSTA found that seat belt usage had increased to since the initial introduction of the SBR system In Ford demonstrated that seat belts were used more in Fords with seat belt reminders than in those without and respectively In Honda conducted a similar study and found that of people who drove Hondas with seat belt reminders used a seat belt while of people who drove Hondas without seat belt reminders used a seat belt br In the Transportation Research Board Committee chaired by two psychologists reported that Enhanced SBRs ESBRs could save an additional lives a year Research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that Ford s ESBR which provides an intermittent chime for up to five minutes if the driver is unbelted sounding for seconds then pausing for increased seat belt use by percentage points Farmer and Wells found that driver fatality rates were lower for vehicles with ESBR compared with otherwise identical vehicles without br br br Delayed start br Starting with the model year some Chevrolet cars refused to shift from Park to Drive for seconds if the driver is unbuckled and the car is in teen driver mode A similar feature was previously available on some General Motors fleet cars br br br Regulation by country br br br International regulations br Several countries apply UN ECE vehicle regulations and br br UN Regulation No safety belt anchorages br UN Regulation No br Safety belts restraint systems child restraint systems and ISOFIX child restraint systems for occupants of power driven vehicles br Vehicles equipped with safety belts safety belt reminders restraint systems child restraint systems and ISOFIX child restraint systems and i Size child restraint systems br UN Regulation No restraining devices for child occupants of power driven vehicles Child Restraint Systems br UN Regulation No Enhanced Child Restraint Systems br br br Local regulations br br br Legislation br br In observational studies of car crash morbidity and mortality experiments using both crash test dummies and human cadavers indicate that wearing seat belts greatly reduces the risk of death and injury in the majority of car crashes br This has led many countries to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws It is generally accepted that in comparing like for like accidents a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury One large observation studying using U S data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is with a three point belt when compared with no belt In another study that examined injuries presenting to the ER pre and post seat belt law introduction it was found that more escaped injury and more escaped mild and moderate injuries br The effects of seat belt laws are disputed by those who observe that their passage did not reduce road fatalities There has also been concern that instead of legislating for a general protection standard for vehicle occupants laws that required a particular technical approach would rapidly become dated as motor manufacturers would tool up for a particular standard that could not easily be changed For example in there were competing designs for lap and three point seat belts rapidly tilting seats and airbags being developed As countries started to mandate seat belt restraints the global auto industry invested in the tooling and standardized exclusively on seat belts and ignored other restraint designs such as airbags for several decades br As of seat belt laws can be divided into two categories primary and secondary A primary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a citation for lack of seat belt use without any other citation whereas a secondary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a seat belt citation only in the presence of a different violation In the United States fifteen states enforce secondary laws while states as well as the District of Columbia American Samoa Guam the Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands enforce primary seat belt laws New Hampshire lacks either a primary or secondary seat belt law br br br Risk compensation br Some have proposed that the number of deaths was influenced by the development of risk compensation which says that drivers adjust their behavior in response to the increased sense of personal safety wearing a seat belt provides br In one trial subjects were asked to drive go karts around a track under various conditions It was found that subjects who started driving unbelted drove consistently faster when subsequently belted Similarly a study of habitual non seat belt wearers driving in freeway conditions found evidence that they had adapted to use by adopting higher driving speeds and closer following distances br A analysis of U S crash data aimed to establish the effects of legislation on driving fatalities and found that previous estimates of seat belt effectiveness had been significantly overstated br According to the analysis seat belts decreased fatalities by for each increase in seat belt use The study controlled for endogenous motivations of seat belt use because that creates an artificial correlation between seat belt use and fatalities leading to the conclusion that seat belts cause fatalities For example drivers in high risk areas are more likely to use seat belts and are more likely to be in accidents creating a non causal correlation between seat belt use and mortality After accounting for the endogeneity of seat belt usage Cohen and Einav found no evidence that the risk compensation effect makes seat belt wearing drivers more dangerous a finding at variance with other research br br br Increased traffic br Other statistical analyses have included adjustments for factors such as increased traffic and age and based on these adjustments which results in a reduction of morbidity and mortality due to seat belt use However Smeed s law predicts a fall in accident rate with increasing car ownership and has been demonstrated independently of seat belt legislation br br br Mass transit considerations br br br Buses br br br School buses br br In the U S six states California Florida Louisiana New Jersey New York and Texas require seat belts on school buses br Pros and cons have been debated about the use of seat belts in school buses School buses which are much bigger than the average vehicle allow for the mass transportation of students from place to place The American School Bus Council states in a brief article The children are protected like eggs in an egg carton compartmentalized and surrounded with padding and structural integrity to secure the entire container Although school buses are considered safe for mass transit of students this will not guarantee that the students will be injury free if an impact were to occur Seat belts in buses are sometimes believed to make recovering from a roll or tip harder for passengers as they could be easily trapped in their own safety belts br In for the first time NHTSA endorsed seat belts on school buses br br br Motor coaches br In the European Union all new long distance buses and coaches must be fitted with seat belts br Australia has required lap sash seat belts in new coaches since These must comply with Australian Design Rule which requires the seat belt seat and seat anchorage to withstand g deceleration and an impact by an unrestrained occupant to the rear br In the United States NHTSA now requires lap shoulder seat belts in new over the road buses includes most coaches starting in br br br Trains br The use of seat belts in trains has been investigated Concerns about survival space intrusion in train crashes and increased injuries to unrestrained or incorrectly restrained passengers led researchers to discourage the use of seat belts in trains br br It has been shown that there is no net safety benefit for passengers who choose to wear point restraints on passenger carrying rail vehicles Generally passengers who choose not to wear restraints in a vehicle modified to accept point restraints receive marginally more severe injuries br br br Airplanes br br All aerobatic aircraft and gliders sailplanes are fitted with four or five point harnesses as are many types of light aircraft and many types of military aircraft The seat belts in these aircraft have the dual function of crash protection and keeping the pilot s and crew in their seat s during turbulence and aerobatic maneuvers Passenger aircraft are fitted with lap belts Unlike road vehicles passenger aircraft seat belts are not primarily designed for crash protection Their main purpose is to keep passengers in their seats during events such as turbulence Many civil aviation authorities require a fasten seat belt sign in passenger aircraft that can be activated by a pilot during takeoff turbulence and landing The International Civil Aviation
