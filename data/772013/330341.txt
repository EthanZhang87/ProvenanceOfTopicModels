title: Automotive safety
id: 330341
Automotive safety is the study and practice of automotive design construction equipment and regulation to minimize the occurrence and consequences of traffic collisions involving motor vehicles Road traffic safety more broadly includes roadway design br One of the first formal academic studies into improving motor vehicle safety was by Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory of Buffalo New York The main conclusion of their extensive report is the crucial importance of seat belts and padded dashboards However the primary vector of traffic related deaths and injuries is the disproportionate mass and velocity of an automobile compared to that of the predominant victim the pedestrian br According to the World Health Organization WHO of cars sold in the world are not compliant with main safety standards Only countries have adopted the full set of the seven most important regulations for car safety br In the United States a pedestrian is injured by a motor vehicle every minutes and are times more likely than a vehicle s occupants to be killed in a motor vehicle crash per outing br Improvements in roadway and motor vehicle designs have steadily reduced injury and death rates in all first world countries Nevertheless auto collisions are the leading cause of injury related deaths an estimated total of million in or of the total from all causes Of those killed by autos nearly two thirds are pedestrians Risk compensation theory has been used in arguments against safety devices regulations and modifications of vehicles despite the efficacy of saving lives br Coalitions to promote road and automotive safety such as Together for Safer Roads TSR brings together global private sector companies across industries to collaborate on improving road safety TSR brings together members knowledge data technology and global networks to focus on five road safety areas that will make an impact globally and within local communities br The rising trend of autonomous things is largely driven by the move towards the autonomous car that both addresses the main existing safety issues and creates new issues The autonomous car is expected to be safer than existing vehicles by eliminating the single most dangerous element the driver The Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School claims that Some ninety percent of motor vehicle crashes are caused at least in part by human error But while safety standards like the ISO specify the required safety it is still a burden on the industry to demonstrate acceptable safety br br br Occupational driving br br Work related roadway crashes are the leading cause of death from traumatic injuries in the U S workplace They accounted for nearly deaths between and Deaths and injuries from these roadway crashes result in increased costs to employers and lost productivity in addition to their toll in human suffering Truck drivers tend to endure higher fatality rates than workers in other occupations but concerns about motor vehicle safety in the workplace are not limited to those surrounding the operation of large trucks Workers outside the motor carrier industry routinely operate company owned vehicles for deliveries sales and repair calls client visits etc In these instances the employer providing the vehicle generally plays a major role in setting safety maintenance and training policy As in non occupational driving young drivers are especially at risk In the workplace of all fatal injuries to workers under age between and in the United States resulted from transportation incidents br br br Active and passive safety br The terms active and passive are simple but important terms in the world of automotive safety Active safety is used to refer to technology assisting in the prevention of a crash and passive safety to components of the vehicle primarily airbags seatbelts and the physical structure of the vehicle that help to protect occupants during a crash br br br Crash avoidance br br Crash avoidance systems and devices help the driver and increasingly help the vehicle itself to avoid a collision This category includes br br The vehicle s headlamps reflectors and other lights and signals br The vehicle s mirrors br The vehicle s brakes steering and suspension systems br br br Driver assistance br A subset of crash avoidance is driver assistance systems which help the driver to detect obstacles and to control the vehicle Driver assistance systems include br br Driver Alertness Detection System DADS to help prevent crashes caused by fatigue lack of alertness or distractions br Advanced emergency braking system systems to prevent or reduce the severity of collision br Infrared night vision systems to increase seeing distance beyond headlamp range br Adaptive headlamps control the direction and range of the headlight beams to light the driver s way through curves and maximize seeing distance without partially blinding other drivers br Reverse backup sensors which alert drivers to difficult to see objects in their path when reversing br Backup camera br Adaptive cruise control which maintains a safe distance from the vehicle in front br Lane departure warning systems to alert the driver of an unintended departure from the intended lane of travel br Tire pressure monitoring systems or Deflation Detection Systems br Traction control systems which restore traction if driven wheels begin to spin br Electronic Stability Control which intervenes to avert an impending loss of control br Anti lock braking systems br Electronic brakeforce distribution systems br Emergency brake assist systems br Cornering Brake Control systems br Assured Clear Distance Ahead measurement and speed governance systems br Precrash system br Automated parking system br Obstacle detection sensor systems notify a driver how close their vehicle is to an object usually providing a distance measurement to the inch as to how close they are br br br Crashworthiness br br Crashworthy systems and devices prevent or reduce the severity of injuries when a crash is imminent or actually happening Much research is carried out using anthropomorphic crash test dummies br br Seatbelts limit the forward motion of an occupant stretch to absorb energy to lengthen the time of the occupant s negative acceleration in a crash reducing the loading on the occupants body They prevent occupants being ejected from the vehicle and ensure that they are in the correct position for the operation of the airbags br Airbags inflate to cushion the impact of a vehicle occupant with various parts of the vehicle s interior The most important being the prevention of direct impact of the driver s head with the steering wheel and door pillar br Laminated windshields remain in one piece when impacted preventing penetration of unbelted occupants heads and maintaining a minimal but adequate transparency for control of the car immediately following a collision It is also a bonded structural part of the safety cell Tempered glass side and rear windows break into granules with minimally sharp edges rather than splintering into jagged fragments as ordinary glass does br Crumple zones absorb and dissipate the force of a collision displacing and diverting it away from the passenger compartment and reducing the negative acceleration impact force on the vehicle occupants Vehicles will include a front rear and maybe side crumple zones like Volvo SIPS too br Safety Cell the passenger compartment is reinforced with high strength materials at places subject to high loads in a crash in order to maintain a survival space for the vehicle occupants Footwell intrusion is one recognized failure mode of the safety cell and anti intrusion bars are one component addressing protection in side impacts br Collapsible universally jointed steering columns along with steering wheel airbag The steering system is mounted behind the front axle behind and protected by the front crumple zone This reduces the risk and severity of driver impact or even impalement on the column in a frontal crash br Pedestrian protection systems br Padding of the instrument panel and other interior parts on the vehicle in areas likely to be struck by the occupants during a crash and the careful placement of mounting brackets away from those areas br Cargo barriers are sometimes fitted to provide a physical barrier between passenger and cargo compartments in vehicles such as SUVs station wagons and vans These help prevent injuries caused by occupants being struck by unsecured cargo They can also help prevent collapse of the roof in the event of a vehicle rollover br br br Post crash survivability br br Post crash survivability is the chance that drivers and passengers survive a crash after it occurs Technology such as Advanced Automatic Collision Notification can automatically place calls to emergency services and send information about a vehicle collision br br br Pedestrian safety br Cars are much more dangerous to pedestrians than they are to drivers and passengers Two thirds of million yearly auto related deaths are pedestrians Since at least the early s attention has also been given to vehicle design regarding the safety of pedestrians in car pedestrian collisions Proposals in Europe would require cars sold there to have a minimum maximum hood bonnet height From the use of bull bars a fashion on x s and SUVs became illegal in the European Union after having been banned on all new cars in br br br Conspicuity br br br Lights and reflectors br br Vehicles are equipped with a variety of lights and reflectors to mark their presence position width length and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver s intent and actions to other drivers These include the vehicle s headlamps front and rear position lamps side marker lights and reflectors turn signals stop brake lamps and reversing lamps School buses and semi trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night br Daytime running lamps have been required in the Nordic countries since the mid s in Canada since and throughout the European Union since February br br br Vehicle colour br A essay on the relation between car colour and safety stated that no previous studies had been scientifically conclusive Since then a Swedish study found that pink cars are involved in the fewest and black cars are involved in the most crashes Land transport NZ In Auckland New Zealand a study found that there was a significantly lower rate of serious injury in silver cars with higher rates in brown black and green cars The Vehicle Colour Study conducted by Monash University Accident Research Centre MUARC and published in analysed crashes that occurring between and in the Australian states of Victoria and Western Australia that resulted in injury or in a vehicle being towed away The study analysed risk by light condition It found that in daylight black cars were more likely than white to be involved in a collision followed by grey cars at silver cars at and red and blue cars at with no other colours found to be significantly more or less risky than white At dawn or dusk the risk ratio for black cars jumped to more likely than white and that for silver cars to In the hours of darkness only red and silver cars were found to be significantly more risky than white by and respectively br br br Unused safety features br Many different inventions and ideas which may or may not have been practical about auto safety have been put forward but never made it to a production car Such items include the driver seat in the middle to give the person a better view the exception being the McLaren F super car and control stick steering br br br History br br br th century th century br Automotive safety may have become an issue almost from the beginning of mechanised road vehicle development The second steam powered Fardier artillery tractor created by Nicolas Joseph Cugnot in is reported by some to have crashed into a wall during its demonstration run However according to Georges Ageon the earliest mention of this occurrence dates from and it does not feature in contemporary accounts One of the earliest recorded car related fatalities was Mary Ward on August in Parsonstown Ireland br br br s br In the Duesenburg Model A became the first car to have four wheel hydraulic brakes br br br s br In safety glass became standard on all Ford cars In the s plastic surgeon Claire L Straith and physician C J Strickland advocated the use of seat belts and padded dashboards Strickland founded the Automobile Safety League of America br In GM performed the first barrier crash test br In the Hudson Terraplane came with the first back up brake system Should the hydraulic brakes fail the brake pedal would activate a set of mechanical brakes for the back wheels br In Chrysler Plymouth DeSoto and Dodge added such items as a flat smooth dash with recessed controls rounded door handles a windshield wiper control made of rubber and the back of the front br seat heavily padded to provide protection for rear passengers br br br s br In Hugh DeHaven published the classic Mechanical analysis of survival in falls from heights of fifty to one hundred and fifty feet br In the American Tucker was built with the world s first padded dashboard It also came with middle headlight that turned with the steering wheel a front steel bulkhead and a front safety chamber br In SAAB incorporated aircraft safety thinking into automobiles making the Saab the first production SAAB car with a safety cage br Also in the Chrysler Imperial Crown was the first car to come with standard disc brakes br br br s br In a USAF surgeon who advised the US Surgeon General wrote an article on how to make cars safer for those riding in it Aside from the usual safety features such as seat belts and padded dashboards bumper shocks were introduced br In Ford tried unsuccessfully to interest Americans in purchasing safer cars with their Lifeguard safety package Its attempt nevertheless earns Ford Motor Trend s Car of the Year award for br In the United Nations established the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations an international standards body advancing auto safety Many of the most life saving safety innovations like seat belts and roll cage construction were brought to market under its auspices That same year Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin invented and patented the three point lap and shoulder seat belt which became standard equipment on all Volvo cars in Over the next several decades three point safety belts were gradually mandated in all vehicles by regulators throughout the industrialised world br In American Motors Corporation offered the first optional head rests for the front seat Also in the Cadillac Cyclone concept by Harley Earl had a radar based crash avoidance system located in the on the nose cones of the vehicle that would make audible and visual signals to the driver if there were obstacles in the vehicle s path br br br s br Effective on new passenger cars sold in the United States after January front outboard lap belts were required br On September the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act became law in the U S the first mandatory federal safety standards for motor vehicles br Effective in US market passenger cars were required to be equipped with padded instrument panels front and rear outboard lap belts and white reverse backup lamps br In the U S established the United States Department of Transportation DOT with automobile safety as one of its purposes The National Transportation Safety Board NTSB was created as an independent organization on April but was reliant on the DOT for administration and funding However in the organization was made completely independent by the Independent Safety Board Act in P L U S C br In equipment specifications by such major fleet purchasers as the City and County of Los Angeles California encouraged the voluntary installation in most new cars sold in the US of safety devices systems and design features including br br Elimination of protruding knobs and controls in passenger compartment br Additional padding on the instrument panel and other interior surfaces br Mounting points for front outboard shoulder belts br Four way hazard flashers br A uniform P R N D L gear sequence for automatic transmission gear selectors br Dual circuit brake hydraulic

front seat vehicle occupants side marker lights collapsible steering columns and other safety features saw the addition of head restraints for front outboard passengers addressing the problem of whiplash in rear end collisions These safety requirements did not apply to vehicles classified as commercial such as light duty pickup trucks Thus manufacturers did not always include such hardware in these vehicles even though many did passenger car duty br Volvo developed the first rear facing child seat in and introduced its own booster seat in br br br s br In GM offered driver and passenger airbags as optional equipment on large Cadillacs Buicks and Oldsmobiles br In the crash test dummy Hybrid III was introduced to assess the impacts of car collisions It represented the th percentile

their vehicles Initially the US NCAP New Car Assessment Program crash tests examined compliance with the occupant protection provisions of FMVSS Over the subsequent years this NHTSA program was gradually expanded in scope br br br s br In New York State passed the first U S law requiring seat belt use in passenger cars Seat belt laws have since been adopted by states New Hampshire has not NHTSA estimates the resulting increased seat belt use saves per year in the United States br In the central rd brake light was mandated in North America with most of the world following with similar standards in automotive lighting br Airbags were first installed in production vehicles in the s as standard equipment instead of an option as was done in the mid s such as the Oldsmobile Toronado in In airbags were an available option on the Mercedes Benz W S Class In the Porsche Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment and airbags were offered as an available option on the and S The first airbag was also installed in a Japanese car the Honda Legend in In Chrysler was the first United States company to install standard driver s side air bags in six of its passenger models In Chrysler became the first U S auto manufacturer to install driver side air bags in all its domestic built automobiles br br br s br In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS began frontal offset crash tests br Also in the same year Volvo introduced the world s first car with side airbags the br In the European New Car Assessment Programme Euro NCAP was established to test new vehicles safety performance and publish the results for vehicle shoppers information The NHTSA crash tests are presently operated and published as the U S branch of the international NCAP programme br br br s br In the NHTSA released a regulation making trunk releases mandatory for new cars by September of the following year due in part to the lobbying efforts of Janette Fennell br In the IIHS began conducting side impact crash tests In NHTSA released new tests designed to test the rollover risk of new cars and SUVs Only the Mazda RX got a star rating br Also in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA introduced a female counterpart crash test dummy of Hybrid III This dummy was just a scaled down version of the original Hybrid III only representing the smallest of women based on mid s standards br In Citro n became the first manufacturer to feature Snowmotion an Intelligent Anti Skid system developed in conjunction with Bosch which gives drivers a level of control in extreme ice or snow conditions similar to a x br In NHTSA upgraded its roof crush standard for vehicles weighing pounds or less The new standard increased the crush load requirement from to times the vehicle s curb weight br br br s br From new cars should have brake assist system in the EU according to The Pedestrian Protection Regulation EC br Starting in all cars under lbs sold in the US are required to have Electronic Stability Control br In ESP Electronic Stability Program and TPMS became mandatory in the European Union with also the driver seat belt reminder and the ISOFIX system under General Safety Regulation EC No br In recognizing that safer roads are a shared responsibility Together for Safer Roads TSR was formally launched to align the private sector s road safety efforts with the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety br In and ABS became mandatory on motorcycles in the EU br In eCall became mandatory in the EU and reverse camera in the US br In the EU legislated to revise the General Safety Regulation GSR the revision includes the following automotive safety features br br Intelligent Speed Assistance ISA br Drowsiness Alerts DDR AW br Distraction Alerts br Event Data Recorders EDR br Advanced Emergency Braking br Alcohol Interlock Installation Facilitation ALC br Tire pressure monitoring system TPMS br Emergency Stop Signals ESS br Lane Departure Warning Systems br Reversing Detection REV br Safety belt Warning Systems covering all the seats in a vehicle br Vehicle Master Control Switches br Driver Availability Monitoring Systems br In addition a number of regulatory changes have been made in the update to the GSR in relation to vehicle design in which the following have been mandated br br Enlargement of Head Impact Zones br Reduction of blind spots for buses vans and HGVs br Improved easy access for people with low levels of mobility on buses which have a capacity over persons and which allow standing br Regulation in relation to frontal protection systems br Previously vans SUVs and MPVs were exempted from regulations pertaining to height and vehicle characteristics these exemptions have been revised br br br Safety trends br In the US about people were killed by traffic crashes every year from to Sharp rises in the price of fuel and related driver behavioural changes reduced highway fatalities in the US to below the fatality count Litigation played a large part in mandating safer cars br Safety is a significant concern in the European Union EU with fatalities and around serious injuries in and respectively Overall between and there was an almost reduction in road deaths in the EU from in to the figure of In the EU average road death rate was people per million inhabitants Also in Romania had the worst figures in this regard with people out of a million inhabitants dying on the roads Belgium had the median score standing at deaths per million and the UK scored the best with people out of every million dying on its roads br br br International comparison br In the US had about deaths per motor vehicles compared to in Germany in France and in the UK In there were fatal crashes in the UK the fewest since in this number was further reduced to and was attributed to the scrappage scheme br The sizable traffic safety lead enjoyed by the US since the s had narrowed significantly by with the US improvement percentages lagging in th place behind those of Australia Austria Canada Denmark Finland Germany United Kingdom Iceland Japan Luxembourg the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden and Switzerland in terms of deaths per thousand vehicles while in terms of deaths per million vehicle miles travelled the US had dropped from first place to tenth place br br br US specificities br Transportation safety in the United States is monitored by various agencies br br Research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the US and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of pickup trucks and SUVs in the US A study by the US Transportation Research Board found that SUVs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars that non US branded vehicles tend to be safer than US branded vehicles and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicle s engineering In the US the level of large commercial truck traffic has substantially increased since the s while highway capacity has not kept pace with the increase in large commercial truck traffic on US highways However other factors exert significant influence Canada has lower roadway death and injury rates despite a vehicle mix comparable to that of the US Nevertheless the widespread use of truck based vehicles as passenger carriers is correlated with roadway deaths and injuries not only directly by dint of vehicular safety performance per se but also indirectly through the relatively low fuel costs that facilitate the use of such vehicles in North America motor vehicle fatalities decline as fuel prices increase br The US NHTSA has issued relatively few regulations since the mid s most of the vehicle based reduction in vehicle fatality rates in the US during the last third of the th Century were gained by the initial NHTSA safety standards issued from to and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle design and construction by vehicle manufacturers br br br Issues for particular demographic groups br br br Women br The domain of automotive design has been traditionally characterized as male dominated As a result there has been a lack of female automotive designers in the area of automotive safety compared to male automotive designers This leads to oversights in automotive safety and ergonomics for female consumers who make up of all new cars sold in the USA According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS women are less likely to get into a crash than men are However women are more likely to die in a car crash and more likely to sustain serious injuries from a crash when compared to men In rear end collisions female drivers face a higher risk of whiplash injuries when compared to their male counterparts due to their lighter weight which causes them to be propelled forward more rapidly br When pregnant women should continue to use seatbelts and airbags properly A University of Michigan study found that unrestrained or improperly restrained pregnant women are times more likely to have an adverse fetal outcome than properly restrained pregnant women If seatbelts are not long enough extensions are available from the car manufacturer or an aftermarket supplier br br br Infants and children br Children present significant challenges in engineering and producing safe vehicles because most children are significantly smaller and lighter than most adults Additionally children far from being just scaled down adults still have an undeveloped skeletal system This means that vehicle restraint systems such as airbags and seat belts far from being effective are hazardous if used to restrain young children In recognition of this many medical professionals and jurisdictions recommend or require that children under a particular age height and or weight ride in a child seat and or in the back seat as applicable br Within Europe ECE Regulation R dictates that children below cm must travel in a child restraint that is appropriate for their weight Each country have their own adaptions of this Regulation For instance in the United Kingdom children must travel in a child restraint until they are cm tall or reach years of age which ever comes soonest As another example in Austria the driver of passenger vehicles is responsible for people shorter than cm and below years to be seated in an adequate child safety seat Moreover it is not allowed for children below the age of to ride in a passenger vehicle without security system which in practice means the vehicle is not equipped with any seat belts or technical systems like Isofix whereas children between and years have to ride in the back seat br Sweden specify that a child or an adult shorter than cm is legally forbidden to ride in a place with an active airbag in front of it br The majority of medical professionals and biomechanical engineers agree that children below the age of two years old are much safer if they travel in a rearward facing child restraint br Child safety locks and driver controlled power window lockout controls prevent children from opening doors and windows from inside the vehicle br br Infants left in cars br Very young children can perish from heat or cold if left unattended in a parked car whether deliberately or through absent mindedness In the U S NHTSA estimated fatalities per year among children left in hot cars br br br Teenage drivers br In the UK a full driving licence can be had at age and most areas in the United States will issue a full driver s license at the age of and all within a range between and In addition to being relatively inexperienced teen drivers are also cognitively immature compared to adult drivers This combination leads to a relatively high crash rate among this demographic br In some areas new drivers vehicles must bear a warning sign to alert other drivers that the vehicle is being driven by an inexperienced and learning driver giving them opportunity to be more cautious and to encourage other drivers to give novices more leeway In the U S New Jersey has Kyleigh s Law citing that teen drivers must have a decal on their vehicle br Some countries such as Australia the United States Canada and New Zealand have graduated levels of driver s licence with special rules By all US states required a graduated driver s licence for drivers under age In Italy the maximum speed and power of vehicles driven by new drivers is restricted In Romania the maximum speed of vehicles driven by new drivers less than one year in experience is km h lower than the national standard except villages towns and cities Many U S states allow year olds to skip some requirements that younger drivers would face which statistics show may be causing higher crash rates among new drivers New Jersey has the same requirements for new drivers up to the age of which may obviate this problem br br br Medical conditions br According to a study published in in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings although most drivers with medical conditions were safe drivers drivers with psychiatric conditions or substance abuse were particularly at higher risks of unsafe driving The study also reported that drivers with neurological conditions were the majority of the entire study population Belgium who were referred for a driving evaluation but they were not the most unsafe drivers br br br Elderly br Insurance statistics in the United States indicate a increase in the number of elderly killed comparing to br Several states require additional testing for elderly drivers On a per driver basis the number of fatal and overall crashes decreases with age with some exceptions for drivers over The overall trend may be due to greater experience and avoiding driving in adverse conditions However on a per miles travelled basis drivers younger than and older than have significantly higher crash rates Survivability of crashes decreases monotonically with the age of the victim br A common problem for the elderly is the question of when a medical condition or biological aging presents a serious enough problem that one should stop driving In some cases this means giving up some personal independence but in urban areas often means relying more on public transportation Many transit systems offer discounted fares to seniors and some local governments run senior shuttles specifically targeted at this demographic br br br Vehicle programs br While it is usually considered that the driver has the responsibility when collisions occur vehicle can also contribute to collisions up to to of crashes br Two kinds of programs exist new car assessment program for new cars and vehicle inspections for other ones br br br NCAP br br A New Car Assessment Program is a government or institutional car safety program tasked with evaluating new car designs for performance against various safety threats br Two well known NCAP are United States New Car Assessment Program since and European New Car Assessment Programme since br br br Legal vehicle inspections br Vehicle inspection is a procedure mandated by national or subnational governments in many countries in which a vehicle is inspected to ensure that it conforms to regulations governing safety emissions or both Inspection can be required at various times e g periodically or on the transfer of title to a vehicle br If required periodically it might be termed periodic motor vehicle inspection or MOT test in the UK or roadworthiness test in EU directives Typical intervals are every two years in EU and every year in UK When a vehicle passes inspection often a sticker is placed on the vehicle s windshield or registration plate to simplify later controls but in some countries such as Netherlands since this is no longer necessary br Vehicles are tested at inspection stations when due for inspection Most US inspection decals stickers display the month s number and the year They are called testing centre in EU directives br Vehicle inspection exists in the United States br In Victoria Australia safety features checked include the structure of the vehicle the tires depth of tread the wheels the engine steering suspension brakes and lights and seatbelts br br br Other safety measures br Tires should be checked regularly br Tire checking is important because proper contact between tire and road is required for adequate vehicle control br br br See also br br
