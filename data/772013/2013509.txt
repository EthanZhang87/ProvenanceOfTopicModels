id: 2013509
The AMC Matador is a series of American automobiles that were manufactured and marketed by American Motors Corporation AMC across two generations from through mid size and until full size in two door hardtop first generation and coupe second generation versions as well as in four door sedan and station wagon body styles br The first generation Matador was focused on the family market segment It was also offered in performance versions as highlighted in the NASCAR racing series with factory support from through With its second generation the Matador became AMC s largest size automobile after the Ambassador which shared the same platform was discontinued after the model year Premium trim levels of the second generation Matador coupe were marketed as the Barcelona and Oleg Cassini after the noted fashion designer positioning the coupe in the personal luxury segment The Matador was popular as a police car in the United States and several television series featured Matadors in prominent roles br Abroad Matadors were also marketed under the Rambler marque and were assembled under license in Costa Rica Mexico and Australia Matadors were also marketed in overseas markets including exports of right hand drive versions to the UK br br br Background br The Matador replaced the AMC Rebel marketed since With a facelift and a new name the AMC Matadors were available in two door hardtop four door sedan and station wagon body styles The Matador shared a modified platform with the full size Ambassador line with a shorter wheelbase Although related directly to the previous Rebel models AMC began promoting the Matador as more than a change in name with a slight facelift to reposition the line in the highly competitive intermediate car segment among consumers The advertising campaign was built around the question What s a Matador br Sedan and wagon models offered excellent value and were fairly popular cars Matadors were also offered to fleet buyers with various police taxicab and other heavy duty packages They outperformed most other cars and was adopted as the official police car Matadors became popular with government agencies and military units as well as police departments in the U S and the sedans and wagons were typically equipped with cu in L or cu in L V engines Matadors with heavy duty police equipment were produced from through They continued to be in service longer than usual because of favorable field reports br The Matador received a redesign in in part to meet new U S safety and crash requirements The most significant change was to the two door version The hardtop was the slowest selling body style in the Matador line However it was in a market segment where two door models were typically the most popular and profitable for other automakers As a result the boxy two door hardtop body design was replaced with a wholly different and sleeker coupe model to contend with the bull market for plush mid size coupes that sprang up after the end of the muscle car era It also featured a design that was praised by owners along with their complaints about its low roofline The design of the Matador coupe has been described as polarizing as well as being an evocative swoopy coupe that perfectly captured the design ethos of the era br Factory backed first generation hardtops and second generation coupes competed in NASCAR car racing from through Drivers included Mark Donohue and Bobby Allison who won several races including the Southern at Darlington The AMC Matador captured five first place wins br Matadors in police livery were featured in television shows and movies during the s The Matador coupe was a featured car and a scale model of it was used as a flying car in The Man with the Golden Gun a James Bond film released in br br br First generation br br br br br For Matadors received a revised front styling for all body styles It shared its body design from the firewall rearward with the Ambassador and the same platform Revisions included a longer wheelbase and updated front styling grille and chrome trim The new Matador was available in four door sedan two door hardtop no B pillar and four door station wagon body styles br The sedan and hardtop models retained the same rear bumper trunk lid chrome strip and rear corner chrome garnishes as the Rebel The Rebel tail light lenses were replaced with three rounded square lenses The interior dash instrument cluster steering wheel and armrests were carried over from the model as was the Weather Eye fan heat control unit used since br Advertising suggested the Matador was not just a name change and facelift The new nameplate distanced the car from connotations of social unrest The What s a Matador advertising campaign established a distinct marketing identity for the car This self disparaging marketing campaign turned the styling of anonymity into an asset Consumer research polls conducted by AMC found it meant virility and excitement to consumers American Motors ran into problems in Puerto Rico where the term matador retained a bullfighting killer connotation br Station wagons offered optional rear facing third row bench seats increasing seating from six to eight passengers Standard equipment included a roof rack as well as a two way tailgate so that with the rear window retracted it could be opened downward using a center mounted release handle engaging the bottom mounted hinges thus extending the load surface or swing open door like when using the handle on the right side that engaged the hinges on the left side of the tailgate br The Matador came with a straight or one of several available V engines The Matador s transmissions included the Borg Warner sourced Shift Command three speed automatic a column shifted three speed manual and a floor shifted four speed manual br br br Machine Go package br The traditional muscle car market segment sharply decreased in with ever higher insurance rates and ever more power robbing changes required on engines forced to operate on lower octane lead free gasoline Combined it was enough to force AMC to discontinue its high performance Rebel Machine model after just one year Instead an optional Machine Go package of performance enhancements was offered as an option not a model designation for the Matador two door hardtop It included many of those the Rebel Machine had had with other options available individually but without any specific Machine designation badges or marketing The only engines available with the Go package were the cu in L V an additional option and the newly introduced cu in L AMC s largest engine extra over the standard cu in L V Red white blue striping as offered on the Rebel Machine was not available nor was its standard factory installed ram air hood scoop No specific transmissions or shifters were included br Included with the Machine Go package were x inch slot style wheels L x raised white lettered Goodyear Polyglas tires a Space Saver spare power disc brakes and a handling package that included heavy duty springs shocks and rear sway bar Dual exhaust was standard with the optional cu in L V but was extra with the base cu in L engine A Twin Grip differential was optional but recommended with the performance package and required with the optional rear end br Approximately fifty Matadors with the Machine Go package were produced for the model year br br br br The Matador was positioned as a family car and continued with a few changes in sedan two door hardtop and a station wagon with two or three rows of seats The cu in L I was standard on sedans and the hardtop with the wagon including the cu in L I engine as standard A three speed column manual transmission was standard with the I engines A total of five different horsepower versions of V s bhp kW PS bhp kW PS bhp kW PS bhp kW PS and bhp kW PS were optional and available only with a column mounted automatic transmission The previous Borg Warner sourced Shift Command three speed automatic transmission was replaced by the Chrysler built TorqueFlite three speed automatic that AMC marketed as Torque Command The optional four speed manual was discontinued All engines were designed to use no lead low octane gasoline New rocker arms and bearings provided quiet valve train operation br The model year introduced AMC s innovative Buyer Protection Plan to address increasing consumer demands This was the automobile industry s first month or mile km bumper to bumper warranty American Motors started with an emphasis on quality and durability by focusing on its component sourcing improving production that included reducing the number of models mechanical upgrades and increasing standard equipment This was followed by an innovative promise to its customers to repair anything wrong with the car except for tires Owners were provided with a toll free number to the company as well as a complimentary loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight The objective was to reduce warranty claims and achieve better public relations along with greater customer satisfaction and loyalty AMC dealers evaluated this revolutionary coverage as successful in bringing buyers into the showroom providing a sales tool that other brands did not offer and the quality of the cars resulted in improved ownership satisfaction br Externally the models were the same as the versions retaining the same front end but now with a simplified grille design The chrome trunk lid strip and rear corner chrome found on the Rebels and Matadors were dropped The model was given a new tail light lens assembly each divided into nine recessed vertically rectangular lenses The models saw the return of the round instrument dials of earlier Ambassador and Rebel models The steering wheel resembled the Rebel and Matador models New for the model were slimmer door armrests and a bench seat without the fold down center armrests Individual reclining front seats were an option for all body styles with optional front bucket seats and center armrests on the hardtops br Production of Matadors included sedans station wagons and pillar less hardtops br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The Matador hardtop sedan and station wagon body styles came in only one trim model for with numerous appearance and comfort options The model year brought new U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA regulations that required all passenger cars to withstand a mile per hour km h front and a mile per hour km h rear impacts without damage to the engine lights and safety equipment Matadors gained stronger front and rear bumpers The front bumper included self restoring telescoping shock absorbers and more prominent vertical rubber guards In contrast the rear bumper gained vertical black rubber bumper guards that replaced a pair of similar and previously optional chrome bumper guards Aside from the changes to the bumpers the design of the model was identical to the model except for new tail light lens assemblies and a slightly different grille pattern The dash and instrument cluster of the model were repeated in the model However the steering wheel horn pad no longer included a bullseye emblem which had been used since the last year of the Rebel models The full width bench seat was standard with individually adjustable and reclining seats were optional on all body styles The station wagons came with Uganda vinyl upholstery while the two door hardtops offered optional front bucket seats br All V powered Matadors included a TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a column mounted shifter The V Autolite carburetor was replaced with the modified Motorcraft carburetor The cu in L I was the base engine with a column mounted three speed manual transmission with a cu in L I optional with which only the station wagon could be ordered with manual transmission because almost all six cylinder powered Matadors came with TorqueFlite automatics br Promotional and publicity efforts for the Matador included sponsorship at NASCAR racing events Mark Donohue drove a two door hardtop prepared by Roger Penske on the road course at Riverside California on January lapping the entire field to win this NASCAR Cup Series race This was also Penske s first NASCAR victory at the Winston Western with Donohue s Matador leading out of the laps br A comparison of Matador owners conducted by Popular Mechanics indicated increased satisfaction and fewer problems than was the case with the owners of the essentially similar AMC Rebel three years earlier br The intermediate sized car market segment was growing to almost of the total market by Still the hardtop was the slowest selling version in the Matador line in a segment where two door hardtops were customarily the most popular and profitable models Automobile Quarterly reviewed the cars and summarized that AMC actually has a very strong product line but public awareness of it seems so feeble as to be negligible The Matador became a typical intermediate an exact counterpart of the Satellite Coronet or Torino Montego and ranked AMC s car as a good buy br br AMC Matador br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Second generation br br American Motors was facing many challenges in a dynamic marketplace The strategy to redesign the Matador for the model year was an example of the changes Gerald C Meyers vice president of product development wanted for AMC s mid sized product range The intermediate sized cars were best sellers in the U S and the two door hardtops or coupe versions most popular with consumers Because styling was most significant selling point a decision was made to develop a new version of the Matador as a coupe thus giving designers the freedom to style rakishly as sheet metal could be made to look and eliminating the limits of making sedans and station wagons with the same lines br The results of these efforts were introduced with the model year Matadors Four door sedans and station wagons featured significant front end changes The rear end on the four door sedans was revised In contrast the two door model became a separate and radically styled pillared coupe All models included new interiors and paint colors The previous hardtop body style design was discontinued and the new two door coupe no longer shared body parts with the sedan or wagon The coupe s roofline was significantly lower and its wheelbase was inches millimetres shorter than the four door Matadors These are considered to be the second generation Matadors br br br br br New passenger car requirements set by NHTSA called for the front and rear passenger car bumpers to have uniform heights take angle impacts and sustain mile per hour km h impacts with no damage All the Matadors accomplished this with massive front and rear bumpers mounted on energy absorbing shocks The sedans and station wagons had them integrated with the bodywork using gap concealing flexible filler panels br The four door sedans and wagons had increased overall vehicle length as well as new front and rear styling A new front fascia with a hood and grille featured a prominent central protrusion that followed the front bumper shape Matadors with this front end are sometimes nicknamed coffin noses The sedan s rear was redesigned with the license plate was relocated above the number to the center of the rear panel with new wider rectangular taillights The station wagon had redesigned taillamps and a heavier more robust bumper with a central rubber facing br The two door hardtop Matador of the previous series was replaced with an all new fast back coupe for a wholly restyled model with no appearance similar to the new sedan and wagon br The interior of all body styles including the radically different coupe featured an all new fully padded and safety shaped dashboard with three squared pods for housing the instruments in front of the driver indicator lights fuel gauge and water temperature to the left mph km h speedometer at the center and an electric clock or fuel economy gauge on the right as well as a new horizontal radio sound system design in the center of the dash The traditional steering wheel horn pad since the Rebel was replaced with a rectangular soft feel horn bar br Second generation sedans and station wagons continued with minor trim and equipment changes only through to br The base model sedans and wagons came with the cu in L I with the three speed Torque Command automatic transmission The cu in L V was optional A two barrel or four barrel cu in L was optional as well as a cu in L V with dual exhausts The cu in L V became a fleet only option after br A road test by automobile journalist Vincent Courtenay of the Matador station wagon praised its performance handling and fuel economy considering its size and CID engine He described it as a real sleeper on the market Its performance ranks it in the first line of cars yet it s reasonably priced br br br br br Changes for the model year were minor as AMC focused on developing and introducing its innovative Pacer Matadors now included a standard no maintenance electronic ignition developed by Prestolite All U S market Matadors featured catalytic converters that required unleaded regular grade fuel New unleaded fuel only decals were placed by the fuel filler door A warning notice was added on the face of the fuel gauge along with a restricted gas tank filler opening that allowed only the smaller pump nozzle that came on new pumps dispensing unleaded fuel Steel belted radial tires became standard equipment on all Matadors br The six cylinder engine now became the cu in L version and it was not available in California The standard V was cu in L and optional were two versions of the cu in L with a two barrel carburetor or a four barrel with a dual exhaust system that AMC called Power Package The cu in L was available only for police and fleet orders From the and V s were fitted with the upgraded four barrel Autolite carburetor Only V powered Matadors were available in California br The sedan and wagon exteriors were updated with a new full width grille featuring squared off parking lights in the front and a new tail light lens assembly An uplevel Brougham trim option became available for sedans and wagons starting with the model year There were no further style changes to the body of the sedan and wagon for the remainder of the production run br A preview of the Matador models by the editors of Consumer Guide was quite complimentary especially of the sedan and wagon br br br br br For the model year changes to the Matador sedan and station wagon were minimal The only external upgrades were the addition of side bumper pads to the front and rear bumpers The paddle style inside door handles were changed for along with new armrests used in other AMC vehicles Otherwise all interior features remained the same The Brougham trim option continued for sedans and station wagons in Included were individually adjustable reclining front seats with custom Hyde Park fabric for the sedan or Soft Touch vinyl for the station wagon woodgrain trim on the dashboard and door panels with assist straps full length bodyside scuff moldings and other exterior trim br The cu in L six cylinder with a manual transmission remained as the base drivetrain for the sedans The cu in L V with an automatic transmission was standard on station wagons optional on the sedan A popular upgrade was the cu in L V with a two barrel carburetor A Performance Option cu in L V with a four barrel carburetor and a dual exhaust system that included twin catalytic converters was available through The rear axle ratio was standard with and optional A floor shifted automatic transmission was available on coupes equipped with a V engine bucket seats and center console br The fuel economy ratings with automatic transmission were br mpg US L km mpg imp city and mpg US L km mpg imp highway for the six cylinder which did not use a catalytic converter to meet emissions requirements Cars with the I and manual transmission as well as all V Matadors included a catalytic converter br mpg US L km mpg imp city and mpg US L km mpg imp highway for the cu in L V engine br mpg US L km mpg imp city and mpg US L km mpg imp highway for the cu in L V two and four barrel versions br These ratings were similar to those of the competitors such as the Dodge Coronet and Charger fourth generation with cu in L V

L km mpg imp city and mpg US L km mpg imp highway br When new the Matadors were considered great cars but AMC could not really market the car against the other full sizers from the Big Three domestic automakers The U S automobile marketplace underwent significant changes and adaptation The Big Three domestic automakers still held of the market while sales of foreign brands continued to expand While the overall automobile market started recovering after the and slump following the oil crisis sales of the large sized Matador did not increase The number four domestic automaker s share of the U S market dropped from in to in as consumer demand for small cars decreased To help move unsold cars AMC offered price cuts and rebates to buyers A problem with emissions controls required a recall of almost all non California Matadors which cost AMC more than million and contributed to a net loss of million for the fiscal year br br br br br All Matadors included enhanced comfort trim and convenience equipment as factory standard Among them were automatic transmission power steering power disc brakes full wheel covers as well as individually adjustable and reclining front seats Standard were fully color coordinated interiors with plaid patterned fabrics or full vinyl upholstery Plush carpet was also in the cargo area of station wagons that featured chrome strips on the load floor to ease loading items br For the model year AMC introduced the Buyer Protection Plan II which extended the engine and drivetrain warranty from the previous twelve months or miles kilometres limits to cover months or miles kilometres miles br The base engines continued to be the cu in L I and the cu in L V with the cu in L optional The high performance Power Package was discontinued for br The domestic automakers had begun the process of downsizing their models in response to changing market demands but AMC continued its body design with the result that the six cylinder Matador now weighed lb kg more along with having less interior room than a new large sized six cylinder Pontiac br br br br All Matador sedans and station wagons came in the Brougham trim level but now without any exterior identification The Barcelona option that was previously exclusive to the Matador Coupe was extended to the four door sedan This special trim package included velveteen crush fabric upholstery on the individually reclining front seats vinyl roof and coordination of colors both inside and outside The Barcelona sedan came in a choice of two two tone color schemes Golden Ginger Metallic on Sand Tan with a tan interior or Autumn Red metallic on Claret metallic with a claret interior Additional features included woven accent stripes on the seats as well as on custom door trim

black trunk carpeting br For the cu in L I remained the standard engine in the sedan and coupe with the cu in L being the only available V All station wagons included the cu in L V as standard Power output was increased with the I now rated at hp kW PS and the V went back to hp kW PS as it was during and The V s torque was increased to lb ft N m at rpm from lb ft N m at rpm in br The AMC Buyer Protection Plan for reverted to months or mi km coverage across the entire AMC range br In sales of the Matador fell by two thirds and AMC proceeded to drop the line by the end of the model year A minor front end face lift was planned presumably for the model year with one surviving example coming up for sale at one point br br br Matador Coupe br br American Motors executives saw an opportunity to replace the uninspired Matador two door hardtop with a new design to capture people looking for exciting sporty styling in a market segment outpacing the rest of the automobile market Marketers also wanted a model to answer the demand for plush mid size coupes after the end of the muscle car era br The model year introduced an aerodynamically styled fastback coupe with pronounced tunneled headlight surrounds The Matador coupe was the only all new model in the popular mid size car segment explicitly targeting the Chevrolet Chevelle Coupe Ford Torino Coupe and Plymouth Satellite Sebring The coupe was designed under the direction of AMC s vice president of styling Dick Teague with input from Mark Donohue the famous race car driver AMC s styling department had greater freedom because of a decision to design the new Matador strictly as a coupe without the constraints of attempting to have the sedan and station wagon versions fit the same body lines br Teague reportedly designed the coupe s front as an homage to one of the first AMCs he designed the Rambler American This was one of several distinctive elements as the long sloping hood was set off by deeply tunneled headlamps between a broad grille with turn signal lamps resembling driving lamps The forward edge of the hood was part of a character crease line that went entirely around the middle of the car and continued across the rear end The coupe s doors were extra long and featured frameless glass The B pillar was also distinctive and the quarter side windows sloped with the roofline Combining a long low hood and a tall short rear deck enhanced the coupe s wind shaped look The new coupe featured a unique design to avoid the massive blockish look The bodywork flowed underneath the coupe s broad grille with tunneled headlamps in the rear with an uninterrupted design with the four round taillamps and an indented license plate area while the bumpers were free standing with rubber gaiters concealing the retractable shock absorbers br The standard power team for the coupe was AMC s cu in L inline six cylinder with a three speed manual transmission Standard on the Matador X was the cu in L V A floor shift automatic transmission was available only on the coupe with a center console and bucket front seats br Many were amazed that AMC developed the fast stylish Matador considering the automaker s size and limited resources The Matador coupe stands out as one of the more distinctive and controversial designs of the s after the AMC Pacer and was named Best Styled Car of by the editors of Car and Driver magazine A Popular Mechanics survey indicated luscious looks of Matador coupe swept most owners off their feet with a specific like listed by of them for styling br Sales of the coupe were brisk with Matador coupes delivered for its introductory year August through December Long Year up sharply from the Matador hardtops sold in This is a respectable record that went against the drop in the overall market during and the decline in popularity of intermediate sized coupes after the oil crisis br The coupe was also a milestone car for American Motors by being the six millionth automobile built by AMC since its formation from the merger of Nash and Hudson in br A new grille for the coupe was introduced for the model year Two rectangular panels with horizontal grille bars met in the center and rectangular park and turn signal lamps replaced the previous round ones br After the coupe outsold the four door Matadors by nearly units in sales dropped to less than in then down to in the final year Nearly Matador coupes were produced from through br American Motors executives including vice president of design Dick Teague described design plans for a four door sedan and station wagon based on the coupe s styling themes that did not reach production br br br Oleg Cassini br br A special Oleg Cassini edition of the Matador coupe was available for the and model years It was positioned in the mid sized personal luxury car market segment that was highly popular during the mid s The Cassini Matador was the latest in a series of designer cars marketed by AMC from a program launched in when AMC signed contracts with selected top names in the fashion world The Cassini model followed the Gucci Hornet and Pierre Cardin Javelin unique designs as well as the Levi s package of the Gremlin and Hornet American Motors had the famous American fashion designer develop an elegant luxury oriented haute couture design for the all new Matador coupe br Cassini was renowned in Hollywood and high society for making elegant ready to wear dresses including those worn by Jacqueline Kennedy According to Dick Teague the automaker s vice president of styling AMC wanted to target mid size car buyers aged to and marketing studies showed that Cassini was a fashion authority whose name was familiar in America as his name was at the top of consumer recognition lists Cassini helped promote the car in AMC s advertising br This was also the first time in AMC s designer models where the fashion expert influenced both the interior and exterior details with the objective for the entire car to emphasize a carefully wrought harmony of colors trim and fabrics With Cassini s styling the new smooth and slippery two door featured marks of haute couture with the upholstery panels and headliner done in jet black with copper trim pieces and with carpets and vinyl roof also offered in a copper accent color The exterior trim included striping bodyside rub strips custom wheel covers and special Oleg Cassini crest badging The Cassini coupes were limited to black white or copper metallic exterior paints and all came with the vinyl covered roof They also featured copper colored trim in the grille headlamp bezels within the standard turbine type full wheel covers and also within the rear license plate recess br The interior was a Cassini hallmark featuring a unique black fabric with copper metal buttons on the individual adjustable and reclining front seats as well as on the padded door panels The design was further enhanced by deep pile copper colored carpeting Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel door pulls and instrument panel Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests The glove compartment door trunk lid front fender and hood featured Cassini s signature br The Cassini version generated publicity along with showroom traffic for AMC dealers A total of Cassinis were built during the model year with another versions for Changes for were minimal such as using AMC s new standard steering wheel design with a softer cover and tapered spokes The Cassini luxury designer model was supplanted for the model year with the Barcelona version designed by AMC s in house staff This new model took the Matador to a whole other level of being a mini Mark IV but with none of the prestige br The use of a fashion designer to specially create appearance packages for American cars was followed by the Continental Mark IV in br br br Barcelona br br For and the Barcelona II coupe featured a padded Landau roof with opera windows and pillow top seats with velour upholstery These styling cues and interior trims were favored at that time by buyers in the highly popular two door personal luxury market segment Initial production was available in only one distinctive two tone paint pattern consisting of Golden Ginger Metallic with Sand Tan br The Barcelona included numerous comfort and appearance upgrades in

the Hudson Hornet of predecessor company Hudson the company s effort raised eyebrows for many NASCAR veterans because AMC was not known for cultivating a racing image Racing pundits initially scoffed at the notion of an AMC entry on the circuit but the Matador acquired a fan following of its own br Hutcherson Pagan built a pair of two door hardtop Bull Fighters for Penske as the marque s first

Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the vehicles for final assembly in AMI s facilities in Port Melbourne Victoria AMI used the same paint codes for the Matadors as the Toyota and Triumph vehicles they also assembled These paint codes did not correspond to the AMC paint codes thus Australian Matador colors are unique Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights

laws this Australian sourced componentry reduced the tariff added to each car br Australian Design Rules did not allow for flashing brake lights Thus red color rear turn signals were prohibited in Australia Therefore Matador sedans had amber lenses in place of the transparent reversing lens portion of the tail light assembly these served as combination turn signal backup lights Matador station wagons had amber add on lights fitted into the tailgate As with its Rebel predecessor the Matador hardtops were not marketed in Australia AMI s two door offering was instead the Rambler Javelin br br br br br AMI continued to assemble the AMC Rebel into late In the latter part of the year AMI began assembly of the Matador The AMI built Matador was available in sedan and wagon body styles with AMC s cu in L engine and Borg Warner automatic transmission The dual exhaust and Twin Grip differential options from the U S Go package were standard on the Australian models The sedan s list price was AU and the wagon was AU br As with the previous Australian assembled Rebel models the AMI assembled Matador continued to use the dash of the U S Rambler Ambassador first used in the right hand drive Ambassadors produced for the United States Postal Service in including the three lever Weather Eye heater unit and analog clock to the left of the instrument fascia The black round instrument dials of the U S Ambassador were also reused A black metal plate with an image of a bull and a bullfighter covered the cavity to the right side of the fascia where the radio was mounted on U S models Instead an AM radio unit was fitted into the center of the dash above the ashtray br Locally sourced air conditioning included an under dash evaporator unit The seats for the model consisted of a locally made full bench seat in vinyl with a fold down center armrest for both front and rear seats and headrests for the front br Interior door panels were locally made in the style of the U S model but with cutouts to accommodate the right hand drive positioning of the power window controls from the U S AMC Ambassador and the rear door panels came standard with ashtrays br Interior color choices included crimson black cream or brown but the plastic trim dashboard steering column and steering wheel were all finished in black br The lighting system was modified to meet Australian regulations The front turn signals used clear lenses rather than the U S amber ones the front and rear side marker lights were amber rather than amber front red rear as in the U S model and were wired as additional turn signals and the inner taillights were fitted with amber lenses and used as combination turn signal back up lights br The Australian Matador also came with unique R logo hub caps which were locally made The full sized stainless steel hubcaps with the American Motors lettering featured on the U S and New Zealand Rebel and U S Matador were never available as an option in Australia Apart from the hubcaps the Australian Matador was identical externally as the U S models br Unlike the U S models Australian Matadors came standard with power steering and power windows They continued to have the

November br As with the U S model the Australian sedan and wagon came with the new Torqueflite transmission and the new for external and internal styling changes br The black instrument dials of the U S Ambassador were again reused in the RHD Ambassador dash The revised door armrests of the U S model were consistent with the Australian model The front bench seats were again locally made featuring individually reclinable driver and passenger seatbacks and a fold down middle armrest The rear seat was the same as the Australian model The locally made door panels from the model were continued allowing for the RHD power window controls br To comply with the Australian requirement for amber rear turn signals the backup light lenses were changed from clear to amber on the sedans and the lights were wired as combination turn signal backup lights Station wagons received amber turn signals attached to the tailgate Front turn signal lenses on all models were clear br The Australian R hub caps were reused for the model Power windows power antenna under dash air conditioning and the earlier Rambler interior steering components remained standard br A total of Matadors sedans and station wagons were sold in most being U S models br br br br AMI continued to assemble the U S model into Production of the U S model began in October The Australian Matador was identical to the U S model incorporating grille and taillight changes All Australian cars were built with the earlier Rambler heavier duty steering components and heavy duty suspension br A four barrel carburetor replaced the two barrel carburetor on the cu in L V providing for an increase in brake horsepower and a increase in torque despite the addition of emission controls br For as amber front turn signals were adopted in Australia AMI discontinued the transparent parking light turn signal lenses instead installing rectangular ill fitting amber trailer truck lenses into where the proper fitting lenses should have been br From Matadors were fitted with Australian made front vinyl upholstered split bench seats each with fold down armrests and headrests The new headrests were slimmer than the and models The rear bench seat remained the same The locally made door panels first used in the Australian model remained unchanged Power windows power steering under dash air conditioning and electric aerial remained standard br A change was made to the passenger side of the dash from the model onwards The Ambassador flat dash pad was replaced with a more protruding dash pad that ran flush with the instrument cluster binnacle and without the area for a speaker Speakers were now mounted on both front door panels Otherwise the dash was the same as previous models but new for was the introduction of the white backed instrument cluster of the U S and Matador displaying speed in miles per hour br For Australian registrations were Matadors sedans station wagons Most were the U S models br br br br For AMI continued to assemble the U S model marketing it as a model br Changes for the year included the introduction of white instrument dials in use on the U S models since now displaying kilometers per hour km h The horn pad and steering wheel of the U S Matador without the bullseye logo were replaced with the slightly smaller steering wheel and interchangeable horn pad of the AMC Hornet with the AMC logo in the center Also for three point retractable seat belts for the front and rear were fitted replacing the two point sash belts The locally made split bench front seat and rear seat from the model was carried over as did the locally made door panels from the U S model br Right hand sweep windshield wipers were now incorporated to match the driver s position br A total of Matadors sedans

were Matadors sedans station wagons including the first few second generation models assembled at the end of br br br br br AMI assembled the U S second generation Matador sedan and wagon through marketing it as the new model The first few were built in December The new Matador was priced at for the sedan and for the station wagon br Externally it was identical to the U S model even using the U S stainless steel full size wheel covers that AMC had been using since but now for the first time in Australia br As with the previous models the Rambler Ambassador dash assembly was reused but was now fitted with the U S type three pod instrument cluster The Ambassador Weather Eye unit previously positioned to the left of the instrument dials in previous models was repositioned to the right The Australian made seats in use since the model and the locally made door cards in use since the model were continued with no changes The revised steering wheel with the rectangular horn pad of the U S version was used on Australian models until the end of production For compliance with the ADR rules allowing only ambler turn signals the tail light assemblies were swapped around so that the original right side assembly was fitted to the left side and vice versa Thus the reverse lights were to the outside instead of the inside as on the U S models A rectangular plastic amber insert was attached over the clear reverse lenses and the lights were rewired as both reverse lights and turn signals br All Australian second generation Matadors continued to be powered with the AMC cu in L V engine with automatic transmission as with the first generation Australian built Matadors From about June AMI fitted the Matador sedans with a Heavy Duty Fleet Engine with a four barrel carburetor and electronic ignition There were no other engine or transmission options br The hood latch on the second generation Australian Matadors remained on the passenger left side of the dashboard In contrast previous Australian Matadors had the bonnet latch on the driver s right side as would be the case on a right hand drive vehicle Under dash air conditioning power windows electric aerial and the s steering componentry remained standard br Australian license plates are wider than U S plates so a sheet of folded steel was screwed to the license plate area of the body as an extension for the Australian plate to be affixed A generic trailer light unit was affixed to the extension for the number plate light br Documented registrations in were Matadors sedans and ten station wagons br br br br A few Matadors assembled in December were registered in br Documented registrations for were Matadors sedans and three station wagons br br br Production Number Discrepancies br The official registration figures of Australian second generation Matador sedans and wagons are at odds with the actual number of Matadors produced as there are known models with body numbers in the s and s despite registrations supposedly totaling sedans and wagons Additionally the document put out by AMI in November about the fitting of heavy duty fleet engines to Matadors states the engines have been fitted in numerical sequence from Body number to Body number and are matched to engine numbers A PF to A PF Those with the fleet engines to which this document pertains were built in June Matadors continued to be built thereafter until December br AMI built Matador sedans and Matador wagons in Australia between December and December The reason for the misreporting has been attributed to new Matadors having been registered as Other instead of Rambler at the time of first registration br br br Matador Coupe br br A fully built AMC Matador X Coupe was imported and presented at the Melbourne International Motor Show in to gauge interest The evaluation car was converted from left hand drive to right hand drive by an outside company for the show AMI dealers announced that there would be assembled for the Australian market One media outlet reporting on the show stated As an indication that U S cars are now very passe most showgoers drifted by with hardly a glance for the car preferring to paw over the bread and butter Toyota range Other media reports were more optimistic stating that they expected the model to sell out quickly br Although AMI received knock down kits for the all new Matador Coupe in they did not assemble them until late By the mid s AMI focused more on producing Toyotas and wanted to build something other than the Matador coupes The knock down kits were purposefully exposed to the elements outside for many months to achieve an insurance write off However the loss assessors adjudicated that cars were still salvageable Of the kits AMI received were destroyed were assembled and ten were held as parts br Priced at the model was marketed through and sold for only one year Australian models came with AMC s cu in L V with a three speed automatic transmission the U S Matador X sports steering wheel and bucket seats Air conditioning electric antenna and AM FM radio were standard br Because of the low production numbers under AMI avoided re engineering the left hand drive wiper to a right hand sweep as they had done on the Matador sedans and wagons after All Australian Matador coupes were badged as the sportier Matador X br Right hand drive Matador sedans wagons and the Matador Coupe were assembled using AMC s RHD dashboard which was introduced in However the instrument dials center column and steering wheel on the Australian Matador Coupe were from the U S model To satisfy Australian design regulations the inner taillamps were replaced with a round orange lens to flash amber as a turn signal while the outer lights remained the original red lens as a combination tail light and brake light br br br Costa Rica br Purdy Motor in San Jose assembled Matadors in Costa Rica from knock down kits br Purdy Motor acquired the franchise rights to market American Motors vehicles in It had imported complete cars to Costa Rica It was not until that Costa Rican laws permitted the local assembly of vehicles Purdy Motor built an assembly plant in and the first locally manufactured Rambler was a Rambler Classic which came off the line in late The all new Rebel was assembled to production end followed by the Matador from br As with other export markets the Matador was marketed in Costa Rica under the Rambler marque even after the marque was retired by AMC in its home market after br In a new local vehicle manufacturer Motorizada de Costa Rica purchased the rights to the Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motor Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands until Motorizada was liquidated in allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the marketing of the AMC brand in Costa Rica br br br Mexico br Matadors were built by Veh culos Automotores Mexicanos VAM in Mexico br br br First generation br br br br Continuing the concept of VAM s version of the AMC Rebel the Mexican Matadors were only available as a single trim level and in four door sedan and two door hardtop forms in their initial year The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name At the same time the four door sedan changed from Rambler Classic to Rambler Classic DPL Both body styles saw the same features as the U S AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only a few exclusive characteristics for each br Standard equipment consisted of four wheel manual drum brakes manual steering bhp kW PS

the older Borg Warner automatics heavy duty suspension with front sway bar improved heater with revised controls placed to the right of the steering column and a new two round pod instrument cluster New wheel cover and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior while seat patterns and side panels were updated br Since its redesign in the hardtop body style started to drop in sales and the front end facelift of did not help reverse the trend VAM did not want to drop it leaving the company without a mid sized two door offering br The model was reworked into an all new limited edition with a sportier focus for and featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car This became the VAM Classic Brougham with the name Rambler removed to rejuvenate the line while the four door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering three speed automatic transmission with a floor mounted shifter the same unit as the U S Rebel Machine models a center console with locking compartment also shared with the Rebel Machine individual high back bucket seats shared with the VAM Javelin bright trim for pedals heater AM FM stereo radio with four speakers tinted windshield and a remote controlled driver s side remote mirror br Despite the marketing and high level of equipment the public saw it as the previous model The only external differences with the model earlier were the colors the grille the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year ending below VAM s expectations br The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Go Package equipped Matador sold in the U S and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador Rebel model produced in Mexico br br br br Because of the low sales of the Classic Brougham hardtop the Classic DPL four door sedan became the only Matador version produced by VAM for with Javelin being the largest two door model offered by the company The Classic DPLs were virtually the same as their previous year s counterparts with differences only in the seat and side panel designs as well as the grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers br br br Second generation br br br br The generational change AMC Matadors received for in the United States was also introduced in Mexico This meant a new front end design with the coffin nose elongated central portion and single headlights new horizontal tail light designs and rear license plate mount located on the back panel instead of the bumper as well as a new dashboard with squared dials and full length padded surface Further changes included bumper designs with the five mile per hour impact absorption system This meant the only case alongside the Pacer of a VAM car incorporating this safety measure which the Mexican government did not mandate making VAM Classics exceed the safety regulations of its time Sedan units ordered with the automatic transmission regularly included the power steering system and a heater at no extra cost The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the cu in L six which changed to a lower compression ratio br br br Matador Coupe br The year s biggest news was the arrival of a new two door model AMC s Matador coupe Unlike all previous Matador and Rebel models it was available in two different trim levels the sporty Classic AMX equivalent to the AMC Matador X model and the luxury Classic Brougham equivalent to the AMC Matador Brougham coupe model Both versions were mechanically the same carrying the same technical specifications as the Classic DPL models Their main differences relied on appearance and standard features The Classic AMX sported VAM s in house five spoke wheels with volcano center caps and trim rings a blacked out grille and a rally stripe surrounding the entire length of the car with an integrated AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid the Classic Brougham had a standard vinyl roof cover with its respective moldings wheel covers new design for the year standard grille and Brougham emblems over the C pillar bases The Classic AMX showcased a three spoke sports steering wheel high back fold down individual bucket seats a center console with a locking compartment a floor mounted gearshift and an AM FM radio Despite the sportiness of the model it intended to take the place of the Javelin as VAM s top of the line performance model as well as the image and enthusiast builder The side armrests were the standard designs used in the Matador base models of the U S On the other hand the Classic Brougham sported a custom sports steering wheel and column mounted shifter with a fold down split back bench seat and AM radio Unlike the Classic DPL the Classic AMX and the Classic Brougham included automatic transmission power steering and heater as standard equipment A unique characteristic of the VAM Classic AMX was the shifter because it was the Javelin s aircraft U shaped design br br br br For changes in all three versions were few br The Classic DPL obtained the new one piece grille design with rectangular parking lights following the US made versions as well as featuring new seats and door panels The luxury steering wheel gained a new design for the Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham br Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC s full length X model side armrests the panels of the sports version also carried an etched AMX emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door The Classic AMX also featured AMC s X model floor mounted shifter design br All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition a vacuum gauge in place of the electric clock a cu in L I with a lower compression ratio and Holley two barrel carburetor The rear differential gear ratio was changed to for both transmissions A significant update was present at the front of the engine The steering pump and alternator positions were reversed the former now being placed at the intake s side and the latter at the distributor s This also meant a new water pump model for the six br br br br Additional changes were incorporated for the model year The Classic DPL and Brougham featured a new design for wheel covers Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided into two portions with squared parking lights The Classic AMX had a new and more discreet side decal covering only the front fenders It started near the A pillar running to the top of the side marker light in two tones with a painted AMX emblem The loss of the rear portion of the side decal meant a new metal AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid Unlike previous years the Classic AMX had a more blurred line between a sporty and luxury models The side panel designs and seats looked luxurious instead of sporty Several units had wheel covers as standard instead of the trim rings and regular hubcaps and some units also had the clock instead of the vacuum gauge What made them sporty mainly was reduced to the side armrests steering wheel individual seat configuration floor mounted shifter and a center console All three versions shared a new km h speedometer tinted windshield and seat designs based on AMC s Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes These were color keyed with the rest of the interior and shared by all three versions instead of just the Brougham coupe as under AMC The most unusual ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and reclining mechanisms for the first time in VAM cars since The Classic DPL sported a fixed front bench seat while the Classic Brougham held a split folding back bench This model as well as the VAM Pacer is the only case of a VAM car that came close to the various U S AMC designer cars This interior design was not an optional package but a standard factory feature The AMC Oleg Cassini models copper accents except for the buttons and the exterior trim were not used in the VAM Classics and Pacers The Mexican Cassini package mainly was focused on seat and side panel designs interior only br The Classic line was discontinued in the middle of the model year VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to the Mexican market representing its fourth product line while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque Having the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model Ambassador in the US External factors were also behind this decision since the large car market was going through a general downturn in Mexico Starting in VAM s most luxurious model was the Pacer and its largest sized models were the Americans AMC Hornets br br br International exports br br br Canada br Although AMC s Brampton Assembly Plant in Ontario Canada had been building Rambler and AMC vehicles since including the Ambassador until and Rebel the plant did not make the almost identical Matador which replaced the Rebel despite also building AMC s Hornet Gremlin and later Concord and Jeep through the s Canadian market Matadors were instead made at Kenosha and exported to Canada from the United States Despite this some parts used in the U S and foreign built Matadors notably tail light and park light lenses were made in Canada br br br Finland br Rambler and AMC vehicles were imported from Kenosha into Finland by two major Finnish companies from the s until the late s after which Wihuri Group a sizeable multi sector family business took over import operations using its shipping operation Autola Oy which Wihuri had brought in First and second generation Matadors were imported along with Hornet and Javelin As with all AMC export markets the models were marketed as Rambler in Finland Imports of the Matador continued until br br br France br Jean Charles Automobiles imported several AMC vehicles including a small number of Matadors including station wagons They are identified by a stamped plate affixed to the body br br br Norway br Matadors were imported into Norway during the s by Norwegian importer Kolberg Caspary AS located at s Norway Kolberg Caspary was formed in and imported automotive industrial and construction products br Matadors Javelins and Hornets were sold by Gavas Motors AS in Oslo and Hasco Motors AS in Drammen br br br United Kingdom br Hudson motor vehicles had been assembled in the United Kingdom since at the Hudson plant in Chiswick West London After the merger of Nash and Hudson to form American Motors the facility became an importer of AMC vehicles It continued as a service center for Hudson and AMC vehicles The U K operation was renamed Rambler Motors A M C Limited As with all AMC s export markets the Rambler name was thereafter used on all AMC vehicles sold in the U K br A few Matador sedans and wagons were sold in the U K alongside the Ambassador in hardtop and station wagon versions as well as the Javelin pony car Except for the Javelin both the Matador and Ambassador models were exported from Kenosha with factory right hand drive as had been with the prior Rebel and Ambassador models imported into the U K None were locally assembled br Unlike the Knock down kits used for Australian assembly which continued to use the RHD version of the Ambassador dash cluster and Weather Eye albeit to the right of the cluster for the second generation models U K second generation Matadors were factory built with the temperature controls of the U S versions positioned underneath and to the left of the instrument dials U K models also received a locally built and fitted walnut burr fascia that replaced the AMC black plastic cluster surround as had been the practice for previous U K market Rebels and Ambassadors br The final models for the U K market were regular LHD versions br br br Discontinuation br During the late s the domestic automobile market moved to smaller cars The large sized Matador was no longer attractive to customers demanding more economical cars as fuel and money became increasingly worrisome problems after the oil crisis and the continuing double digit domestic inflation br Lacking the financial resources for a complete redesign AMC dropped the large Ambassador after while the Matador was discontinued after around the same time as Ford moved their full size nameplates to a smaller platform The downsized Chevrolet Impala also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler American Motors responded to the declining demand for large cars by introducing a new nameplate in the AMC Concord The Concord was an upmarket restyling and positioning of the compact AMC Hornet that had the same inch mm wheelbase as the redesigned intermediate Chevrolet Malibu It was presented as combining an easy to handle size with a roomy sumptuous interior and in contrast to the Matador coupe the overall styling was pleasant would not offend anyone This was the first full line of economical compact sized cars with luxurious trim features and comfort levels previously available only in larger automobiles br American Motors did not have another large car until the Eagle Premier that was developed with Renault s partnership and introduced to
