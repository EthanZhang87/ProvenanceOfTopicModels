title: Tow hitch
id: 2900236
A tow hitch or tow bar or trailer hitch in North America is a device attached to the chassis of a vehicle for towing or a towbar to an aircraft nose gear It can take the form of a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer or a tow pin or a tow hook with a trailer loop often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide br To tow safely the correct combination of vehicle and trailer must be combined with correct loading horizontally and vertically on the tow ball Advice should be heeded see references to avoid problems br br br Regional variations br br br North America br Trailer hitches for conventional passenger cars light duty commercial vehicles light trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles come in two main OEM or aftermarket types receiver and bumper fixed drawbar br Receiver type hitches consist of a portion with a rearward facing opening that accepts removable aftermarket hitch mounted accessories trailer hitch ball mounts hitch bike racks cargo carriers etc br Bumper fixed drawbar type hitches typically are built as one piece have an integrated hole sometimes more than one hole on pickup trucks for the trailer ball mount and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch mounted accessories br Outside North America the vehicle mounting for the tow ball is called the tow bracket The mounting points for all recent passenger vehicles are defined by the vehicle manufacturer and the tow bracket manufacturer must use these mount points and prove the efficacy of their bracket for each vehicle by a full rig based fatigue test br br br Ball mounts br The trailer hitch ball attaches to a ball mount with a diameter typically inch mm larger than the ball bolt shank diameter The ball mount must match the SAE hitch class The ballmount for a receiver type hitch is a square bar that fits into a receiver attached to the vehicle Removable ball mounts are offered with a varying rise or drop to accommodate variations in the height of the vehicle and trailer to provide for level towing br br br Load classes br A trailer hitch typically bolts to the chassis of the vehicle In North America there are a few common trailer hitch classes I II III and IV that are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE br br Class I up to pounds kg light loads br Class II up to pounds kg light loads br Class III up to pounds kg larger loads campers boats etc br Class IV up to pounds kg larger loads campers boats etc br Some manufacturers market Class V hitches but there was no such standard listed in the version of SAE J br br Class V up to pounds kg larger loads construction equipment etc br br br Receiver tube sizes br A receiver hitch can accommodate a variety of different tow hitches when the tow hook ball may be attached via a receiver tube attached to the tow vehicle Trailer hitch receiver tubes may be bolted welded or integral to the vehicle chassis and come in various sizes depending on the load they are designed to carry and the country of operation The US standards are br br Class I and II in mm light or medium duty receiver tube br Class III and IV in mm heavy duty receiver tube br Class V or in or mm receiver tube br br br Ball sizes br br Trailer hitch balls come in various sizes depending on the load they carry and the country of operation with removable types consisting of a bolt shank to attach to the ball mount The trailer tongue North America or coupling outside North America slips over a trailer hitch ball attached to a receiver hitch mount or integral with the hitch br A larger heavy duty gooseneck ball size in mm is typically used for towing greater than pounds t and this towing capacity falls outside of the scope of SAE J trailer hitch classes br br br Truck variants br br Weight ratings for both bumper mounted and frame mounted receiver hitches can be found on the bumper of pickup trucks for bumper mounted tow balls and on the receiver hitch for frame mounted receiver hitches br For flat deck and pickup trucks towing to pound to t trailers there are fifth wheel and gooseneck hitches These are used for agriculture industry and large recreational trailers br Front trailer hitches are also used on pickup trucks full size SUVs and RVs for multiple purposes A front mounted hitch can accommodate additional truck equipment such as front mount bike carriers fishing hunting gear winches step plates and snowplows It also allows a driver to maneuver a trailer with better visibility into a parking site Front trailer hitches are mounted directly to the frame of a vehicle to ensure a reliable connection Front hitches are typically equipped with standard sized receiver tubes to accommodate a variety of removable aftermarket hitch mounted accessories br br br Europe br br In the European Union tow hitches must be a type approved by European Union directive EC requirements and fitted to vehicles first registered on or after August Outside of North America the ISO standard tow ball that has been adopted in most of the world is mm in in diameter and conforms to a standard BS AU b replaced by BS ISO With a minor modification it was published by UNECE on June as class A br There are two main categories of ISO tow ball the flange fitting and the swan neck which has an extended neck fitting into the tow bracket Swan neck tow balls are often removable to avoid the inconvenience of a tow ball protruding from the vehicle when not required Some manufacturers are introducing retractable tow balls as an option br Across Europe around of vehicles have tow balls fitted but there are distinct regional variations being more common in Benelux and Scandinavia In Sweden around million cars of around million just over have tow balls In the United Kingdom the popularity of caravans is responsible for a large proportion of four wheel drive SUV vehicles being fitted with tow hitches br br br Electrical connector br br The vehicle must also be electrically connected to the trailer Trailer connector variants are standardised at the regional or national and local levels Some variants are defined by the ISO standards for trailer connectors br br br Trailer tow hitch br A car can be equipped with a trailer tow hitch with a removable tow ball br br br Weight distributing hitch br A weight distributing hitch is a load leveling hitch It is a hitch setup mounted on the tow vehicle that uses spring bars and chains under tension to distribute part of the trailer s hitch weight from the towing vehicle s rear axle to the towing vehicle s front axle and to the trailer s axle s It can help reduce trailer sway and hop Trailer hop can jerk the tow vehicle Trailer sway is also called fishtailing At high speeds trailer sway can become dangerous Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of pounds kg and pounds kg of tongue weight without using a weight distributing hitch Tow vehicles often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches br br br Pintle hook and lunette ring br br A lunette ring is a type of trailer hitch that works in combination with a pintle hook on the tow vehicle A pintle hook and lunette ring make a more secure coupling desirable on rough terrain compared to ball type trailer hitches It is commonly seen in towing applications in agriculture industry and the military br The clearance between the lunette and pintle allows for more relative motion between the trailer and tow vehicle than a ball coupling does A disadvantage of that is the slam transmitted into the towing vehicle with each push pull load reversal This becomes a tradeoff between a more secure coupling and a more comfortable towing experience br br br Gooseneck hitch br The gooseneck hitch mounts in the middle of the truck bed This hitch is designed to be paired with a gooseneck trailer which can manage heavier loads than a hitch at the back of the tow vehicle br An advantage of the gooseneck hitch is its tighter turning radius which helps when towing a big flatbed or car hauler Gooseneck hitches also enable use of the entire truck bed when not towing br br br History br Before all trailers used only jaw or hook couplings with an eyelet for trailer towing In Franz Kn bel of Westfalia Werke developed the trailer hitch with a ball head and socket joint Franz Kn bel patented the ball head socket joint trailer hitch invention on March Westfalia holds a number of towing patents br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br Directive EC of the European Parliament br Trailer hitches
