id: 1029526
In automotive engineering a grille covers an opening in the body of a vehicle to allow air to enter or exit Most vehicles feature a grille at the front of the vehicle to protect the radiator and engine Merriam Webster describes grilles as a grating forming a barrier or screen especially an ornamental one at the front end of an automobile The word grille is commonly misspelled as grill which instead refers to the cooking method Other common grille locations include below the front bumper in front of the wheels to cool the brakes in the cowl for cabin ventilation or on the rear deck lid in rear engine vehicles Grilles evolved from previously installed gravel shields that were designed to protect exposed radiators typically used on cars until the early s br br br Design br The front fascia of a motor vehicle has an important role in attracting buyers The principal function of the grille is to admit cooling air to the car s radiator However the look of the vehicle matters a great deal more than whether the design features actually serve any function As one of the main visual components on the front of vehicles an inspired grille design makes a car attractive and shapes its identity by tying it to the carmaker s history and reputation br Currently big grilles are primarily cosmetic The grille is often a distinctive styling element and many marques use it as their primary brand identifier For example Jeep has trademarked its seven bar grille style br Rolls Royce is known for arranging its grille bars by hand to ensure that they appear perfectly vertical Other makers known for their grille styling include Bugatti s horse collar BMW s split kidney Rover s chrome teeth Mitsubishi s forward swept fighter aircraft style grilles for their cars Lancer and Lancer Evo X Dodge s cross bar Alfa Romeo s six bar shield Volvo s slash bar Nissan s trapezoid shaped chrome surround Mazda s rotary engine shape Audi s relatively new so called single frame grille Pontiac s split horizontal grille and an egg crate grille on late generation Plymouths and Lexus s spindle shaped grille The unusual Plymouth Barracuda grille is known as a cheesegrater Ford s three bar grille introduced on the Fusion has become distinctive as well Porsche a long time manufacturer of air cooled cars continues to minimize the prominence of a grille on the marque s modern water cooled vehicles in keeping with that heritage br The contrary styling pattern also occurs Starting from the late s Cadillac would alternate its pattern from horizontal bars to various patterns of crosshatching as a simple way of making the car look new from year to year for this make did not have a standard grille form Sometimes there is a sort of fashion trend in grille bars For example in the early years after World War II many American car makers generally switched to fewer and thicker grille bars br A billet grille is an aftermarket part that is used to enhance the style or function of the original OEM grille They are generally made from billet solid bar stock aircraft grade aluminum although some are CNC machined from one solid sheet of aluminum br Active Air Flap System was developed by Hyundai Mobis on June Based on the existing radiator grille the grille itself has evolved to move according to the cooling water temperature When the engine coolant temperature is high the air flap is opened to increase cooling efficiency through air suction On the contrary when the temperature drops the air flap is automatically closed to reduce air resistance to increase fuel efficiency and electricity consumption br Customizers would alter the grille as a matter of course in personalizing their car taking the grille bar from another make for example Even sheet metal with patterned holes for ventilation grating sold to homeowners for repair has been found filling the grille opening of custom cars br br br Electric Vehicles br The emergence of electric vehicles EV in the automotive market has prompted a fundamental reevaluation of grille design as electric motors need little to no front vent cooling compared to a traditional combustion engine Still customer expectations of grilles dominating the front of cars have proven strong enough that companies like Nissan have reincorporated cosmetic grilles into their EV designs in response to mixed consumer reception of early grilleless models Designs that fully do away with any visual reference to traditional front grilles have tended to come from new auto makers that exclusively produce EVs such as Tesla Inc or Rivian as these companies do not have an established historical brand language of grilles br br br Grille types br Per mounting location on the car body br br Radiator grille front engine vehicle br Roof or trunk grilles rear engine vehicles br Bumper skirt grilles front and rear br Fender grilles brake ventilation duct covers br Hood scoop grille to allow intercooler air flow br br br Per style br The American aftermarket restyling industry defines two major grille styles br br OEM factory style grilles Such grilles have no difference with those manufactured by the automobile producers br Custom style produced in small quantities and have an assortment of materials br br br Per fastening method br Bolt over style br In this installation method the billet grille simply bolts over the existing OEM plastic grille This method does not require drilling or cutting of the OEM grille shell Hidden bolts brackets and clamps are used for this simple installation The downside is it may not look as clean as the replacement style because you can still see the OEM grille underneath Bolt overs should take no more than minutes to install br br Replacement style br The OEM grille must first be removed and then the replacement billet grille must be mounted in place of the OEM grille Drilling and sometimes cutting is required for this method Installation instructions are provided by the grille manufacturer but are still a challenging job br br br History br br Grilles on automobiles have taken on different designs through the years This feature first appeared on automobiles in Several years later the arch shaped design became common and became the standard design on automobile grilles for many years The split grille design first appeared in on the Alfa Romeo sports car br In the s and s automobile manufacturers became creative with their grille designs Some of these designs were bell shaped Buick Chevrolet and Pontiac split and slightly folded Silver Arrow Mercury Oldsmobile cross shaped pre war Studebaker Champion models Cadillac Ford while some including Packard Rolls Royce and MG TC models still followed the older arch shaped design br Grilles took on a new look after World War II Following the introduction of the Buick Studebaker and Kaiser grilles became shorter and wider to accommodate for the change in design br br br See also br Bottom
