The Ford Thunderbird colloquially called the T Bird is a personal luxury car manufactured and marketed by Ford Motor Company from model years to with a hiatus across generations Introduced as a two seat convertible the Thunderbird was offered variously as a four seat hardtop coupe four seat convertible five seat convertible and hardtop four door pillared hardtop sedan six passenger hardtop coupe and five passenger pillared coupe with the final generation designed again as a two seat convertible br Ford targeted the two seat Thunderbird as an upscale model but the model year design introduced a rear seat and arguably marked the expansion of a market segment eventually known as personal luxury cars positioned to emphasize comfort and convenience over handling and high speed performance br br br Overview br The Thunderbird entered production for the model year as a sporty two seat convertible Unlike the Chevrolet Corvette it was not marketed as a sports car Ford positioned the Thunderbird as an upscale model and it is credited in developing a new market segment the personal luxury car For the Thunderbird was redesigned with a second row of seats Succeeding generations became larger until the line was downsized in again in and once again in Sales were good until the s when large two door coupes became unpopular Thunderbird production ended in then briefly resumed as a two passenger marketed from to br From its introduction in to its final phaseout in Ford produced over million Thunderbirds br br br Development br A smaller two seater sports roadster named the Vega was developed in at the behest of Henry Ford II The completed one off generated interest at the time but had meager power European looks and a correspondingly high cost so it never proceeded to production The Thunderbird was similar in concept but was more American in style more luxurious and less sport oriented br Credit for the development of the original Thunderbird is given to Lewis Crusoe a former GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II George Walker chief stylist and a Ford vice president Frank Hershey chief stylist for the Ford Division Bill Boyer designer for the Body Development Studio who became the manager of the Thunderbird Studio in the spring of and Bill Burnett chief engineer Ford Designer William P Boyer was the lead stylist on the original two seater Thunderbird and also had input in the following series of Thunderbirds that included the th Anniversary Edition Hershey s participation in the creation of the Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic Crusoe and Walker met in France in October Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker Why can t we have something like that Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe Oh we re working on it although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream car sketches by members of the design staff records of it have never come to light br Walker promptly telephoned Ford s HQ in Dearborn and told designer Frank Hershey about the conversation with Crusoe Hershey took the idea and began working on the vehicle The concept was for a two passenger open car with a target weight of lb kg a cu in L Ford Y block Interceptor V based on the forthcoming overhead valve Ford engine slated for model year introduction and a top speed over mph km h Crusoe saw a painted clay model on May which corresponded closely to the final car he gave the car the go ahead in September after comparing it with current European trends After Henry Ford II returned from the Los Angeles Auto Show Autorama in he approved the final design concept to compete with the then new Corvette br The name was not among the thousands proposed including rejected options such as Apache the original name of the P Mustang Falcon owned by Chrysler at the time Eagle Tropicale Hawaiian and Thunderbolt A Ford stylist who had lived in the southwest submitted the Thunderbird name a reference to the mythological thunderbird a supernatural bird of great power and strength of the North American indigenous people br At the time Ernest Breech then chairman of Ford Motor Company was a member of the Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage California According to club lore he asked its permission to use the name which was granted br br br Generations br br br First generation br br The Ford Thunderbird was introduced in February as a response to Chevrolet s new sports car the Corvette which was publicly unveiled in prototype form just a month before Under rapid development the Thunderbird went from idea to prototype in about a year being unveiled to the public at the Detroit Auto Show on February It was a two seat design available with a detachable fiberglass hardtop and a folding fabric top br Production of the Thunderbird began on September of that year with the car beginning sales as a model on October Though sharing some design characteristics with other Fords of the time such as single circular headlamps and tail lamps and modest tail fins the Thunderbird was sleeker in shape and featured a hood scoop and a mph km h speedometer not available on other Fords It used mechanical components from mass market Ford models The Thunderbird s in mm wheelbase frame was a shortened version used in other Fords and the standard cu in L Y block V came from Ford s Mercury division br Though inspired by and positioned directly against the Corvette Ford advertised the Thunderbird at launch as a personal car of distinction and put a greater emphasis on the car s comfort and convenience features rather than its inherent sportiness br The Thunderbird sold exceptionally well in its first year outselling the Corvette by more than to one in with Thunderbirds sold against Corvettes br With the Thunderbird considered a success few changes were made to the car for the model year The most notable change was moving the spare tire to a Continental style rear bumper to make more storage room in the trunk and a new volt electrical system The addition of the weight at the rear caused steering issues Among the few other changes were new paint colors the addition of standard circular porthole windows in the fiberglass roof to improve rearward visibility with a delete option and a cu in L Y block V rated at hp kW when mated to a three speed manual transmission or hp kW when mated to a Ford O Matic three speed automatic transmission this transmission featured a low gear which was accessible manually via the gear selector When in Drive it was a two speed automatic transmission similar to Chevrolet s Powerglide Low gear could also be accessed with a wide open throttle In Ford also added its new Lifeguard safety package br The Thunderbird was revised for with a reshaped front bumper a larger grille and tailfins and larger tail lamps The instrument panel was heavily restyled with round gauges in a single pod and the rear of the car was lengthened allowing the spare tire to be positioned back in the trunk The cu in L V became the Thunderbird s standard engine and was now rated at hp kW Other more powerful versions of this V were available including one with two four barrel Holley carburetors VIN code E and another with a Paxton supercharger rated at hp kW VIN code F Though Ford was pleased to see sales of the Thunderbird rise to a record breaking units for company executives felt the car could do even better leading to a substantial redesign of the car for br br br Second generation br br Although the Thunderbird was a success Ford executives particularly Robert McNamara were concerned that the car s position as a two seater limited its sales potential As a result the car was redesigned as a four seater for br Despite being released mid model year the new Thunderbird began a sales momentum previously unseen with the car selling units in three years four times that of the two year two seat model run This success spawned a new market segment the personal luxury car It was the first individual model line as opposed to an entire brand s line to earn Motor Trend Car of the Year honors br It was offered in both hardtop and convertible body styles although the latter was not introduced until June five months after the release of the hardtop The new Thunderbird was considerably larger than the previous generation with a longer in mm wheelbase to accommodate the new back seat The increased size also increased the car s weight by lb kg Along with a new more rigid unibody construction was new styling including quad headlights more prominent tailfins a bolder chrome grille and a larger though nonfunctional hood scoop The engine was the new hp kW cu in L FE V available with a three speed manual or automatic transmissions The mid model year sales were units an increase of over the previous year br For the Thunderbird featured a new grille and a newly optional hp kW cu in L MEL V engine Sales increased to units br For the model year the grille was again redesigned along with minor styling changes A new option was a manually operated sunroof for hardtop models The dual unit round taillights featured on the and were changed to triple units Sales increased again with sold in br br br Third generation br br The Thunderbird was redesigned for with styling that gave the car a unique bullet like body side appearance A new engine the cu in L FE V was the standard and only engine initially offered in the Thunderbird It was rated at hp kW and was mated to a three speed automatic transmission The new Thunderbird was well received with sold for br The car was s Indianapolis pace car and was featured prominently in US President John F Kennedy s inaugural parade who appointed Ford executive Robert McNamara as secretary of defense It also benefitted from product placement notably on the popular television series Sunset Strip br A vinyl roofed Landau option with simulated S bars was added to the Thunderbird for as was a Sports Roadster package for convertible models The Sports Roadster included spoke Kelsey Hayes designed wire wheels and a special fiberglass tonneau cover for the rear seats which gave the car the appearance of a two seat roadster like the original Thunderbird The Sports Roadster package was slow selling due to the high price of the package and the complexity of the tonneau cover br Newly optional for was an upgraded version of the cu in L V called the M Code a nickname used in reference to the letter M used as the engine code in the VIN in cars so equipped The M Code version of the cu in L V was equipped with three two barrel Holley carburetors and was rated at hp kW A total of M Code V Thunderbirds were sold between and For only Y code cars could come equipped with the same cubic inch V also equipped by the factory with tri power carburetors only if the buyer desired air conditioning br Few other changes were made to the Thunderbird for as Ford prepared to introduce a new version for A horizontal styling line was added that ran from the point where the bumper and fender met back through the door and angled down Small diagonal chrome bars were added in this area on the door Alternators rather than generators were a new feature on all Thunderbirds br br br Fourth generation br br For the Thunderbird was restyled in favor of a more squared off appearance which was mostly evident when viewing the car from the side or rear Hinting at its roots in the previous generation of Thunderbird the new model retained a similar grille design with quad headlights and a in mm wheelbase As before the new Thunderbird continued to be offered in hardtop convertible and landau versions The hp kW cu in L FE V continued as the standard engine for the Thunderbird It was paired with a three speed automatic transmission For sequential turn signals were added flashing the individual segments of the broad horizontal tail lights in sequences from inside to outside to indicate a turn Also new for were standard front disc brakes and doubled sided keys br Though it was the last year of the generation had a stylistic revision for the Thunderbird highlighted by a new egg crate style grille with a large Thunderbird emblem at its center and a single blade front bumper The rear bumper was restyled to include new full width taillamps Engine choices were also revised for The standard cu in L V equipped with a single four barrel carburetor was rated at hp kW Newly optional and taking the top position for performance was a hp kW cu in L FE V The optional cost only over the base engine This was the last year for the convertible until the retro models of br br br Fifth generation br br br br The Thunderbird s fifth generation brought the second major change in the car s design direction since its debut in From through the Thunderbird had remained fundamentally the same in concept as a two door coupe convertible with two rows of seating The introduction by Lincoln Mercury of the Mercury Cougar the most luxurious of the flood of pony cars to follow the wildly successful mid introduction of the Ford Mustang created a challenge to the Thunderbird s market positioning The Cougar was also a two door coupe or convertible with two rows of seating at a materially lower price To prevent overlap the Thunderbird was upsized with a four door option added br The new Thunderbird was no longer unibody but a body on frame construction with rubber mountings between the body and frame to reduce noise and vibration The convertible model was discontinued in favor of a four door hardtop coupe body style It featured suicide doors for rear seat access and a very wide C pillar that extended into the rear door window area It was covered to match the standard vinyl top with simulated landau bars on the fixed pillar helping camouflage the cut line A design feature of the fifth generation Thunderbird was the full width fighter jet inspired grille opening that incorporated hidden headlights br br br The model year Thunderbird continued with the same platform and many of the same parts and styling cues from the through models such as the sequential turn signals incorporated into the full width tail lamps The most noticeable change was in the front grille where a prominent projection somewhat resembling a bird s beak was added on the centerline in line with long angular lines in the hood The T bird was offered in coupe or sports back models for these two years the latter being a further distinction from the through models br In Neiman Marcus offered his and hers Thunderbirds in its catalog with telephones tape recorders and other features Sold only as a pair they retailed for a total of US equivalent to in The Thunderbird was mostly a carry over from the model as Ford prepared to release a new larger Thunderbird for It was also the last year to offer a four door br br br Sixth generation br br The sixth generation of the Thunderbird debuted in the fall of as a model With a inch mm wheelbase an overall length of inches mm growing to inches mm by and a curb weight of pounds kg over pounds kg when equipped with an optional cu in L V it was the largest Thunderbird ever produced by Ford sharing the assembly line with the Lincoln Continental Mark IV br Matching the large size of the car were large engines including a standard cu in L V and the optional cu in L V which became standard after Though offering two of the largest displacement V engines ever installed in a production vehicle by Ford the car s considerable weight combined with low power output caused by restrictive emissions technology resulted in modest performance As might also be expected from installing a large displacement V in a heavy car fuel efficiency was poor br The big Thunderbirds were initially popular with sales peaking at over units in in spite of the oil crisis but sales had slumped to less than by Finishing off the generation sales had an uptick to almost units for Acknowledging increasing fuel prices and more stringent federal emissions standards a new downsized Thunderbird was to appear for br br br Seventh generation br br Reflecting the rising demand for more fuel efficient cars the model year Thunderbird was shifted to the smaller in mm wheelbase chassis shared with the Ford Torino and its replacement the LTD II which also debuted for Even being nearly inches shorter than the Thunderbird only inches vs from the second model year of the sixth generation it still looked large to the eye This generation was a continuation of the Ford Elite Ford s first attempt at competing in the market created by the Pontiac Grand Prix and Chevrolet Monte Carlo br Along with being shorter the car was lb kg lighter although height and width were relatively unchanged A substantial component of the weight reduction was in the drivetrain where a small block V replaced the heavier big block V s of previous years The standard engine outside California was the cu in L Windsor V while the larger cu in L M and cu in L and T tops were available as options along with the W In California the was the standard engine and the was optionally available For the first time a wide fixed B pillar was used reflecting Detroit s discontinuation of the pillarless hardtop body designs However the door window glass remained frameless br In Ford offered the Diamond Jubilee Edition Thunderbird to commemorate the company s th year as an auto manufacturer This option package escalated the price of the car to almost US virtually doubling the standard price Naturally it included every option available except for a moonroof and an engine block heater A similar option package called Heritage was available for Though this generation was the most successful in sales with over examples produced in its three year run ongoing fuel efficiency and emissions concerns caused Ford to downsize the Thunderbird further for For the model year the cu in engine was no longer available br br br Eighth generation br br Reflecting a further industry wide adoption of smaller vehicle designs in the interest of improved fuel efficiency and emissions compliance the Thunderbird was downsized again for Even more squarish it rode on the compact Ford Fox platform which had first appeared only two years prior as the basis for the Ford Fairmont Compared to the previous Torino based Thunderbird s large in mm wheelbase and in mm overall length the new Thunderbird lost inches mm of wheelbase and inches mm in overall length br Frameless door glass was discontinued in favor of a chrome trimmed metal frame The combination of a low output L cu in Windsor V base engine and a C three speed transmission with rear gears robbed the car of any performance The optional hp kW cu in L Windsor V coupled with the optional AOD automatic overdrive transmission and optional rear end ratio showed only moderate improvement The heritage of the Thunderbird as a performance personal luxury car was completely lost br Reinforcing this reality a six cylinder engine was made available for the first time in the Thunderbird s history in the aptly named cu in L Thriftpower Six br For the model year the straight six was replaced with a more modern V the L Essex as the Thunderbird s standard engine It came equipped with a Motorcraft V carburetor The L cu in V was optional br At units produced between and the eighth generation of the Thunderbird had a sales average under units a year tapering off drastically after the first year failing to perform as well as the previous generation which achieved sales records for three consecutive years br br br Ninth generation br br Seeking to reverse the sales slide of the models and revitalize the Thunderbird s appearance Ford executed a significant redesign for Though still based on the Fox body it featured a radically sleeker more aerodynamic body and a slightly shorter wheelbase of in mm Power however remained limited with the L Essex V and the cu in L V being carried over from the previous generation The gained CFI electronic fuel injection in and the V in for US models for Canadian models which was in turn replaced by multipoint fuel injection on the V in and the V in All new and a Thunderbird first was a turbocharged L OHC four cylinder engine featured in the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe The engine initially was rated at hp kW but by power was increased to hp kW Another first was the availability of a five speed manual transmission with the turbocharged four In the higher trim model was the Heritage this was renamed the Elan in Also a Fila branded model was introduced In a special th Anniversary edition was available with special Medium Regatta Blue Metallic paint special graphics and trim br For the Thunderbird received a significant refresh complete with new sheet metal and a revised front fascia with aerodynamic composite headlamps Mechanically the car was little changed The V models carried over port fuel injection from while the Turbo Coupe s turbocharged four cylinder engine gained an intercooler increasing output to hp kW and lb of torque br br br Tenth generation br br In late for the model year a completely redesigned Thunderbird was introduced along with the similar Mercury Cougar The new Thunderbird was developed on Ford s MN mid sized North American Project platform which had been in development since Featuring a inch mm longer wheelbase than the previous generation Thunderbird and a four wheel independent suspension the car offered better handling and ride quality br Only two engines were originally available naturally aspirated and supercharged versions of the L cu in Essex V The naturally aspirated standard engine produced hp kW while the Super Coupe model received a supercharged and intercooled version rated at hp kW br The th anniversary of the Thunderbird was released in for the model year The Super Coupe was available with a black and silver two tone paint Anniversary Edition with Anniversary floor mats a car cover a pen a poster and a few other anniversary collectible items br A cu in cm V marketed as the was added in for the model year Power ranged between the standard and supercharged versions of the L V br In the model year Thunderbird received a substantial refresh including stylistic changes inside and out and mechanical enhancements In particular the small block cu in L V was replaced with Ford s new Modular L OHC V The Super Coupe s supercharged V produced more power and torque br br br Eleventh generation br br After a five year hiatus the Thunderbird returned for the model year years after its debut For its eleventh generation the model line reverted to its original two passenger personal convertible configuration Along with its revived layout the Thunderbird combined many design elements of the first generation with the minimalist styling of the third generation convertibles A predominant feature of the removable hardtop was the circular window from the versions br The eleventh generation Thunderbird uses the Ford DEW platform also used by the Lincoln LS sedan and the Jaguar S Type the Ford Mustang is loosely based on it Though sharing no body panels with its sedan counterparts the Thunderbird shared some visible components with the LS instrument panel steering wheel and other trim pieces As with the LS V the Thunderbird was powered by a Jaguar DOHC L AJ V producing hp kW and lb ft N m of torque the engine was paired with a Ford designed R N speed automatic For the AJ became the AJ following the addition of variable valve timing and electronic throttle control output increased to hp kW and lb ft N m of torque The speed automatic received optional SelectShift manual shifting control br With sales dropping significantly after its first model year Ford discontinued the eleventh generation Thunderbird after the model year the final vehicle was manufactured on July As of current production Ford has not returned the model line to sale in any form br br br Convertible models br Alongside the original two seat Thunderbirds of the Thunderbird was offered as a soft top convertible from through The model shared its convertible top retraction mechanism with the Ford Skyliner retractable hardtop convertible and would also be shared the s Lincoln Continental convertible When the top was stowed the rear hinged trunklid was raised in order for the forward edge of the trunklid to serve as a metal boot cover Though the hydraulically powered design reduced available trunk space the metal top boot negated the need for a separate cover Unlike hardtop models that used a conventional key secured forward hinged design the convertibles combined the trunk opening and closing within the convertible top operating system br The Skyliner derived design could present challenges for troubleshooting a convertible top malfunction The system consists of solenoids relays limit switches electric motors and a hydraulic pump reservoir as well as several hydraulic directional valves and cylinders While the hydraulic system is not often a cause for trouble electrical relays are known to fail Malfunction of any of the numerous relays motors or limit switches prevents the convertible system from completing the cycle br For through the Ford offered convertible Thunderbirds with a rare Sports Roadster option with a fiberglass tonneau cover over the rear seat offering the appearance of a two seat car the Sports Roadster packaged was sometimes combined with even rarer options including higher performance engines and wire spoke wheels br br br NASCAR br br Thunderbirds first made inroads into NASCAR racing in the season The combination of the second generation body style and the newly available CID V took drivers Curtis Turner Johnny Beauchamp Tiger Tom Pistone and Cotton Owens to victory lane In the season most teams returned to using the conventional full sized Ford body style and the T Bird made only sporadic appearances through the rest of the s with no additional wins br Beginning in Thunderbird bodied racecars replaced the Torino as Ford s primary body style in NASCAR starting a trend of luxury coupe type body styles eventually the Imperial would also be seen racing being used as a sheet metal source on the race track Bobby Allison won races with this car driving for owner Bud Moore in the through seasons though the cars looked boxy and un aerodynamic During the downsized and aerodynamically clean Thunderbirds were successful in NASCAR stock car racing before they were replaced by Taurus based bodies in The through bodied exceeded mph and in one case during a qualifying session set the record of the fastest lap in stock car history at seconds with an average speed of mph km h at Talladega Superspeedway a record that still stands Bill Elliott and Davey Allison in particular were successful with the cars with Elliott winning the championship Alan Kulwicki also won the championship in in a car nicknamed Underbird for his underdog status as a driver The last time a Thunderbird was used in the Cup Series was when Billy Standridge failed to qualify for the Daytona br br br br br br Further reading br Bonsall Thomas E The
