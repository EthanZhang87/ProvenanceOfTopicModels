An odometer or odograph is an instrument used for measuring the distance traveled by a vehicle such as a bicycle or car The device may be electronic mechanical or a combination of the two electromechanical The noun derives from ancient Greek hod metron from hod s path or gateway and m tron measure Early forms of the odometer existed in the ancient Greco Roman world as well as in ancient China In countries using Imperial units or US customary units it is sometimes called a mileometer or milometer the former name especially being prevalent in the United Kingdom and among members of the Commonwealth br br br History br br br Classical Era br br Possibly the first evidence for the use of an odometer can be found in the works of the ancient Roman Pliny NH and the ancient Greek Strabo Both authors list the distances of routes traveled by Alexander the Great r BC as by his bematists Diognetus and Baeton However the high accuracy of the bematists s measurements rather indicates the use of a mechanical device For example the section between the cities Hecatompylos and Alexandria Areion which later became a part of the Silk Road was given by Alexander s bematists as Roman miles English miles long that is with a deviation of from the actual distance English miles From the nine surviving bematists measurements in Pliny s Naturalis Historia eight show a deviation of less than from the actual distance three of them being within Since these minor discrepancies can be adequately explained by slight changes in the tracks of roads during the last years the overall accuracy of the measurements implies that the bematists already must have used a sophisticated device for measuring distances although there is no direct mention of such a device br An odometer for measuring distance was first described by Vitruvius around and BC during the First Punic War although the actual inventor may have been Archimedes of Syracuse c BC c BC Hero of Alexandria AD AD describes a similar device in chapter of his Dioptra The machine was also used in the time of Roman Emperor Commodus c AD although after this point in time there seems to be a gap between its use in Roman times and that of the th century in Western Europe Some researchers have speculated that the device might have included technology similar to that of the Greek Antikythera mechanism br The odometer of Vitruvius was based on chariot wheels of Roman feet m diameter turning times in one Roman mile about m For each revolution a pin on the axle engaged a tooth cogwheel thus turning it one complete revolution per mile This engaged another gear with holes along the circumference where pebbles calculus were located that were to drop one by one into a box The distance traveled would thus be given simply by counting the number of pebbles Whether this instrument was ever built at the time is disputed Leonardo da Vinci later tried to build it himself according to the description but failed However in engineer Andre Sleeswyk built his own replica replacing the square toothed gear designs of Leonardo with the triangular pointed teeth found in the Antikythera mechanism With this modification the Vitruvius odometer functioned perfectly br br br Imperial China br br br Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms period br The odometer was also independently invented in ancient China possibly by the prolific inventor and early scientist Zhang Heng AD AD of the Han dynasty By the rd century during the Three Kingdoms Period the Chinese had termed the device as the j l g ch or li recording drum carriage Note the modern measurement of li m ft Chinese texts of the rd century tell of the mechanical carriage s functions and as one li is traversed a mechanical driven wooden figure strikes a drum and when ten li is traversed another wooden figure would strike a gong or a bell with its mechanical operated arm br Despite its association with Zhang Heng or even the later Ma Jun c there is evidence to suggest that the invention of the odometer was a gradual process in Han Dynasty China that centered around the huang men court people i e eunuchs palace officials attendants and familiars actors acrobats etc that would follow the musical procession of the royal drum chariot The historian Joseph Needham asserts that it is no surprise this social group would have been responsible for such a device since there is already other evidence of their craftsmanship with mechanical toys to delight the emperor and the court There is speculation that some time in the st century BC during the Western Han Dynasty the beating of drums and gongs were mechanically driven by working automatically off the rotation of the road wheels This might have actually been the design of one Luoxia Hong c BC yet by AD the mechanical odometer carriage in China was already known depicted in a mural of the Xiaotangshan Tomb br The odometer was used also in subsequent periods of Chinese history In the historical text of the Jin Shu AD the oldest part of the compiled text the book known as the Cui Bao c AD recorded the use of the odometer providing description attributing it to the Western Han era from BC AD The passage in the Jin Shu expanded upon this explaining that it took a similar form to the mechanical device of the south pointing chariot invented by Ma Jun see also differential gear As recorded in the Song Shi of the Song Dynasty AD the odometer and south pointing chariot were combined into one wheeled device by engineers of the th century th century and th century The Sunzi Suanjing Master Sun s Mathematical Manual dated from the rd century to th century presented a mathematical problem for students involving the odometer It involved a given distance between two cities the small distance needed for one rotation of the carriage s wheel and the posed question of how many rotations the wheels would have in all if the carriage was to travel between point A and B br br br Song Dynasty br The historical text of the Song Shi AD recording the people and events of the Chinese Song Dynasty also mentioned the odometer used in that period However unlike written sources of earlier periods it provided a much more thoroughly detailed description of the device that harkens back to its ancient form Wade Giles spelling br br The odometer The mile measuring carriage is painted red with pictures of flowers and birds on the four sides and constructed in two storeys handsomely adorned with carvings At the completion of every li the wooden figure of a man in the lower storey strikes a drum at the completion of every ten li the wooden figure in the upper storey strikes a bell The carriage pole ends in a phoenix head and the carriage is drawn by four horses The escort was formerly of men but in the th year of the Yung Hsi reign period AD the emperor Thai Tsung increased it to In the th year of the Thien Sheng reign period AD the Chief Chamberlain Lu Tao lung presented specifications for the construction of odometers as follows br br What follows is a long dissertation made by the Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong on the ranging measurements and sizes of wheels and gears along with a concluding description at the end of how the device ultimately functions br br The vehicle should have a single pole and two wheels On the body are two storeys each containing a carved wooden figure holding a drumstick The road wheels are each ft in diameter and ft in circumference one evolution covering paces According to ancient standards the pace was equal to ft and paces to a li but now the li is reckoned as paces of ft each br br Note the measurement of the Chinese mile unit the li was changed over time as the li in Song times differed from the length of a li in Han times br br The vehicle wheel li lun is attached to the left road wheel it has a diameter of ft with a circumference of ft and has cogs chhih inches apart There is also a lower horizontal wheel hsia phing lun of diameter ft and circumference ft with cogs the same distance apart as those on the vertical wheel inches This engages with the former br br Upon a vertical shaft turning with this wheel there is fixed a bronze turning like the wind wheel hsuan feng lun which has only cogs the distance between these being inches This turns the following one In the middle is a horizontal wheel ft in diameter and ft circumference with cogs the distance between these cogs being the same as on the turning like the wind wheel inches br br Next there is fixed on the same shaft a small horizontal wheel hsiao phing lun inches in diameter and ft in circumference having cogs inches apart Engaging with this there is an upper horizontal wheel shang phing lun having a diameter of ft and a circumference of ft with cogs the same distance apart as those of the small horizontal wheel inches br br When the middle horizontal wheel has made revolution the carriage will have gone li and the wooden figure in the lower story will strike the drum When the upper horizontal wheel has made revolution the carriage will have gone li and the figure in the upper storey will strike the bell The number of wheels used great and small is inches in all with a total of teeth Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain the dog teeth mutually engaging with each other so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point ti hsiang kou so chhuan ya hsiang chih chou erh fu shih br br br Subsequent developments br br Odometers were first developed in the s for wagons and other horse drawn vehicles in order to measure distances traveled br Levinus Hulsius published the odometer in in his work Gr ndtliche Beschreibung de Diensthafften und Nutzbahrn

Though not an odometer the pascaline utilized gears to compute measurements Each gear contained teeth The first gear advanced the next gear one position when moved one complete revolution the same principle employed on modern mechanical odometers br Odometers were developed for ships in with the odometer invented by the Englishman Thomas Savery Benjamin Franklin U S statesman and the first Postmaster General built a prototype odometer in that he attached to his carriage to help measure the mileage of postal routes In William Clayton and Orson Pratt pioneers of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints first implemented the Roadometer they had invented earlier a version of the modern odometer which they attached to a wagon used by American settlers heading west It recorded the distance traveled each day by the wagon trains The Roadometer used two gears and was an early example of an odometer with pascaline style gears in actual use br In Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the Cyclometer The Cyclometer was a mechanical device that counted the number of rotations of a bicycle wheel A flexible cable transmitted the number of rotations of the wheel to an analog odometer visible to the rider which converted the wheel rotations into the number of miles traveled according to a predetermined formula br In Arthur P and Charles H Warner two brothers from Beloit Wisconsin introduced their patented Auto meter The Auto Meter used a magnet attached to a rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument The Warners sold their company in to the Stewart Clark Company of Chicago The new firm was renamed the Stewart Warner Corporation By Stewart Warner odometers and trip meters were standard equipment on the vast majority of automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States br By the early s mechanical odometers would be phased out on cars from major manufacturers The Pontiac Grand Prix was the last GM car sold in the US to offer a mechanical odometer in the Canadian built Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis were the last Fords sold with one in br br br Trip meters br br Most modern cars include a trip meter trip odometer Unlike the odometer a trip meter is reset at any point in a journey making it possible to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but in most modern vehicles it is now electronic Many modern vehicles often have multiple trip meters Most mechanical trip meters will show a maximum value of The trip meter may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn br br br Clocking busting miles and legality br br A form of fraud is to tamper with the reading on an odometer and presenting the incorrect number of miles kilometres traveled to a prospective buyer this is often referred to as clocking in the UK and busting miles in the US This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been and thus increase its apparent market value Most new cars sold today use digital odometers that store the mileage in the vehicle s engine control unit making it difficult but not impossible to manipulate the mileage electronically With mechanical odometers the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer speedometer pair while on the road Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage a concept which provides the premise for a classic scene in the comedy film Ferris Bueller s Day Off but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle br The resale value of a vehicle is often strongly influenced by the total distance shown on the odometer yet odometers are inherently insecure because they are under the control of their owners Many jurisdictions have chosen to enact laws which penalize people who are found to commit odometer fraud In the US and many other countries vehicle mechanics are also required to keep records of the odometer any time a vehicle is serviced or inspected Companies such as Carfax then use these data to help potential car buyers detect whether odometer rollback has occurred br br br Prevalence br Research by Irish vehicle check specialist Cartell found that of vehicles imported to Ireland from Great Britain and Northern Ireland had had their mileometers altered to show a lower mileage br br br Accuracy br Most odometers work by counting wheel rotations and assume that the distance traveled is the number of wheel rotations times the tire circumference which is a standard tire diameter times pi If nonstandard or severely worn or underinflated tires are used then this will cause some error in the odometer The formula is br br br br br a br c br t br u br a br l br br d br i br s br t br a br n br c br e br br t br r br a br
