title: Subframe
id: 3145000
A subframe is a structural component of a vehicle such as an automobile or an aircraft that uses a discrete separate structure within a larger body on frame or unit body to carry certain components such as the engine drivetrain or suspension The subframe is bolted and or welded to the vehicle When bolted it is sometimes equipped with rubber bushings or springs to dampen vibration br The principal purposes of using a subframe are to spread high chassis loads over a wide area of relatively thin sheet metal of a monocoque body shell and to isolate vibrations and harshness from the rest of the body For example in an automobile with its powertrain contained in a subframe forces generated by the engine and transmission can be damped enough that they will not disturb passengers As a natural development from a car with a full chassis separate front and rear subframes are used in modern vehicles to reduce the overall weight and cost In addition a subframe yields benefits to production in that subassemblies can be made which can be introduced to the main bodyshell when required on an automated line br There are generally three basic forms of the subframe br br A simple axle type which usually carries the lower control arms and steering rack br A perimeter frame which carries the above components but in addition supports the engine br A perimeter frame which carries the above components but in addition supports the engine transmission and possibly full suspension As used on front wheel drive cars br A subframe is usually made of pressed steel panels that are much thicker than bodyshell panels which are welded or spot welded together The use of hydroformed tubes may also be used br The revolutionary monocoque transverse engined front wheel drive Austin Mini that set the template for modern front wheel drive cars used front and rear subframes to provide accurate road wheel control while using a stiff lightweight body The Jaguar E type or XKE used a tubular spaceframe type front subframe to mount the engine gearbox and long bonnet hood to a monocoque tub passenger compartment br The subframe saw regular production in the s and s General Motors X platform and F platform bodies and the M platform vans Astro Safari br Subframes are prone to misalignment which can cause vibration and alignment issues in the suspension and steering components Misalignment is caused by space between the chassis subframe mounting bolts and the mounting hole There are a number of companies in the automotive aftermarket that offer solutions for the subframe misalignment and movement issue including TyrolSport of the US and Spoon Sports of Japan br br br
