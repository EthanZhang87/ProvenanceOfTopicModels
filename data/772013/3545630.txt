A run flat tire is a pneumatic vehicle tire designed to resist the effects of deflation when punctured allowing the vehicle to continue to be driven at reduced speeds for limited distances First developed by tire manufacturer Michelin in the s run flat tires were introduced to the public market in the s They have increased in popularity over time br br br Technologies br There are three basic technologies currently available described below br br br Self supporting br The origins of the commercial self supporting run flat tire started in with a tire that had a fabric inner tire The tire was advertised as a protection against blowouts a common and dangerous occurrence in the s br In Michelin introduced a tire that was based on technology developed for local commuter trains and trolleys It had a safety rim inside the tire which if punctured would run on a special foam lining The tire was sold for military use and for specialized vehicles like bank armoured cars It was advertised as semi bulletproof While the tire performed as advertised it was far too expensive to be a feasible option for most private automobile users br In Chrysler teamed with Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to offer Captive Air run flat tires using an interlining to carry the weight br In Dunlop launched the Total Mobility Tyre later Denovo fail safe wheel and tire system that became optional equipment on the Rover P in and by evolved into the TD Denloc which became standard equipment across the whole Austin Metro range br Most recently Bridgestone and Pirelli run flat tires are supplied on some new model BMW cars The automaker promoted these as a safety feature and as an alternative to carrying a spare tire br br Pressure Zero Tire PZT was pioneered by American Engineering Group AEG for US Special Forces AEG prototype dissipates heat and has the tire flexibility and strength to support the heavy military pick up weight while providing a relatively smooth ride The durability characteristics of this design were studied further on four different tire sizes for ATV Polaris Toyota Hilux and Toyota Land Cruiser GMV special operations vehicles br Self supporting run flat tires are now common on light trucks and passenger cars and typically allows the vehicle to be driven for miles km at around miles per hour km h However if the tires are subject to this kind of misuse wheels may become damaged in the process and repair may be impossible or unsafe especially if the tire is punctured in the sidewall or at the edge of the tread These tires carry a to weight penalty over similar standard tires and the thicker sidewall also means higher rolling resistance which reduces the vehicle s fuel economy However the weight penalty of the individual tire is usually more than compensated by the fact that the vehicle need no longer carry a spare as well as the equipment needed to swap in the spare The thicker sidewall however results in more road imperfections filtering through the tire to the rim and hence to the car which results in a harsher ride br br br Self sealing br br These tires contain an extra lining within the tire that self seals in the event of a small hole due to a nail or screw In this way the loss of air is prevented from the outset such that the tire is either permanently self repairing or at least loses air very slowly br There are also a number of retrofitted tire sealants which act in a similar way to self sealing tires These compounds are normally injected through the tire valve The rotating force then distributes the compound onto the inner surface of the tire to act as a self sealing lining within the tire br br br Auxiliary supported br br In this system there is an additional support ring or insert attached to the wheel that can support the weight of the vehicle in the event of a loss of pressure The run flat insert has an unsurpassed ability to carry heavy vehicle loads for long distances at high speeds It is therefore the normal run flat selection for military vehicles high level executive protection vehicles and armored vehicles used by government aid groups or private contractors in conflict zones br br br Standards of performance br The basic benefit of using run flat tires is continued mobility in case of a loss of air pressure due either to a normal puncture or to a hostile deliberate act including a bullet strike while the vehicle is traveling at high speed Performance criteria are therefore in terms of distance and speed at which the vehicle can escape without becoming immobile and the steering control over the vehicle during this process br The usual standard of performance especially for military or security vehicles are the Finabel standards br br br Market share br Run flat tires accounted for less than of replacement tire sales in the U S in In it was expected that such tires would gain popularity with armored vehicle manufacturers but growth figures were slow with one major model the Michelin PAX System no longer being developed by the manufacturer though replacements will be produced for the foreseeable future A Michelin study released in found that of drivers worldwide want run flat tires U S market share is well below American Honda Motor Co announced that the Honda Odyssey Touring and Acura RL were its last models available with run flat tires and with Honda no longer using run flats This leaves only a handful of volume manufacturers offering them as standard fittings and only on some models An exception is BMW who are the largest fitter of run flats as original equipment br Former US President Barack Obama s presidential limo the Beast had Goodyear Kevlar lined run flat tires br br br Factors contributing to small market share br The cost can be more than double other tires of comparable size Also run flat tires cannot be run flat if the flat is due to sidewall damage a common cause of flats Generally under ideal circumstances the speed and range of run flat tires is limited Run flat tires cannot be driven over miles per hour most of the time and usually offer only up to miles of extended mobility These limitations lower the value of the extra expense for many buyers In certain applications depending on the vehicle specific tire design and driving surface a run flat tire can provide from miles to miles driving while flat with limited speed br For Goodyear Tire one effect on market share is the policy to prohibit the repair of tires punctured by nails or other road hazards while Goodyear tires can be repaired the manufacturer s warranty and liability is voided br br br See also br br br
