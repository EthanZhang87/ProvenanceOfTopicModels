title: Impalement
id: 236597
Impalement as a method of torture and execution is the penetration of a human by an object such as a stake pole spear or hook often by the complete or partial perforation of the torso It was particularly used in response to crimes against the state and regarded across a number of cultures as a very harsh form of capital punishment and recorded in myth and art Impalement was also used during times of war to suppress rebellions punish traitors or collaborators and punish breaches of military discipline br Offences where impalement was occasionally employed included contempt for the state s responsibility for safe roads and trade routes by committing highway robbery or grave robbery violating state policies or monopolies or subverting standards for trade Offenders have also been impaled for a variety of cultural sexual and religious reasons br References to impalement in Babylonia and the Neo Assyrian Empire are found as early as the th century BC br br br Methods br br br Longitudinal impalement br Impaling an individual along the body length has been documented in several cases and the merchant Jean de Thevenot provides an eyewitness account of this from th century Egypt in the case of a man condemned to death for the use of false weights br br They lay the malefactor upon his belly with his hands tied behind his back then they slit up his fundament with a razor and throw into it a handful of paste that they have in readiness which immediately stops the blood After that they thrust up into his body a very long stake as big as a mans arm sharp at the point and tapered which they grease a little before when they have driven it in with a mallet till it come out at his breast or at his head or shoulders they lift him up and plant this stake very straight in the ground upon which they leave him so exposed for a day One day I saw a man upon the pale who was sentenced to continue so for three hours alive and that he might not die too soon the stake was not thrust up far enough to come out at any part of his body and they also put a stay or rest upon the pale to hinder the weight of his body from making him sink down upon it or the point of it from piercing him through which would have presently killed him In this manner he was left for some hours during which time he spoke and turning from one side to another prayed those that passed by to kill him making a thousand wry mouths and faces because of the pain he suffered when he stirred himself but after dinner the Basha sent one to dispatch him which was easily done by making the point of the stake come out at his breast and then he was left till next morning when he was taken down because he stunk horridly br br br Survival time br br The length of time which one managed to survive upon the stake is reported as quite varied from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours or even a few days The Dutch overlords at Batavia seem to have been particularly proficient in prolonging the lifetime of the impaled one witnessing a man surviving six days on the stake another hearing from local surgeons that some could survive eight days or more A critical determinant for survival length seems to be precisely how the stake was inserted If it went into the interior parts vital organs could easily be damaged leading to a swift death However by letting the stake follow the spine the impalement procedure would not damage the vital organs and the person could survive for several days br br br Transversal impalement br Alternatively the impalement could be transversely performed as in the frontal to dorsal direction that is from front through abdomen chest or directly through the heart to back or vice versa br In the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere in Central Eastern Europe women who killed their newborn babies were placed in open graves and stakes were hammered into their hearts particularly if their cases contained any implications of witchcraft A detailed description of an execution that was carried out in this manner comes from th century Ko ice then in Hungary now in eastern Slovakia The case of a woman who was to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants First a grave some one and a half ell deep was dug The woman was then placed within it her hands and feet were secured by driving nails through them The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face He then placed and held vertically a wooden stave on her heart in order to mark its location while his assistants piled earth on the woman keeping her head free of earth at the behest of the clerics because to do otherwise would have quickened the death process Once the earth had been piled upon her the executioner used a pair of tongs to grab a rod made of iron which had been made red hot He positioned the glowing iron rod beside the wooden stave and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman s head It is said that a scream was heard and the earth moved upwards for a moment before it was all over br br br Variations br br br Gaunching br br Joseph Pitton de Tournefort travelling on botanical research in the Levant observed both ordinary longitudinal impalement but also a method called gaunching in which the condemned is hoisted up by means of a rope over a row of sharp metal hooks He is then released and depending on how the hooks enter his body he may survive in impaled condition for a few days br Forty years earlier than de Tournefort de Th venot described much the same process adding that it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel Some years prior to de Thevenot in Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed a variant of the gaunching ritual A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook piercing him from the abdomen through his back so that he hung from it hands feet and head downward On top of the cross bar the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him br br br Hooks in the city wall br While gaunching as de Tournefort describes involves the erection of a scaffold it seems that in the city of Algiers hooks were embedded in the city walls and on occasion people were thrown upon them from the battlements br Thomas Shaw who was chaplain for the Levant Company stationed at Algiers during the s describes the various forms of executions practised as follows br br but the Moors and Arabs are either impaled for the same crime or else they are hung up by the neck over the battlements of the city walls or else they are thrown upon the chingan or hooks that are fixed all over the walls below where sometimes they break from one hook to another and hang in the most exquisite torments thirty or forty hours br According to one source these hooks in the wall as an execution method were introduced with the construction of the new city gate in Before that time gaunching as described by de Tournefort was in use As for the actual frequency of throwing persons on hooks in Algiers Capt Henry Boyde notes that in his own years of captivity there he knew of only one case where a Christian slave who had murdered his master had met that fate and not above two or three Moors besides Taken captive in the barber surgeon William Davies relates something of the heights involved when thrown upon hooks although it is somewhat unclear if this relates specifically to the city of Algiers or elsewhere in the Barbary States Their ganshing is after this manner he sitteth upon a wall being five fathoms feet or about m high within two fathoms feet or about m of the top of the wall right under the place where he sits is a strong iron hook fastened being very sharp then he is thrust off the wall upon this hook with some part of his body and there he hangeth sometimes two or three days before he dieth Davies adds that these deaths are very seldom but that he had personally witnessed it br br br Hanged by the ribs br br A slightly variant way of executing people by means of impalement was to force an iron meat hook beneath a person s ribs and hang him up to die slowly This technique was in th century Ottoman controlled Bosnia called the cengela but the practice is also attested in s Dutch Suriname as a punishment meted out to rebellious slaves br br br Bamboo Torture br br A recurring horror story on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot Over several days the sharp fast growing shoot would first puncture then completely penetrate the victim s body eventually emerging through the other side However no conclusive evidence exists that this form of impalement ever actually happened br br br History br br br Antiquity br br br Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East br The earliest known use of impalement as a form of execution occurred in civilizations of the ancient Near East The Code of Hammurabi promulgated about BC by the Babylonian king Hammurabi specifies impaling for a woman who killed her husband for the sake of another man In the late Isin Larsa period from about the same time it seems that in some city states mere adultery on the wife s part without murder of her husband mentioned could be punished by impalement From the royal archives of the city of Mari most of it also roughly contemporary to Hammurabi it is known that soldiers taken captive in war were on occasion impaled Roughly contemporary with Babylonia under Hammurabi king Siwe Palar huhpak of Elam made official edicts in which he threatened the allies of his enemies with impalement among other terrible fates For acts of perceived great sacrilege some individuals in diverse cultures have been impaled for their effrontery For example roughly BC merchants of Ugarit express deep concern to each other that a fellow citizen is to be impaled in the Phoenician town Sidon due to some great sin committed against the patron deity of Sidon br br br Pharaonic Egypt br During Dynasty Merneptah had Libu prisoners of war impaled caused to be set upon a stake to the south of Memphis following an attempted invasion of Egypt during his Regnal Year The relevant determinative for t stake depicts an individual transfixed through the abdomen Other Egyptian kings employing impalements include Sobekhotep II Akhenaten Seti and Ramesses IX br br br Neo Assyrian Empire br br Evidence by carvings and statues is found as well from the Neo Assyrian empire c BC The image of the impaled Judeans is a detail from the public commemoration of the Assyrian victory in BC after the siege of Lachish under King Sennacherib r BC who proceeded similarly against the inhabitants of Ekron during the same campaign From Sennacherib s father Sargon II s time r BC a relief from his palace at Khorsabad shows the impalement of enemies during an attack on the city of Pazashi A peculiarity about the Neo Assyrian way of impaling was that the stake was driven into the body immediately under the ribs rather than along the full body length For the Neo Assyrians mass executions seem to have been not only designed to instill terror and to enforce obedience but also it can seem as proofs of their might that they took pride in Neo Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II r BC was evidently proud enough of his bloody work that he committed it to monument and eternal memory as follows I cut off their hands I burned them with fire a pile of the living men and of heads over against the city gate I set up men I impaled on stakes the city I destroyed and devastated I turned it into mounds and ruin heaps the young men and the maidens in the fire I burned br Paul Kern in his Ancient Siege Warfare provides some statistics on how different Neo Assyrian kings from the times of Ashurnasirpal II commemorated their punishments of rebels br Although impalement of rebels and enemies is particularly well attested from Neo Assyrian times the th century BC Mitanni king Shattiwaza charges his predecessor the usurper Shuttarna III for having delivered unto the Middle Assyrians several nobles who had them promptly impaled Some scholars have said though that it is only with King Ashur bel kala r that there is solid evidence that punishments like flaying and impaling came into use From the Middle Assyrian period there is evidence about impalement as a form of punishment relative to other types of perceived crimes as well The law code discovered and deciphered by Otto Schroeder contains in its paragraph the following injunction against abortion br br If a woman with her consent brings on a miscarriage they seize her and determine her guilt On a stake they impale her and do not bury her and if through the miscarriage she dies they likewise impale her and do not bury her br br br Achaemenid Persia br br The Greek historian Herodotus recounts that when Darius I king of Persia conquered Babylon he impaled Babylonians In the Behistun Inscription Darius himself boasts of having impaled his enemies Darius speaks proudly of the ruthlessness with which these revolts were put down In Babylon Nidintu Bel was impaled along with of his companions br br Behistun Inscription br Then in Babylon I impaled that Nidintu Bel and the nobles who were with him I executed forty nine this is what I did in Babylon br br In BC Phraortes proclaimed that he was a descendant of the Median king Cyaxares and took the throne he seized Ecbatana the capital of Media and rebelled against the Achamenied yoke this revolt was suppressed by Darius king of Persia and Phraortes was captured and impaled br br Behistun Inscription br Darius the King says Thereafter this Phraortes with a few horsemen fled a district named Raga in Media along there he went off Thereafter I sent an army in pursuit Phraortes seized was led to me I cut off his nose and ears and tongue and put out one eye he was kept bound at my palace entrance all the people saw him Afterward I impaled him at Ecbatana and the men who were his foremost followers those at Ecbatana within the fortress I flayed and hung out their hides stuffed with straw br br br Biblical evidence br A Bible passage in the Book of Esther concerning the fate of the th century BC Persian minister Haman and his ten sons has been treated differently by different translators leading to an ambiguity as to whether they were impaled or hanged The passage explains that Haman conspired to have all the Jews in the empire killed but his plan was thwarted and he was given the punishment he had thought to mete out to Mordecai The English Standard Version of Esther describes this as hanging whereas The New International Reader s version opts for impalement br The Assyriologist Paul Haupt opts for impalement in his essay Critical notes on Esther while Benjamin Shaw has an extended discussion of the topic on the website ligonier org from br Other passages in the Bible may allude to the practice of impalement such as II Samuel concerning the fate of the sons of Saul where some English translations use the verb impale but others use hang br Although we lack conclusive evidence either way for whether Hebrew law allowed for impalement or for hanging whether as a mode of execution or for display of the corpse the Neo Assyrian method of impalement as seen in carvings could perhaps equally easily be seen as a form of hanging upon a pole rather than focusing upon the stake s actual penetration of the body br br br Rome br From John Granger Cook Stipes is Seneca s term for the object used for impalement This narrative and his Ep are the only two textually explicit references to impalement in Latin texts br br I see crosses there not just of one kind but made differently by different fabricators some individuals suspended their victims with heads inverted toward the ground some drove a stake stipes through their excretory organs genitals others stretched out their victims arms on a patibulum cross bar I see racks I see lashes br br Video istic cruces ne unius quidem generis sed aliter ab aliis fabricatas capite quidam conuersos in terram suspendere alii per obscena stipitem egerunt alii brachia patibulo explicuerunt video fidiculas video uerbera br br br Europe br br br Transversal impalement br Within the Holy Roman Empire in article of the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina the following punishment was stated for women found guilty of infanticide Generally they should be drowned but the law code allowed for in particularly severe cases that the old punishment could be implemented That is the woman would be buried alive and then a stake would be driven through her heart Similarly burial alive combined with transversal impalement is attested as an early execution method for people found guilty of adultery The statutes of Zwickau allowed punishment of an adulterous couple in the following way They were to be placed on top of each other in a grave with a layer of thorns between them Then a single stake was to be hammered through them A similar punishment by impalement for a proven male adulterer is mentioned in a th century ordinance for Moravian mining city Jihlava then and German Iglau whereas in a Vienna statute the husband of a woman caught in flagrante in adultery could if he wished to demand that his wife and her lover be impaled or alternatively demand a monetary restitution Occasionally women found guilty of witchcraft have been condemned to be impaled In Kiel year old Sunde Bohlen was on being condemned as a witch buried alive and afterwards had a stake driven through her heart br Rapists of virgins and children are also attested to have been buried alive with a stake driven through them In one such judicial tradition the rapist was to be placed in an open grave and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure Serving as an example of the fate of a child molester in August in Z rich Switzerland Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine His clothes were taken off and he was placed on his back His arms and legs were stretched out each secured to a pole Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground Thereafter people left him to die br br br Longitudinal impalement br Cases of longitudinal impalement typically occur in the context of war or as a punishment for robbery the latter being attested to as the practice in Central and Eastern Europe During the Defenestration of Prague in the Hussites impaled councilors to the king on pikes br Individuals accused of collaborating with the enemy have on occasion been impaled In during the Thirty Years War the German officer Fuchs was impaled on suspicion of defecting to the Swedes a Swedish corporal was likewise impaled for trying to defect to the Germans The Swedes continued this practise during the Scanian War especially in the case of deserters and those perceived as traitors In under the Ottoman siege of the Venetian garrison at Crete several peasants were impaled for supplying provisions to the besieged Likewise in some Christians were impaled by the Hungarians for having provided supplies to the Turks br In a particularly brutal German General Kops leading the forces of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I who wanted to keep Hungary dominated by the Germans rather than allow it to become dominated by the Turks began impaling and quartering his Hungarian subjects opponents An opposing general on the Hungarian side Wessel nyi responded in kind by flaying alive Imperial troops and fixing sharp iron hooks in fortress walls upon which he threw captured Germans to be impaled Finally Emperor Leopold I had enough of the mutual bloodshed and banished Kops in order to establish a needed cessation of hostilities After the Treaty of The Hague Sicily fell under Habsburg rule but the locals deeply resented the German overlords One parish priest who exhorted his parishioners to kill the Germans is said to have broken into joy when a German soldier arrived at his village exclaiming that a whole eight days had gone by since he had last killed a German and shot the soldier off his horse The priest was later impaled In the short lived Horea Revolt against the Austrians and Hungarians the rebels gained hold of two officers whom they promptly impaled On their side the imperial troops got hold of Horea s year old son and impaled him That seems to have merely inflamed the rebel leader s determination although the revolt was quashed shortly afterwards After the revolt was crushed by early some rebels are said to have been impaled br From onwards German regiments organized manhunts on robbers in Hungary Croatia impaling those who were caught br br br Heinous murderers br Occasionally individual murderers were perceived to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or being broken on the wheel were regarded as incommensurate with their crimes and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised An example is that of Pavel Va ansk Paul Waschansky in German transcript who was executed on March in Ivan ice in present day Czech Republic on account of confessed murders he was a roaming highwayman He underwent a particularly gruelling execution procedure first his limbs were cut off and his nipples were ripped off with glowing pincers he was then flayed impaled and finally roasted alive A pamphlet that purports to give Wasansky s verbatim confession does not record how he was apprehended nor what means of torture was used to extract his confessions br Other such accounts of heinous murderers in which impalement is a prominent element include cases in and the murderer nicknamed Puschpeter executed in for killing thirty people including six pregnant women whose unborn children he ate in the hope of thereby acquiring invisibility the head of the Pappenheimer family in and an unnamed murderer executed in Breslau in who under torture had confessed to acts of murder by arson br br br Vlad the Impaler br br During the th century Vlad III Dracula Prince of Wallachia is credited as the first notable figure to prefer this method of execution during the late medieval period and became so notorious for its liberal employment that among his several nicknames he was known as Vlad the Impaler After being orphaned betrayed forced into exile and pursued by his enemies he retook control of Wallachia in He dealt harshly with his enemies especially those who had betrayed his family in the past or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia Though a variety of methods were employed he has been most associated with his use of impalement The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers members of a rival clan and criminals in his domain whether they were members of the boyar nobility or peasants and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him Following the multiple campaigns against the invading Ottoman Turks Vlad would never show mercy to his prisoners of war After The Night Attack of Vlad epe in mid June failed to assassinate the Ottoman sultan the road to T rgovi te the capital of Vlad s principality of Wallachia eventually became inundated in a forest of impaled and decaying corpses and it is reported that Mehmet II s invading army of Turks turned back to Constantinople in after encountering thousands of impaled corpses along the Danube River Woodblock prints from the era portray his victims impaled from either the frontal or the dorsal or the rectal impalement method which consisted of a wood or metal pole being inserted through the body either front to back or vertically through the rectum or vagina The exit wound could be near the victim s neck shoulders or mouth br br br Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth br The impalement was practiced on the south eastern borders of the Republic of Poland The punishment was applied to peasants who rebelled against their lords but also to the nobility Ukraine was the scene of many Cossack uprisings for example that of Severyn Nalyvaiko crushed by the Poles They most often expressed discontent of a social nature cf social revolt of the Ha damaks such as the subjugation of the free Ukrainian peasants to the Polish lords who had carved out large estates for themselves The most important uprising was that of Bohdan Chmielnicki Khmelnitsky The hatred of the Poles and the Jews was at the origin of the pogroms perpetrated during crossings of Cossack armies The echoes of this disaster reached through Jewish traders Western Europe and are still present in Hasidic songs We know the story of the small army of the great lord of Volhynia kniaz Prince Jeremi Wi niowiecki who penetrating from the north momentarily repelled the armies of Bohdan Khmelnytsky and enabled the numerous Jews to be saved The prince a poor strategist as Pawe Jasienica writes following the opinion of his contemporaries made himself known for his cruelty towards the rebellious peasants taken prisoner beheadings hangings and impalements in the squares of towns and villages but it was only the answer to the exactions committed on the noble prisoners by the Cossack chief Maksym Kryvonis Nez Crooked br Aleksander Kostka Napierski the leader of the peasant uprising in Podhale was impaled on a stake in br Colonel and ataman Sukharuka a Cossack envoy in the novel and film With Fire and Sword and Donets a Cossack colonel Horpyna s brother were sentenced to this penalty This also happened to the Cossack bandurist Taras Weresaj the hero of Jacek Komuda s novel Bohun br One of the most famous Polish films where the execution of this punishment can be seen is the film Pan Wo odyjowski and the TV series Przygody pana Micha a Mr Michael s adventures whose script was based on the Trilogy by Henryk Sienkiewicz Azja Tuhaj bejowicz was subjected to this punishment for betraying the Commonwealth in Pan Wo odyjowski The method of execution in Mr Wo odyjowski was different from the description of J drzej Kitowicz the convict was strung on his back not on his stomach as in J drzej Kitowicz br br br Ottoman Empire br Longitudinal impalement is an execution method often attested within the Ottoman Empire for a variety of offenses it was done mostly as a warning to others or to terrify br br br Siege of Constantinople br The Ottoman Empire used impalement during and before the last siege of Constantinople in During the buildup phase to the great siege the year before in the sultan declared that all ships sailing up or down through the Bosphorus had to anchor at his fortress there for inspection One Venetian captain Antonio Rizzo sought to defy the ban but his ship was hit by a cannonball He and his crew were picked up from the waters the crew members to be beheaded or sawn asunder according to Niccol Barbaro whereas Rizzo was impaled In the early days of the siege in May contingents of the Ottoman army made mop up operations at minor fortifications like Therapia and Studium The surrendered soldiers some individuals from each place were impaled br br br Civil crimes br Within the Ottoman Empire some civil crimes rather than rebel activity treasonous behavior such as highway robbery might be punished by impalement For some periods at least executions for civil crimes were claimed to have been rather rare in the Ottoman Empire Aubry de La Motraye lived in the realm for years from to and claimed that he had not heard of twenty thieves in Constantinople during that time As for highway robbers who surely had been impaled Aubry heard of only such cases during his residence there Staying at Aleppo from to Alexander Russell notes that in the years gone by there were no more than half a dozen public executions there Jean de Th venot traveling in the Ottoman Empire and its territories like Egypt in the late s emphasizes the regional variations in impalement frequency Of Constantinople and Turkey de Th venot writes that impalement was not much practised and very rarely put in practice An exception he highlighted was the situation of Christians in Constantinople If a Christian spoke or acted out against the Law of Mahomet or consorted with a Turkish woman or broke into a mosque then he might face impalement unless he converted to Islam In contrast de Th venot says that in Egypt impalement was a very ordinary punishment against the Arabs there whereas Turks in Egypt were strangled in prison instead of being publicly executed like the natives Thus the actual frequency of impalement within the Ottoman Empire varied greatly not only from time to time but also from place to place and between different population groups in the empire br Highway robbers were still impaled into the s but one source says the practice was rare by then Travelling to Smyrna and Constantinople in Stephen Massett was told by a man who witnessed the event that just a few years ago a dozen or so robbers were impaled at Adrianople All of them however had been strangled prior to impalement Writing around the archaeologist Austen Henry Layard mentions that the latest case he was acquainted with happened about ten years ago in Baghdad on four rebel Arab sheikhs br Impalement of pirates rather than highway robbers is also occasionally recorded In October Hassan Bey who had preyed on Turkish ships in the Euxine Sea for a number of years was captured and impaled even though he had offered ducats for his pardon br br br Klephts and rebels in Greece br During the Ottoman rule of Greece impalement became an important tool of psychological warfare intended to inflict terror into the peasant population By the th century Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents known as klephts became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government Captured klephts were often impaled as were peasants that harbored or aided them Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts but would even turn them in to the authorities The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in and and were able to enlist Greek villagers eager to avoid the stake in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen br Impalement was on occasion aggravated with being set over a fire the impaling stake acting as a spit so that the impaled victim might be roasted alive Among other severities Ali Pasha an Albanian born Ottoman noble who ruled Ioannina had rebels criminals and even the descendants of those who had wronged him or his family in the past impaled and roasted alive Thomas Smart Hughes visiting Greece and Albania in says the following about his stay in Ioannina br br Here criminals have been roasted alive over a slow fire impaled and skinned alive others have had their extremities chopped off and some have been left to perish with the skin of the face stripped over their necks At first I doubted the truth of these assertions but they were abundantly confirmed to me by persons of undoubted veracity Some of the most respectable inhabitants of loannina assured me that they had sometimes conversed with these wretched victims on the very stake being prevented from yielding to their torturing requests for water by fear of a similar fate themselves Our own resident as he was once going into the serai of Litaritza saw a Greek priest the leader of a gang of robbers nailed alive to the outer wall of the palace in sight of the whole city br During the Greek War of Independence Greek revolutionaries and civilians were tortured and executed by impalement A German witness of the Constantinople massacre April narrates the impalement of about Greeks by a Turkish mob In April thirty Greeks from the Ionian island of Zante Zakynthos had been impaled in Patras This was recorded in the diary of the French consul Hughes Pouqueville and published by his brother Fran ois Pouqueville br Athanasios Diakos a klepht and later a rebel military commander was captured after the Battle of Alamana near Thermopylae and after refusing to convert to Islam and join the Ottoman army he was impaled Diakos became a martyr for a Greek independence and was later honored as a national hero Non combatant Greeks elders monks women etc were impaled around Athens during the first year of the revolution br br br Rebels elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire br Impaling perceived rebels was an attested practice in other parts of the empire as well such as the quelling of a Bosnian revolt and during the Serbian Revolution against the Ottoman Empire about Serbs were impaled in Belgrade in Historian James J Reid in his Crisis of the Ottoman Empire Prelude to Collapse notes several instances of later use in particular in times of crises ordered by military commanders if not that is directly ordered by the supreme authority possessed by the sultan He notes late instances of impalement during rebellions rather than cases of robbery like the Bosnian revolt of during the Cretan insurrection of and during the insurrections in Bosnia and Herzegovina in br In the Nobel Prize winning novel The Bridge on the Drina by Ivo Andri in the third chapter is described impalement of a Bosnian Serb who was trying to sabotage the bridge s construction br br br Armenian and Assyrian Genocide br Aurora Mardiganian a survivor of the Armenian genocide of discussing the scene of crucifixion in the biographical film of her life stated that the actual killings were by impalement br br The Turks didn t make their crosses like that The Turks made little pointed crosses They took the clothes off the girls They made them bend down and after raping them they made them sit on the pointed wood through the vagina That s the way they killed the Turks Americans have made the film a more civilized way They can t show such terrible things br A Russian clergyman who visited ravaged Christian villages in northwestern Persia claimed that he found the remains of several impaled people He wrote The bodies were so firmly fixed in some instances that the stakes could not be withdrawn it was necessary to saw them off and bury the victims as they were br br br References and notes br br br Bibliography br Books br br Newspapers magazines and periodicals br br Web resources
