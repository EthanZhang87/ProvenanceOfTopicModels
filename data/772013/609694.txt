The Lincoln Continental is a series of mid sized and full sized luxury cars produced between and by Lincoln a division of the American automaker Ford Motor Company The model line was introduced following the construction of a personal vehicle for Edsel Ford who commissioned a coachbuilt Lincoln Zephyr convertible developed as a vacation vehicle to attract potential Lincoln buyers In what would give the model line its name the exterior was given European continental styling elements including a rear mounted spare tire br In production for over years across nine different decades Lincoln has produced ten generations of the Continental Within the Lincoln model line the Continental has served several roles ranging from its flagship to its base trim sedan From to Lincoln sold the Continental as its exclusive model line The model line has also gone on hiatus three times From to the nameplate was briefly retired In the Continental was renamed the Lincoln Town Car to accommodate the seventh generation Continental After the Continental was retired largely replaced by the Lincoln MKS in in the tenth generation Continental replaced the MKS br As part of its entry into full scale production the first generation Continental was the progenitor of an entirely new automotive segment the personal luxury car Following World War II the segment evolved into coupes and convertibles larger than sports cars and grand touring cars with an emphasis on features styling and comfort over performance and handling From to the Continental nameplate was the namesake of the short lived Continental Division marketing the Continental Mark II as the worldwide flagship of Ford Motor Company as a second successor Ford introduced the Continental Mark series in produced over six generations to br Along with the creation of the personal luxury car segment the Lincoln Continental marked the zenith of several designs in American automotive history The Continental is the final American vehicle line with a factory produced V engine the final four door convertible and the final model line to undergo downsizing for the model year br American production of the Continental and MKZ its only two sedans ended in thereby making Lincoln a crossover SUV only brand in the USA After it was discontinued in Lincoln s home market Ford indicated that it planned to move Continental production to China br br br Edsel Ford prototype br br br Development br The Lincoln Continental began life as a personal vehicle for Ford Motor Company President Edsel Ford In Ford commissioned a one off design he wanted ready for his March vacation from company Chief Stylist Eugene T Bob Gregorie Using the blueprints of the streamlined Lincoln Zephyr as a starting point Gregorie sketched a design for a convertible with a redesigned body allegedly the initial sketch for the design was completed in an hour br Ford wanted to revive the popularity of the Lincoln Victoria coupe and convertible but with a more modern approach reflecting European styling influences for the Continental br By design the Edsel Ford prototype was essentially a channeled and sectioned Lincoln Zephyr convertible although the vehicle wore a conventional windshield profile the prototype sat nearly inches lower than a standard Lincoln Along with the massive decrease in height the running boards were deleted entirely In contrast to the Zephyr and in a massive change from the K Series Lincoln the hood sat nearly level with the fenders taking advantage of the fact that the engine type and configuration did not need the clearance afforded by the height of the standard Lincoln hood line br To focus on the styling of the car the chrome trim on the car was largely restricted to the grille the prototype differed from the eventual production version in that it utilized a somewhat less angular roof line As with the Lincoln Zephyr the prototype utilized a cubic inch V engine transverse leaf springs front and rear as well as hydraulic drum brakes br The prototype designed by Gregorie was produced on time making the deadline to be delivered to Edsel Ford in Florida Interest from well off friends was high Edsel sent a telegram back to Michigan that he could sell a thousand of them In reference to its European inspired design the Lincoln based prototype received its name Continental br Immediately production commenced on the Lincoln Continental with the majority of production being Cabriolet convertibles and a rare number of coupes These were extensively hand built the two dozen models and built examples were built with hand hammered body panels dies for machine pressing were not constructed until The limited number of models produced are commonly referred to as Continentals br br br Legacy and significance br The modified body gave the Continental new proportions over its Zephyr counterpart with the hoodline sitting lower over the V engine and the passenger compartment moved rearward the prototype had more in common with classic era long hood short deck body configurations versus being a strict adherent of contemporary streamline moderne design trends This design philosophy quickly became the standard for American vehicles for decades br As a consequence of the smaller trunk space the spare tire was mounted behind the trunk while disappearing on American cars the externally mounted covered spare tire remained a feature on European produced cars Though the spare tire itself was relocated into the vehicle for all succeeding models the styling motif remained a hallmark of most Continental Mark Series cars With the exception of the Continental Mark III IV and V all generations of the Mark Series featured a rounded trunk bulge that suggested the appearance of an externally rear mounted spare tire br Aftermarket kits that relocate the spare tire behind the trunk popular on Fifties cars even today remain known as Continental kits due to the design s continued association with the famous Continental model line br br br First generation br br At the time work had begun on the first Continental coupe Lincoln had announced the cancellation of the Lincoln K series coupes sedans and limousines which cut the lineup down to the very limited production Lincoln Custom limousine and the smaller higher volume Lincoln Zephyr coupes and sedans with Lincoln Zephyr technically a sub marque of Lincoln br This pared down model range came about at roughly the same time Ford Motor Company first introduced the Mercury brand in With the last examples of Lincoln K series completed and sold by and the new Mercury Eight encroaching on the Lincoln Zephyr price point the new Continental provided the luxury brand with an br Lincoln Continentals from to shared largely the same body design with each other with push button door catch releases displacing the previous lever type handles for the Continental received minimal updates from year to year br For the model year all Lincoln models were given squared up fenders and a revised grille with the Lincoln Zephyr now gaining the exterior push button door catch releases The result was a boxier more massive appearance in keeping with then current design trends but perhaps less graceful in retrospect production was shortened following the entry of the United States into World War II the attack on Pearl Harbor led to the suspension of production of automobiles for civilian use br After World War II the Lincoln division of Ford returned the Continental to production as a model Lincoln dropped the Zephyr nomenclature following the war so the postwar Continental was derived from the standard Lincoln internally H Series To attract buyers the design was refreshed with updated trim distinguished by a new grille For walnut wood trim was added to the interior br Following the death of Edsel Ford in Ford Motor Company re organized its corporate management structure which led to the departure of the Continental s designer Bob Gregorie would become the last year for the Continental as the division sought to redevelop its new model line as an upgraded version of the Mercury the expensive personal luxury car no longer had a role at Lincoln br The Continental is recognized as a Full Classic by the Classic Car Club of America one of the last built cars to be so recognized As of the Lincoln Continental and Lincoln were the last cars produced and sold by a major U S automaker with a V engine Base retail price for the coupe was listed at US equivalent to in and the cabriolet was listed at US equivalent to in br br Media related to Lincoln Continental first generation at Wikimedia Commons br br br Second generation br br After an eight year hiatus for the model year the Continental nameplate made its return to launch the vehicle Ford created a namesake Continental division centered around its new flagship vehicle To again highlight the European influence of the original Continental Ford assigned the Mark II suffix to the new Continental also in an effort to distinguish itself from the similar Bentley Continental Slotted well above Lincoln Mercury Continentals would be marketed and serviced through the Lincoln dealership network br At its launch the Continental Mark II was the most expensive automobile sold by a domestic manufacturer in the United States rivaling the Rolls Royce Silver Cloud At in dollars the Mark II cost nearly the same as five Ford Customlines With a large number of power equipment features included the Mark II was offered with only a single option air conditioning priced at br On a unique low slung chassis sharing only its inch wheelbase dimension with the Lincoln Capri and Premiere the Mark II was assembled with its own body panels and interior each vehicle was hand built with hand sanding and finishing of body panels In several elements of its design the Mark II broke from American styling precedent As with a Rolls Royce or Mercedes Benz d the Mark II essentially restricted chrome trim to the window trim grille and bumpers With a nearly flat hood and trunklid the Mark II was also designed with neither tailfins then prominent on American sedans nor pontoon fenders then current in Europe Rather than a separate assemblage the Continental spare tire was now integrated into the deck lid stamping serving to accommodate the vertically mounted spare tire beneath br br In total Continental Mark IIs were produced including two prototype convertibles As a consequence of the nearly hand built construction Ford estimated it lost nearly on every Continental Mark II produced After the Mark II was discontinued the Continental Division was re branded as a competitor to Imperial and Cadillac rather than Rolls Royce and Bentley br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Third generation br br To build a better business case for its flagship and the division that marketed the vehicle the Continental model line underwent extensive changes for the model year To widen its sales potential Ford required Continental to reach a price point in dollars a reduction from the Mark II allowing the division to better compete against Cadillac Eldorado and Imperial LeBaron To allow for production at a larger scale the Continental model line was more closely integrated with Lincoln differing primarily in roofline trim and grille For Ford cancelled the Continental division outright with its model line remaining through the model year as part of the model cycle br The first all new unibody design since World War II this generation of the Continental is one of the largest sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company or any American automaker br br br Development br To facilitate continuation of the Continental model line the division was forced to abandon hand built construction Sharing a common chassis and much of the exterior of the Lincoln Premiere Continental production shifted to the then new Wixom Assembly plant br To set itself apart from a Lincoln along with a division specific grille all versions of the Continental including convertibles were styled with a reverse slant roofline fitted with a retractable breezeway rear window First introduced on the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser the feature allowed for augmented interior ventilation along with air conditioning Unlike the Turnpike Cruiser the reverse slant of the roofline included the rear window an element that would reappear on Mercury sedans in the next decade br The Continental Mark III was designed by John Najjar Chief Stylist of Lincoln assisted by Elwood Engel largely drawing influence from the Ford La Tosca concept model designed by Alex Tremulis Engel would style the Mark IV with Don Delarossa who replaced Najjar as Lincoln Chief Stylist in developing the Mark V As a result of its massive size and the configuration of its headlights the model line was nicknamed the slant eyed monster in the Ford design studio br br br Chassis body br The Continental Mark III V are built upon the same mechanical components used by the Lincoln Capri and Premiere For Lincoln split further from Mercury in body design as part of ongoing efforts to outdo Cadillac with Lincoln adopting unibody construction for the first time the Continental shared a common body with the Premiere with the exception of the reverse slant roofline br Shared with Lincoln Mercury and the Ford Thunderbird the Continental Mark III V were fitted with a cubic inch MEL V engine a speed Turbo Drive automatic was the sole transmission In the engine produced hp and was detuned to hp in making hp in br Using a inch wheelbase the Continentals are the longest wheelbase sedans ever built by Ford Motor Company Longer than a Ford Excursion the Continentals are the longest sedans ever produced by Ford without mph bumpers The Continental Mark III convertible is the longest convertible ever mass produced in the United States with the sole exception of the rare Cadillac V convertibles br br br Models br In line with the previous Continental naming tradition Continental introduced its model line as the Mark III In a break from previous practice the two subsequent model years were marketed as incrementally increased marks Marks IV and V br br br Mark III br For Continental released the Mark III in four body styles including a door hardtop and convertible a door pillared sedan and a four door hardtop sedan called Landau Although far less expensive than the Mark II the Mark III remained well equipped retaining air conditioning as an option which was relocated from the ceiling to the dashboard The Mark III became the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to offer an FM radio tuner it was a rarely ordered option A unique option was Auto Lube allowing for the car to lubricate itself as long as an oil reservoir was kept full br br br Mark IV br For the Continental Mark IV saw a minor restyling with the elimination of Dagmars from the front bumpers and side sculpting becoming much less deeply drawn Coinciding with the end of the Continental Division Continental III fender badging is replaced by separate Continental and Mark IV badging The grille is restyled slightly with the headlight clusters now integrated into the egg crate grille br br br Mark V br For the Continental Mark V saw another styling update with flatter front bumpers with Dagmars The Continental badging was restyled with Mark V badging moved to the rear fenders On the front fenders four horizontal chrome spears were added Using a similar layout as the Mark IV the Mark V was given a restyled grille The Continental features a beautiful one year only restyled dashboard The rear grille and bumper were also completely restyled setting it apart from the previous two years The rear suspension was changed from coil spring to leaf springs the fusebox was placed under the hood for ease of access and cruise control was offered for the first time br br br Town Car Limousine br Alongside the Mark III IV and V there are two additional models of the third generation Continental In Lincoln added the Limousine and Town Car body styles the latter marked the first use of the Town Car name by Lincoln Available only in black both versions were built with a model specific formal rear roofline with a padded vinyl roof and smaller rear window for privacy The Limousine featured a retractable partition between the front and rear seats with a rear seat radio on the back of the front seat The wheelbase remained the same inches on the limousine as the other Continental models and the rear seating was also the same dimensions Priced at for the limousine and for the Town Car these cars came equipped with every optional accessory offered that year The air conditioning capacity was increased with the addition of a trunk mounted evaporator to increase rear seat cooling br The Town Car and Limousine are among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever sold only examples of the equivalent to in Town Car were produced and only examples of the Limousine were produced equivalent to in br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Nameplate reuse br Nearly lower in price than the Continental Mark II the Mark III would go on to sell better than the Mark II predecessor From to the Lincoln Division would lose over million in dollars along with the launch of newly developed vehicles in a recession economy a factor that contributed to the downfall of the Edsel line Lincoln and Continental were faced with overcoming the expense of developing a vehicle that was shared with neither Ford nor Mercury br In as Lincoln redesigned its model line the Continental went from being a flagship marque over Lincoln to the only model line sold by Lincoln for the next years In the mid s Ford made a decision to develop a new successor to the Mark II naming it the Continental Mark III effectively continuing the Mark series As with the Mark II and the Continentals it was sold marketed and serviced by Lincoln though not officially badged as such As part of the launch the existence of the Continental Mark III that shared its name was heavily downplayed a second nickname to this generation is dubbed the forgotten Marks br br br Fourth generation br br For the model year the Lincoln range was consolidated into one model Following the million in losses in dollars to develop the cars all models were replaced by a new Lincoln Continental Making its first appearance since the fourth generation was available only as a four door sedan and convertible until its model year refresh The four door sedan was listed at US in dollars and manufactured while the convertible was listed at US in dollars and manufactured br The new generation was nearly inches shorter overall with a shorter wheelbase over its predecessor though heavier than its Cadillac or Imperial counterparts Its construction and post build quality control reflected Ford corporate management s commitment to quality br The Lincoln Continental and its designers received a bronze medal by the Industrial Design Institute IDI of New York NY It also won Car Life s Engineering Excellence Award br br br Development br The fourth generation Lincoln Continental was styled by Ford design vice president Elwood Engel In mid Lincoln was struggling against Cadillac with its lack of profitability putting the future of the division at risk In Engel developed a proposal for the Ford Thunderbird with staffers Howard Payne and John Orfe in While the proposal was not selected for the Thunderbird the design interested Ford executives to the point of desiring the vehicle as a four door Lincoln br At the time of the approval Ford product planners had come to two conclusions critical to restoring the Lincoln Division to profitability First to instill design continuity Lincoln would adopt a model cycle distinct from Ford or Mercury moving from three years to eight or nine Second the Lincoln model line was too large for a standard length sedan consequently the Lincoln would have to decrease its exterior footprint br br br Chassis br The fourth generation Lincoln Continental rode on a stretched version of the unibody platform produced for the Thunderbird lengthened to a inch wheelbase from market launch to This was then extended to inches and retained until br The only engine available was the cu in L MEL V carried over from the Mark V It was expanded to cubic inches on models becoming the largest displacement engine ever used in a Ford Motor Company passenger car A new engine the cu in L series based V took its place by shared with the Continental Mark III All versions of the Continental were fitted with a speed automatic transmission New for was Ford s C automatic designed for use in big block high horsepower V engines br br br Body br At its launch the fourth generation Lincoln Continental was offered solely as a four door as either a sedan or a convertible For the first time on a Lincoln since rear doors were rear hinged suicide doors To alert drivers of open doors Lincoln fitted the dashboard with a Door Ajar warning light as seen on many modern automobiles Latching at the B pillar with a vacuum operated central locking system convertibles used an abbreviated pillar while sedans were pillared hardtops In the configuration a thin B pillar supported the roof structure while all four doors utilized frameless door glass in the style of a hardtop or convertible the layout would become used by several Ford Motor Company sedans during the s and s br In what would be the first four door convertible from a major American manufacturer after World War II the Lincoln Continental convertible was fitted with a power operated top on all examples Deriving its mechanism from the Ford Fairlane Skyliner hardtop convertible the Continental was fitted with a fabric roof that stored under a rear hinged deck lid filler panel In a similar fashion as the Skyliner to access the trunk for storage the deck lid was opened electrically without raising or lowering the roof br Due to the overlap of the front and rear door window weatherstripping on the four door convertibles with suicide doors to open the rear door when the front door was closed required that the rear door window be slightly lowered first This was accomplished automatically using sensors and relay controlled logic when the outside door latch button or inside handle was first pressed the power operated window lowered a few inches then raised when the door was closed br An option for was the vertically adjustable steering column Unlike most tilt adjustable columns that employ a lever activated locking pivot joint just behind the steering wheel the Lincoln version employed a vacuum actuated clamp a dash mounted height indicator window and a pivot point further down the column br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Model timeline br During its production the fourth generation Lincoln Continental would be produced in three versions undergoing model revisions in and br br br br The Lincoln Continental was introduced with four door sedan and four door convertible versions replacing the Lincoln Premiere and Lincoln Continental Mark V For the first time in a car manufactured in the United States the Lincoln Continental was sold with a year mi km bumper to bumper warranty California walnut veneer was used on the doors and instrument panel br For a simpler front grille design with floating rectangles and a thin center bar replaced the heavy gauge Thunderbird like high mounted bumper of the br For the Continental underwent several functional updates The front seatbacks were modified in an effort to increase rear seat legroom To increase luggage space the trunklid was reshaped In line with a number of vehicles in the United States the electrical charging system introduced an alternator replacing the generator br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For the Lincoln Continental underwent its first mid cycle redesign Alongside styling updates several functional changes were focused towards increasing rear seat space The wheelbase was increased from to inches shifting the rear seats backward The roofline underwent several changes with the adoption of flat side glass replacing curved window glass To increase rear headroom the rear roofline became additionally squared off in a notchback style br In a slight exterior restyling to eliminate the electric shaver appearance the front fascia added vertical chrome accents to the grille the recessed rear grille was replaced by a much simpler decklid with trim panel moving the fuel filler door to the left rear fender The interior was completely revised with a full width instrument panel updated upholstery patterns door panels and fittings br In Lincoln debuted the Continental Town Brougham concept car which had a inch wheelbase overall length at and had a retractable glass partition between the front and rear compartments with an exposed area over the front compartment in typical s style town car brougham appearance br For Lincoln made additional updates to the Continental In a styling change the convex electric shaver front fascia was replaced by a more angular blunt hood with an upright flat grille design As part of the redesign the front turn signals and parking lights are moved from the front bumpers to wraparound lenses on the front fenders with similar parking lights turn signals on the rear all four lights received metal trim to match the horizontal lines of the new grille To improve braking ability the Continental was given Kelsey Hayes disc brakes for the front wheels in addition front seat belts with retractors became standard br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br For the fourth generation Lincoln Continental underwent a second mid cycle redesign To better compete against the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown Coupe Lincoln introduced its first two door pillarless hardtop since The convertible remained offered solely as a four door In an effort to increase sales of the five year old model range Lincoln reduced the price of the Continental nearly from while keeping equipment levels identical The marketing decision proved successful boosted by the introduction of the two door body style the model range increased sales by br While following much of the restyling distinguished in largely by a new grille and the addition of Continental to the hood the Lincoln Continental wore an all new body growing inches longer implemented primarily in the rear seats to accommodate more legroom and nearly an inch taller and wider Curved side glass made its return with less obvious tumblehome to increase interior room To offer an engine sized comparably to those in the Imperial cubic inches in and Cadillac cubic inches cubic inches in the V was enlarged to cubic inches br The convertible underwent several equipment revisions for the first time adding a glass rear window and the top mechanism added a second hydraulic pump for opening the convertible roof and the trunklid making the two systems separate hydraulic solenoids were deleted from the top mechanism The interior underwent several revisions adding a tilt steering wheel and an track tape player as options br For the Lincoln Continental was given only minor trim updates with the deletion of the Lincoln star emblem from the front fenders being the largest change Several functional changes were made as Lincoln added a number of indicator lights to the dashboard Along with an oil pressure warning light the dashboard was given indicator lights for an open trunk and the cruise control if on Following federal safety mandates lap safety seatbelts became standard equipment coupled with an energy absorbing steering column br Following years of decreasing sales marked the final year of the Lincoln Continental convertible with only sold After becoming the first four door convertible sold after World War II the Lincoln Continental would become the final as of the model year example of its type sold by an American manufacturer As a result of numerous frame reinforcements required by the lack of a fixed roof the lb kg Lincoln Continental convertible is one of the heaviest passenger cars ever sold by Ford Motor Company br For Lincoln made several styling changes to the Continental To meet federal safety standards the parking lights taillights and front turn signals were returned to a wraparound design on the fenders to satisfy Federal standards for side marker lights For the interior torso seatbelts were added for the outboard front seats The Continental wording was removed from the front fascia replaced by the Lincoln star emblem as seen on the rear the hood ornament was deleted in anticipation of a federal ban on the feature which never came to effect The new cu in L Ford Lima engine was to be available at the beginning of the model year but there were so many cu in L Ford MEL engine engines still available the was phased in later that year In April the new Mark III made its debut as a model Total sales would be down to just br For few changes were made in the final year of production To comply with federal regulations the front seats were updated with head restraints for the outboard passengers The front fascia was updated with the grille enlarged for the first time since with the Continental wording returning above the grille Shared with the Mark III the V became the sole engine for the Lincoln Continental paired with the Ford C speed automatic transmission br After a nine year hiatus the Town Car name made a return in as part of an interior trim option package

Lincoln Continental reverted to body on frame construction the first Lincoln to do so since To save on its engineering and development costs the Continental was no longer given its own chassis instead given a longer wheelbase version of the Mercury Marquis chassis stretched from inches to inches vehicles received a inch wheelbase The four door sedan was listed at US in dollars and were sold br

operated hidden headlamps as a fail safe the headlamp doors were designed to open in the event of failure a dashboard indicator light indicated their status br br br Model timeline br During its production the fifth generation Lincoln Continental was sold in two versions with a major revision in Following the downsizing of the full size General Motors and Chrysler product lines the Lincoln Continental became the largest mass market automobile produced worldwide for the model year It was surpassed only by purpose built limousines such as the long wheelbase version of the Mercedes Benz the Rolls Royce Phantom VI and the ZIL Following the downsizing of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis the Lincoln Continental was marketed as the final traditional or large sedan in the United States br br br br For Lincoln introduced a redesigned Continental two door Continental four door and Continental Town Car sold only as a four door the Town Car was distinguished by a vinyl roof br For the grille underwent a minor styling change partially in an effort to better distinguish the Continental from the Mercury Marquis The grille and headlight doors were redesigned with the latter painted in body color Rear wheel ABS brakes called Sure Trak was optional br For several functional changes were made as the V decreased in compression though intended to decrease emissions and adapt to unleaded gasoline output dropped The tradition of Lincoln exclusive engines came to an end as Mercury began use of the in the Mercury Marquis and Colony Park as an option Minor styling changes were made as the grille and the fenders were restyled to better separate the Continental from the Mark IV Lincoln reintroduced chrome fender trim For the first time since the Continental was equipped with a hood ornament On the inside more rear seat legroom was added br For the Lincoln Continental was brought into compliance with federal crash regulations as it was fitted with a mph front bumper While a number of vehicles underwent significant revisions to comply with the regulation the Continental was able to meet the standard by moving its front bumper several inches forward and fitting it with rubber tipped impact overriders The rear bumper was modified in a similar manner with a mph rating in total the Continental gained nearly inches in length br As a counterpart to the Continental Town Car a two door Continental Town Coupe was introduced In a similar fashion as the Town Car the Town Coupe was distinguished by its padded vinyl top br For the Lincoln Continental was given a new grille moving from an egg crate style to a waterfall design As part of federal regulations a mph bumper was added to the rear leading to a redesign of the rear bumper the taillamps were moved from inside the bumper to above it br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br After years on the market Lincoln made an extensive revision to the Continental Coinciding with the introduction of the Mercury Grand Marquis Lincoln and Mercury sought to better visually differentiate their two flagship model lines in spite of their mechanical commonality As part of the revision the Lincoln Continental was able to adopt a greater degree of styling commonality with the Continental Mark IV For the exterior of the Lincoln Continental underwent a major revision Although the body below the beltline saw only minor change with the taillights redesigned with vertical units the roofline was completely restyled To separate itself from the Mark IV the two door Continental Town Coupe adopted a fully pillared roofline with a square opera window in the C pillar In place of the pillared hardtop shared with the Mercury Marquis and Ford LTD the four door Continental Town Car adopted a wide B pillar to distinguish itself from the Cadillac Sixty Special Brougham Town Cars were given the oval opera window introduced on the Mark IV Along with the styling upgrades Lincolns received substantial upgrades to the braking system Designed by Bendix the Lincoln Continental became one of the first American cars equipped with a wheel disc brake system as an option To further improve the emissions performance of the V the engine was fitted with catalytic converters ending its compatibility with leaded regular gasoline br For the exterior remained essentially the same as the year before marking the first carryover styling year for Lincoln since In an effort to price the Continental more competitively Lincoln deleted a number of previously standard features making them extra cost options br For the Lincoln Continental would undergo another exterior revision The wide Mercury style grille was replaced by a narrower Rolls Royce style radiator grille taking cues from the outgoing Mark IV grille Variations of such grilles would continue to front Lincolns through In another trim revision the Continental script was removed from the rear fenders br For the dashboard was updated for the first time as the Lincoln Continental adopted a revised version of the Mercury Grand Marquis dashboard In addition to increasing parts commonality the update was done to save weight the plastic frame Mercury dashboard was lighter than the previous steel frame version In a similar move Lincoln redesigned the rear fender skirts adopting a version that covered less of the rear wheels Alongside the optional sliding glass sunroof a fixed glass moonroof with an interior sunshade was introduced for the first time since the Ford Skyliner br For the interior underwent further updating as the Mercury sourced dashboard received additional wood trim The V was deleted from the Lincoln Mark V model line entirely leaving the V as the sole engine br br

opera windows or coach lights fitted to the roofline For and the opera windows and coach lights were added to the roofline br br br Collector s Series br To commemorate the end of production of the Lincoln Continental and Continental Mark V while denoting them as the final traditional full size American sedans and coupes Lincoln offered a Collector s Series for both the Continental and Mark V As with its Mark V counterpart the Continental Collector s Series was equipped with essentially every available feature as standard equipment Only four options were available for the Collector s Series a power moonroof channel CB radio Sure Track anti lock brakes and a plush Kashmir velour interior in lieu of leather The Continental Collector s Series could reach equivalent to in when fully equipped within Ford Motor Company it was only surpassed by its equivalent to in Mark V Collector s Series counterpart at the time br Along with four options the Continental Collector s Series was produced in four colors dark blue white and limited issue medium blue built and light silver built with a dark blue vinyl top br br br Production br br br Sixth generation br br With the impending adoption of federal fuel economy standards CAFE making the large cars of the s a potential financial threat to Ford Motor Company for Ford and Mercury full size sedans underwent extensive downsizing Lincoln became the final American brand to release to a downsized model range for the model year In another extensive model change the Lincoln Continental became the counterpart of the newly introduced Continental Mark VI the first Mark series model range smaller than its predecessor br While lagging behind Cadillac for three years to downsize its model range the redesign of the Continental provided Lincoln with the best year to year fuel economy improvement in Ford history Alongside a massive reduction of curb weight the introduction of a speed overdrive transmission enabled Lincoln to surpass its competitors switching from the brand with the worst CAFE rating to the most fuel efficient full size car sold br One of the most technologically advanced vehicles ever sold by Ford at the time the Continental introduced a standard speed automatic overdrive transmission electronic fuel injection with computer controlled engine management EEC III digital instrument panel and trip computer measuring real time and average fuel economy figures and driving range Throughout the decade many of the features would make their way into many other Ford and Lincoln Mercury vehicles br The sixth generation of the Lincoln Continental would be offered only for To eliminate saturation of the Lincoln model line the sixth generation Continental was re released as the Lincoln Town Car for effectively lasting through the model year Following the withdrawal of the Versailles and the introduction of the Town Car the Continental nameplate was shifted to the mid size segment for the model year skipping the model year While never officially announced as the replacement for the Versailles the Continental became the Lincoln competitor for the Cadillac Seville The Mark VI ended its model run after the model year and was replaced by the Mark VII a far different vehicle br br br Chassis br Central to the redesign was the adoption of the all new Ford Panther platform shared with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis While retaining the body on frame layout of its predecessor and using a rear wheel drive powertrain the Panther platform made major engineering changes to lower curb weight In addition the chassis itself was smaller in several key dimensions While only approximately inches narrower the Continental shed inches of its wheelbase and inches in length In losing nearly pounds of curb weight the Continental came within pounds of the curb weight of the compact Lincoln Versailles br In its focus on fuel economy the Panther platform was developed without the use of the or V s

Continental br br br Body br Although sharing a common platform and powertrain with the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis the Lincoln Continental was well differentiated from its counterparts no visible body panels were common between the three vehicles In contrast the Continental was positioned as the base model of the Lincoln model line the Continental Town Car Town Coupe made its return as the top trim model As all Continentals wore padded roofs Continental Town Cars were largely differentiated by two tone paint Lincolns were differentiated from Continental Mark VIs by their exposed headlights

the introduction of the Continental and Mark VI both placed Lincoln in compliance with CAFE regulations and delivered the division an all new model line after the discontinuation of the Lincoln Versailles in early the Lincoln line now consisted of two full size sedans that were functionally identical to each other Though the premium Mark VI was fitted with different interior trim it offered little visual differentiation over the Continental beyond its hidden headlamps oval opera windows and rear bodywork featuring the spare tire trunklid of the Mark series br For Lincoln responded by rebranding its full size sedans under the Town Car name the Mark VI ended its model cycle after The Continental returned in October for becoming a mid size competitor for the Cadillac Seville The smaller line was not intended to replace the Versailles directly as late as a second generation Versailles remained in development by Ford though the new Continental would adopt a similar exterior footprint Sold exclusively as a four door sedan it was marketed alongside the two door Mark VII introduced in with both vehicles featuring a spare tire trunklid br Using the lessons learned from the

in a Lincoln since For both engines were dropped replaced by a fuel injected L V shared with the Town Car For the throttle body L gained electronic control for its fuel injection increasing output to hp For the V adopted the sequential fuel injection SEFI system sharing the hp version used by the Panther platform br For the entire production of the seventh generation Continental the V and the V engines were exclusively paired with the speed Ford AOD overdrive transmission br In response to diesel engine options offered by Cadillac and by several European luxury brands Lincoln introduced a diesel engine offering for sourcing a L inline turbodiesel from BMW with a ZF speed automatic transmission producing hp Several revisions were made to the chassis to accommodate the new powertrain

the cornering lamps The decklid adopted the electric trunklid closure feature from the Mark VII as standard equipment All Continentals now came with aluminum wheels with a full disc wheel replacing the previous wheel covers For only the Continental dropped all Lincoln badging alongside the Mark VII it held a non Lincoln VIN at the time For the Continental saw its Lincoln badging return as both it and the Mark VII officially adopted Lincoln VINs to comply with government mandates the model line adopted a center brake light CHMSL br The interior underwent an update alongside adopting the
