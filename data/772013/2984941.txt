title: Pillar (car)
id: 2984941
The pillars on a car with permanent roof body style such as four door sedans are the vertical or nearly vertical supports of its window area or greenhouse designated respectively as the A B C and in larger cars such as door station wagons and sport utility vehicles D pillar moving from front to rear in profile view br br br Nomenclature br Car pillars are vertical or inclined components of an enclosed automobile s body that both support its roof and reinforce the torsional rigidity of the body br An alphabetical convention for designating a car s pillars has developed over time used variously by the automotive press in describing and reviewing vehicles insurance companies in identifying damaged components and first responder rescue teams to facilitate communication as when using the jaws of life to cut their way into a wreck br The letters A B C and D are used in upper case br br The A pillar is the forward most pillar on a vehicle supporting its roof at each corner of the windshield br The B pillar is located between a vehicle s front and rear side glass where it serves as a structural support of its roof br The C pillar is the rearmost on two and four door sedans and hatchbacks br The D pillar is the rearmost pillar on larger four door vehicles such as station wagons and full sized SUVs br Posts for quarter windows a smaller typically opening window on older vehicles between the front door window and windshield and sometimes found in the rear usually fixed are not considered roof pillars br br br Design br Body pillars are critical in providing strength to an automobile body As the most costly body components to develop or re tool a vehicle s roof and door design are a major factor in meeting safety and crash standards Before safety standards pillars were typically thin The design of body pillars has changed with regulations that provide roof crush protection Standards in the United States were introduced in phases starting in that require enclosed passenger cars to be able to support from times to times the vehicle s unloaded weight on its roof while maintaining headroom survival space for occupants br This has meant designing thicker roof pillars that not only provide sufficient strength but that also incorporate padding and accommodate airbags However because thicker A pillars can somewhat limit the driver s forward field of vision and thus create blind spots some designs employ slimmer chamfered A pillars made of stronger alloy steel on each side of the windshield to help improve driver vision while still meeting safety standards and offering crash protection br One of the important design elements of modern cars is the A pillar because its location and angle impact the shape of the front of the car and the overall shape of modern vehicles or what designers call volume For example more forward positioned A pillars provide for increased interior room and make for less angle and visual difference between the hood and windshield This arrangement makes the side view of a car look aerodynamic The A pillars that are positioned further back on a vehicle are most often found on rear wheel drive and SUV models This arrangement provides a greater hood to windshield angle as well as achieving a bigger field of view for the driver but at the disadvantage of encroaching on interior space br The center B pillar on four door sedans also known as a post is typically a closed steel structure welded at the bottom to the car s rocker panel and floorpan as well as on the top to the roof rail or panel This pillar provides structural support for the vehicle s roof panel and is designed for latching the front door and mounting the hinges for the rear doors As perhaps the most complex of all the structures on the vehicle the B pillar may be a multi layered assembly of various lengths and strengths br B pillars also exist as integral elements of an automobile unibody on two door sedans and hatchbacks separating the front door from either fixed or movable glass of the second row of seating Additional doors beyond four such as on limousines will create corresponding B pillars numbered by order B B etc br Closed vehicles without a B pillar are widely called hardtops and have been available in two or four door body styles in sedan coupe and station wagon versions Designs without a B pillar for roof support behind the front doors and rear side windows offer increased occupant visibility while in turn requiring underbody strengthening to maintain structural rigidity The need for stronger roof structures meant replacing the pillar less designs with a rigid B pillar such as the two door AMC Matador line To continue capitalizing on the popularity of the design General Motors attempted to broaden the definition of hardtop during the early s to include models with a B pillar with the false rationale up to then everybody thought a hardtop was a car without a center pillar The Colonnade mid sized General Motors models were so named because of their pillared structure designed to meet new rollover protection standards but marketers attempted to promote them as if they were true hardtops By the s the full size Chrysler was the last design with opening front and rear side windows and no B pillar br The C pillar is the rearmost on two and four door sedans and hatchbacks and has served as an opportunity for automobile designers to introduce a little design flair to what would otherwise be a fairly nondescript side view Most conventional C pillars are rearward sloping but reverse angled have been used to differentiate their designs Because many modern cars are similar in side view the designs of the C pillar have become an area for stylistic whimsy br Designs of the D pillar typically found on station wagons and SUVs have also undergone a transition from function to more of a styling element As crossover vehicles look similar the D pillar is the only opportunity for any distinction br br br See also br Automobile design br Automotive head up display br Blind spot automobile br Driver visibility br List of auto parts br Quarter glass br br br br br br External
