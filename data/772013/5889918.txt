title: Ponton (car)
id: 5889918
Ponton or pontoon styling is an automotive design genre that spanned roughly from the s s when pontoon like bodywork enclosed the full width and uninterrupted length of a car body eliminating previously distinct running boards and articulated fenders The integrated fenders of an automobile with ponton styling may also be called Pontoon fenders and the overall trend may also be known as envelope styling br Now largely archaic the term Ponton describes the markedly bulbous slab sided configuration of postwar European cars including those of Mercedes Benz Opel Auto Union DKW Borgward Lancia Fiat Rover Renault and Volvo as well as similar designs from North America and Japan sometimes in its most exaggerated usage called the bathtub look in the U S br The term derives from the French and German word ponton meaning pontoon The Langenscheidt German English dictionary defines Pontonkarrosserie as all enveloping bodywork straight through side styling slab sided styling br br br Origin of the trend br In Hungarian aerodynamicist Paul Jaray requested a patent for a streamlined car with an evenly shaped lower body that covers the wheels and runs parallel to the floor space A year later he presented his first running prototype with such a body the Ley T and in Auto Union presented a streamliner concept car designed by Jaray br Another of the first known cars with a ponton body is the Bugatti Type Tank which participated in the French Grand Prix at Tours br In the Romanian engineer Aurel Persu filed a patent application for an aerodynamically shaped automobile with the wheels mounted inside the aerodynamic body having a drag coefficient of only and received it in Germany in Named the Persu Streamliner the car was built in Germany by Persu with the help of several local companies During his research Persu established that the most adequate aerodynamic shape was that of a water droplet falling to the ground br In Fidelis B hler designed one of the first production cars with a ponton body the Hanomag The car s body resembled a loaf of bread earning it the sobriquet of Kommissbrot a coarse whole grain bread as issued by the army The economical car was produced from to B hler built the core body around two side by side passenger seats He dispensed with running boards and integrated the fenders in the body to save on weight The inexpensive car became popular with consumers in Germany br In Vittorio Jano working with the brothers Gino and Oscar Jankovitz created a one off mid engine prototype on an Alfa Romeo C chassis which Jano had shipped to Fiume in The brothers Jankovitz had been close friends with designer Paul Jaray and the prototype called the Alfa Romeo Aerodinamica Spider featured ponton styling an especially early and clear example of the bulbous uninterrupted forms that would come to characterize the genre br In Pinin Farina designed a flowing ponton style body for the Lancia Aprilia berlinetta aerodynamica coup and also the open body on the Lancia Aprilia Cabriolet br The Cisitalia coup which Farina designed from sketches by Cisitalia s Giovanni Savonuzzi was the car that transformed postwar automobile design according to New York s Museum of Modern Art MoMA MoMA acquired an example for its permanent collection in noting that the car s hood body fenders and headlights are integral to the continuously flowing surface rather than added on Rounded flowing forms with unbroken horizontal lines between the fenders the style had identified as the so called Ponton Side Design became the new fashion in Europe br Two of the first American cars with fresh post war styling that adopted the new envelope body style were the Frazer Kaiser and the Crosley CC series The Howard Dutch Darrin designed Frazer won the Fashion Academy of New York Gold Medal for design achievement and was said to have been the inspiration for the Borgward Hansa Germany s first sedan in the ponton style br In the Soviet Union the GAZ M Pobeda came into production in This was about one month after the first Kaiser rolled off the production line br In Britain the Standard Vanguard went on sale in The Studebaker Champion designed by Virgil Exner and Roy Cole featured an innovative rear end that surprised Americans who smiled and asked which way is it going However the design is sometimes erroneously attributed to Raymond Loewy br In the Czechoslovakian Tatra began production a large rear engine design using an aeroplane inspired body style br Ford and General Motors followed the trend with their own designs from Ford examples are the Ford Taunus Germany and the Ford Zephyr United Kingdom General Motors examples are the Vauxhall Velox United Kingdom and the Opel Kapit n Germany br br br Post WWII examples br br One of the earliest completely new styled cars that were introduced after World War II in the United States were the Nash models Popular Science magazine described the new pontoon Nashes as the most obvious departure from previous designs They carried the fender less pontoon body fast back shape further than the competition This Nash design became a family appearance for their automobiles that also included the Nash Healey The redesign of the two seat sports car took on an even closer family appearance to the redesigned Nash models by featuring pontoon type fenders fore and aft The new styling also moved the headlights from the pontoon fenders to the grille br The term is also used in reference to Mercedes Benz models from to For example a book about the marque refers to the Ponton the Ponton saloon Ponton Ponton S and SE coupes and cabriolets and the Ponton models br A General Motors document refers to the Olympia Record as the first Opel with a full width or ponton body shell br The Volkswagen Beetle carried articulated running boards and fenders but the subsequent Volkswagen Type became known for its ponton styling in the Netherlands the Volkswagen Type door notchback sedan was referred to as the Ponton br In a reference work on alternative energy vehicles electrical engineering academics used the term as a generic for saloon cars with three box design also a German work on car design and technology mentions a Rover Ponton ponton style Rover and a French book on art and design also used the term in an automotive context in br br br Ponton fenders br br Pontoon fenders are a type of automobile fender or wings as they are more usually called in the United Kingdom br Originally the term referred to a design prevalent in the United States in the s where front fenders encased a wheel and terminated in a teardrop point remaining distinct from the running boards or the body of the car Examples include the Cord the Auburn Speedster and several designs by French Carrossiers notably Figoni et Falaschi br In The Buick Y Job the auto industry s first concept car was meant to be a vision of the future of the automobile and test the reaction of customers to the new design with streamline and ponton elements displaying a further degree of integration of the pontoon fenders with the main body of the car br Subsequently the term pontoon fender took on another more prominent definition derived from the wartime practice in Germany of adding full length tread armor along each side of a tank attached primarily on the top edge and resembling pontoons As this roughly coincided with the automobile styling trend where distinct running boards and articulated fenders became less common with cars carrying integrated front fenders and full width full length bodywork the fenders took on the pontoon fender nickname br The post war trend of the markedly round slab sided designs became itself known as ponton styling with many postwar Mercedes Benz models informally nicknamed the Ponton br The British assumed the latter definition using it in such works as the Beaulieu National Motor Museum Encyclopaedia of the Automobile br br br Gallery br br br br
