The Volkswagen Beetle officially the Volkswagen Type is a small car produced by the German company Volkswagen from to It is one of the most iconic cars in automotive history and is recognised for its distinctive shape Its production period of years is the longest of any single generation of automobile and its total production of over million is the most of any car of a single platform br The Beetle was conceived in the early s The leader of Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler decided there was a need for a people s car to serve Germany s new road network the Reichsautobahn The German engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his design team began developing and designing the car in the early s But the fundamental design concept can be attributed to B la Bar nyi in predating Porsche s claims by over five years The result was the Volkswagen Type and the introduction of the Volkswagen brand Volkswagen initially slated production for the late s but the outbreak of war in meant that production was delayed until the war had ended The car was originally called the Volkswagen Type and marketed simply as the Volkswagen but it was not until that it was officially named the Beetle br Volkswagen implemented designations for the Beetle in the s including and Volkswagen introduced a series of large luxury models throughout the and s comprising the Type Type and the K to supplement the Beetle but none of these models achieved the level of success that it did Rapidly changing consumer preferences toward front wheel drive compact hatchbacks in Europe prompted Volkswagen s gradual shift away from rear wheel drive starting with the Golf in In the late s and s Japanese automakers began to dominate the market which contributed to the Beetle s declining popularity br Over its lifespan the Beetle s design remained consistent yet Volkswagen implemented over incremental updates These modifications were often subtle involving minor alterations to its exterior interior colours and lighting Some more noteworthy changes included the introduction of new engines models and systems such as improved technology or comfort br br br History br br br KdF Wagen br In May at a meeting at Berlin s Kaiserhof Hotel Hitler insisted on a vehicle that could accommodate two adults and three children while not using more than seven litres of fuel per km mpg US mpg UK All components were designed for a quick and inexpensive part exchange As Hitler explained the reason for choosing an air cooled engine was that many rural doctors did not have access to garages for maintaining coolant On June Ferdinand Porsche received a development contract from the Verband der Automobilindustrie German Association of the Automotive Industry for the prototype of an inexpensive and economical passenger car after the leader of Nazi Germany Adolf Hitler decided there was a need for a people s car a car affordable and practical enough for lower class people to own to serve the country s new road network the Reichsautobahn Although the Volkswagen Beetle was primarily the conception of Porsche and Hitler the idea of a people s car is much older than Nazism and has existed since the introduction of automotive mass producing br Originally designated as the Type by Porsche the Beetle project involved a team of designers and engineers comprising Erwin Komenda who specialised in the bodywork Josef Kales responsible for the engine design Karl Rabe serving as the chief engineer and Josef Mickl and Franz Xaver Reimspiess the latter credited for devising the iconic Volkswagen badge The project saw significant milestones in October with the completion of the first two Type prototypes identified as cars V sedan and V convertible denoted with a V signifying its status as a test car The testing of three additional V prototypes began on July the first of which was driven to Obersalzberg and inspected by Hitler Two V s were delivered to Berlin in August for examination by other Nazi Party officials who showed great interest in them By June the V s underwent over km mi of testing across various terrains A series of thirty W development models commissioned by Porsche and manufactured by Daimler Benz underwent testing in early April covering a total distance of over kilometres mi All vehicles featured the characteristic rounded design and included air cooled rear mounted engines A further batch of VW pre production cars produced in introduced split rear windows and subsequently Volkswagen introduced fifty VW cars completed in July br br Kraft durch Freude was in charge of this project Robert Ley a Nazi official announced in that every German would own a Volkswagen within ten years However there were challenges Gasoline prices in Germany were high due to taxes making it expensive for private car ownership Gasoline was also primarily used for the military in the Nazi regime Despite that the Nazi leaders saw the mass produced car as a way to promote their system It symbolised a shift from cars being a privilege for the wealthy to a dream that lower class Germans could now fulfil Hitler was particularly enthusiastic about it because the car could easily be adapted for military use br The KdF Wagen was not series produced before the Second World War because the Volkswagen plant near Fallersleben now a district of Wolfsburg founded in May was not yet finished During the war other German manufacturers were concurrently producing military vehicles and armaments so the series production of the then called Volkswagen car could not begin until the end of the war By the close of Volkswagens were built and delivered to the occupying powers and the Deutsche Post br br br Design br The Beetle featured a rear located air cooled four cylinder boxer engine and rear wheel drive in a two door bodywork featuring a flat front windscreen accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat and it has a drag coefficient of The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to the Beetle s nearly flat platform chassis featured a central structural tunnel The front and rear suspension incorporated torsion bars and a front stabiliser bar providing independent suspension at all wheels albeit the front axle was designed with double longitudinal trailing arms whereas the rear axle was a swing axle Light alloy forms the Beetle s engine transmission and cylinder heads br br br Design controversies br German Bohemian Ferdinand Porsche and his team were generally known as the original designers of the Volkswagen However there has been debate over whether he was the original designer Rumours circulated suggesting that other designers such as B la Bar nyi Paul Jaray Josef Ganz and Hans Ledwinka may have influenced its design br br B la Bar nyi br In Austro Hungarian automotive engineer B la Bar nyi designed a car similarly shaped to the Beetle more than five years before Porsche unveiled his initial People s Car design Through a court ruling in Bar nyi successfully asserted his authorship and associated claims He explained that he had previously elucidated the concept of the Beetle which was already formulated in the s to Porsche in great detail However this concept was not protected sufficiently by patents Key elements of this concept included the air cooled four cylinder boxer engine at the rear the transmission positioned in front of the rear axle and the distinctive roundish shape Dieter Landenberger the head of Porsche s historical archive later affirmed that Bar nyi played a decisive role in the authorship of the later VW Beetle Since then he has been known for conceiving the original car design br br Paul Jaray br Many assume that Paul Jaray shaped the car s body design through his aerodynamics calculations According to a November update of research mentioned in the fifteenth report by the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Jaray s findings influenced the design of Hitler s streamlined KdF car later known as the beetle which became the best selling car globally post war Jaray s research results in fluid mechanics for ground bound vehicles extended beyond the VW Beetle impacting the Tatra and other vehicles His initial patents and publications date back to the early s The engineer Christian Binnebesel scientifically presented Jaray s significant contribution to streamline form in his dissertation br br Josef Ganz br Josef Ganz s potential early contributions to the original Beetle s development remained controversial for years and lacked clear clarification Research suggests that his idea and the concept of a compact car played a significant role in the VW Beetle s development and its prototypes Ganz personally drove a Hanomag Kommissbrot and a swing axle Tatra both featuring elements such as a central tubular frame independent wheel suspension and a rear mid engine design Ganz incorporated these technical features into his proposed vehicle designs Hitler reportedly saw cars designed by Josef Ganz at the Berlin Auto Show The Standard Superior designed by Ganz for the Standard vehicle factory featured an implied teardrop shaped body on a central tubular frame with a rear swing axle yet the engine was transversely installed in front of the axle not longitudinally as a rear engine br br Hans Ledwinka br The Austrian automobile designer Hans Ledwinka whom Porsche was a contemporary worked at the Czechoslovakian company Tatra In Tatra built the V prototype which featured an air cooled flat twin engine mounted at the rear Hitler and Porsche both were influenced by the Tatras Hitler an avid automotive enthusiast rode in Tatras multiple times during political tours of Czechoslovakia and had frequent dinners with Ledwinka Following one such tour Hitler remarked to Porsche This is the car for my roads From onwards Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs and Porsche admitted Well sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine while designing the Volkswagen The Tatra of had a cc rear located rear wheel drive air cooled four cylinder boxer engine It accommodated five passengers in its compact four door body which provided luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seats br Just before the outbreak of World War II Tatra filed numerous legal claims against VW for patent infringement Tatra launched a lawsuit halted only by Germany s invasion of Czechoslovakia in leading to the Nazi administration of the Tatra factory in October Hitler instructed Tatra to focus exclusively on heavy trucks and diesel engines discontinuing all car models except the V engined Tatra The issue resurfaced post World War II and in Volkswagen paid Ringhoffer Tatra Deutsche Marks in an out of court settlement br br br Tenure br br br World War II and military production br br The name Volkswagen was officially substituted by the term KdF Kraft durch Freude German for Strength Through Joy derived from the Nazi organisation once Hitler ceremoniously laid the foundation stone for the Volkswagen factory on May As part of this organisation Volkswagen urged workers to save five marks a week and get your car Before the completion of the KdF factory many Germans had already signed up for a savings plan to buy a car At that time Germany had fewer cars than other European countries In there were only about registered cars in Germany while France and Great Britain had over million each and the USA had more than million However the onset of the Second World War hindered the distribution of the cars and there was a lack of time for series production With the Volkswagen facility dedicated solely to wartime requirements the over KdF savers could not acquire their vehicles Following the war numerous KdF savers pressed for the receipt of a Volkswagen When their request was denied the VW saver initiative ensued spanning several years br During the war the factory predominantly built the K belwagen Type the Schwimmwagen Type and numerous other light utility vehicles These vehicles were derived mechanically from the Type and used by the Wehrmacht These vehicles including several hundred Kommandeurswagen Type featured a Type Beetle body mounted on the robust chassis of the four wheel drive Type K belwagen prototype The Kommandeurswagen included a portal axle a Schwimmwagen drivetrain wider fenders and oversized Kronprinz all terrain tyres reminiscent of the later Baja Bugs The production of the Kommandeurswagen persisted until when the production at the plant halted due to the extensive damage inflicted by the Allied air raids Due to gasoline shortages late in the war a few Holzbrenner Beetles were built fueled with wood logs br br Planned for September Kraft durch Freude arranged an event to showcase Germany s Autobahn highway system and to promote the purported beginning of the production of the KdF Wagen involving a kilometre mi journey from Berlin to Rome Erwin Komenda supervised the development process while Karl Froelich was responsible for creating official plans that they subsequently used to form a wooden scale model The model was wind tunnel tested at Stuttgart University by Josef Mickl Dubbed the Berlin Rome car Porsche AG s engineers designed the Type K officially known as the Porsche Although the engineers produced three vehicles they never made it to the race due to the outbreak of war before the scheduled date two of them got lost during the conflict Austrian Otto Math acquired the third Berlin Rome car and raced it throughout the s becoming the fastest in its class during the Alpine Cup He continued to use it until his death in br br br Post war production and success br br Following the war the Beetle experienced a significant growth in success On April Fallersleben where people lived was officially designated Wolfsburg Official series manufacture of the saloon began on December Volkswagen made fifty five vehicles by the end of the year The Volkswagen facility initially slated for dismantling and transportation to Britain under American control in faced a lack of interest from British car manufacturers an official report included the phrase The vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor car it is quite unattractive to the average buyer To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise Instead the factory remained operational by producing cars for the British Army Allied dismantling policy changed from late to mid During this period heavy industry in Germany continued until In March Herbert Hoover helped change policy by stating br br There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a pastoral state It cannot be done unless we exterminate or move people out of it br Major Ivan Hirst a British Army officer has been widely acknowledged for the reopening of the factory Hirst was ordered to take control of the heavily bombed factory which the Americans had captured Recognising the scarcity of occupations in Germany and the shortage of vehicles in the British Army Hirst persuaded the British military to order cars stating that it was the limit set by the availability of materials By March production capacity was rated at approximately units per month Based on an eight hour shift in mid production was around per month At the time about machine tools were in operation of which were used exclusively for the key components br br Once Heinrich Nordhoff assumed management at Volkswagenwerk manufacturing capacity increased significantly Production in and was rated at and examples respectively but in Nordhoff s first year manufacture doubled to approximately units On August the millionth example was assembled and by production capacity was rated at units per year By mid the Forces of Occupation received cars leaving less than for export or domestic consumption The number of employees increased from by the end of to almost in After the war over apartments were built to house the workers in Wolfsburg which then had a population of nearly In Volkswagen invested more than DM million to increase daily production by reaching a final target of per day During the company occasionally increased production by around by the end of Volkswagen planned to produce examples daily Nordhoff stated Then we believe we shall have reached a balance between supply and demand so that we can finally deliver Volkswagens to customers without a waiting period br By the early s the Wolfsburg facility was massive It accommodated about production machines and covered million square feet in roofed area more than the combined residential area in Wolfsburg Daily production increased to approximately and the plant employed over workers By Nordhoff had spent over DM million in expanding the factory At that time Volkswagen sales constituted per cent of the total West German automotive market and per cent of sub lb kg commercial vehicle market there Nordhoff s recurring encouragement proved to be highly effective He consistently urged the team to work harder reduce expenses and avoid complacency and corporate inefficiencies In January Nordhoff quoted br br We shall some day speak of the Golden Fifties We are now moving away from them and we must recognise that fact and use the time given us The wheel of history never turns back Whatever opportunities you miss today will never return The new year will have days this time every day we will cross one off and soon there will be only four left No power of heaven or earth will bring those days back Let us use this time as long as we are free to do so as we are now and as we shall still be for a few years br The Emden facility represented an expenditure exceeding DM million with Beetle operations beginning there on December By late Volkswagen s annual production exceeded units averaging units per day Volkswagen s share of all cars produced in West Germany reached per cent representing a increase from the previous year When including Audis produced at Ingolstadt the combined output from Volkswagen and its Auto Union company constituted of all West German cars produced that year In the Type was officially given the name Beetle from der K fer German for beetle br br br Decline and end of German production br br While it was largely successful in the s recording its highest sales growth in North America from to the Beetle started facing competition from more contemporary designs worldwide in the s The decade started out well for Volkswagen who sold Beetles in In fifteen Volkswagen dealerships in Washington convened to implement the Volkswagen American Dealers Association which was made to preserve a free market of imported international automobiles through political pressure and lobbying On February the world car production record was broken by the Beetle with a total of units produced worldwide thereby surpassing the production figure that had been held by the American Ford Model T for nearly fifty years Volkswagen donated the car to the Smithsonian Institution for permanent exhibition in its industrial history section By over million Beetles had been manufactured On July the final Beetle was produced at the Wolfsburg plant after examples were made there Following its discontinuation Volkswagen ceased the ongoing development of the Beetle in Germany On January the last Beetle sedan manufactured in Europe rolled off the production line at the Emden plant with the chassis number After its discontinuation in Germany production of the Volkswagen Beetle continued in Australia Mexico and Nigeria br In the s and s Volkswagen augmented its product portfolio with several models to supplement the Type the Type the Type and the NSU based K sedan None of these models achieved the level of success of the Beetle The overdependence on a singular model which was experiencing a decline in popularity meant that Volkswagen was in a financial crisis and needed German government funding to produce the Beetle s replacement Consequently the company introduced a new generation of water cooled front engined front wheel drive models including the Golf the Passat the Polo and the Scirocco all of which were styled by the Italian automotive designer Giorgetto Giugiaro By the Golf constituted over per cent of Volkswagen sales and it eventually became Volkswagen s most successful model since the Beetle As opposed to the Beetle the Golf was substantially redesigned over its lifetime with only a few components carried over between generations On January the final Beetle convertible of rolled off the production line at the Karmann facility in Osnabr ck It was the most successful convertible for a long time and was replaced by the first Golf cabriolet in br The number of Beetle units sold by Volkswagen was at its lowest in the s The Beetle faced competition from Japanese automakers such as Toyota and Honda whose cars were uprated in reliability and performance The closure of Volkswagen s Pennsylvania factory was due to high costs subpar quality and poor sales In the United States Volkswagen introduced the Rabbit and Corrado both of which had little success The overall sales suffered a significant downturn leading to the loss of many dealerships for the company br br br New Beetle and end of production br In the planning of a new car began once J Mays and Freeman Thomas returned to California to open Volkswagen s Design Centre at Simi Valley Recognising that Japanese manufacturers dominated the market in the s and s Volkswagen needed to introduce a vehicle to regain popularity Before this the company began the development of a city car codenamed Chico in which they invested millions of Deutsche Marks In the brand stated that the Chico was intended to begin production in However this plan was abandoned once Volkswagen realised that the project was commercially infeasible Mays and Thomas recognised the difficulties faced by the brand and suggested the need for a vehicle that included the recognisable design of the Beetle as a potential solution to improve customer appeal During development this car was known as the Concept One project The prototype version of the project was revealed at the Detroit Motor Show and a red convertible variant of the model was showcased at the Geneva Motor Show br It took a year for Volkswagen to officially confirm the production of the concept in its final form which was slated for completion by the end of the century To help gauge public demand of the forthcoming automobile in the United States Volkswagen implemented a free access telephone line to allow members to express their thoughts on the car The line quickly became inundated with calls with many saying You build it I ll buy it Work on the Concept One continued with further redesigns on its front fascia To reduce production investments and expenses Volkswagen initially planned to use the platform of the Polo However in at the Tokyo Motor Show the company unveiled another prototype sharing its wheelbase and its broader range of engine options with the Golf Simultaneously Volkswagen announced that it would be named the New Beetle After over six years of planning and development Volkswagen introduced the New Beetle in br On July at a m at the Puebla plant in Mexico Volkswagen produced the final Type after examples were produced globally during its tenure Its production span of years is the longest of any single generation of automobile and its total production of over million is the most of any car of a single platform To celebrate the occasion Volkswagen marketed a series of Beetles as ltima Edici n Final Edition br br br Models and history of design br While the design of the Beetle changed little over its lifespan Volkswagen implemented over incremental updates Typically subtle these alterations usually involved minor updates to the exterior interior colours and lighting More noteworthy changes have comprised new engines models and systems such as updated dashboards and hydraulic braking br br br Initial and successful models br The Type standard limousine initially designated as the Type before received the dub Pretzel Beetle due to its distinctive oval shaped vertically divided rear window On July the Volkswagen lineup was expanded to include the export model featuring enhanced interiors chrome bumpers and trim It was offered in a variety of colours to distinguish it from the preceding Standard model Starting in an optional sunroof with a textile cover could be added at an extra cost By March of the same year the export model began to be equipped with a hydraulic brake system which became a standard feature from April onwards In the equipment was enhanced with the addition of vent windows in the doors and the rims were reduced to a diameter of inches mm from the previous inches mm On March the split rear window was replaced with a one piece rear window Starting in the Type engine had a mm in cylinder bore increased by mm in and an engine displacement of cc L cu in surpassing the previous cc L cu in This engine produced kW PS a kW PS improvement over its predecessor In the traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America followed by their worldwide replacement in In the Beetle received a revised instrument panel and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design br br In Volkswagen introduced a series of technical alterations The front indicators were relocated to the front bonnet within chrome housings and the rear indicators were integrated into the tail lamps In January the valve clearing adjusting nut was slightly largened and resistor type ignition leads were adopted In March Volkswagen made several modifications to its front trailing arm and the steering damper In May Volkswagen added plastic warm air ducts to decrease noise br br In the mid s the traditional labels standard and export for the Beetle s model variants were superseded by numerical designations approximately correlating with the engine displacements In the October issue of Motor Trend Don Werner noted Five years ago out of every ten imported cars sold six were Volkswagens The latest figures show the ratio is now down to about every four Volkswagens out of every ten If the current VW starts to slip the new Type soon to be introduced probably will be imported to justify the company s more than Volkswagen dealerships and the million investment in facilities He continued by expressing that the Type had failed to leave a positive impression on industry executives in both Europe and North America The new engine essentially possessed identical specifications as the previous model it was a horizontally opposed overhead valve four cylinder air cooled engine It generated kilowatts PS hp at rpm and produced newton metres lbf ft at rpm br The Beetle introduced a full synchronised four speed manual transmission replacing the former non synchronised first gear The Volkswagen facility implemented alterations to the new model some of which were minor Noteworthy changes comprised an automatic choke an anti icing carburettor heater a redesigned fuel tank that increased boot capacity an external gas tank vent to prevent odours in the car standard windshield wipers and a new ignition switch Stylistic improvements included new paint colours and interior design options a coloured steering wheel and a mile per hour speedometer On July Volkswagen made several updates for the model year including the incorporation of an air filter into the oil filter the introduction of larger diameter cylinder head induction ports and the adoption of plastic for the headliner and window guides Volkswagen replaced the Wolfsburg crest on the hood which had been present since with the company s lettering A heating system was also introduced In the A designation was introduced for the standard Beetle with the kW hp engine br Volkswagen introduced the in August equipped with a litre engine producing kW hp Although featuring an identical design the horsepower kW increase was achieved through the adoption of the crankshaft from the Type This extended the stroke from mm in to mm in resulting in an engine displacement of approximately cubic inches cm also marked the Beetle s most extensive design change when its body stampings were extensively revised It allowed for significantly larger windows a departure from previous designs The windshield increased by in area and adopted a slight curvature replacing its flat configuration Door windows also expanded by with a slight backward canting of door vent window edges Rear side windows increased by and the rear window by br In updates comprised shortened front and rear bonnets box profile bumpers with a railway rails design that were installed at a higher position vertically oriented scattering discs for the headlights and larger rear lights with an iron design Volkswagen introduced external fuel filler flap eliminating the need to open the front bonnet for refuelling In September the Beetle was introduced Its engine displacement was approximately cubic inches cm its power output was kW hp and it featured a three speed semi automatic transmission In the received fully independent suspension some stylistic improvements and an external fuel cap The transitioned from six volt to twelve volt electrics and received dual circuit braking and a fuel gauge The also received these alterations as well as carburettor enhancements In the received twelve volt electrics hazard warning lamps and a locking fuel cap The was available with a semi automatic transmission and radial ply tyres In the received a new carburettor and dual circuit braking and Volkswagen discontinued the br In the received a larger windscreen while the received a power increase to kW hp and larger brakes effectively replacing the Volkswagen replaced the with the A economy version in for the model year possessing the same specifications as the but maintaining the same overall design as the br br br Mid life and declining models br The VW introduced in August featured a redesigned front end It incorporated a new front axle featuring MacPherson suspension struts wishbones and a stabiliser The enlargement of the front trunk became possible as a result Unlike its predecessor the spare wheel was no longer positioned diagonally at the front under the hood but instead rested horizontally under a cover in the trunk area The company initially intended to designate the car as the but a trademark already held by the French company Simca compelled Volkswagen to use instead Volkswagen produced the more powerful S alongside the The latter has an engine displacement of cubic inches cm while the former has a capacity of cubic inches cm In English speaking countries the name Super Beetle alongside was included on the written description but not the engine cover br The possessed the same kW PS output as the whereas the S saw an increase to kW PS This was facilitated by a twin port cylinder head enabling the engines to breathe more effortlessly The British automotive magazine Autocar expressed disappointment in its power increase noting Even with per cent more power the total output of bhp is very modest for the size of the engine The Super Beetle had a cm in increase in wheelbase but the extra space was in front of the windshield For the overall length increased by cm in doubling the front trunk capacity and adding cu ft m of luggage space Volkswagen also implemented a new fresh air ventilation system drawing its air from the rear quarter panels br br In August the range superseded the model which featured a curved windshield This design change elicited mixed opinions some favoured it while others expressed dissatisfaction Despite the effort to infuse the Beetle with a modernised design this did not resonate with consumers resulting in declining Beetle sales In the and S received rack and pinion steering but in July of that year Volkswagen discontinued both of them The long serving was renamed the L in with the additional deluxe features incorporated into the car s interior In July Volkswagen eliminated the engine lid louvres br br br Final models br Starting in for the model year the sole model available was the single carburettor version with cubic inches cm From late for the model year Volkswagen standardised catalytic converters the Bosch Digifant engine management system a lambda probe and electric ignition This fuel injection system proved much more straightforward and reliable than previous injection systems used on German assembled Volkswagens since Vehicles with these modifications can be identified externally by the reintroduced louvred engine lid heavier and larger bumper bars four stud wheels with twenty ventilation holes and a i badge on the engine lid The model also featured a third generation Golf style steering wheel and front seats a protection alarm handbrake and engine compartment lamps and an optional ZF limited slip differential The engine received hydraulic tappets a full flow oil filter a compression ratio allowing for the use of unleaded fuel and an electric fuel pump A standard version was also released in featuring painted bumper bars and many minor removals br From front disc brakes and an immobiliser became available and the De Luxe model featured small traffic indicator side lamps ahead of the top door hinge The steering wheel s centre boss was restyled to resemble that of the contemporary Golf and Polo In Volkswagen removed the small through flow ventilation slots behind the rear side windows and standardised front disc brakes Furthermore Volkswagen included a security alarm as standard and removed the i inscription from the engine lid br br br Markets and assembly br Over its year tenure Volkswagen produced the Volkswagen Type in numerous locations worldwide The following list encompasses all the locations in which it was manufactured br br br Specific markets br br br Brazil br Official exportation of the Beetle to the Brazilian market began on March with its parts imported from Germany For the local market the Type was officially known Volkswagen Fusca In January Volkswagen shifted assembly to the new S o Bernardo do Campo plant initially maintaining per cent of its German parts However by the mid s the cars had about per cent Brazilian made components Production persisted until after over million examples were produced there But manufacture resumed in extending until br br br Mexico br br The production of the Beetle was possible through agreements with companies like Chrysler in Mexico and the Studebaker Packard Corporation who assembled cars imported in complete knock down form The Beetle was introduced to the Mexican market in and began official production ten years later The local market referred to the Beetle as the Vocho The introduction of a new taxi regulation in Mexico City requiring only four door vehicles to be permitted to prevent robberies influenced Volkswagen s decision to the end of the production of the Beetle in br br br Australia br Formal introduction of the Volkswagen Beetle to the Australian market took place in followed by local assembly operations at the Clayton Victoria facility in the subsequent year The establishment of Volkswagen Australia Ltd took place in and by locally manufactured body panels were integrated for the first time Despite the introduction of larger windows for the European Type One body in Volkswagen Australia opted to maintain production of the smaller windowed bodies with features tailored for Australian models This decision was influenced by the constraints of the market size and the expenses associated with retooling By this juncture Australian content had surged to nearly per cent The final Australian assembled Beetle rolled off the production line in July br br br Retrofit program br Volkswagen entered into partnership with eClassics enabling Beetle owners to electrify their vehicles The electric conversion kit includes a battery with a capacity of kWh providing an estimated range of kilometres mi The converted Beetle can achieve a top speed of kilometres
