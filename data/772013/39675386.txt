A stressed member engine is a vehicle engine used as an active structural element of the chassis to transmit forces and torques rather than being passively contained by the chassis with anti vibration mounts Automotive engineers use the method for weight reduction and mass centralization in vehicles Applications are found in several vehicles where mass reduction is critical for performance reasons usually after several iterations of conventional frame chassis designs have been employed br br br Applications br br br Motorcycles br br Stressed member engines was patented in by Joah John Carver Phelon and his nephew Harry Rayner and were pioneered at least as early as the Harley Davidson valve racer and incorporated in the production Harley Davidson Model W by The technique was developed in the th century by Vincent and others and by the end of the century was common feature of chassis built by Ducati BMW and others In KTM Duke s engine is used as a stressed member br br br Automobiles br Many mid engine sport cars have used stressed engine design br br br Race cars br The Lotus is credited for establishing a solution copied by everyone in Formula One This requirement is cited as a reason the rules committee changed from an inline four to a V configuration for the Formula One season br br br Production automobiles br The limited production De Tomaso Vallelunga mid engine car prototyped in used the engine as a stressed member br In GM s Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla Motors Model S and Roadster electric cars the battery pack is a stressed member to increase rigidity br br br Tractors br The Fordson tractor Model F designed during World War I eliminated the frame to reduce cost of materials and assembly and was probably influenced by the similar design of the Wallis Cub br br br
