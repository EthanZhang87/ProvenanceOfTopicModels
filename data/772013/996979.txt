A sunroof is a movable panel that opens to uncover a window in an automobile roof allowing light and fresh air to enter the passenger compartment Sunroofs can be manually operated or motor driven and are available in many shapes sizes and styles While the term sunroof is now used generically to describe any moveable panel in the roof the term moonroof was historically used to describe stationary glass panes rigidly mounted in the roof panel over the passenger compartment A moonroof has a glass panel that is transparent and usually tinted Previous terms include sunshine roof sliding head and sliding roof br br br History br A common configuration for early automobiles included a fixed roof for the rear passenger compartment and an uncovered section for the chauffeur in a style known as Coupe de Ville Sedanca two door or Sedanca de Ville An open cabin allowed the driver to be more connected to their surroundings demonstrated that the car s owner employed a paid driver one reason chauffeurs wore uniform and identified the owner through the driver s livery the other reason for the uniform Road speeds were increasing and vehicles were changing from occasional use to full time transport meaning that they were increasingly being used in bad weather In order to provide better shelter for the driver therefore temporary cover was now demanded These part time roofs sometimes at first just a stretched piece of leather became more sophisticated comprising frame elements and leather or water resistant cloth to form the construction and installations even included spaces provided to store the parts when not in use br By the late s a more convenient version of the temporary roof was often being used where a solid metal panel would slide into a slot at the top of the passenger compartment sometimes called a de Ville extension By the early s cars were being constructed in the Sedan style comprising a metal one piece roof without the gap above the driver s cabin To provide a similar facility to the earlier Coup de Ville configurations sliding cloth or metal panels recognisable as the modern sunroof were regularly fitted to Bentley and Rolls Royce models built by coach builders such as Barker Gurney Nutting or Park Ward In these cars the continuous roofline between the windscreen and passenger compartment was unbroken and so unlike the Coup de Ville a coverable opening had to be let into the roof panel itself br While at first the purpose may still have been to expose the chauffeur Bentley cars in particular were increasingly sold for owners to drive themselves Indeed some models were provided with a sliding panel for the front seats even though the vehicle had just two seats Early Derby Bentley hard top models were therefore frequently equipped with sliding sunroof panels possibly more often than not The purpose of the sliding panels thus changed from uncovering the chauffeur to allowing the owner to better enjoy their surroundings on fine weather days br br This evolution was eventually not limited to luxury motoring The entrepreneur Noel Mobbs laid the foundation of the volume sunroof market when he evolved his coach building business into a company dedicated to the manufacture of sliding roofs in the name of Pytchley The Pytchley mechanism was both patented and first publicly demonstrated in At first Pytchley used their sliding roof system to build a number of coach built custom tourer saloon automobiles sold from their premises at Great Portland Street London In they claimed for a Daimler hp that This roof slides at the touch of a finger and opens up of the roof area giving greater visibility and more air without draughts The sliding roof system evolved from a device that Pytchley installed themselves to an option which manufacturers offered as a standard body style It was factory fitted to vehicles from a number of different manufacturers By the design had improved so that when closed the moveable panel was flush with the rest of the roof Morris built several models using Pytchley s technology from including the Morris Minor Morris Major and Morris Ten adding what became known as a Sliding Head using the term head in the same way as Folding Head or Drop Head This comprised a panel which could be slid back over the roof behind to create an opening above the driver and passenger The sliding panel also incorporated locks which allowed the panel to be fixed at any position from fully closed to fully open By Wolseley were using the Pytchley roof and by Austin too were also selling models with the sliding head The Hillman Minx was another low cost small car which was clearly not designed to be chauffeured and in it was offered in a variety of body styles as was usual at that time among the options was a sliding roof section including on the Aero model with glass panels as photographed on the show car making this the first moonroof In Pytchley took on the manufacturer Vauxhall for failure to pay royalties Vauxhall claimed that their variation of the sliding roof which slid the panel under the rear section rather than over was sufficiently different to mean that a license need not be paid Pytchley won the case br br Variations in moveable removable and transparent roof panels continued The Ford Lincoln X concept car of revisited the Sedanca style for a non chauffeured vehicle as it had a retractable transparent targa top which inspired later fixed moonroof panels on production vehicles In Triumph launched the TR with a removable hard top roof split into two sections The rear part incorporating the rear window could be left on the car when the centre piece was removed creating a Sedanca layout This concept was resurrected again in when Porsche launched a version of its sports car that established the term Targa trademarked by Porsche This bore even more of a resemblance to the traditional Sedanca form as the car had both a permanently fixed roll over hoop and rear seats While in Lamborghini showed the first full roof framed transparent panel roof heralding the modern panoramic roof on an Espada br br Sunroofs by historical definition are opaque Today most factory sliding sunroof options feature a glass panel and are sometimes marketed as moonroofs a term introduced in by John Atkinson a marketing manager at Ford for the Continental Mark IV For the first year Ford sent out its Mark IVs to American Sunroof Company for offline installation br Variations of both the sunroof and moonroof have become the norm in both factory installed and aftermarket offerings creating a wide range of features and choices Sunroof systems may be manual or electric while most moonroof systems are electric electronic Manual sunroofs may be lever actuated as in venting type pop ups manual lever or crank operated for sliding systems Electric roof systems are usually cable driven by a motor and feature some form of sliding opening Most moonroof systems today are electric and have either a combination pop up inbuilt or a pop up spoiler configuration see sunroof types below br Roof systems may be original equipment factory options provided by the car company or installed aftermarket by a roof installation professional for the car dealer or retail customer Once the vehicle leaves the assembly line the factory option can no longer be integrated into the roof making aftermarket the only option br br br Sunroof types br Roof systems are available in many shapes sizes and styles and are known by many names The main types are as follows br br Pop up sunroofs are simply a manually operated tilting panel These panels are sometimes removable and like T roofs must be stored when removed The tilting action provides a vent in the roof or a full opening when the panel is removed Pop ups can be installed in most vehicles and are relatively inexpensive Examples include metal panels in the Porsche the early Mazda RX and many glass panel factory and aftermarket installations br Spoiler sunroofs tilt slides combine the features of a pop up with those of a sliding roof system They tilt to vent and slide open above the roof requiring little headroom or roof length Spoilers typically do not provide as large an opening as other roof systems but offer the convenience of a self storing panel Most spoiler roofs are electric with optional features like integrated sun shades and express open close Spoilers are ideal for short roof vehicles where other types of sliders cannot be installed Examples include the Honda CRX the Toyota Celica and the Mazda RX br Inbuilt sunroof systems have a panel which slides between the metal roof and interior headliner requiring some loss of headroom but providing a full opening in the roof All inbuilts slide inside the roof while some also include a rear venting feature see pop up or express open close functions Inbuilts do not fit every vehicle as the panel must slide and store completely within the vehicle roof Historically inbuilts were a metal sunroof panel painted to match the vehicle roof but now most are glass panel systems with sliding sunshades typically referred to as moonroofs One of the first examples was the Ford Thunderbird br Folding sunroofs often called rag tops or cabrio coach are a European tradition They offer the convenience of a sunroof with an opening more like a convertible The panel is made of fabric often vinyl which folds back as it slides open After a long absence in European and North American markets folding sunroofs have experienced a resurgence with several new factory installed options Aftermarket versions were once only manual but now are also available in powered versions Examples include the original VW Beetle Renault Twingo and Jeep Liberty br Top mount sliding sunroofs rail mount topslider have been a popular factory option in Europe for many years A large glass panel slides open in tracks on top of the roof with no loss of headroom Most feature an integral wind deflector to eliminate wind noise Examples include Donmar s original Skyroof topslider aftermarket system the London Taxi and Renault cars br Panoramic roof systems are a type of large or multi panel moonroof which offer openings above both the front and rear seats and may be operable or fixed glass panels An early example visually very similar to many current versions was paraded around the Monaco Grand Prix circuit in it comprised a full length fixed Plexiglas panel and was fitted to a Lamborghini Espada The first example of a panoramic roof however was incorporated into the Lincoln XL concept car which sported a full length Plexiglas bubble canopy Large operable openings are often accomplished with top slider tracks in the top of the roof or spoiler type mechanisms Examples include the Acura ZDX Lexus ES BMW Mini Scion tC Pontiac G Mercedes C Class Volkswagen Eos Porsche Cayenne and the Tesla Model S br Removable roof panels t tops or targa roofs open a vehicle roof to the side windows providing a wider opening than other roof systems The Targa body style is identical in configuration to the Sedanca but is designed for owner driven rather than chauffeured cars and while a Sedanca style implies a rear passenger area the Targa does not T roofs have two removable panels and leave a T shaped structural brace in the roof center Targa roofs include only one opaque or transparent panel and leave no cross brace Aftermarket kits are no longer made but several companies sell replacement and remanufactured panels parts and accessories Examples include Triumph TR Porsche Targa Suzuki Cappuccino Toyota Supra Pontiac Firebird Chevrolet Corvette Honda NSX and Porsche br Solar sunroofs are made of glass with an inlaid photovoltaic solar panel that makes the glass totally opaque They operate the same as conventional factory fitted glass moonroofs tilting and retracting but when closed the solar panel provides electricity to power the interior ventilation fans for cooling the car interior on hot days when the car is standing outside in the sunlight These are available as a factory option on the Prius recent Audi cars Renault Zo and also were available on some versions of the Mazda Millenia and Mazda br Electric vs electronic Motorized power roof systems may be operated by a simple push and hold switch or may include an electronic control module ECM to provide single touch express opening express closing or auto closing on ignition off br Moonroof is a transparent usually glass or Plexiglas sunroof that lets light in while closed Examples include the Mk Ford Fiesta from the Mk Ford Escort from the Acura ILX and Pontiac G The earliest example although not called moonroof at the time was the Hillman Aero Minx which could be fitted with a sliding roof panel including inset glass An early use of a large panel transparent roof section was the Ford Skyliner and Mercury Sun Valley models which borrowed in part from the full panoramic roof of the Lincoln XL concept car as well as the X A fixed moonroof exclusively for rear seat passengers was a prominent feature of the Aston Martin Lagonda from series to which was launched in br br br Gallery
