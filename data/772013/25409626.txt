title: Vehicle horn
id: 25409626
A vehicle horn is a sound making device installed on motor vehicles trains boats and other types of vehicles The sound it makes usually resembles a honk older vehicles or a beep modern vehicles The driver uses the horn to warn people of danger The horn is activated to warn others of the vehicle s presence or approach or to call attention to some hazard Motor vehicles ships and trains are required by law in some countries to have horns Trams trollies streetcars and even bicycles are also legally required to have an audible warning device in many areas br br br Types br br br Motor vehicles br br Modern car horns are usually electric driven by a flat circular steel diaphragm that has an electromagnet acting on it in one direction and a spring pulling in the opposite direction The diaphragm is attached to contact points that repeatedly interrupt the current to that electromagnet causing the diaphragm to spring back the other way which completes the circuit again This arrangement opens and closes the circuit hundreds of times per second which creates a loud noise like a buzzer or electric bell which sound enters a horn to be amplified br A traditional style automobile horn includes an expansion chamber cast into its body once spiral shaped to better match the acoustical impedance of the diaphragm with open air and thus more effectively transfer the sound energy Sound levels of typical car horns are approximately decibels and they typically draw amperes of current br Horns can be used singly but are often arranged in pairs to produce an interval consisting of two notes sounded together although this doubles the sound volume the use of two differing frequencies is more perceptible to the human ear than two horns of the same frequency particularly in an environment with a high ambient noise level Typical frequencies of a pair of horns of this design are Hz and Hz approximately B and G minor third br Most cars motorcycles and motor scooters have for some time used a cheaper and smaller alternative design which despite retaining the name horn abandons the actual horn ducting and instead relies on a larger flat diaphragm to reach the required sound level Sound levels of such horns are approximately decibels and they typically draw amperes of current Again these horns can be either single or arranged in pairs typical frequencies for a pair are Hz and Hz approximately G A and F F for this design br br A horn grille is a part of some designs of car or other motor vehicle that has an electric horn such as a motor scooter br Larger louder air horns as found on trucks lorries and buses are driven by air compressors or supplied by reservoirs charged to operate their air brakes The compressor forces air past a diaphragm in the horn s throat causing it to vibrate Usually two are used with varied frequencies generally lower than those of automobile horns in the Hz approximately C G range Sound levels are approximately decibels br br br Trains trolleycars and trams streetcars br br In order to be heard at the longer distances that trains require to warn of danger or stop their locomotives have pneumatic train horns br that are both louder and lower in frequency than motor vehicle horns Operated by compressed air from the train s air brake system their sound level is dB In the United States train horns are required to have a minimum sound level of dB and a maximum sound level of dB at ft m in front of the train br To distinguish their sound from truck and bus air horns train horns in the U S consist of groups of two to five horns called chimes which have different notes sounded together to form a chord br In Japan most modern trains like series or E series from the first half of the s onwards use electric horns as primary in passenger use Although electric horns were used by Seibu series air horns were primarily used until the s Modern Japanese trains may still be equipped with both air horns and electric horns br Most modern streetcars trams and trolley cars including low floor vehicles around the world also employ horns or whistles as a secondary auditory warning signal in addition to the gong bell which either use the sound of air horns or electric automobile car horns br br br Ships br br Ships signal to each other and to the shore with air horns sometimes called whistles that are driven with compressed air or from steam tapped from the power plant Low frequencies are used because they travel further than high frequencies horns from ships have been heard as far as fifteen kilometres ten miles Traditionally the lower the frequency the larger the ship The RMS Queen Mary an ocean liner launched in had three horns based on Hz corresponding to A a frequency chosen because it was low enough that the very loud sound of it would not be painful to the passengers Modern International Maritime Organization regulations specify that ships horn frequencies be in the range Hz corresponding to C G for vessels that are over m ft in length For vessels between and m and ft the range is Hz and for vessels under m ft it is Hz br Smaller craft typically use electric diaphragm horns br Portable air horns driven by canned compressed air are also used as well as for officiating sports events and recreational activities br br br Bicycle br Small battery operated electric horns as well as the traditional single reed bulb horn are typically used on bicycles br br br As musical instrument br Various types of vehicle horns are used by percussionists as sound effects or even melodically in musical works For example George Gershwin s orchestral work An American in Paris calls for the use of taxi horns Gy rgy Ligeti s opera Le Grand Macabre features two Car Horn Preludes scored for bulb horns each one tuned to a specific pitch br br br Klaxon br br A klaxon is a type of an electromechanical horn or alerting device Mainly used on cars trains and ships it produces an easily identifiable sound often transcribed onomatopoeiacally in English as awooga Like most mechanical horns it has largely been replaced by solid state electronic alarms though the memorable tone has persisted Klaxon was originally a brand name br The klaxon horn s characteristic sound is produced by a spring steel diaphragm with a rivet in the center that is repeatedly struck by the teeth of a rotating cogwheel The diaphragm is attached to a horn that acts as an acoustic transformer and controls the direction of the sound br In the first klaxons the wheel was driven either by hand or by an electric motor American inventor Miller Reese Hutchison later chief engineer of Thomas Edison patented the mechanism in br The Lovell McConnell Manufacturing Company of Newark New Jersey bought the rights to the device and it became standard equipment on General Motors cars Franklyn Hallett Lovell Jr the founder coined the name klaxon from the Ancient Greek verb klaz I shriek br Klaxons were first fitted to automobiles and bicycles in They were originally powered by six volt dry cells and from by rechargeable batteries Later hand powered versions were used as military evacuation alarms and factory sirens They were also used as submarine dive and surface alarms beginning in the Second World War br The klaxophone is a musical instrument that makes use of the klaxon s unique sound br The English company Klaxon Signals Ltd has been based in Oldham England for the last years with premises also in Birmingham The French Klaxon company was acquired by the Italian Fiamm Group in the s In Klaxon Signals sold the rights for the hooter or klaxon range to Moflash Signalling Ltd based in the original Klaxon Factory in Birmingham England br The Moflash Company discontinued the Klaxet hooter in but continued to produce the A hooter the only original Klaxon left in production br br br In other languages br Several languages have either borrowed or transcribed the name into their lexicons In Japanese the word klaxon kurakushon refers to car horns in general This is also true in languages such as French klaxon Italian clacson Greek Dutch claxon Russian Polish klakson Spanish claxon Romanian claxon Czech klakson Turkish klakson Indonesian klakson Some Arabic dialects and Korean br br br Regulation br br In countries applying the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic
