The Citro n DS French pronunciation si t n de s is a front mid engined front wheel drive executive car manufactured and marketed by Citro n from to in fastback sedan wagon estate and convertible body configurations across three series of one generation br Marketed with a less expensive variant the Citro n ID the DS was known for its aerodynamic futuristic body design unorthodox quirky and innovative technology and it set new standards in ride quality handling and braking thanks to both being the first mass production car equipped with hydropneumatic suspension as well as disc brakes The series also introduced directional headlights to a mass produced car br Italian sculptor and industrial designer Flaminio Bertoni and the French aeronautical engineer Andr Lef bvre styled and engineered the car and Paul Mag s developed the hydropneumatic self levelling suspension Robert Opron designed the Series facelift Citro n built examples in six countries of which were manufactured at Citro n s main Paris Quai de Javel now Quai Andr Citro n production plant br In combination with Citro n s proven front wheel drive the DS was used competitively in rally racing during almost its entire year production run and achieved multiple major victories as early as and as late as It placed third in the Car of the Century poll recognizing the world s most influential auto designs and was named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic Sports Car magazine br The name DS and ID are puns in the French language DS is pronounced exactly like d esse lit goddess whereas ID is pronounced as id e idea br br br Model history br br After years of secret development as the successor to the Traction Avant the DS was introduced on October at the Paris Motor Show In the first minutes of the show orders were taken and orders for the first day totalled During the days of the show the DS took in deposits a record that stood for over years until it was eclipsed by the Tesla Model which received first day deposits in March The original list price for a ID was US in dollars br Contemporary journalists said the DS pushed the envelope in the ride vs handling compromise possible in a motor vehicle br To a France still deep in reconstruction after the devastation of World War II and also building its identity in the post colonial world the DS was a symbol of French ingenuity The DS was distributed to many territories throughout the world br br It also posited the nation s relevance in the Space Age during the global race for technology of the Cold War Structuralist philosopher Roland Barthes in an essay about the car said that it looked as if it had fallen from the sky An American advertisement summarised this selling point It takes a special person to drive a special car br Because they were owned by the technologically aggressive tyre manufacturer Michelin Citro n had designed their cars around the technologically superior radial tyre since and the DS was no exception br The car used double wishbone suspension with L shaped arms at the front and trailing arms at the rear with totally novel hydropneumatic spring and damper units The car s advanced hydraulics included automatic self levelling and driver adjustable ride height developed in house by Paul Mag s This suspension allowed the DS to travel quickly on the poor road surfaces then common in France br In addition the vehicle had power steering and a semi automatic transmission the transmission required no clutch pedal but gears still had to be shifted by hand with the shift lever controlling a powered hydraulic shift mechanism in place of a mechanical linkage br It had a fibreglass roof which lowered the centre of gravity and so reduced weight transfer Inboard front disc brakes as well as independent suspension reduced unsprung weight Different front and rear track widths reduced the unequal tyre loading which is well known to promote understeer typical of front engined and front wheel drive cars Although disc brakes had been tried on a car as early as by British Lanchester volume production had not been applied until by USA small car manufacturer Crosley but without success The Citro n DS was the first successful fielding of disc brakes on a mass produced car br Furthermore at launch the DS featured innovative centerlock wheels which used a captive allen bolt as the central fastener whilst a hexagonal protrusion transferred the drive to a matching recess in the wheel This made it possible to change the wheel very quickly in the event of a puncture and proved an advantage in motor racing br As with all French cars the DS design was affected by the tax horsepower system which effectively encouraged smaller engines Unlike the Traction Avant predecessor there was no top of range model with a powerful six cylinder engine Citro n had planned an air cooled flat engine for the car but did not have the funds to put the prototype engine into production br The DS placed third in the Car of the Century competition and fifth on the list of Coolest Cars by Automobile Magazine It was also named the most beautiful car of all time by Classic Sports Car magazine after a poll of world renowned car designers including Giorgetto Giugiaro Ian Callum Roy Axe Paul Bracq and Leonardo Fioravanti br br br Motorsport br br The DS was successful in motorsports like rallying where sustained speeds on poor surfaces are paramount and won the Monte Carlo Rally in In the Lakes Rally Pauli Toivonen drove a DS to victory in br In the DS won the Monte Carlo Rally again with some controversy as the competitive BMC Mini Cooper team was disqualified due to rule infractions Ironically Mini was involved with DS competition again two years later when a drunk driver in a Mini in Sydney Australia crashed into the DS that was leading the London Sydney Marathon km mi from the finish line Robert Neyret won the Rallye du Maroc in and in a DS br The DS was still competitive in the grueling London Sahara Munich World Cup Rally where it won over other cars only of which even completed the entire event br br br Technical innovation hydraulic systems br br In conventional cars hydraulics are only used in brakes and power steering In the DS they were also used for the suspension clutch and transmission The cheaper ID did have manual steering and a simplified power braking system An engine driven pump pressurizes the closed system to MPa psi br At a time when few passenger vehicles had independent suspension on all wheels the application of the hydraulic system to the car s suspension system to provide a self levelling system was an innovative move This suspension allowed the car to achieve sharp handling combined with very high ride quality frequently compared to a magic carpet br The hydropneumatic suspension used was pioneered the year before on the rear of another car from Citro n the top of range Traction Avant CV H br br br Effect on Citro n brand development br br The DS cemented the Citro n brand name as an automotive innovator building on the success of the Traction Avant which had been the world s first mass produced unitary body front wheel drive car in In fact the DS caused such a huge sensation that Citro n was apprehensive that future models would not be of the same bold standard No clean sheet new models were introduced from to br The DS was a large expensive executive car and a downward brand extension was attempted but without result Throughout the late s and s Citro n developed many new vehicles for the very large profitable market segments between the CV and the DS occupied by vehicles like the Peugeot Renault and Ford Cortina but none made it into production Either they had uneconomic build costs or were ordinary me too cars not up to the company s high standard of innovation As Citro n was owned by Michelin from to as a sort of research laboratory such broad experimentation was possible Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the radial tyre Michelin had invented when such experimentation was successful br New models based on the small utilitarian CV economy car were introduced such as the Ami It was also designed by Flaminio Bertoni and aimed to combine Three box styling with the chassis of the CV The Ami was very successful in France but less so on export markets Many found the styling controversial and the car noisy and underpowered The Dyane was a modernised CV with a hatchback that competed with the CV inspired Renault Hatchback All these cylinder models were very small so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the s br In Citro n finally introduced a car to target the mid range the Citro n GS which won the European car of the Year for and sold million units It combined a small kW hp flat air cooled engine with Hydropneumatic suspension The intended kW hp Wankel rotary engined version with more power did not reach full production br br br Replacing the DS br The DS maintained sales and remained competitive throughout its production run Its peak production year was Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin column mounted gearstick and separate fenders began to seem a little old fashioned in the s br Citro n invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in the SM which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS with similar length but greater width The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit The front disc brakes were the same design Axles wheel bearings steering knuckles and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts br The SM had a different purpose than replacing the year old DS design however it was meant to launch Citro n into a completely new luxury grand touring market segment Only fitted with a costly exotic Maserati engine the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS The SM was not designed to be a practical door saloon suitable as a large family car the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe Typically manufacturers would introduce low volume coup s based on parts shared with an existing saloon not as unique models a contemporary example being the Mercedes Benz SLC C BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid size sedan series large coupe series and large sedan series sharing common underpinnings br The SM s high price and limited utility of the seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars a modern DS and the smaller CX it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro n s large family or executive car in the model range br The last DS came off the production line on April with Citro n building up approximately eight months of inventory of the break Safari estate station wagon version of the DS to continue sales until the autumn of when the estate station wagon version of the CX would be introduced br br br Development br The DS maintained its size and shape with easily removable unstressed body panels but design changes occurred During the year production improvements were made on an ongoing basis br br br ID submodel to extend brand downwards br The DS was more expensive than the car it replaced the Citro n Traction Avant This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II so a cheaper submodel the Citro n ID was introduced in br br The ID shared the DS s body but was less powerful and luxurious Although it shared the engine capacity of the DS engine at this stage cc the ID provided a maximum power output of only kW hp compared to the kW hp claimed for the DS Power outputs were further differentiated in when the DS acquired a Weber twin bodied carburettor and the increasing availability of higher octane fuel enabled the manufacturer to increase the compression ratio from to A new DS now came with a promised kW hp The ID was also more traditional mechanically it had no power steering and had conventional transmission and clutch instead of the DS s hydraulically controlled set up Initially the basic ID was sold on the French market with a price saving of more than against the DS although the differential was reduced at the end of when the manufacturer withdrew the entry level ID Normale A station wagon variant the ID Break was introduced in br br br D Sp cial and D Super br The ID was replaced by the D Sp cial and D Super in but these retained the lower specification position in the range The D Super was available with the DS cc engine and a speed gearbox and named the D Super br br br Series Nose redesign in br br In September the DS was restyled with a more aerodynamically efficient nose better ventilation and other improvements It retained the open two headlamp appearance but was available with an optional set of driving lights mounted on the front fenders All models in the range changed nose design at the same time including the ID and station wagon models br br br Series Nose redesign in with directional headlights br In late for the model year the DS and ID was again restyled by Robert Opron who also styled the SM and CX This version had a more streamlined headlamp design This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy and the inner set swivelled with the steering wheel This allowed the driver to see around turns especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable br Behind each glass cover lens the inboard high beam headlamp swivels by up to as the driver steers throwing the beam along the driver s intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road The outboard low beam headlamps are self leveling in response to pitching caused by acceleration and braking br Because this feature was not allowed in the US see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations a version with four exposed headlights that did not swivel was manufactured for the US market br Although a directional headlight was previously seen on the Tucker Torpedo Citro n was the first to mass market adaptive headlights br br br New green hydraulic fluid br The original hydropneumatic system used a vegetable oil liquide hydraulique v g tal LHV but later switched to a synthetic liquide hydraulique synth tique LHS Both had the disadvantage of being hygroscopic Disuse allows water to enter the hydraulic components causing deterioration and requiring expensive maintenance The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid With every inhalation of fresh moisture and dust laden air the fluid absorbed more water br For the model year Citro n introduced a new mineral oil based fluid LHM liquide hydraulique min ral This fluid was much less harsh on the system br LHM required completely different materials for the seals Using either fluid in the incorrect system would completely destroy the hydraulic seals very quickly To help avoid this problem Citro n added a bright green dye to the LHM fluid and also painted all hydraulic elements bright green The earlier LHS parts were painted black br All models including the station wagon and ID were upgraded at the same time The hydraulic fluid changed to the technically superior LHM in all markets except the US and Canada where the change did not take place until January due to local regulations br br br International sales and production br br The DS was primarily manufactured at the Quai Andr Citro n in the Javel neighborhood of Paris with other manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom South Africa the former Yugoslavia mostly Break Ambulances and Australia br Australia constructed their own D variant in the s at Heidelberg Victoria identified as the ID Parisienne Australian market cars were fitted with options as standard equipment such as the DSpecial DeLuxe that were not available on domestic European models br Until UK cars were assembled at the manufacturer s Slough premises to the west of London using a combination of French made knock down kits and locally sourced components some of them machined on site A French electrical system superseded the British one on the Slough cars in giving rise to a switch to continental style negative earthing An intermediate model between the DS and the ID called the DW was introduced on the UK market in with a manual transmission and simpler foot operated clutch while retaining the DS power unit power steering and power braking outside of the UK this model was known as the DS M When the cc engine replaced the original cc unit in September the manual equipped DSes built in Slough were renamed DS A The Slough factory closed on February and thereafter cars for the British market were imported fully assembled from the company s French plant The British built cars are distinguished by their leather seats wooden early ID models or one piece plastic early DS models dashboards chromed number plate mount set into the front bumper and on pre cars Lucas made electrics These were all right hand drive cars br The DS was built and sold in South Africa from to br The DS was sold in Japan but the models were built in France and left hand drive br br br DS in North America br br The DS was sold in North America from to Despite its popularity in Europe and regard for its design from the American motoring press it did not sell well in the United States and little better in Canada While promoted as a luxury car it did not have the basic features that American buyers expected to find on such a vehicle such as an automatic transmission air conditioning power windows or a powerful engine The DS was designed specifically to address the French market with punitive tax horsepower taxation of large engines and very poor roads and not for a market where those constraints were removed br Further harming the DS prospects on the other side of the Atlantic was an inadequate supply of parts for the vehicle Jay Leno described the sporadic supply of spare parts as a problem for s era customers based on his early experiences working at a Citro n dealer in Boston br Additionally the DS was expensive with a hp kW vehicle costing in when would buy a hp kW Buick Electra Custom The Electra was available with an automatic transmission power windows and came with a much larger engine a cc V and it was hardly the only competitor to the DS to have these features as options or as standard br As a result of the insufficient supply of replacement parts an inability to compete with bigger and more luxurious cars sold for the same price and simply having not been designed for the North American market sales for the DS were mediocre on the North American market ultimately reaching a total of br US regulations at the time also banned one of the car s more advanced features its composite headlamps with aerodynamic covered lenses Based on legislation that dated from all automobiles sold in the U S were required to have round sealed beam headlamps that produced candlepower The DS s quartz iodine swiveling headlamps designed for the model were not allowed by the regulations Even the aerodynamic headlight covers featured on other cars such as the Jaguar E Type were illegal and had to be removed It was not until Ford Motor Company lobbied to have composite headlamps allowed that the sealed beam headlamp requirements were finally rescinded in br However the European lamps were legal in Canada including the directional headlamps br The hydraulic fluid change in also fell afoul of American regulations NHTSA follows the precautionary principle also used by the Food and Drug Administration where new innovations are prohibited until their developers can prove them safe to the regulators The castor based LHV and synthetic LHS fluids used in European market DSes were not certified for use in North America so cars sold there used conventional brake fluid instead Brake fluid as well as LHV and LHS is hygroscopic and miscible readily absorbing and mixing with moisture the idea being that within a closed hydraulic circuit these properties will ensure pockets of non soluble water will not form and cause corrosion of the system from within The design of the DS s hydraulic system used much more fluid and allowed much more moist air into the system than a simple hydraulic braking circuit so the fluid s hygroscopic properties were not preventing corrosion as intended Brake fluid also did not provide the viscosity and lubricity suited for used in the suspension clutch and gear change mechanism Mineral based LHM fluid was designed to remedy these issues but Citroen was obligated to demonstrate the new fluid was safe for automotive use before it could be installed in American market cars It took NHTSA until January to approve it so in the US market about half the production of cars in the model year use the older red LHS fluid and half use newer green LHM fluid neither of which is compatible with the other br br br Design variations br br br Pallas br In a luxury upgrade the DS Pallas after Greek goddess Pallas Athena was introduced This included comfort features such as better noise insulation a more luxurious and optional leather upholstery and external trim embellishments From the Pallas model received a driver s seat with height adjustment br br br Station wagon Familiale and ambulance br A station wagon version was introduced in It was known by different names in individual markets Break in France Safari and Estate in the UK Wagon in the US and Citro n Australia used the terms Safari and Station Wagon It had a steel roof to support the standard roof rack Familiales had a rear seat mounted further back in the cabin with three folding seats between the front and rear squabs The standard Break had two side facing seats in the main load area at the back br The Ambulance configuration was similar to that of the Break but with a split in the rear folding seat to accommodate a stretcher A Commerciale version was also available for a time br The Safari saw use as a camera car notably by the BBC The hydropneumatic suspension produces an unusually steady platform for filming while driving br br br Convertible br A factory convertible was offered from summer until summer The D capotable Cabriolet d Usine factory convertible were built by French carrossier Henri Chapron for the Citro n dealer network It was an expensive car and only were sold These DS convertibles used a special frame which was reinforced on the side members and rear suspension swingarm bearing box similar to but not identical to the Break Station Wagon frame br The design of the factory convertible was by Flaminio Bertoni who had originally started sketching convertibles in The production version was developed together with Chapron The manufacture was passed to Henri Chapron who had already been converting small numbers of DS s to convertibles in his Paris plant since Chapron persevered with his own custom versions alongside the works cars for those who wanted something particular or to allow conversion of an existing sedan After official production ended in August Chapron kept building small numbers of the works design for individual customers until br br br Chapron variations br In addition Chapron also produced a few coup s non works convertibles and special sedans including the Prestige same wheelbase but with a central divider and the Lorraine notchback Chapron also built the imposing DS Pr sidentielle in to a design created by Citro n s design department This car was m ft long specifically to be longer than the cars used by US Presidents Johnson and Nixon Ordered directly by President Charles de Gaulle he did not like the car due to its divider and continued to mainly use either DS landaulets or the two earlier special bodied Citro n H built by Franay and Chapron br br br Bossaert coup br Between and Hector Bossaert produced a coup on a DS chassis shortened by mm inches While the front end remained unchanged the rear end featured notchback styling br br br The Reactor br In American auto customizer Gene Winfield created The Reactor a Citro n DS chassis with a turbocharged hp kW flat six engine from the Corvair driving the front wheels Since the DS already had the engine behind the front wheels the longer engine meant only one row of seats This was draped in a streamlined low slung aluminum body br The Reactor was seen in American television programs of the era such as Star Trek The Original Series episode Bread and Circuses Batman episodes Funny Feline Felonies and driven by Catwoman Eartha Kitt and Bewitched which devoted its episode Super Car to The Reactor br br br Michelin PLR br The Michelin PLR is a mobile tyre evaluation machine based on the DS Break built in later used for promotion br br br Back to the Future Part II taxi br For the film Back to the Future Part II the producers created a flying car to depict a typical taxi in the future world of This taxi was based on the DS br br br Technical details br br br Suspension br In a hydropneumatic suspension system each wheel is connected not to a metal spring but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector a valve controlled by the mid position of the anti roll bar connected to the axle If the suspension was too low the height corrector introduced high pressure fluid if it was too high it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir In this manner a constant ride height was maintained A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights normal riding height two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain and two extreme positions for changing wheels The correct term oleopneumatic oil air has never gained widespread use Hydropneumatic water air continues to be preferred overwhelmingly br The DS neither had nor needed a jack to raise the car off the ground Instead the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand To change wheel in the event of a flat tyre one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above the ground ready to be changed This system used on the SM also was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that after the suspension was raised to the high position lifted the tyre clear of the ground The DS system while impressive to use sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel br br br Source and reserve of pressure br The central part of the hydraulic system was the high pressure pump which maintained a pressure of between and bar in two accumulators These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres One was dedicated to the front brakes and the other ran the other hydraulic systems On the simpler ID models the front brakes operated from the main accumulator Thus in case of a hydraulic failure the first indication would be that the steering became heavy followed by the gearbox not working only later would the brakes fail br Two different hydraulic pumps were used The DS used a seven cylinder axial piston pump driven off two belts and delivering bar psi of pressure The ID with its simpler hydraulic system had a single cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the camshaft br br br Gearbox and clutch br br br Hydraulique or Citromatic br The DS was initially offered only with the Hydraulique four speed semi automatic B V H Bo te de Vitesses Hydraulique gearbox br This was a four speed gearbox and clutch operated by a hydraulic controller To change gears the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased up on the accelerator pedal The hydraulic controller disengaged the clutch disengaged the previous gear then engaged the nominated gear and re engaged the clutch The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled automatically responding to hydraulic sensing of engine rpm and the position of the butterfly valve in the carburetor i e the position of the accelerator and the brake circuit When the brake was pressed the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights When the brake was released the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure following a loss of system fluid the clutch would disengage to prevent driving while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill br Unlike an automatic transmission there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked In addition the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped so the car could not be left in gear when parked The only way to prevent the car from rolling for example if parked on a slope is to use the parking brake br br br Manual four speed and five speed br The later and simpler ID had the same gearbox and clutch manually operated This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in The mechanical aspects of the gearbox and clutch were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID In September Citro n introduced a five speed manual gearbox in addition to the original four speed unit All manual transmissions used a steering column mounted shifter br br br Fully automatic br In September Citro n introduced a speed fully automatic Borg Warner transmission gearbox on the DS and later DS models The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time Many automatic DSs fuel injected DS sedans with air conditioning were sold in Australia br br br Engines br br The DS was originally designed around an air cooled flat six based on the design of the cylinder engine of the CV similar to the motor in the Porsche Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped br Thus for such a modern car the engine of the original DS was old fashioned It was derived from the engine of the CV Traction Avant models B and C It was an OHV four cylinder engine with three main bearings and wet liners and a bore of mm in and a stroke of mm in giving a volumetric displacement of cc The cylinder head had been reworked the C had a reverse flow cast iron cylinder head and generated hp kW at rpm by contrast the DS had an aluminium cross flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated hp kW at rpm br Like the Traction Avant the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine with the differential in between Thus some consider the DS to be a mid engine front wheel drive car br The DS and ID engines evolved throughout their year production run The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four cylinder engine The initial cc three main bearing engine carried forward from the Traction Avant of the DS was replaced in with the cc five bearing wet cylinder motor becoming the DS a called DS from September br br The DS was also introduced for model year This was a cc five main bearing engine power was hp DIN This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of Bosch electronic fuel injection for making the DS one of the first mass market cars to use electronic fuel injection Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time owing to the employment of larger inlet valves br Lastly saw the introduction of the cc hp kW hp engine of the DS in both carbureted and fuel injected forms The DS with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model producing hp kW SAE hp DIN br IDs and their variants went through a similar evolution generally lagging the DS by about one year ID saloon models never received the DS engine or fuel injection although the Break Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS engine when it was introduced supplemented the DS Break Familiale br The top of the range ID model The DSuper DP gained the DS engine the only model that this engine was retained in for the model year and it was mated to a five speed gearbox This should not be confused with the cc DSuper fitted with an optional low ratio five speed gearbox or with the previous DS M DJ five speed br br br In popular culture br President Charles de Gaulle survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit Clamart near Paris on August planned by Algerian War veteran Jean Marie Bastien Thiry The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns disable the vehicles and then close in for the kill De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured Citro n DS with saving his life the car riddled with bullets and with two tyres punctured was still able to escape at full speed Afterward De Gaulle vowed never to ride in any other make of car This event was accurately recreated in the film The Day of the Jackal br The Citro n DS D capotable Usine by Henri Chapron garnered publicity for the new model from its prominent film placement when Cary Grant himself telephoned the French automotive company Citro n to order a new car for use in the film That Touch of Mink br br br Legacy br br Citro n DS values have been rising a DS Injection Electronique Decapotable Chapron Convertible sold for US at Christie s R tromobile in February A similar car sold by Bonhams in February brought US On September a DS Decapotable Usine was sold by Bonhams for a hammer price of GB Bonhams sold another DS Decapotable on January for br Citro n was the featured exhibit at the Mullin Automotive Museum for the year and the DS made its first appearance on the lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d Elegance in br The DS s place in French society was demonstrated in Paris on October with a celebration of the th anniversary of its launch DS cars drove in procession past the Arc de Triomphe br In Groupe PSA created a new brand DS Automobiles intended as high quality high specification variations on existing models with differing mechanics and bodywork This brand was introduced in three models the DS DS and the DS The DS launched in March is based on Citro n s new C but is more customisable and unique bearing some resemblance to the original DS with its Shark Fin side pillar br br br Production figures br br br See also br Road Track magazine USA
