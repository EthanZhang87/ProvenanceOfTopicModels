Panhard was a French motor vehicle manufacturer that began as one of the first makers of automobiles It was a manufacturer of light tactical and military vehicles Its final incarnation now owned by Renault Trucks Defense was formed by the acquisition of Panhard by Auverland in and then by Renault in In Renault Trucks Defense ACMAT and Panhard combined under a single brand Arquus br br br History br Panhard was originally called Panhard et Levassor and was established as an automobile manufacturing concern by Ren Panhard mile Levassor and Belgian lawyer Edouard Sarazin in br br br Early years br Panhard et Levassor sold their first automobile in based on a Daimler engine license Levassor obtained his licence from Paris lawyer Edouard Sarazin a friend and representative of Gottlieb Daimler s interests in France Following Sarazin s death Daimler commissioned Sarazin s widow Louise to carry on her late husband s agency The Panhard et Levassor license was finalised by Louise who married Levassor in Daimler and Levassor became friends and shared improvements with one another br These first vehicles set many modern standards but each was a one off design They used a clutch pedal to operate a chain driven gearbox The vehicle also featured a front mounted radiator An Panhard et Levassor is credited with the first modern transmission For the Paris Rouen Rally Alfred Vacheron equipped his hp kW Panhard with a steering wheel believed to be one of the earliest employments of the principle br In the company built its first all Levassor design a state of the art model the Syst me Panhard consisted of four wheels a front mounted engine with rear wheel drive and a crude sliding gear transmission sold at francs It would remain the standard until Cadillac introduced synchromesh in This was to become the standard layout for automobiles for most of the next century The same year Panhard et Levassor shared their Daimler engine license with bicycle maker Armand Peugeot who formed his own car company br In cc cu in Panhard et Levassor vehicles finished first and second in the Paris Bordeaux Paris race one piloted solo by Levassor for hr However during the Paris Marseille Paris race Levassor was fatally injured due to a crash while trying to avoid hitting a dog and died in Paris the following year Arthur Krebs succeeded Levassor as General Manager in and held the job until He turned the Panhard et Levassor Company into one of the largest and most profitable manufacturers of automobiles before World War I br Panhards won numerous races from to Panhard et Levassor developed the Panhard rod which came to be used in many other types of automobiles as well br From Panhard worked to develop engines without conventional valves using under license the sleeve valve technology that had been patented by the American Charles Yale Knight Between and the Panhard Levassor catalogue listed plenty of models with conventional valve engines but these were offered alongside cars powered by sleeve valve power units Following various detailed improvements to the sleeve valve technology by Panhard s own engineering department from till all Panhard cars used sleeve valve engines br br br First World War br Under the presidency of Raymond Poincar which ran from till Panhard Levassor s CV and CV models were the official presidential cars br During the war Panhard like other leading automobile producers concentrated on war production including large numbers of military trucks V cylinder aero engines gun components and large and diameter shells br The military were also keen on the sleeve valve engined Panhard HP General Joffre himself used two HP Panhard Type X s with massive cylinder cc cu in engines for his personal transport and these were frequently to be seen by Parisians carrying military leaders between the front line and the lys e Palace br br br Inter war period br Following the return to peace in Panhard resumed passenger car production in March with the HP Panhard Type X which used a cylinder cc cu in engine This was followed three months later by three more cylinder models which will have been familiar to any customers whose memories pre dated the war but they now incorporated ungraded electrics and a number of other modifications For the th Paris Motor Show in October Panhard were displaying four models all with four cylinder engines as follows br br Panhard Type X cc HP br Panhard Type X cc HP br This replaced the HP Panhard Type for br Panhard Type X cc HP br Panhard Type X cc HP br By all Panhard s cars were powered by Knight sleeve valve engines that used steel sleeves The steel sleeves were thinner and lighter than the cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard sleeve valve engines since and this already gave rise to an improved friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds To reduce further the risk of engines jamming the outer sleeves which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves were coated on their inner sides with an anti friction material employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since This was one of several improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve valve engine concept br In a cc cu in model set the world record for the fastest hour run an average of km h mph br A surprise appeared on the Panhard stand at the th Paris Motor Show in October in the shape of the manufacturer s first six cylinder model since before the war The new Panhard CV Six came with a cc engine and sat on a mm in wheelbase At the show it was priced in bare chassis form at francs Of the nine models displayed for the model year seven featured four cylinder engines ranging in capacity from cc CV to cc CV and in price from francs to francs all in bare chassis form Also on show was an example of the cylinder cc CV Huit model which Panhard had offered since and which at the show was priced by the manufacturer in bare chassis form at francs br When Panhard presented their line up at the Paris Motor Show in October their last two four cylinder models had been withdrawn along with the CV six cylinder Type X Instead they concentrated on their S series cars designated Panhard CS and Panhard DS according to engine size and introduced a year earlier Publicity of the time indicated the S stood for Voitures surbaiss es cars having an underslung chassis but clearly captivated by the power of alliteration added that S also indicated cars that were souples sup rieures stables spacieuses silencieuses sans soupapes i e using valveless cylinders Four of the five Panhards exhibited featured increasingly lavish and pricey cylinder engined cars their engine sizes ranging from litres to litres There was also an cylinder L cu in Panhard Type X on display with a generous mm in wheelbase and listed even in bare chassis form at francs br Panhard et Levassor s last pre war car was the unusually styled monocoque Dynamic series first introduced in br Panhard et Levassor also produced railbuses including some for the metre gauge Chemin de fer du Finist re br br br Post World War II era br After World War II the company was renamed Panhard without Levassor and produced light cars such as the Dyna X Dyna Z PL CT and BT The company had long noted the weight advantages of aluminum and this as well as postwar government steel rationing designed to limit new car models to ensure an orderly return to production at the major firms encouraged the firm to proceed with the expensive alternative of making the bodies and several other components out of aluminum Thus the Dyna X and early Dyna Z series had aluminum bodies Unfortunately cost calculations by Jean Panhard the inheriting son and managing director of the firm failed to account for the extra cost of aluminum vs steel His calculations were made for the sheet metal panel area actually utilized per body shell and did not account for the scrap of each of the stampings making up the shell Once in production a re examination showed a cost of fr for aluminum shells and only fr for steel The use of aluminum had pushed the firm close to bankruptcy and a hurried engineering job returned the firm to steel Thus the later Dyna Z from mid September and the successor PL bodies were steel and the major stampings retained the heavier gauge intended for durability with aluminum so as to avoid complete replacement of the stamping dies br The air cooled flat twin engine of the Dyna was used by Georges Irat for his Voiture du Bled VdB off road vehicle built in Morocco in small numbers in the early s br Drawing inspiration from the Panhard Dynavia concept the styling of the Dyna Z was distinctively smooth and rounded with an emphasis on aerodynamics and an overall minimalist design The CT was a later from summer on stylish seater the BT being a version of the same with a longer wheelbase and space for four br For a period after the war the Panhard based Monopole racing cars received unofficial support from Panhard as did DB and other clients such as Robert Chancel using it to good effect in winning the Index of Performance class at Le Mans in and In Panhard moved on to a more direct involvement with Chancel which however came to an end after the deadly Le Mans In the latter half of the s and the early s the Deutsch Bonnet racers DB Panhard picked up this mantle and went on to dominate the Index of Performance as well as other small engine racing classes br The last Panhard passenger car was built in After assembling CV panel trucks for Citro n to utilize capacity during falling sales and raising operating cash by selling ownership progressively to Citro n respectively to its mother company Michelin full control as of in autumn of the civilian branch was absorbed by Citro n and the marque was retired From Panhard only made armored vehicles br In Panhard lost a competition to another manufacturer of military vehicles Auverland for the choice of the future PVP of the French Army This allowed Auverland to purchase Panhard then a subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citro n in However the fame of Panhard being greater it was decided to retain the name the PVP designed by Auverland would bear a Panhard badge br In October Renault Trucks Defense division of Swedish Volvo Group since finalized the acquisition of Panhard for million euros br Today the only use of the name Panhard is in the Panhard rod also called Panhard bar a suspension link invented by Panhard that provides lateral location of the axle This device has been widely used on other automobiles or as an aftermarket upgrade to rear axles for vintage American cars br br br Models br br br Panhard car models br br br Cars with Panhard technology br br br
