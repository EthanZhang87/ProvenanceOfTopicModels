title: Tell-tale (automotive)
id: 3541212
A tell tale sometimes called an idiot light or warning light is an indicator of malfunction or operation of a system indicated by a binary on off illuminated light symbol or text legend br The idiot light terminology arises from popular frustration with automakers use of lights for crucial functions which could previously be monitored by gauges so a troublesome condition could be detected and corrected early Such early detection of problems with for example engine temperature or oil pressure or charging system operation is not possible via an idiot light which lights only when a fault has already occurred thus providing no advance warnings or details of the malfunction s extent The Hudson automobile company was the first to use lights instead of gauges for oil pressure and the voltmeter starting in the mid s br br br Regulation br Automotive tell tales are regulated by automobile safety standards worldwide In the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard includes tell tales in its specifications for vehicle controls and displays In Canada the analogous Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard applies In Europe and throughout most of the rest of the world ECE Regulations specify various types of tell tales br br br Types br Different tell tales can convey different kinds of information One type lights or blinks to indicate a failure as of oil pressure engine temperature control charging current etc lighting and blinking indicate progression from warning to failure indication Another type lights to alert the need for specific service after a certain amount of time or distance has elapsed e g to change the oil br Colour may also communicate information about the nature of the tell tale for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving e g oil pressure Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer e g some British Fords of the s used green for oil pressure warning while many other makes of the same era used amber for oil pressure br br br Oil pressure br The oil pressure idiot light lights when engine oil pressure drops below a predetermined level The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on but the engine is not running as it detects no oil pressure due to the oil pump not operating the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft so only operates when the engine is running It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up oil pressure This tell tale can bear the legend oil or a pictogram of an oil can Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow depending on the action needed to be taken br br br Engine temperature EV battery temperature br The engine temperature tell tale is usually installed singly but has less commonly been installed in pairs A pair of lights indicate insufficient cold blue and excessive hot red engine temperature A single light usually indicates only an overheat condition in engine In electric cars it is usually to monitor the EV battery temperature and indicate the EV battery is overheating or is too cold to operate One example is in a Nissan Leaf EV br br br Malfunction indicator check engine hybrid EV system br br A malfunction indicator lamp MIL or check engine light CEL illuminates usually in red amber or yellow to indicate malfunction or a service requirement detected by the computerized engine management system It is found on the instrument console of most automobiles In the United States an MIL with specified functions is required by environmental protection regulations Unlike other types of idiot light an MIL does not correspond to a condition that would have been read out on a gauge br On vehicles equipped with OBD II the light has two stages it illuminates steadily to indicate a minor fault such as a loose gas cap or malfunction with the vehicle s emissions controls and it flashes when a severe condition is detected to alert the driver that continued driving may cause severe damage to the engine or catalytic converter emission control system br The MIL can present a legend such as check engine power limited engine or service engine soon or it also can present a pictogram of an engine br In hybrid and electric cars a fault with the hybrid EV system shows the pictogram of the vehicle with the exclamation point to indicate a fault with the electric motor and or hybrid EV battery in fuel cell cars it is also to determine a fault with the hydrogen fuel cell br br br Charging system br An idiot light can indicate that the vehicle s alternator or generator is not properly charging the battery The battery will then discharge disabling the car The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on but the engine is not running as it detects that no power is coming from the alternator the alternator is powered off the engine so only generates when the engine is running It subsequently extinguishes as soon as the engine starts and the alternator starts generating electricity This light presents a pictogram of a battery or it presents the legend amp or batt or gen br br br Trouble indicator br Some vehicles had a single indicator labeled trouble or engine this was not a Check Engine Light but a catch all warning light to indicate trouble that was serious enough to portend an imminent breakdown Early s Fords such as the LTD Crown Victoria without the instrument option had only this light which indicated low oil pressure overheating and carburetion problems without distinguishing among them This usage of the engine light was discontinued in the mid s to prevent confusion with the MIL br br br Brake br Many vehicles have a red tell tale to indicate that the parking brake is engaged or that there is a fault with the vehicle s braking system This tell tale in most cases bears the ISO symbols for a parking brake and for a braking system emergency In the past US regulations required this tell tale to bear the legend brake br Vehicles with anti lock braking system ABS have a lamp to indicate a detected failure br br br Tire Pressure br Tire pressure monitoring systems are often mandated by law As a cost saving measure individual readouts for each tire are often substituted with a single tell tale indicator for all tires br br br Other systems br Dashboard indicator lights or tell tales are provided for turn signals high beam transmission mode in automatic transmission vehicles and similar devices These indicate running status and are not an indication of a fault br As automobiles became increasingly complex more dashboard indicator lights have been added for the status of safety and convenience systems Lights can indicate many conditions including br br Low fuel charge or re fuel re charge Appears when vehicle s fuel tank is nearing empty Usually shaped like a gas dispenser or a light next to E on the fuel gauge and most later cars a buzzer In an EV when the battery runs low usually shaped with the EV charger symbol or the EV battery symbol and in most cases a buzzer or chime Sometimes a power low warning indicator is displayed usually shaped like a turtle with a outline circle when the EV battery is critically low In a plug in hybrid PHEV when the battery is depleted and vehicle runs low on fuel both indicators may show indicating to recharge and to refuel br Glowplugs operating or wait to start most diesel engines Appears when the engine is switched on to indicate the engine glow plugs are operating and the driver should wait for the light to extinguish before starting the engine Usually shaped like a coiled cord br Fasten driver or passenger seat belt usu with a buzzer Appears when the engine is switched and the driver s and or passenger s seat belt is not buckled A pressure sensor in the passenger seat prevents the passenger warning light from activating if the seat is unoccupied Usually shaped like a person wearing a seat belt br Traction control anti skid system operative br Low windshield washer fluid br Air bag system malfunction detected br Water in fuel most diesel engines br Door open usually indicated as door ajar or trunk lid open usually with a buzzer br Anti theft alarm engine immobilizer active most later cars br Speed radar detected br Automatic transmission fault br Low tire pressure br Modes of the heating air conditioning system defrost recirculation and others br Cruise control on shaped like a gauge with an arrow on the needle in most later cars br Autopilot self driving mode active br EV light hybrids PHEVs to determine if vehicle is in electric operation and engine shut off br Eco light newer cars indicates that vehicle is in efficient fuel saving operation br Eco comfort sport mode Driving modes to drive economically or for excitement br br br
