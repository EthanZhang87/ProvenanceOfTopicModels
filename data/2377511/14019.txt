Horsepower hp is a unit of measurement of power or the rate at which work is done usually in reference to the output of engines or motors There are many different standards and types of horsepower Two common definitions used today are the imperial horsepower which is about watts and the metric horsepower which is approximately watts br The term was adopted in the late th century by Scottish engineer James Watt to compare the output of steam engines with the power of draft horses It was later expanded to include the output power of other types of piston engines as well as turbines electric motors and other machinery The definition of the unit varied among geographical regions Most countries now use the SI unit watt for measurement of power With the implementation of the EU Directive EEC on January the use of horsepower in the EU is permitted only as a supplementary unit br br br History br br The development of the steam engine provided a reason to compare the output of horses with that of the engines that could replace them In Thomas Savery wrote in The Miner s Friend br br So that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses working together at one time in such a work can do and for which there must be constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same Then I say such an engine may be made large enough to do the work required in employing eight ten fifteen or twenty horses to be constantly maintained and kept for doing such a work br The idea was later used by James Watt to help market his improved steam engine He had previously agreed to take royalties of one third of the savings in coal from the older Newcomen steam engines This royalty scheme did not work with customers who did not have existing steam engines but used horses instead br Watt determined that a horse could turn a mill wheel times in an hour or times a minute The wheel was feet m in radius therefore the horse travelled feet in one minute Watt judged that the horse could pull with a force of pounds force N So br br br br br P br br br br W br t br br br br br br br F br d br br t br br br br br br br br br br lbf br br br br br br br br br br br br ft br br br

pounds J per minute and Tredgold suggested foot pounds J per minute Watt found by experiment in that a brewery horse could produce foot pounds J per minute James Watt and Matthew Boulton standardized that figure at foot pounds J per minute the next year br A common legend states that the unit was created when one of Watt s first customers a brewer specifically demanded an engine that would match a horse and chose the strongest horse he had and driving it to the limit In that legend Watt accepted the challenge and built a machine that was actually even stronger than the figure achieved by the brewer and the output of that machine became the horsepower br In R D Stevenson and R J Wassersug published correspondence in Nature summarizing measurements and calculations of peak and sustained work rates of a horse Citing measurements made at the Iowa State Fair they reported that the peak power over a few seconds has been measured to be as high as hp kW and also observed that for sustained activity a work rate of about hp kW per horse is consistent with agricultural advice from both the th and th centuries and also consistent with a work rate of about four times the basal rate expended by other vertebrates for sustained activity br When considering human powered equipment a healthy human can produce about hp kW briefly see orders of magnitude and sustain about hp kW indefinitely trained athletes can manage up to about hp kW briefly br and hp kW for a period of several hours The Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt produced a maximum of hp kW seconds into his second metre yd sprint

originally more or less directly related to the size of the engine but as of many countries changed over to systems based on CO emissions so are not directly comparable to older ratings The Citro n CV is named for its French fiscal horsepower rating deux chevaux CV br br br Electrical horsepower br Nameplates on electrical motors show their power output not the power input the power delivered at

the ft lb s definition One boiler horsepower is equal to the thermal energy rate required to evaporate pounds kg of fresh water at F C in one hour In the early days of steam use the boiler horsepower was roughly comparable to the horsepower of engines fed by the boiler br The term boiler horsepower was originally developed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in where the best steam engines of that period were tested The average steam consumption of those engines per output horsepower was determined to be the evaporation of pounds kg of water per hour based on feed water at F C and saturated steam generated at psi kPa This original definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of Btu h kW A few years later in the ASME re defined the boiler horsepower as the thermal output equal to the evaporation of pounds per hour of water from and at F C This considerably simplified boiler testing and provided more accurate comparisons of the boilers at that time This revised definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of Btu h kW Present industrial practice is to define boiler horsepower as a boiler thermal output equal to Btu h kW which is very close to the original and revised definitions br Boiler horsepower is still used to measure boiler output in industrial boiler engineering in the US Boiler horsepower is abbreviated BHP not to be confused with brake horsepower below which is also abbreviated bhp in lower case br br br Drawbar power br br Drawbar power dbp is the power a railway locomotive has available to haul a train or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one A special railway car called a dynamometer car coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the drawbar pull exerted and the speed From these the power generated can be calculated To determine the maximum power available a controllable load is required it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied in addition to a static load br If the drawbar force F is measured in pounds force lbf and speed v is measured in miles per hour mph then the drawbar power P in horsepower hp is br br br br br

British cars Many cars took their names from this figure hence the Austin Seven and Riley Nine while others had names such as hp which indicated the RAC figure followed by the true measured power br Taxable horsepower does not reflect developed horsepower rather it is a calculated figure based on the engine s bore size number of cylinders and a now archaic presumption of engine efficiency As new engines were designed with ever increasing efficiency it was no longer a useful measure but was kept in use by UK regulations which used the rating for tax purposes The United Kingdom was not the only country that used the RAC rating many states in Australia used RAC hp to determine taxation The RAC formula was sometimes applied in British colonies as well such as Kenya British East Africa br br br

is the number of cylinders br Since taxable horsepower was computed based on bore and number of cylinders not based on actual displacement it gave rise to engines with undersquare dimensions bore smaller than stroke which tended to impose an artificially low limit on rotational speed hampering the potential power output and efficiency of the engine br The situation persisted for several generations of four and six cylinder British engines For example Jaguar s litre XK engine of the s had six cylinders with a bore of mm in and a stroke of mm in where most American automakers had long since moved to oversquare large bore short stroke V engines See for example the early Chrysler Hemi engine br br br Measurement br The power of an engine may be measured or estimated at several points in the transmission of the power from its generation to its application A number of names are used for the power developed at various stages in this process but none is a clear indicator of either the measurement system or definition used br In general br br nominal horsepower is derived from the size of the engine and the piston speed and is only accurate at a steam pressure of kPa psi br indicated or gross horsepower is the theoretical capability of the engine PLAN br brake net crankshaft horsepower power delivered directly to and measured at the engine s crankshaft equals br indicated horsepower minus frictional losses within the engine bearing drag rod and crankshaft windage losses oil film drag etc br shaft horsepower power delivered to and measured at the output shaft of the transmission when present in the system equals br crankshaft horsepower minus frictional losses in the transmission bearings gears oil drag windage etc br effective true thp or commonly referred to as wheel horsepower whp equals br shaft horsepower minus frictional losses in the universal joint s differential wheel bearings tire and chain if present br All the above assumes that no power inflation factors have been applied to any of the readings br Engine designers use expressions other than horsepower to denote objective targets or performance such as brake mean effective pressure BMEP This is a coefficient of theoretical brake horsepower and cylinder pressures during combustion br br br Nominal horsepower br Nominal horsepower nhp is an early th century rule of thumb used to estimate the power of steam engines It assumed a steam pressure of psi kPa br Nominal horsepower area of piston in square inches equivalent piston speed in feet per minute br For paddle ships the Admiralty rule was that the piston speed in feet per minute was taken as stroke For screw steamers the intended piston speed was used br The stroke or length of stroke was the distance moved by the piston measured in feet br For the nominal horsepower to equal the actual power it would be necessary for the mean steam pressure in the cylinder during the stroke to be psi kPa and for the piston speed to be that generated by the assumed relationship for paddle ships br The French Navy used the same definition of nominal horse power as the Royal Navy br br br Indicated horsepower br Indicated horsepower ihp is the theoretical power of a reciprocating engine if it is completely frictionless in converting the expanding gas energy piston pressure displacement in the cylinders It is calculated from the pressures developed in the cylinders measured by a device called an engine indicator hence indicated horsepower As the piston advances throughout its stroke the pressure against the piston generally decreases and the indicator device usually generates a graph of pressure vs stroke within the working cylinder From this graph the amount of work performed during the piston stroke may be calculated br Indicated horsepower was a better measure of engine power than nominal horsepower nhp because it took account of steam pressure But unlike later measures such as shaft horsepower shp and brake horsepower bhp it did not take into account power losses due to the machinery internal frictional losses such as a piston sliding within the cylinder plus bearing friction transmission and gear box friction etc br br br Brake horsepower br Brake horsepower bhp is the power measured using a brake type load dynamometer at a specified location such as the crankshaft output shaft of the transmission rear axle or rear wheels br In Europe the DIN standard tests the engine fitted with all ancillaries and the exhaust system as used in the car The older American standard SAE gross horsepower referred to as bhp used an engine without alternator water pump and other auxiliary components such as power steering pump muffled exhaust system etc so the figures were higher than the European figures for the same engine The newer American standard referred to as SAE net horsepower tests an engine with all the auxiliary components see Engine power test standards below br Brake refers to the device which is used to provide an equal braking force load to balance or equal an engine s output force and hold it at a desired rotational speed During testing the output torque and rotational speed are measured to determine the brake horsepower Horsepower was originally measured and calculated by use of the indicator diagram a James Watt invention of the late th century and later by means of a Prony brake connected to the engine s output shaft Modern dynamometers use any of several braking methods to measure the engine s brake horsepower the actual output of the engine itself before losses to the drivetrain br br br Shaft horsepower br Shaft horsepower shp is the power delivered to a propeller shaft a turbine shaft or to an output shaft of an automotive transmission Shaft horsepower is a common rating for turboshaft and turboprop engines industrial turbines and some marine applications br Equivalent shaft horsepower eshp is sometimes used to rate turboprop engines It includes the equivalent power derived from residual jet thrust from the turbine exhaust pounds force N of residual jet thrust is estimated to be produced from one unit of horsepower br br br Engine power test standards br There exist a number of different standards determining how the power and torque of an automobile engine is measured and corrected Correction factors are used to adjust power and torque measurements to standard atmospheric conditions to provide a more accurate comparison between engines as they are affected by the pressure humidity and temperature of ambient air Some standards are described below br br br Society of Automotive Engineers SAE International br br br Early SAE horsepower br br In the early twentieth century a so called SAE horsepower was sometimes quoted for U S automobiles This long predates the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE horsepower measurement standards and was another name for the industry standard ALAM or NACC horsepower figure and the same as the British RAC horsepower also used for tax purposes Alliance for Automotive Innovation is the current successor of ALAM and NACC br br br SAE gross power br Prior to the model year American automakers rated and advertised their engines in brake horsepower bhp which was a version of brake horsepower called SAE gross horsepower because it was measured according to Society of Automotive Engineers SAE standards J and J that call for a stock test engine without accessories such as dynamo alternator radiator fan water pump and sometimes fitted with long tube test headers in lieu of the OEM exhaust manifolds This contrasts with both SAE net power and DIN standards which account for engine accessories but not transmission losses The atmospheric correction standards for barometric pressure humidity and temperature for SAE gross power testing were relatively idealistic br br br SAE net power br In the United States the term bhp fell into disuse in as automakers began to quote power in terms of SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE standard J Like SAE gross and other brake horsepower protocols SAE net hp is measured at the engine s crankshaft and so does not account for transmission losses However similar to the DIN standard SAE net power testing protocol calls for standard production type belt driven accessories air cleaner emission controls exhaust system and other power consuming accessories This produces ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is actually configured and sold br br br SAE certified power br In the SAE introduced SAE Certified Power with SAE J To attain certification the test must follow the SAE standard in question take place in an ISO certified facility and be witnessed by an SAE approved third party br A few manufacturers such as Honda and Toyota switched to the new ratings immediately The rating for Toyota s Camry L MZ FE V fell from to hp to kW The company s Lexus ES and Camry SE V L V were previously rated at hp kW but the ES dropped to hp kW while the Camry declined to hp kW The first engine certified under the new program was the L LS used in the Chevrolet Corvette Z Certified power rose slightly from to hp to kW br While Toyota and Honda are retesting their entire vehicle lineups other automakers generally are retesting only those with updated powertrains For example the Ford Five Hundred is rated at horsepower kW the same as that of model However the rating does not reflect the new SAE testing procedure as Ford is not going to incur the extra expense of retesting its existing engines Over time most automakers are expected to comply with the new guidelines br SAE tightened its horsepower rules to eliminate the opportunity for engine manufacturers to manipulate factors affecting performance such as how much oil was in the crankcase engine control system calibration and whether an engine was tested with high octane fuel In some cases such can add up to a change in horsepower ratings br br br Deutsches Institut f r Normung DIN br DIN is a German DIN standard for measuring road vehicle horsepower DIN hp is measured at the engine s output shaft as a form of metric horsepower rather than mechanical horsepower Similar to SAE net power rating and unlike SAE gross power DIN testing measures the engine as installed in the vehicle with cooling
