An inboard motor is a marine propulsion system for boats As opposed to an outboard motor where an engine is mounted outside the hull of the craft an inboard motor is an engine enclosed within the hull of the boat usually connected to a propulsion screw by a br driveshaft br In international shipping the marine diesel engines are the largest most powerful engines ever produced br br br History br br The first marine craft to utilize inboard motors were steam engines going back to and the Clermont and the Charlotte Dundas Harbour tugs and small steam launches had br inboard steam engines In the s the naphtha engine made its appearance and a few boat engines appeared Such engines had low power and high fuel consumption The gasoline petrol engine pioneer Gottlieb Daimler and Maybach built a four cycle boat engine and tested it in on the Neckar River Sintz in America built several commercially available engines from br br br Sizes br Inboard motors may be of several types suitable for the size of craft they are fitted to Boats can use one cylinder to v engines depending if they are used for racing or trolling br br br Small craft br For pleasure craft such as sailboats and speedboats diesel gasoline and electric engines are used Many inboard motors are derivatives of automobile engines known as marine automobile engines The advent of the stern drive propulsion leg improved design so that auto engines could easily power boats br br br Large craft br For larger craft including ships where outboard propulsion would in any case not be suitable the propulsion system may include many types such as diesel gas turbine or even fossil fuel or nuclear generated steam Some early models used coal for steam driven ships br The largest engines in the world are marine diesel engines used to power supertankers and container ships E g the W rtsil RT flex C produces horsepower weighs tons stands feet tall is feet long and has a maximum of rpm br br br Cooling br Some inboard motors are freshwater cooled while others have a raw water cooling system where water from the lake river or sea is pumped by the engine to cool it br However as seawater is corrosive and can damage engine blocks and cylinder heads some seagoing craft have engines which are indirectly cooled via heat exchanger in a keel cooler Other engines notably small single and twin cylinder diesels specifically designed for marine use use raw seawater for cooling and zinc sacrificial anodes are employed to protect the internal metal castings br br br
