id: 499365
Boat building is the design and construction of boats instead of the larger ships and their on board systems This includes at minimum the construction of a hull with any necessary propulsion mechanical navigation safety and other service systems as the craft requires br The boat building industry provides for the design manufacturing repair and modification of human powered watercrafts sailboats motorboats airboats and submersibles and caters for various demands from recreational e g launches dinghies and yachts commercial e g tour boats ferry boats and lighters residential houseboats to professional e g fishing boats tugboats lifeboats and patrol boats br br br Construction materials and methods br br br Wood br Wood is the traditional boat building material used for hull and spar construction It is buoyant widely available and easily worked It is a popular material for small boats of e g metre ft length such as dinghies and sailboats Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood Woods such as teak totara and some cedars have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods such as Pinus radiata will rot very quickly The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as oak while planking can be oak but is more often softwood such as pine larch or cedar br Plywood is especially popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used Cheap construction plywood often has voids in the interior layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and or a good paint system Varnish and Linseed oil should not be used on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing Varnish has about of the water resistance of a good paint system Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire A valuable year old waka Maori canoe caught fire in New Zealand in June when restorers left rags piled overnight Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil More recently introduced tropical woods as mahogany okoum iroko Keruing azob and merbau are also used With tropical species extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed FSC certified Teak or iroko is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure Glue screws rivets and or nails are used to join the wooden components Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner otherwise the joint will fail br Traditional wood construction techniques can be classified into the shell first method also called planking first and the frame first method With shell first the form of the hull is determined by joining shaped planks that are fastened together followed by reinforcing the structure with the frames or ribs that are fitted to the inside With frame first the hull shape is established by setting up the frames on the keel and then fastening the planking on the outside br Some types of wood construction include br br Carvel in which a smooth hull is formed by edge joined planks attached to a frame The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail br Clinker is a planking first technique originally identified with the Scandinavians and Ingveonic people in which wooden planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit The planks are mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets bent over iron nails screws or in modern boats with adhesives Often steam bent wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull br Strip planking is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks br Sheet plywood boat building uses sheets of plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines inwhales sheer clamps or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the stitch and glue method where pre shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame Metal or plastic ties nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three dimensional curved shapes These hulls generally have one or more chines Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated WBP which stands for water and boiled proof or more usually BS Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS which does not meet international standards Specifically they say outer plies are too thin should be mm or in minimum or are very thin less than mm or in or high grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores Most high grade marine Okoume Gaboon ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores Often the stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear In Australia and New Zealand a higher grade marine ply than BS is AS It requires both faces to be A quality with even thickness plies The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained very smooth moderately light at kg m or lb cu ft it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about heavier than genuine poplar cored BS Okoume Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F indicating high strength Meranti Lauan ply has a stress rating of F and Okoume ply F Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders and many dinghies such as the Vaurien Cherub Tolman Moth and P class ply on frame construction and FJs FDs and Kolibris stitch and glue method have been built from it Another variation is tortured ply where very thin mm or in and flexible often Okoume preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used This method is mainly confined to kayaks br Cold moulding is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood called veneers oriented in different directions resulting in a strong monocoque structure similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers Sometimes just veneers are used Cold moulding is popular in small medium and very large wooden super yachts Using different types of wood the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high stress areas Sometimes cold moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance especially when lightweight soft timber such as cedar is used This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape Cold moulded refers to a type of building one off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at degree angles to the centerline This method is often called double diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended each occurring at opposing degree angles The hot moulded method of building boats which used ovens to heat and cure the resin has not been widely used since World War II and now almost all curing is done at room temperature br Lashed lug is a boat building techniques of the Austronesian peoples It is characterized by the use of sewn holes and later dowels treenails to stitch planks edge to edge The planks are further lashed together and onto ribs with fiber ropes wrapped around protruding carved lugs on the inside surfaces This is a shell first or planking first method of construction The seams between planks are also sealed with absorbent tapa bark and fiber that expands when wet or caulked with resin based preparations br br br Metal br br br Iron and steel br Either used in sheet or alternatively plate for all metal hulls or for isolated structural members It is strong but heavy despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less It is generally about heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than polyester The material rusts unless protected from water this is usually done by means of a covering of paint Modern steel components are welded or bolted together As the welding can be done very easily with common welding equipment and as the material is very cheap it is a popular material with amateur builders Also amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for DIY construction kits If steel is used a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull It is applied after sandblasting which is required to have a cleaned surface and before painting The painting is usually done with lead paint Pb O Optionally the covering with the zinc layer may be left out but it is generally not recommended Zinc anodes also need to be placed on the ship s hull Until the mid s steel sheets were riveted together br br br Aluminum br Aluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all metal hulls or for isolated structural members Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after It is the lightest material for building large boats being lighter than polyester and lighter than steel Aluminium is relatively cheap in comparison with wood or steel in most countries In addition it is relatively easy to cut bend and weld Galvanic corrosion below the waterline in salt water is a serious concern particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts pontoon and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France br br br Cupronickel br A relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is cupronickel Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls cupronickel is reasonably tough highly resistant to corrosion in seawater and is because of its copper content a very effective antifouling metal Cupronickel may be found on the hulls of premium tugboats fishing boats and other working boats and may even be used for propellers and propeller shafts br br br Fiberglass br Fiberglass glass reinforced plastic or GRP is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich cored type in which a core of balsa foam or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould but before the inner skin is laid This is similar to the next type composite but is not usually classified as composite since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength It does however increase stiffness which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould with fibreglass and resin applied by hand hand lay up method Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin but takes special materials and more technical knowledge Older fibreglass boats before were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination The name comes from the multitude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather br br br Composite material br Composite construction involves a variety of composite materials and methods an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron Sheet copper anti fouling copper bottomed could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised Fast cargo vessels once were copper bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls the term composite applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass When a hull is being created in a female mould the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a thermosetting plastic usually epoxy polyester or vinylester and some kind of fiber cloth fiberglass kevlar dynel carbon fiber etc These methods can give strength to weight ratios approaching that of aluminum while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills br br br Ferrocement br br First developed in the mid th century in both France and Holland ferrocement was also used for the D Day Mulberry harbours After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the s ferro building has since declined br Ferrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull although unsuitable for commercial mass production A steel and iron armature is built to the exact shape of the hull ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting Then on a single day the cement is applied by a team of plasterers The cement sand ratio is a very rich As the hull thickness is typically to cms ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about metres LOA as there is a weight penalty above that length there is no penalty Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish In the s and s particularly in Australia and New Zealand the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford not anticipating that the fitting out costs of a larger boat can be crippling br The advantages of a ferro hull are br br cannot burn rot or rust no osmosis br good insulation cool in summer warm in winter br tougher than GRP and almost as tough as a steel vessel and if damaged easily repaired almost anywhere in the world br properly built a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull br they may be cheap to buy see disadvantages below br The disadvantages are br br many home built ferro boats are lumpy overweight and ugly br some early builders realising that their creation proved to be disappointing scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance br accordingly ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure br See also concrete ship concrete canoe br br br Hull types br br There are many hull types and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat s intended purpose For example a sea going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals Hull types include br br Smooth curve hull these are rounded and free of chines or corners br Chined hulls these hulls have flat panels typically plywood which meet at a sharp angle known as the chine Chined hulls range from simple flat bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about degrees such as banks dories and sharpies to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat Multi chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape br Flat bottomed hull flat bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non tidal rivers They are often shallow draft and may operate in shallower water They are cheap to build but being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability they are unsuitable for sea going vessels However large ships are almost always flat bottomed having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat bottomed boats br Displacement hulls a displacement hull always remains partly submerged Such a hull has a maximum hull speed which is a function of its waterline length An exception is the catamaran whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave br Planing hulls planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases Sail boats that plane are typical V shaped at the bows and flat bottomed aft Hydroplanes are very light flat bottomed high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water but they become unstable in rough water Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V bottomed with a deadrise angle of about degrees The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are Planing hulls need sufficient power to reach the plane after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption br br br Glossary br br Anchor a device for holding a boat to the seabed typically with chain and rope Traditional anchors include the fisherman Danforth and plough types such as the CQR and Delta Recently far more effective anchors with more reliable holding include the Rocna and the Ultra both of which are spade anchors
