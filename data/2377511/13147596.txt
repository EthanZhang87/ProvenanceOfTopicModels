A V engine is an eight cylinder piston engine in which two banks of four cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration br br br Origins br br The first known V was the Antoinette designed by L on Levavasseur and built in by the French Antoinette company for use in speedboat racing cars and later airplanes br br Also in V engines began small scale production by Renault and Buchet for use in race cars br br br Design br br br V angle br br Most engines use a V angle the angle between the two banks of cylinders of degrees This angle results in good engine balance which results in low vibrations However the downside is the greater width of the engine compared to those that use a smaller V angle br V engines with a degree V angle were used in the Ford Taurus SHO the Volvo XC and the Volvo S The Ford engine used a degree V angle because it was based on a V engine with a degree V angle Both the Ford and Volvo engines were used in transverse engine chassis which were designed for a front wheel drive layout with an on demand all wheel drive system in the case of the Volvos To reduce the vibrations caused by the unbalanced degree V angle the Volvo engines used a balance shaft and offset split crankpins The Rolls Royce Meteorite tank engine also used a degree V angle since it was derived from the degree V Rolls Royce Meteor which in turn was based on the Rolls Royce Merlin V engine br Other V angles have been used occasionally The Lancia Trikappa Lancia Dilambda and Lancia Astura produced used narrow angle V engines based on the Lancia V engine with V angles of degrees The Miller four wheel drive racing cars used a V engine with a V angle of degrees The cylinder versions of the through EMD diesel locomotive engine also used a V angle of degrees br br br Crankshaft configuration br br br Cross plane crankshaft br br Most V engines fitted to road cars use a cross plane crankshaft since this configuration produces less vibration due to the perfect primary balance and secondary balance The cross plane crankshaft has the four crank pins numbered from the front at angles of and degrees which results in a cross shape for the crankshaft when it is viewed from one end br The rumbling exhaust sound produced by a typical cross plane V engine is partly due to the uneven firing order within each of the two banks of four cylinders A usual firing order of L R L L R L R R or R L R R L R L L results in uneven intake and exhaust pulse spacing for each bank When separate exhaust systems are used for each bank of cylinders this uneven pulsing results in the rumbling sound typically associated with V engines However racing engines seek to avoid these uneven exhaust pressure pulses to maximize the power output The s cross plane V racing engines used long primary exhaust pipes such as the Ford GT endurance racing car or located the exhaust ports on the inside of the V angle such as the Lotus IndyCar to link the exhaust systems from each bank and provide even exhaust gas pulses br br br Flat plane crankshaft br A flat plane crankshaft configuration provides two benefits Mechanically the crankshaft can be machined from a flat billet and does not require counterweights so it is lighter However it produces more vibration due to a secondary imbalance Most early V road car engines also used a flat plane crankshaft since this was simpler to design and build than a cross plane crankshaft Early flat plane V engines included the De Dion Bouton engine the Peerless engine and the Cadillac engine A flat plane crankshaft is used by many V engines fitted to racing cars br From the gas dynamics aspect the flat plane crankshaft allows for even exhaust gas pulses to be achieved with a simple exhaust system The design was popularized in motor racing by the Coventry Climax FWMV Formula One engine and the Cosworth DFV engine was highly successful in Formula One Several production sports cars have used flat plane V engines such as every Ferrari V model from the Ferrari GT to the present Ferrari F Tributo the Lotus Esprit V the Porsche Spyder and the McLaren MP C br br br Automobile use br The first V engine used in a road going car was the Rolls Royce built in the United Kingdom This model was initially equipped with a L cu in V engine However only three cars were made before Rolls Royce reverted to using straight six engines for their cars br In the Hewitt Touring Car became the first car built in the United States with a V engine The engine was designed and built by Edward R Hewitt who emphasized the V s superiority to the typical I and I and six cylinder engines of the time because of its lower weight and easier to make crankshaft compared to the I s of equal power as well as the V not taking much more space than a I br The De Dion Bouton built in France is considered to be the first V engine produced in significant quantities br The Cadillac L head V engine is considered the first road going V engine to be mass produced in significant quantities with sold the first year This engine was built in the United States and was greatly assisted by Cadillac s pioneering use of electric starter motors br The popularity of V engines in cars was significantly increased following the introduction of the Ford Flathead V br By the early st century the use of V engines in passenger vehicles declined as automobile manufacturers opted for more fuel efficient lower capacity engines or hybrid and electric drivetrains br br br Size layout and classification br The displacement of modern V engines is typically from to L to cu in However larger and smaller examples have been produced such as the L cu in V engine used in the Cadillac Eldorado and BMW s L cu in M B V engine found in cars such as the BMW E i V engines intended for motorsport are often small and short stroke to maximize RPMs and thus power The Cosworth DFV L cu in is such an engine br Due to its large external dimensions V engines are typically used in cars that use a longitudinal engine layout and rear wheel drive or all wheel drive However V engines have also occasionally been used in transverse engine front wheel drive vehicles sometimes using closer cylinder bore spacings and narrower cylinder bank angles to reduce their space requirements br The classification of big block or small block refers to the engine s external dimensions and does not necessarily indicate the actual engine displacement Engines with displacements from to L to cu in have been classified as both small block and big block depending on the particular manufacturer s range of engines br br br Motorsport br br V engines have been used in many forms of motorsport from Formula One IndyCar and NASCAR circuit racing to Top Fuel drag racing br br Formula One br Among the first V Formula One cars to compete were the AFM entry and the Lancia D with a development of the latter powering Juan Manuel Fangio s car to victory in the driver s championship The L Formula One era of included V engines from Ferrari Coventry Climax British Racing Motors BRM and Automobili Turismo e Sport ATS The driver s championships for the and seasons were won by drivers of V powered cars br From through the top three manufacturers in each season s Constructor s Championship all predominantly used V engines in their cars In the engine capacity limits were increased to L cu in or litres with a supercharger and both the and Constructor s Championships were won by cars powered by the Brabham Repco V engine br From until the Cosworth DFV V engine dominated Formula One racing During this time the Manufacturers Championship was won by Cosworth DFV powered cars every season except and which cylinder Ferraris won After a long period of dominance the Cosworth DFV was eventually outpaced by turbocharged straight four and V engines br The next period of significant V usage in Formula One was from to when the rules mandated use of L cu in naturally aspirated V engines with regular power outputs between and hp in order to reduce the power outputs being achieved by the previous litre V engines These were replaced by litre turbocharged V engines for the and later seasons br br NASCAR br V engines have dominated American premier stock car racing NASCAR series since its inaugural season However there wasn t a strict ruleset to follow until the season when engines were no longer allowed to be any bigger than cu in L for the purpose of reducing speeds caused by the rapid aerodynamic advancements from to br br Drag racing br In the American Top Fuel class of drag racing V engines displacing cu in L today produce outputs of over kW hp and N m lb ft The engines used in Top Fuel and Funny car drag racing are typically based on the aluminium conversion Chrysler Hemi engine and run on highly explosive nitromethane fuel br br Land speed record racing br The world s fastest non jet powered i e piston engine powered wheeled land vehicle the Speed Demon which achieved a speed of mph in is powered by a V engine based on the Chevrolet small block engine design br br br Automobile use by country br br br Australia br br The first Australian designed car to use a V engine was the Chrysler Valiant AP which was available with an American built L cu in Chrysler engine The first locally designed V Ford was the Ford Falcon XR and the first V Holden was the Holden HK both using engines supplied by their parent companies in the United States br The first V engine to be mass produced in Australia was the Holden V engine This cast iron overhead valve engine used a V angle of degrees and was built in displacements of L cu in and L cu in the latter being de stroked to L cu in in The Holden V engine was used in various models including the Kingswood Monaro Torana Commodore and Statesman Versions tuned for higher performance were sold by Holden Dealer Team and Holden Special Vehicles including versions stroked to up to L cu in The Holden V engine was also used in touring car racing and formed the basis of the Repco Holden engine used in Formula racing In the Holden V engine began to be replaced by the imported General Motors LS V engine br In Ford Australia began local production of the Ford Cleveland V an overhead valve cast iron engine The engine was produced in displacements of L cu in and L cu in for use in the Australian Ford Falcon and Ford Fairlane models It was also used in several low volume DeTomaso sports cars and luxury sedans built in Italy Australian production ceased in when Ford Australia temporarily stopped production of V cars From until the Ford Falcon was available with the imported Ford Windsor Ford Barra or Ford Modular V engines the latter was marketed as Boss and locally assembled from a mix of imported and local parts br A L cu in version of the Rover V engine was produced in Australia for the ill fated Leyland P sedan The engine had an overhead valve design and was the only all aluminum engine made in Australia br br br China br The Hongqi CA was a luxury car of which approximately were built for government officials It was powered by a L cu in Chrysler LA engine and built on the chassis of a s Chrysler Imperial br br br Czech Republic br br The Tatra rear engined sedan was initially powered by L cu in petrol V which was air cooled and used an overhead camshaft that operated the valves using a walking beam rocker arrangement This model line continued until when the Tatra ended production br Tatra also produced diesel V truck engines from the Tatra to the present day Tatra br br br France br French manufacturers were pioneering in their use of V engines in the early s with the Antoinette aircraft engine the first known V engine and the De Dion Bouton However there were few French automotive V engines in the following decades with manufacturers such as Delage Delahaye Talbot Lago Bugatti and Hotchkiss using six cylinder or straight eight engines instead br From until Matford Ford s French subsidiary later renamed to Ford SAF produced cars with V engines closely based on contemporary American Ford models Simca purchased the Ford SAF in and continued to produce various models powered by the Ford Flathead V until br After WW France imposed very steep tax horsepower charges the owners of cars with engines above L were financially penalized so France had a small domestic market for larger engined cars such as the V Despite this Facel Vega produced luxury and sports cars powered by Chrysler V engines from through br br br Germany br br One of the first German V engines was the Argus As aircraft engine This engine was air cooled used an inverted V design and was used in several training surveillance and communications airplanes br From until the Horch luxury cars were powered by V engines sold alongside Horch s larger straight eight engines Shortly after the Stoewer Greif V was powered by a L cu in V engine br BMW s first V engine was the BMW OHV V engine a petrol engine with overhead valves and all aluminum construction The company resumed production of V engines in with the BMW M aluminum double overhead camshaft engine and V engines have remained in production until today BMW s first turbocharged V engine was the M twin turbocharged diesel engine The first turbocharged V petrol engine from BMW was the present BMW N engine br Their first eight cylinder engine since passenger car and motorsport straight eight engine production stopped in and respectively Mercedes Benz began production of the Mercedes Benz M petrol V engine in and has continued production of V engines to the present day The M had a single overhead camshaft a cast iron block and an aluminium head Supercharging was first used on the Mercedes Benz M engine in and turbocharging was first used on non commercial diesel V engines in with the OM and on petrol engines with the M engine in br Porsche s first road car to use a V engine was the Porsche coupe Its first to use a V diesel engine was the second generation Cayenne S Diesel in br Audi s first road car to use a V engine was the Audi V luxury sedan Its first model to use a V diesel engine was the D A TDI in br br br Italy br Alfa Romeo br The first V engined Alfa Romeo road car was the Alfa Romeo Stradale mid engined sports car of which were produced This was followed by the Alfa Romeo Montreal front engined sports car The engines for both cars are based on the degree V engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo racing car and have double overhead camshafts and a dry sump The Stradale engine has a displacement of L cu in and a flat plane crankshaft while the Montreal uses an engine enlarged to L cu in and uses a cross plane crankshaft br The Alfa Romeo C Competizione Spider sports cars are powered by a L cu in version of the Ferrari F engine with a cross plane crankshaft br br Ferrari br br Ferrari s first contact with V engines was the Vittorio Jano designed Lancia Ferrari D a Formula One racing car that the company acquired as part of its purchase of Lancia s Formula One racing department The first Ferrari developed V engines were used in the Ferrari SP and Ferrari SP sports prototype racing cars designed by Carlo Chiti This engine had a single overhead camshaft and was rear mounted in the vehicles br The company s first V road car was the Dino GT mid engined sports car The engine is a degree all aluminum V with double overhead camshafts In the L cu in engine in the Ferrari GT became the smallest production V engine ever produced The model lineage of mid engined V road cars continues to the present Ferrari F Tributo br Five valve per cylinder versions were used from until in the Ferrari F and Ferrari Turbocharging was introduced on the Ferrari GTO flagship car and the range of entry level mid engined sports cars switched to turbocharging with the Ferrari br The Formula One team resumed using V engines for the seasons beginning with the Ferrari F br br Maserati br br The first Maserati V road car was the Maserati GT luxury coupe of which only cars were produced The GT used a L cu in overhead camshaft engine derived from the Maserati S racing car Developments of this engine were used in the Maserati Quattroporte I luxury sedan the Maserati Ghibli the Maserati Bora seat coupe and several other models br The Maserati Shamal coupe introduced a L cu in turbocharged V engine based on the existing Maserati Biturbo V This engine was later replaced by the naturally aspirated L cu in Ferrari F V engine beginning with the Maserati Coup Spyder br br Other Italian manufacturers br During the s and s Lancia produced a line of range topping luxury cars powered by V engines the Lancia Trikappa the Lancia Dilambda and the Lancia Astura The engines ranged in displacement from L cu in and used unusually narrow V angles of to degrees with a single overhead camshaft In the s an engine derived from Ferrari s V engine was transverse mounted in the Lancia Thema br The only Fiat car to use a V engine was the Fiat V of which approximately were produced The L cu in pushrod engine used an all aluminium construction and an unusual V angle of degrees Fiat also began production of V diesel truck engines for the Des initially in the naturally aspirated form before switching to turbocharging in the mid s br Lamborghini s V powered models are the Lamborghini Urraco coupe Lamborghini Silhouette seat convertible and Lamborghini Jalpa seat convertible The present Lamborghini Urus SUV uses a Volkswagen Group turbocharged V engine br br br Japan br br Japanese manufacturers have not been significant producers of V engines for passenger cars due to Japanese government road tax regulations that impose higher charges for engines that exceed L cu in However several passenger cars have been produced with V engines for consumers and for use in motor racing br br Honda br Honda has never produced V engines for passenger vehicles In the late s the company resisted considerable pressure from its American dealers for a V engine with American Honda reportedly sending one dealer a shipment of V vegetable juice to silence them The only Honda car sold with a V engine was the Honda Crossroad SUV which was a rebadged Land Rover Discovery Series I fitted with the Rover V engine br In motor racing the Honda Indy V was produced for the IndyCar racing series and was the control engine for the through seasons The engine was a L cu in all aluminium V with double overhead camshafts with a power output of hp kW PS and a rpm redline The Honda Racing F Team used L V engines which produced around kW hp at rpm as mandated by Formula One regulations br br Mitsubishi br From to Mitsubishi briefly sold the Mitsubishi A engine which was a L cu in all aluminium V engine with double overhead camshafts and direct injection The engine was fitted to the Mitsubishi Proudia luxury sedan and Mitsubishi Dignity limousine however financial pressures forced the company to discontinue sales of both these vehicles after only fifteen months br br Nissan br The Nissan Y engine is Nissan s first V engine which uses a pushrod design and had a displacement of L cu in Its primary use was in the Nissan President limousine The Y engine was replaced by the Nissan VH engine which is an all aluminum construction with double overhead camshafts and displacements of L cu in This was replaced by the Nissan VK engine in which remains in production today The VK engine is an all aluminium construction with double overhead camshafts and displacements of L cu in br br Toyota br The first mass produced Japanese V engine was the Toyota V engine introduced in the Toyota Crown Eight luxury car The Toyota V engine was an all aluminum construction used a pushrod valvetrain and was produced until The Toyota UZ engine has double overhead camshafts and was made from until while the Toyota UR engine added direct injection and has been in production since br From to the Toyota Racing Formula One team cars were powered by L cu in naturally aspirated V engines as mandated by the Formula One rules These Toyota engines were rated to produce kW hp at rpm kW hp at rpm for and were also used by the Williams Midland and Jordan teams br br br Korea br Hyundai s first passenger car V engine was the Hyundai Omega engine which was based on the Mitsubishi A engine see above The Omega engine was replaced by the Hyundai Tau engine which is an all aluminium construction with double overhead camshafts and has been produced from to the present br br br Sweden br Volvo developed the B V engine in which was intended to be used in the planned Volvo Philip car The project was canceled but the engine has been used in trucks since br Koenigsegg initially used twin supercharged versions of the Ford Modular V engine in its Koenigsegg CC S and Koenigsegg CCR The company switched to its twin supercharged engine for the Koenigsegg CCX A twin turbocharged V engine was introduced in the Koenigsegg Agera and has been used on all models

construction with double overhead camshafts and was used in several models until when the Virage model was discontinued br Production of V engined Aston Martin cars resumed in with a new generation of the Vantage powered by the Jaguar AJ V naturally aspirated V engine Since Aston Martin has switched to the Mercedes Benz M turbocharged V engine beginning with the DB model br br McLaren br Every McLaren road car since the brand s relaunch has been powered by the McLaren M T twin turbocharged V engine which was introduced in the McLaren C then called the MP C coupe This engine is an all aluminium construction with double overhead camshafts and a flat plane crankshaft br br Rolls Royce br br The first V engine produced in the United Kingdom was fitted to the Rolls Royce of which three cars were made This engine used a side valve design a V angle of degrees and had a displacement of L cu in br Mass production of V engines began in with the release of the Rolls Royce Bentley L series V engine in the Rolls Royce Silver Cloud II the Rolls Royce Phantom IV and the Bentley S This engine is an all aluminium construction with a pushrod valvetrain and a V angle of degrees It has been produced in displacements of L cu in with a twin turbocharged version introduced in The L series V engine remains in production in the Bentley Mulsanne luxury sedan br br Rover br Rover began

Jaguar AJ V engine br br Other U K manufacturers br The Daimler V engine was introduced in the Daimler SP sports car and was produced until This engine has an iron block an alloy cylinder head and a pushrod drivetrain that was built in displacements of L cu in br The Jaguar AJ V engine Jaguar s first V engine for road cars has been in production since This engine is an all aluminium construction with double overhead camshafts It has been produced in both naturally aspirated and supercharged configurations br Land Rover and Range Rover produced vehicles fitted with the Rover V naturally aspirated petrol engine the Ford TDV turbocharged diesel engine the BMW M naturally aspirated petrol engine and N twin turbo petrol V from the Jaguar AJ V from petrol engine in both naturally aspirated and supercharged configurations from present and the Ford Turbo Diesel engine from current br The Triumph V was used solely for the Triumph Stag coupe This engine had a cast iron block an aluminium cylinder head single overhead camshafts and a displacement of L cu in br The TVR Speed Eight engine was used in the Cerbera road cars and the Tuscan Challenge racing cars This engine had an all aluminium construction single overhead camshafts a flat plane crankshaft and an unusual V angle of degrees br br br United States br br The first automotive V engine to reach production was the Cadillac L Head engine introduced in the Type model The L head had an alloy crankcase a single iron casting for each cylinder block and head side valves a flat plane crankshaft and a displacement of L cu in An electric starter motor was used eliminating the large engines being difficult to start with hand cranking br The Cadillac engine was followed by a V model from Peerless using an engine manufactured by an amusement park manufacturer in br The first American V production engine with overhead valves a pushrod engine was used by the Chevrolet Series D This engine used a counterweighted crankshaft a detachable crossflow cylinder head and had a displacement of L cu in Production of the Series D models ended in br The Cadillac Type V was powered by the first American V to use a cross plane crankshaft which reduced vibrations A year later Peerless also introduced a cross plane crankshaft V Other manufacturers producing V engines by the mid s included Lincoln Ferro Northway supplier to Cadillac Cole Indianapolis and Mississippi Perkins Detroit Murray Vernon and Yale br A significant development in providing V engines in more affordable cars was the through Ford Flathead V The Flathead V reduced production costs by using a monobloc or en bloc construction where each cylinder bank is made from a single piece of cast metal The engine was fitted to the low cost Ford Model car offering superior performance to its competitors br Demand for larger cars increased in the years following World War II and the wider bodies were well suited to the fitment of V engines This led to many manufacturers introducing overhead valve V engines such as the Oldsmobile Rocket engine the Cadillac engine the Chrysler Firepower engine the Studebaker s V engine the Buick Nailhead engine the Chevrolet small block engine the Lincoln Y block V engine the Pontiac V engine and the AMC Rambler engine br br Engine displacements grew with the expanding size of full size cars through the s to mid s This led to big block engines such as br br L cu in Lincoln Y block engine released in for the model year br L cu in Pontiac Super Duty engine released in for the model year br L cu in Chrysler Hemi engine released in for the model year br L cu in Ford FE engine released in for the model year br L cu in Chevrolet big block engine released in for the model year br Big block engines reached their zenith with the L cu in Cadillac engine used in the Cadillac Eldorado coupe During the s due to the oil crises and the gradual tightening of emission standards big block V s were affected As a result their use in passenger cars decreased as manufacturers began to phase them out for more efficient designs br Before the late s sharing engines between General Motors divisions was uncommon This enabled each division to have its unique engine character but made for much duplication of effort The company has since implemented the sharing of engines across divisions however some divisions such as Cadillac still maintain some engines specific to their division Ford and Chrysler had fewer divisions and favored brand specific shared designs br In GM built its millionth unit of the Chevrolet small block engine making that engine family the most produced V engine in the world br American manufacturers continue to produce large displacement V engines despite the strategy of downsizing engines often in conjunction with turbocharging being adopted by many European and Asian manufacturers These engines continued to use pushrod overhead valve valvetrains long after most overseas engines had switched to dual overhead camshaft designs Examples include the L cu in Chrysler Apache engine produced from present the L cu in Ford Godzilla engine produced from present and the L cu in GM L T engine produced from present br American manufacturers have concurrently produced more modern DOHC engines such as the Chevrolet Gemini small block engine Cadillac s turbocharged Cadillac Blackwing V and the Ford Modular V br br br Vietnam br In Vietnam VinFast used a V engine in the full size SUV VinFast President from December br br br Airplane use br br Several early aircraft engines used a V configuration such as the French Antoinette engine and Buchet engines The version of the Antoinette engine produced kW hp with kg lb of weight including cooling water resulting in a power to weight ratio that was not surpassed for years br Early airplanes continued to use V engines During World War One V aircraft engines included the French Renault G the Spanish Hispano Suiza the British Sunbeam Arab and the American Curtiss OX br The Hispano Suiza SOHC engine was designed by Marc Birkigt from Switzerland and was built by Hispano Suiza in France and Spain as well as under license in England and the United States This engine was used by American French and British military aircraft in World War One It was one of the most important engines with most of the leading aces piloting aircraft powered by this dependable flexible performance as well as light and well balanced Hispano Suiza engine By the versions incorporated improvements by Wright Aeronautical and was considered the lightest and most efficient pursuit engine in the world br After this time flat eight engines became more commonplace than V engines due to their lighter crankshafts and better suitability for air cooling One of the few remaining V airplane engines by World War Two was the German Argus As inverted V which was air cooled and used in several trainers and small utility aircraft br br br Marine vessel use br br The V configuration is not commonly used in marine vessels However several marine diesel V engines have been produced by companies such as Brons Scania and Yanmar br Gray Marine Motor Company was one of the first to use petrol V engines for marine use br Engines from American Motors Corporation AMC were used by Gray Marine from until They were marketed as Fireball inboards and available in L cu in versions using a variety of carburetor combinations including single and dual Carter one barrel YH side drafts Carter two barrel and Carter AFB AVS four barrel types The engine is mostly the same as for automobile applications with changes to freeze plugs and cam profiles to reduce top rpm but often has a reverse rotation for use in twin engine boats br W rtsil a four stroke medium speed diesel engine manufactured by W rtsil is one of the few large marine diesel engines available in V configuration The V model which has a cylinder bore of centimetres in is available as diesel V dual fuel V DF and pure gas V SG configurations with an output of to kilowatts to hp depending on the model br br br Motorcycle use br Until Boss Hoss Cycles began production in the few V motorcycles made were either prototypes or racing machines br In Glen Curtiss set an unofficial world record of mph km h on a home made L cu in motorcycle The Moto Guzzi V was a cc cu in motorcycle capable of km h mph used for Grand Prix racing from until The Morbidelli V was a cc cu in concept motorcycle which did not reach production As of Boss Hoss had sold over bikes and trikes
