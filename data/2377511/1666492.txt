id: 1666492
Outboard Marine Corporation OMC was a maker of Evinrude Johnson and Gale Outboard Motors and many different brands of boats It was a multibillion dollar Fortune corporation Evinrude began in Milwaukee Wisconsin in OMC was based in Waukegan Illinois They also owned several lines of boats such as Chris Craft Lowe Boats Princecraft Four Winns SeaSwirl Stratos and Javelin OMC was also a parent company to Lawn Boy and Ryan which made lawn mowers br OMC sold motors in and had one third of the outboard market OMC filed for bankruptcy December and laid off employees br The Johnson and Evinrude brands were won by bid in February by Bombardier Recreational Products and the boat division by Genmar Holdings of Minnesota The former OMC plant in Waukegan Illinois is now a Superfund cleanup site br br br History br Outboard Marine Corporation sometimes referred to as Outboard Motor Company was formed in when ELTO was merged with Lockwood Ash Motor Company They began using the name OMC in Outboard Marine Corporation was the world s largest manufacturer and supplier of outboard motors and second largest producer of powerboats Based in Waukegan Illinois the company had become famous for its brand name Johnson and Evinrude outboard motors as well as its Chris Craft and Grumman powerboats Other products under the brand names of Four Winns Seaswirl Trade Winds Sunbird Stratos and Hydra Sports include fiberglass runabouts cruisers performance boats and craft for offshore fishing Outboard Marine also marketed clothing for boating and resort wear Unfortunately during the late s and early s Outboard Marine had a difficult time keeping up with the competition notably archrival Brunswick Corporation currently the world s largest manufacturer of powerboats br br br Early years br Motorized transport was just becoming an everyday part of life in when Ole Evinrude first mass produced a practical outboard engine for boats Evinrude placed an advertisement in a motor magazine to introduce his motor drawing so many inquiries from U S and overseas readers that he decided to try large scale production Needing financial help with this undertaking he found a backer and established the Evinrude Motor Company in br The business was an instant success its market included not only recreational boaters but also the Scandinavian fishing fleets operating in the North Sea Friction between the partners forced Evinrude to sell his share to his backer in and depart after signing a guarantee restricting him from the outboard motor industry for five years The company continued without him becoming a subsidiary of the gasoline engine manufacturer Briggs Stratton Corporation in br By Evinrude was back in business in a venture he called the ELTO Outboard Motor Company His new offering was the Evinrude Light Twin Outboard a motor partly made of aluminum reducing its weight by a third Popular with the fishing fleets this revolutionary engine outstripped sales of Evinrude s original outboard motor within three years It also attracted the attention of a competitor Johnson Motor Company which brought out its rival lightweight engine in Johnson gained market share snatching the lead four years later with an updated model weighing a trim pounds costing a thrifty and able to drive a boat at a zippy miles per hour Neither the Evinrude Company nor ELTO could match this Now far ahead Johnson produced a net profit of in far outpacing Evinrude s and ELTO s br A new engine in restored the ELTO Company whose annual net profit rose to Ole Evinrude merged ELTO with Stephen Briggs the following year when he and Harold Stratton disagreed over diversifying Briggs Stratton into the outboard engine market Mr Briggs became chairman of the brand new Outboard Motors Corporation with Mr Evinrude as the President br br br The Great Depression and World War II br Outboard scarcely had time to find its feet before the stock market crash of tested its staying power Already responsible for in bank loans as a result of the merger the company had to increase its debt to between and when operating deficits totaled To keep the business afloat the entire inventory was sold at bargain prices and Evinrude sacrificed his salary until his death in br Johnson s fate was worse A too costly advertising campaign as well as an ill timed offering of matched motors and hulls drained all cash reserves by when control of the company passed to its bankers Next came an attempt to lessen its reliance on seasonal sales by entry into the refrigerator compressor market This last ditch effort did not revive the business and shortly thereafter Johnson was for sale br In the Outboard Motors Corporation bought the Johnson Motor Company Its price tag brought Outboard a well known line of outboards and plant and equipment worth million It also brought Outboard established overseas markets in China Burma Iran and Albania to broaden Evinrude s array of dealers in Europe Australia and New Zealand Another plus was Johnson s niche in the refrigeration market Outboard established the Gale Products Division at Galesburg Illinois to manufacture this new line br Expansion brought changes No longer devoted to purely marine interests the company changed its name in to the Outboard Marine Manufacturing Company Stephen F Briggs resigned his Outboard chairmanship temporarily he had held this position since to take the Johnson helm He instituted a rigorous cost cutting regime and by the Johnson division s gross sales were million as compared with Evinrude ELTO s million br By now Outboard Motors accounted for about percent of U S outboard motor production There were three engine lines suiting most needs the ELTO line for the buyer seeking thrift Evinrude the prestige line and Johnson offering special features Though there was cooperation operations were largely independent This left each division to award contracts to outside bidders as well as those sharing a place under the Outboard umbrella Even export sales operations were handled differently although they were all routed through the Waukegan headquarters Johnson tended to sell directly to its dealers while most Evinrude sales were passed through distributors and then to the dealers br In addition to the engines selling mostly in seasonal markets there were other items broadening the product lines The Lawn Boy lawnmower had been an Evinrude staple since along with pumps for drainage firefighting and lawn spraying Offerings from Johnson included small generators a gasoline engine for washing machines and refrigerators In combination with the motors all these produced net sales of million by generating profits of br In the early s Outboard s facilities were all converted to the production of war materials Bomb fuses aircraft engines and firefighting apparatus flowed from the Outboard factories along with landing boat motors for the Navy Evinrude four cylinder engines carried troops across the Rhine Net sales for reached million topping million the following year br The personnel who steered the company through the hectic war years were Outboard oldtimers In addition to Briggs there was Joseph G Rayniak director of manufacturing research whose career dated back to the Johnson brothers horsepower Light Twin unveiled in There was Finn T Irgens holder of patents who had risen to be director of engineering from a start with Ole Evinrude in There was Ralph Evinrude who had succeeded to the company presidency after his father s death in br br br Expansion and growth in the postwar years br These longtime staff members were all on hand with the return of peacetime when the company converted its facilities back to the production of Johnson and Evinrude outboard motors Spending million on plant expansion and improvement by Outboard then offered models ranging from one cylinder horsepower engines to two cylinder horsepower models br Several acquisitions broadened the Outboard product line during the s The first in was RPM Manufacturing Company of Missouri whose specialty was a rotary power mower that Outboard planned to sell under its familiar Lawn Boy tradename Featuring a detachable engine useful as an outboard the mower was already a best selling unbranded item in both the Sears and the Spiegel catalogs Outboard coped with the huge volume of existing orders by completing entire units in one factory rather than using the more time consuming method of piecemeal assembly in several locations br In the company changed its name to Outboard Marine Corporation OMC The same year OMC purchased Industrial Engineering Canada s largest chain saw manufacturer for C million plus shares OMC moved this new subsidiary to Peterborough Ontario and changed the name Industrial Engineering to Pioneer Saws Ltd br Cushman company of Nebraska joined the company subsidiary list in Well known in the utility vehicle field Cushman had manufactured the Airborne a motor scooter dropped by parachute for ground transport of paratroopers Later the company s lightweight vehicles became popular for agricultural industrial and recreational use Costing shares at par the new acquisition added three wheel mail carriers golf carts and motor scooters to the OMC product line Besides the Johnson and Evinrude motors then being sold by about retail dealers the swelling list of OMC offerings included Gale Buccaneer motors sold through hardware jobbers as well as a number of unbranded models sold for retailers br The company s most innovative engine appeared in The first mass produced die cast aluminum engine it was a four cylinder horsepower outboard completely manufactured by OMC its V blocks came from Johnson its steel parts from Evinrude while the Gale division contributed its carburetors and ignition systems br Export sales of all items surged ahead during the s Seeing a percent gain in exports between and OMC expanded its export department in gaining a new subsidiary called Outboard Marine International S A By taking the next logical step of overseas production the company was manufacturing and assembling motors in Brugge Belgium All these developments showed in the annual net sales which soared from million in to million by br During the s OMC s main objective had been acquisitions to broaden basic product lines In the s the company s aim was to improve all these products and find growing markets for them Ensuring its industry leadership by constant innovation and improvement to existing products OMC allocated more than million annually to research and development br As the s began the United States was in the trough of a recession First time buyers as well as those seeking bigger and better leisure time equipment put their purchases on hold Because its principal markets were tied to leisure time activities mostly practiced on a seasonal basis OMC sales sank to a low of million br The economic turndown did not however prevent the company from starting a five year philanthropic program in In response to a request to benefit the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization s freedom from hunger campaign OMC contributed several hundred outboard engines each year to be used in fishing part of a program to increase food production in underdeveloped countries Also in the company established the OMC Boats Division to produce and market to foot boats featuring both outboard and the newer stern drive engines Production began the following year helping to raise sales to million by br The stern drive or inboard outboard motors were available both as separate units for boat builders or as components of boats produced by OMC Built to give the fuel economy and dependability of inboard engines they were nevertheless as versatile as outboards By the company was selling only about stern drives a year however and sales of the outboards were still outpacing them tenfold The problem stemmed from the engine s state of the art technology many dealers did not know how to repair these motors and owners were often ignorant of maintenance needs OMC met this challenge by developing computerized week long repair and maintenance classes for dealer training Four schools two permanently stationed in San Francisco California and Waukegan Illinois and two mobile units familiarized customers with the new engines br During the s public interest in novel sports offered new market potential Alert to novel trends OMC entered the snowmobile industry with enthusiasm introducing the Evinrude Skeeter and the Johnson Skee Horse in each sure to thrill riders with speeds of more than miles per hour Another innovation was the Evinrude Aquanaut for skin diving also sold under the Johnson tradename Air Buoy Consisting of a floating gasoline powered compressor the unit supplied air to two masked divers at the same time Another breakthrough was the loop charged outboard devised after the company went back to powerboat racing for the first time since World War II br By October OMC s fiscal year end sales had reached million Of this amount percent came from power mowers with golf carts and utility vehicles sharing second place at percent and with snowmobiles the fastest growing segment of the business also at percent Chain saw sales accounted for percent of the final figure while a full percent came from marine products The only failure of the decade was the boat building enterprise initially small operating losses grew each year until the line was sold to Chris Craft in Otherwise the s had been lucrative as the net sales figure of million showed br br br Retrenchment and Reorganization in the s br The s began with a dip to million in net sales This was partly due to the unprofitable boat line and partly to a line of tent campers that had never fulfilled expectations after the acquisition of their manufacturer Trade Winds Campers The company discontinued the line in and immediately saw the improvement in their net sales figures which soared to million by br There were other disappointments Golf cart sales sank to percent of overall revenue by and were discontinued in Chain saw sales totaled million in resulting in losses for the company and reflecting a flattening of future market potential OMC discontinued them the following year Snowmobiles constituting about percent of sales volume in were offered in with an optional Wankel engine costing about more than the conventional motor Though this was the United States s first introduction to the revolutionary rotary engine OMC s hopes of success were dashed by heavy competition from other snowmobile brands as well as by two winters of sparse snow Snowmobile production came to an end in after a fiscal operating loss of million br Fuel shortages were another downside Coming to an OPEC inspired zenith in they brought fears of a buying slowdown in the peak spring quarter An OMC environmental executive warned of possible gasoline rationing by the petroleum industry and outlined steps for fuel conservation among boaters br In the same year OMC purchased a five acre site in Hong Kong Intended as a first step towards larger outboard motor markets in Asia the move was also encouraged by a Hong Kong government program designed to attract specific technologically advanced industries Assembly operations began in the plant in with the manufacture of electronic outboard motor components following two years later br In Charles D Strang succeeded W C Scott as president Strang s interest in powerboats beginning in boyhood had lasted through college and a post as a research associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology During a later period of employment with the makers of Mercury outboard motors interest had deepened into vocation In his experience in the powerboat industry had brought him to OMC Eight years later he rose to the presidency br An environmental question was one of his first challenges It began in when OMC was cited by both the U S and Illinois environmental protection agencies for polluting a drainage ditch and Waukegan harbor with polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs The company filed suit against both agencies after lengthy negotiations charging that the federal government had dragged its feet in spending funds authorized for pollution control use Company attorneys also stated that the PCB contaminated pipes had been replaced in but the agencies likewise filed suit asking that the company be ordered to remove the contaminants from the harbor and to pay a maximum penalty of about million reflecting a fine for each day the PCB sources had been in place This suit was to dog OMC s footsteps throughout the s br Reorganizing his domestic operations was another Strang priority with bringing together the Evinrude and Johnson divisions at the top of the list Complete separation of the two since the company s beginnings had fostered an intense rivalry between them along with disregard for competition by manufacturers outside the company To unite the company against outside competitors in Strang centralized all domestic manufacturing operations at the corporate headquarters in Waukegan Illinois charging vice president James C Chapman with responsibility for their coordination as well as for manufacturing policy br Next came long range plans for dealing with the competitors themselves Chief among these were the Japanese firm Yamaha eating into OMC s European market and Brunswick Corporation makers of premium priced Mercury outboards A joint venture between Yamaha and Brunswick had produced a low cost engine called Mariner thus Brunswick then had an engine at both high and low ends of the market leaving OMC sandwiched in the middle With his newly united company behind him Strang cleared this hurdle by slashing prices by percent and also by making sure that all products offered by competitors were available in the OMC lineup In another move he bought out independent distributors overseas thus gaining greater control over foreign marketing operations br Threatening OMC s competitiveness was a Department of Energy proposal that boating be banned on weekends As a result of this suggestion public concern about gasoline shortages caused OMC s net sales to plummet to million in from million just one year earlier It was not easy to maintain the company s competitive edge against the Japanese at this time but Strang slashed budgets reducing his work force by one third to save an annual pretax amount of million The reward for this effort showed at the end of fiscal when net sales reached million br br br Transition in the s and s br OMC was now in a position to spend million on the construction and tooling of nine new plants Contrary to previous practice each plant was designed to specialize in one manufacturing function In addition overseas plants were refined to reduce operations costs and provide more efficient handling and storage Streamlining made product innovation easier Power steering variable ratio oiling delivering exact mixtures of gasoline and oil to the engine and saltwater protection were new features appreciated by powerboat buyers Starting in OMC began to prepare the way for a new stern drive engine to supersede previous models After reviewing the stern drive market the company sent interviewers to dealers and service department personnel gathering information for the ideal stern drive engine The result was the OMC Cobra introduced in Designed for both boat builders and consumers its liter engine delivered horsepower br In James Chapman stepped into the presidency of the company succeeding Robert F Wallace whose short tenure had lasted from January Like his predecessors Chapman grappled with the Waukegan Harbor question This issue was finally laid to rest in April when the U S Department of Justice ordered OMC to fund a trust to remove the pollutants from Lake Michigan br This was just the beginning of OMC s problems however In the boat market peaked and then went into a tailspin Although Chapman decided to purchase boatmakers to assure OMC of captive customers for their outboard engines the company did not develop a comprehensive or well designed strategy to manage its growing operations efficiently In the middle of the worst downturn in the industry s history Chapman reduced staff closed factories and eliminated whole product lines such as Chris Craft engines and boat models all to no avail Between and OMC suffered losses totaling million br In OMC purchased some of the holdings of Murray Industries Inc makers of Chris Craft boats That same year OMC sold off Lawn Boy a popular lawn mower company and Cushman to The Toro Company and Ransomes respectively The sales netted a much needed million in cash for OMC One portion of the money was used for capital improvements for its boatbuilding facilities while another portion was invested in building a new Suncruiser aluminum pontoon boat Despite the large expenditures OMC s decision to focus on boatbuilding proved to be a good one OMC was able to pair boats with appropriately powered outboards and sales of boat packages doubled within a one year timeframe br Smaller and quieter V s were introduced in in the form of the Evinrude Spitfire and the Johnson Silver Star series These outboards featured a new flushing device that could be used to flush the engine with fresh water while it was running The Spitfire and Silver Star models also used an infra red sensor system called Optical Ignition System OIS This system automatically advanced the engine timing to eliminate unwanted timing changes Other advancements in included smaller more fuel efficient diesel stern drive models The OMC Cobra Diesel was a pound liter six cylinder monoblock inline powerhouse that produced hp at rpm br Electronic Fuel Injection EFI was introduced on some OMC drive systems in representing the first time that EFI was available to recreational stern drive customers With the previous carbureted systems boaters had to endure a nine step starting sequence With the EFI boaters had only to turn the key and shift into gear br By OMC had more than brands in the marketplace ranging from canoes to cruisers Operations were divided into three groups the Fishing Boat Group the Recreational Boat Group and the Aluminum Boat Group Each group was responsible for all manufacturing and marketing efforts associated with its line of products The Fishing Boat Group included Stratos Hydra Sports Javelin and Quest by Four Winns The Recreational Boat Group produced models under the brand names Chris Craft Donzi Four Winns Seaswirl and Sunbird The Aluminum Boat Group included Duranautic Princecraft Springbok Suncruiser Lowe Sea Nymph Grumman and Roughneck Many of these same brands are still in production today br br br End of an era br As OMC continued to lose money Harry Bowman the former CEO of Whirlpool Corporation was hired to replace Chapman When the boat industry finally rebounded from its economic downturn in OMC did not have enough of the right kind of product for its customers since much of it had been sold by Chapman Bowman immediately formed a joint venture with Volvo to consolidate two engines into one brand name finalized a contract with a German firm to bring in new technology for high pressure fuel injectors so that OMC engines could be more fuel efficient initiated a thoroughgoing advertising campaign to strengthen its brand name Evinrude and Johnson outboard engines and began to develop a new generation of outboard motors that were environmentally acceptable fuel efficient and easily repaired Bowman s strategy worked By the middle of OMC s revenues were billion br The company faced net revenue losses of million in the nd quarter of ending March and would have been worse if million in dividends were not suspended The previous quarter loss was million even after selling assets such as the corporate jet In April OMC hired Salomon Brothers to explore future option such as a buyout or merger In Detroit Diesel made a a share bid for OMC They were outbid at a share by Alfred Kingsley who previously owned million shares purchased at a share and had no experience in the outboard industry The deal was backed by George Soros Carl Icahn a corporate raider who bought TWA in is said to blame Kingsley his lieutenant during the s for the ensuing TWA bankruptcy a few years later David Jones former Mercury Marine Division president until August was hired by Kingsley in September to become the President and CEO of OMC but resigned in August due to financial turmoil at OMC In March OMC laid off employees after earlier laying off In September OMC announced the closure of their Milwaukee Wisconsin and Waukegan Illinois plants over the next two years br OMC released the FICHT fuel injected motor in to meet stiffer EPA guidelines This motor used gasoline direct injection developed by Ficht GmbH Germany This motor had problems due to the transition phase of operation being exactly at the same trolling speed of many fishermen and had problems early on and the smoking and knocking of these engines along with many pistons and rods exploding out the sides of the engine block created an aura of doom to potential new customers Some outboard motor industry insiders have speculated the rush to meet EPA standards helped with the undoing of OMC br br br Statistics br Incorporated as Outboard Marine Manufacturing Company br
