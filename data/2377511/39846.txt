title: Outboard motor
id: 39846
An outboard motor is a propulsion system for boats consisting of a self contained unit that includes engine gearbox and propeller or jet drive designed to be affixed to the outside of the transom They are the most common motorised method of propelling small watercraft As well as providing propulsion outboards provide steering control as they are designed to pivot over their mountings and thus control the direction of thrust The skeg also acts as a rudder when the engine is not running Unlike inboard motors outboard motors can be easily removed for storage or repairs br br In order to eliminate the chances of hitting bottom with an outboard motor the motor can be tilted up to an elevated position either electronically or manually This helps when traveling through shallow waters where there may be debris that could potentially damage the motor as well as the propeller If the electric motor required to move the pistons which raise or lower the engine is malfunctioning every outboard motor is equipped with a manual piston release which will allow the operator to drop the motor down to its lowest setting br br br General use br br br Large outboards br Large outboards are affixed to the transom using clamps and are either tiller steered or controlled from the helm Generally motors of hp plus are linked to controls at the helm These range from and cylinder models generating to horsepower to kW suitable for hulls up to feet m in length to powerful V and V cylinder blocks rated up to hp kW with sufficient power to be used on boats of feet m or longer br br br Portable br Small outboard motors up to horsepower kW or so are easily portable They are affixed to the boat via clamps and thus easily moved from boat to boat These motors typically use a manual start system with throttle and gearshift controls mounted on the body of the motor and a tiller for steering The smallest of these weigh as little as kilograms lb have integral fuel tanks and provide sufficient power to move a small dinghy at around knots km h mph br This type of motor is typically used br br to power small craft such as jon boats dinghies canoes etc br to provide auxiliary power for sailboats br for trolling aboard larger craft as small outboards are typically more efficient at trolling speeds In this application the motor is frequently installed on the transom alongside and connected to the primary outboard to enable helm steering In addition many small motor manufacturers have begun offering variants with power trim tilt and electric starting functions so that they may be completely controlled remotely br br br Electric powered br Electric outboard motors are self contained propulsory units for boats first invented in by Morton Ray of Ray Electric Outboards These are not to be confused with trolling motors which are not designed as a primary source of power Most electric outboard motors have to kilowatt direct current DC electric motors operated at to volts DC Recently developed outboard motors are powered with an alternating current AC or DC electric motor in the power head like a conventional petrol engine With this setup a motor can produce kW output or more and is able to replace a petrol engine of HP or more The advantage of the induction or asynchronous motor is the power transfer to the rotor by means of electromagnetic induction As these engines do not use permanent magnets they require less maintenance and develop more torque at lower propeller speeds br br br Pump jet br Pump jet propulsion is available as an option on most outboard motors Although less efficient than an open propeller they are particularly useful in applications where the ability to operate in very shallow water is important They also eliminate the laceration dangers of an open propeller br br br Propane br Propane outboard motors are available from several manufacturers These products have several advantages such as lower emissions absence of ethanol related issues and no need for choke once the system is pressurized Lehr is regarded as the first manufacturer to have brought a propane powered outboard motor to market by Popular Mechanics and other boating publications br br br History and developments br The first known outboard motor was a small pound kg electric unit designed around by Gustave Trouv and patented in May Patent N Later about petrol powered outboards may have been produced in by American Motors Co but neither of these two pioneering efforts appear to have had much impact br The Waterman outboard engine appears to be the first gasoline powered outboard offered for sale in significant numbers It was developed from in Grosse Ile Michigan with a patent application filed in Starting in the company went on to make thousands of his Porto Motor units claiming sales by The inboard boat motor firm of Caille Motor Company of Detroit were instrumental in making the cylinder and engines br The most successful early outboard motor was created by Norwegian American inventor Ole Evinrude in Historically a majority of outboards have been two stroke powerheads fitted with a carburetor due to the design s inherent simplicity reliability low cost and light weight Drawbacks include increased pollution due to the high volume of unburned gasoline and oil in their exhaust and louder noise br br br Four stroke outboards br Although four stroke outboards have been sold since the late s particularly Roness and Sharland in Homelite introduced a commercially viable four cycle outboard a horsepower kW motor based on the four cylinder Crosley automobile engine This was called the Bearcat and was later purchased by Fischer Pierce the makers of Boston Whaler for use in their boats because of their advantages over two stroke engines In Honda Motor Co introduced its first four stroke powerhead In Yamaha introduced their first four stroke powerhead These motors were only available in the low power range In Honda released hp and hp four stroke models They continued to lead in the development of four stroke engines throughout the s as US and European exhaust emissions regulations such as CARB California Air Resources Board led to the proliferation of four stroke outboards At first North American manufacturers such as Mercury and OMC used engine technology from Japanese manufacturers such as Yamaha and Suzuki until they were able to develop their own four stroke engine The inherent advantages of four stroke motors included lower pollution especially oil in the water noise reduction increased fuel economy and increased torque at low engine speeds br Honda Marine Group Mercury Marine Mercury Racing Nissan Marine Suzuki Marine Tohatsu Outboards Yamaha Marine and China Oshen Hyfong marine have all developed new four stroke engines Some are carburetted usually the smaller engines The balance are electronically fuel injected Depending on the manufacturer newer engines benefit from advanced technology such as multiple valves per cylinder variable camshaft timing Honda s VTEC boosted low end torque Honda s BLAST way cooling systems and closed loop fuel injection Mercury Verado four strokes are unique in that they are supercharged br Mercury Marine Mercury Racing Tohatsu Yamaha Marine Nissan and Evinrude each developed computer controlled direct injected two stroke engines Each brand boasts a different method of DI br Fuel economy on both direct injected and four stroke outboards measures from a percent to percent improvement compared with conventional two strokes br However the gap between two stroke and four stroke outboard fuel economy is beginning to narrow Two stroke outboard motor manufacturers have recently introduced technologies that help to improve two stroke fuel economy br br br LPG outboards br In Lehr inc introduced some small hp outboards based on modified Chinese petrol engines to run on propane gas Tohatsu currently also produces propane powered models all rated hp Conversion of larger outboards to run on Liquified petroleum gas is considered unusual and exotic although some hobbyists continue to experiment br br br Outboard motor selection br It is important to select a motor that is a good match for the hull in terms of power and shaft length br br br Power requirements br Overpowering is a dangerous condition that can lead to the transom accelerating past the rest of the vessel and underpowering often results in a boat that is incapable of performing in the role for which it was designed Boats built in the US have Coast Guard Rating Plates which specify the maximum recommended engine powers for the hulls A motor with less than of the maximum will most likely result in unsatisfactory performance br In the united kingdom boats have CE plates on the transoms which specify maximum engine power shaft length maximum engine weight and maximum number of persons or maximum load br br br Shaft length br Outboard motor shaft lengths are standardized to fit and inch and centimeter transoms If the shaft is too long it will extend farther into the water than necessary creating drag which will impair performance and fuel economy If the shaft is too short the motor will be prone to ventilation Even worse if the water intake ports on the lower unit are not sufficiently submerged engine overheating is likely which can result in severe damage br br br General dimensions br Different outboard engine brands require different transom dimensions and sizes This affects performance and trim br br br Operational considerations br br br Motor mounting height br Motor height on the transom is an important factor in achieving optimal performance The motor should be as high as possible without ventilating or loss of water pressure This minimizes the effect of hydrodynamic drag while underway allowing for greater speed Generally the antiventilation plate should be about the same height as or up to two inches higher than the keel with the motor in neutral trim br br br Trim br Trim is the angle of the motor in relation to the hull as illustrated below The ideal trim angle is the one in which the boat rides level with most of the hull on the surface instead of plowing through the water br br If the motor is trimmed out too far the bow will ride too high in the water With too little trim the bow rides too low The optimal trim setting will vary depending on many factors including speed hull design weight and balance and conditions on the water wind and waves Many large outboards are equipped with power trim an electric motor on the mounting bracket with a switch at the helm that enables the operator to adjust the trim angle on the fly In this case the motor should be trimmed fully in to start and trimmed out with an eye on the tachometer as the boat gains momentum until it reaches the point just before ventilation begins or further trim adjustment results in an increase in engine speed with no increase in travel speed Motors not equipped with power trim are manually adjustable using a pin called a topper tilt lock br br br Ventilation br Ventilation is a phenomenon that occurs when surface air or exhaust gas in the case of motors equipped with through hub exhaust is drawn into the spinning propeller blades With the propeller pushing mostly air instead of water the load on the engine is greatly reduced causing the engine to race and the propeller to spin fast enough to result in cavitation at which point little thrust is generated at all The condition continues until the prop slows enough for the air bubbles to rise to the surface The primary causes of ventilation are motor mounted too high motor trimmed out excessively damage to the antiventilation plate damage to propeller foreign object lodged in the diffuser ring br br br Safety br If the helmsman goes overboard the boat may continue under power but uncontrolled risking serious or fatal injuries to the helmsman and others in the water A safety measure is a kill cord attached to the boat and helmsman which cuts the motor if the helmsman falls overboard br br br Cooling system br br The most common type of cooling used on outboards of all eras use a rubber impeller to pump water from below the waterline up into the engine This design has remained the standard due mainly to the efficiency and simplicity of its design One disadvantage to this system is that if the impeller is run dry for a length of time such as leaving the engine running when pulling the boat out of the water or in some cases tilting the engine out of the water while running the impeller is likely to be ruined in the process br br br Air cooled outboards br Air cooled outboard engines are currently produced by some manufacturers These tend to be small engines of less than horsepower kW Outboard engines made by Briggs Stratton are air cooled br br br Closed loop cooling br Outboards manufactured by Seven Marine use a closed loop cooling system with a heat exchanger This means saltwater is not pumped through the engine block as is the case with most outboard motors but instead engine coolant and outside water are pumped through opposite sides of the heat exchanger br br br Engine Stalls br An outboard engine may stall if it does not have the correct inputs Common problems that lead to stalling are electrical issues low quality gas or clogged fuel filer Other issues may include a damaged carburetor oil switch br br br Use in long tail boats br br In Vietnam and other parts of southeast Asia long tail boats use outboard motors altered to extend their propellers far from the rest of the motor In Vietnam these outboards are called m y u i t m shrimp tail motor which are smallish air cooled or water cooled gasoline diesel or even modified automotive engines bolted to a welded steel tube frame with another long steel tube up to m long to hold an extended drive shaft driving a conventional propeller The frame that holds the motor has a short swiveling steel pin tube approximately cm long underneath to be inserted into a corresponding hole on the transom or a solid block or wood purposely built in thereof br This drop in arrangement enables extremely quick transfer of the motor to another boat or for storage all that is needed is to lift it out The pivoting design allows the outboard motor to be swiveled by the operator in almost all directions Sideways for direction up and down to change the thrust line according to speed or bow lift elevate completely out of water for easy starting placing the drive shaft and the propeller forward along the side of the boat for reverse or put them inside the boat for propeller replacement which can be a regular occurrence to the cheap cast aluminum propellers on the often debris prone inland waterways br br br Manufacturers br Aquawatt Electric Outboard Motor br Bolinder br Briggs Stratton USA Up to hp br Cimco Marine AB br DBD Marine
