The Kitchen rudder is the familiar name for Kitchen s Patent Reversing Rudders a combination rudder and directional propulsion delivery system for relatively slow speed displacement boats which was invented in the early th century by John G A Kitchen of Lancashire England It turns the rudder into a directional thruster and allows the engine to maintain constant revolutions and direction of drive shaft rotation while altering thrust by use of a control which directs thrust forward or aft Only the rudder pivots the propeller itself is on a fixed shaft and does not br Kitchener gear or Kitchener rudder have been common misnomers for the Kitchen rudder br It is held under British Provisional Patent No and US Patent No and has been improved with the design in US Patent br br br Description br The rudder consists of a pair of slightly conical usually but not always designs vary semi cones mounted on a pivot either side of the propeller with the long axis of the cone running fore and aft when the helm is midships They are pivoted about a vertical axis such that the cone may close off the propeller thrust aft of the propeller directing the thrust forwards and thus creating motion astern br In addition to the jaws of the cone being controlled the direction of thrust is also controlled by rudder direction In this way it is unlike the azimuth thrusters used on many medium and large vessels or the outboard motors or stern drives used by some small boats since these all use the directed thrust to avoid the need of a rudder altogether br Modern equivalent include certain types of pump jets or Kort nozzle br While not strictly Kitchen rudder technology the bucket on some aircraft jet engines is an aeronautical derivative of the device When the deflectors are deployed directing thrust forwards they are equivalent to the Kitchen rudder in the full astern position br br br Operation br The operation of the Kitchen rudder is performed with the propeller engaged even when the boat is stationary The rudder is controlled by a small wheel on the tiller br br br Neutral br The engine is brought up to speed with the drive to the propeller engaged and with the Kitchen rudder in the neutral position This is a position where an equal quantity of thrust is aimed forward and aft Each vessel will have a unique neutral position br br br Moving ahead br The Kitchen gear is opened up to direct an increasing proportion of thrust aft As the balance changes the vessel will move ahead br br br Moving astern br The Kitchen gear is closed to direct an increasing proportion of thrust forward As the balance changes the vessel will move astern br br br See also br Azipod Electric drive azimuth thruster br Ducted propeller Marine propeller with a non rotating nozzle br Pleuger rudder Thruster assisted ship s rudder br Schilling rudder Low aspect ratio rudder with endplates br Sterndrive Type of boat engine br br br Notes br br br External links br Description near the foot of the article under Pinnace br Kitchen Rudder Diagrams br Kitchen Rudder Discussion and diagrams br Manoeuvring device for boats United States Patent expiring in fall br Special rudders and manoeuvering devices br U S patent br U S patent
