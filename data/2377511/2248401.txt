Mercury Marine is a marine engine division of Brunswick Corporation headquartered in Fond du Lac Wisconsin The main product line is outboard engines It also produces the MerCruiser line of sterndrives and inboard engines As well as an all new lineup of electric outboard motors utilizing V lithium ion modular and portable designed batteries Implementing an industry first transverse flux motor technology yielding high torque with optimum efficiency Some manufacturing is in Fond du Lac while HP engines are made in China Smaller engines are Tohatsus that have been rebadged br br br History br br br Founding br The Kiekhaefer Mercury company began in when engineer Carl Kiekhaefer purchased a small outboard motor company in Cedarburg Wisconsin Kiekhaefer s original intention for the Kiekhaefer Corporation was to make magnetic separators for the dairy industry The purchase included defective outboard motors Kiekhaefer and a small staff of employees rebuilt the motors and sold them to Montgomery Ward a mail order company The motors were much improved so the buyer purchased more Kiekhaefer designed motors that withstood the elements better than his competition and called the motor Mercury taking advantage of the Mercury Motor Car popularity at the time whilst adopting the logo of the Roman god Mercury br Kiekhaefer took more than orders at the New York Boat Show br br br World War II br World War II changed the corporate climate and Kiekhaefer sought a government contract to design two man air cooled chainsaws Army engineers had been unable to design a lightweight motor Kiekhaefer designed a new lightweight chainsaw in months The Kiekhaefer powered chainsaw was able to cut through a inch mm green log in seconds while it took the nearest competitor seconds Mercury was awarded the contract and was the world s largest chainsaw manufacturer by the end of the war br br br Post war s br Kiekhaefer Mercury foresaw that the average American s interest in boating would increase after the war Kiekhaefer introduced a cubic inch horsepower hp two cylinder alternate firing design engine at the New York Boat Show called the Lightning or KE This engine also called the Super actually developed around horsepower Its designation was updated to KF for For the engine block though still displacing cubic inches was updated a great deal and given the name Hurricane The kg Super featured this engine which developed around horsepower For this model was updated with a forward neutral reverse gearset and a twist grip throttle It was renamed Cruiser at this point and no longer called Super This engine later became the heart of the Mark of the mid to late fifties Initially rated at horsepower this engine was soon beefed up to There was also an H version which produced more power but carried no rating H version Mercurys were mostly used for racing br In the company also introduced its first large outboard the approximately cubic inch cylinder in line Thunderbolt This engine was rated at horsepower but actually put out around There was soon an H version designed for high rpm use This version put out nearly horsepower while being rated at The Thunderbolt engine benefited from upgrades and updates eventually becoming the Mark Mark and Mark engines of the mid and late fifties All of these were rated quite accurately at horsepower The Mark H high speed developed more but carried no rating br Due to a rather large gap between the Mark hp and the Mark hp Mercury brought out the in line approximately cubic inch Mark horsepower engine for and produced versions of its TurboFour engine for several years It too was available as an H version producing much extra horsepower for racing and sporting use br Why these Mark engines and other Mark engines carried number names which were not horsepower ratings not displacement numbers and not consistent from one motor to another is a real mystery Why was the hp Mercury a Mark and the hp Mercury a Mark while the hp job was the Mark No one really knows br Of course there were also smaller Mercs during both the K era and the Mark era such as the Super and later such engines as the Mark and the Mark br br br s br In Kiekhaefer started testing at a Florida lake he called Lake X to keep the location secret Later that year the Kiekhaefer Mercury company designed a new inline cylinder cubic inch hp kW engine named Mark Like its and cylinder brethren the Mark featured internal reed valves The reed valve blocks served as intermediate main bearings Because the valves occupied space already necessary for the main bearings instead of mounting to an extension of the crankcase crankcase volume was minimized resulting in a higher crankcase compression ratio and more power in proportion to displacement than the competition br Mercury s first cylinder engines featured direct reversing Instead of a lower unit with forward neutral and reverse gears its lower units were more compact with only drive and driven gears and no submerged shift mechanism required Reverse was selected by turning off the engine and restarting it in opposite rotation and neutral by simply switching off Mark s like many of their smaller brethren were available in an H high speed version Many of these large H engines sported open headers for competition and produced horsepower from cubic inches Two totally stock Mark s set a world endurance record on Lake X running miles at an average of mph while being re fueled on the fly The boats were stopped only for driver changes and standard maintenance After the record setting run was completed the motors were torn down and inspected for wear They were found to be well within factory tolerances br For an enlarged version of this engine was introduced The new Mark had horsepower with cubic inches of displacement No H version was offered Also in a stock Mark H set a new world speed record for outboard motors of mph br br br NASCAR racing br br Kiekhaefer decided to promote his company by owning a NASCAR and AAA team The team dominated NASCAR Grand National at one point winning straight races even though it only competed in and The team won the and NASCAR championships with drivers Tim Flock and Buck Baker One of Kiekhaefer s innovations was using dry paper air filters which are still standard in automobiles today br br br s br When Kiekhaefer Mercury s top of the line horsepower cubic inch model Merc was introduced for direct reversing as standard equipment was optionally replaced by full forward neutral and reverse gear shifting as on Mercury s and cylinder models and thru hub exhaust was introduced Previously as with other outboard brands and Mercury s smaller models exhaust exited from a chute at the rear of the cavitation plate above the propeller Thru hub exhaust was claimed to be more efficient by omitting the added drag of an exhaust chute and using the low pressure area necessarily created by the gear housing and propeller moving through the water to assist in exhaust evacuation Over the next several years thru hub exhaust became a standard feature of all Mercury models and later was adopted near industry wide for both outboards and stern drives br With Mercury Marine outboards typically having smaller displacement per horsepower and better fuel economy than the competition s motors an ad ran in publications showing a Mercury powered boat pulling an elephant on a large ski like platform The caption simply read Mercury pulls an elephant Runs on peanuts br In the company merged with the Brunswick Corporation br The company introduced the MerCruiser stern drive line at the Chicago Boat Show The line would later take over percent of the world market br For the Merc became the new top of the line in line offering hp It was somewhat of a sensation It also introduced the new Phanton Black paint scheme which soon spread to the entire line and became famous br In cylinder Mercury models featured the introduction of electronic ignition another first that eventually became an industry standard br Carl Kiekhaefer resigned as President of Kiekhaefer Mercury in and the name was changed to Mercury Marine in During this time Mercury produced snowmobiles like many other companies in the late s The first ones incorporated a cc two man chainsaw engine br br br s br In they came out with the Rocket and Lightning models of snowmobiles These sleds combined aluminum tunnels with Canadian Curtiss Wright CCW engines The Rocket was a and the Lightning a with electric start By Mercury started production of the Hurricane a more modern snowmobile with optional slide rail suspension as opposed to bogie wheel In Mercury introduced the Sno Twister cc snowmobile designed primarily for racing It featured a Kohler free air engine and succeeded in dominating the cc class br In Mercury introduced cc and cc versions of the Sno Twister and both were dominant at the track saw a change in the Sno Twister this time cc cc and cc versions were all introduced These were radical for their time and were the result of Mercury Sno Pro sleds developed and raced the previous year These sleds were featured water cooled Kohler engines The chassis were small lightweight very low profile with curved handlebars and seat cushions that were designed for left turns oval tracks br In and Mercury also produced the Trail Twister snowmobiles which were available in cc and cc which were fan cooled These were some of the fastest lake racers around in their day This started off a new era in snowmobile construction for the whole industry and the sled s basic format set up what is seen today in modern snowmobiles br br br Engine specifications br br br Present day br br At present Mercury product brands include Mercury Mercury Racing MerCruiser and Mariner outboards sold outside the U S Outboard sizes range from horsepower kW to horsepower kW MerCruiser sterndrives and inboards range from to horsepower kW and Mercury Racing outboards produce up to horsepower kW and sterndrives to horsepower kW Subsidiaries include Mercury Precision Parts and Accessories as well as Mercury propellers and Mercury Jet Drives Mercury outboards hp and below are manufactured by Tohatsu in Japan br Mercury has recently developed a processor enhanced line of outboards called the Verado outboard engine The Verado system integrates the outboard into an entire system including fly by wire steering and advanced diagnostics Verado engines are available in hp and hp V hp and hp V introduced in and hp V as of early br In Mercury Marine began selling its Zeus drive system Developed by Mercury and its joint venture company Cummins MerCruiser Diesel CMD the Zeus drive is a dual engine pod drive system Some of the most notable benefits from this class design for boaters will be enhanced helm control While underway an automated trim control feature simplifies operation Also Zeus includes Skyhook Electronic Anchor which will keep a vessel in a fixed location within a tight range The system might be called all weather as it will maintain location in strong currents and winds br Mercury s brand portfolio includes Mercury and Mariner Mercury MerCruiser sterndrives and inboard engines MotorGuide trolling motors Mercury and Teignbridge propellers Mercury inflatable boats Mercury SmartCraft electronics and Mercury and Quicksilver parts and oils MotoTron electronic controls was also a part of Mercury Marine but as of October Brunswick Corp sold MotoTron and its intellectual properties to Woodward Governor of Fort Collins Colorado br SeaCore is a brand of sterndrive marine propulsion systems manufactured in the United States by MerCruiser The SeaCore engine
