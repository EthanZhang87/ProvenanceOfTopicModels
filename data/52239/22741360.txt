title: Soviet influence on the peace movement
id: 22741360
During the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the United States were engaged in an arms race the Soviet Union promoted its foreign policy through the World Peace Council and other front organizations Some writers have claimed that it also influenced non aligned peace groups in the West br br br Russian Revolution and the Polish Soviet War br The Bolsheviks aimed at spreading their revolution by the use of force linking the revolution in Russia with an expected revolution in Germany and assisting other Communist movements in Western Europe Poland in particular was the geographical bridge that the Red Army would have to cross in order to do so and thus Soviets had been preparing their own strike against Poland even before the Polish Kiev offensive they planned to take over Galicia and use the conquered ethnic Polish territories as a springboard for the invasion of Germany and other European countries br However the Soviet propaganda aimed at the international scene would deny any visions of conquest and pro Soviet sympathizers would stage various protests in Western European countries against their government actions which aimed to support Poland against the Soviet advance Eventually the Soviets were defeated at the battle of Warsaw but they learned from the war of the importance of foreign propaganda that could sway Western public opinion and would continue to use similar strategies in the future br br br The World Peace Council br br The World Peace Council WPC was set up by the Soviet Communist Party in to promote Soviet foreign policy and to campaign against nuclear weapons at a time when only the USA had them The WPC was directed by the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party via the Soviet Peace Committee a WPC member The WPC and its members took the line laid down by the Cominform that the world was divided between the peace loving Soviet Union and the warmongering United States From the s until the late s the Soviet Union used numerous organizations associated with the WPC to spread its view of peace They included br br Christian Peace Conference br International Federation of Resistance Fighters br International Institute for Peace br International Organization of Democratic Lawyers br International Organization of Journalists br International Union of Students br World Federation of Democratic Youth br World Federation of Scientific Workers br World Federation of Trade Unions br Women s International Democratic Federation br World Peace Esperanto Movement br In October the Danish authorities expelled Vladimir Merkulov a Soviet Embassy second secretary and KGB operative whom they charged with passing money to Arne Herl v Petersen a member of the WPC s Danish affiliate the Copenhagen based Liaison Committee for Peace and Security to finance a newspaper campaign calling for the establishment of a Nordic nuclear weapons free zone br Other international peace organizations have been said to be associated with the WPC as well International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War is said to have had overlapping membership and similar policies to the WPC The Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs and the Dartmouth Conferences were said to have been used by Soviet delegates to promote Soviet propaganda Joseph Rotblat one of the leaders of the Pugwash movement said that there were a few participants in Pugwash conferences from the Soviet Union who were obviously sent to push the party line but the majority were genuine scientists and behaved as such br The main activity of the WPC was organizing enormous international peace conferences with thousands in attendance they condemned western military action armaments and weapons tests but refrained from criticizing Russian aggression For example in the WPC condemned the Suez war but not the Russian invasion of Hungary br Because of the energetic propaganda of the WPC from the late s onwards with its big conferences and budget from the Soviet Union some observers saw no difference between a peace activist and a communist It was said by some that the peace movement in the West distinct from the WPC was influenced by or even led by it for example US President Ronald Reagan said that the peace demonstrations in Europe in were sponsored by the WPC and Soviet defector Vladimir Bukovsky claimed that they were co ordinated at the WPC s World Parliament of Peoples for Peace in Sofia The FBI reported to the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that the WPC affiliated U S Peace Council was one of the organizers of a large peace protest in New York City but said that the KGB had not manipulated the American movement significantly br In the heyday of the WPC from the late s to the early s co operation between western groups and the WPC was actually very limited and because the non aligned movement was constantly under threat of being tarnished by association with avowedly pro Soviet groups many individuals and organizations studiously avoided contact with communists and fellow travellers As early as the World Pacifist Meeting warned against active collaboration with Communists Western delegates at WPC conferences who tried to criticize the Soviet Union or the WPC s defence of Russian armaments were often shouted down and they gradually dissociated themselves from the WPC Finally after confrontation between western and Soviet delegates at the World Congress for Peace and Disarmament organised by the WPC in Moscow forty non aligned organizations decided to form a new international body the International Confederation for Disarmament and Peace to which Soviet delegates were not invited br Rainer Santi in his history of the International Peace Bureau writes that the WPC always had difficulty in securing cooperation from West European and North American peace organisations because of its obvious affiliation with Socialist countries and the foreign policy of the Soviet Union Especially difficult to digest was that instead of criticising the Soviet Union s unilaterally resumed atmospheric nuclear testing in the WPC issued a statement rationalising it In the World Peace Council explained the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as an act of solidarity in the face of Chinese and US aggression against Afghanistan It was suggested by a former secretary of the WPC that it simply failed to connect with the western peace movement It was said to have used most of its funds on international travel and lavish conferences to have poor intelligence on Western peace groups and even though its HQ was in Helsinki to have no contact with Finnish peace organizations br br br Wider Soviet influence br In the House Committee on Un American Activities published The Communist Peace Offensive which detailed the activities of the WPC and of numerous affiliated organisations It listed dozens of American organisations and hundreds of Americans who had been involved in peace meetings conferences and petitions It noted that some of the persons who are so described in either the text or the appendix withdrew their support and or affiliation with these organizations when the Communist character of these organizations was discovered There may also be persons whose names were used as sponsors or affiliates of these organizations without permission or knowledge of the individuals involved br In The Heritage Foundation published Moscow and the Peace Offensive which said that non aligned peace organizations advocated similar policies on defence and disarmament to the Soviet Union It argued that pacifists and concerned Christians had been drawn into the Communist campaign largely unaware of its real sponsorship br Russian GRU defector Stanislav Lunev said in his autobiography that the GRU and the KGB helped to fund just about every antiwar movement and organization in America and abroad and that during the Vietnam War the USSR gave billion to American anti war movements more than it gave to the VietCong although he does not identify any organisation by name Lunev described this as a hugely successful campaign and well worth the cost The former KGB officer Sergei Tretyakov said that the Soviet Peace Committee funded and organized demonstrations in Europe against US bases According to Time magazine a US State Department official estimated that the KGB may have spent million on the peace offensive up to channeling funds through national Communist parties or the World Peace Council to a host of new antiwar organizations that would in many cases reject the financial help if they knew the source Richard Felix Staar in his book Foreign Policies of the Soviet Union says that non communist peace movements without overt ties to the USSR were virtually controlled by it Lord Chalfont claimed that the Soviet Union was giving the European peace movement million a year The Federation of Conservative Students FCS alleged Soviet funding of CND br U S plans in the late s and early s to deploy Pershing II missiles in Western Europe in response to the Soviet SS missiles were contentious prompting Paul Nitze the American negotiator to suggest a compromise plan for nuclear missiles in Europe in the celebrated walk in the woods with Soviet negotiator Yuli Kvitsinsky but the Soviets never responded Kvitsinsky would later write that despite his efforts the Soviet side was not interested in compromise calculating instead that peace movements in the West would force the Americans to capitulate br In November Norway expelled a suspected KGB agent who had offered bribes to Norwegians to get them to write letters to newspapers denouncing the deployment of new NATO missiles br In Time magazine noted the suspicions of some Western scientists that the nuclear winter hypothesis was promoted by Moscow to give antinuclear groups in the U S and Europe some fresh ammunition against America s arms buildup Sergei Tretyakov claimed that the data behind the nuclear winter scenario was faked by the KGB and spread in the west as part of a campaign against Pershing II missiles He said that the first peer reviewed paper in the development of the nuclear winter hypothesis Twilight at Noon by Paul Crutzen and John Birks was published as a result of this KGB influence br br br Western intelligence assessments br In a CIA report on the US peace movement observed that the Communist Party of the USA benefits from anti US activity by Peace groups but does not appear to be inspiring them or directing them After demonstrations against NATO missiles in West Germany in an official investigation turned up circumstantial evidence but no absolute proof of KGB involvement Western intelligence experts concluded that the movement in Europe at that time was probably not Soviet inspired br In MI and MI reported to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Soviet contacts with the peace movement based on the testimony of KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky According to Christopher Andrew s official history of MI Gordievsky s evidence indicated that there was little effective contact between either the KGB or the Soviet embassy and the peace movement br br br See also br All Soviet Peace Conference br Astroturfing br Communist propaganda br Congress for Cultural Freedom br Culture during the Cold War br
