Pe abots is the nickname for automated social media accounts allegedly used by the Mexican government of Enrique Pe a Nieto and the PRI political party to keep unfavorable news from reaching the Mexican public Pe abot accusations are related to the broader issue of fake news in the st century br br br History of disinformation in Mexican politics br The PRI political party has been reported to use fake news since before Pe a Nieto The main tactic originally was to spread such propaganda through open radio and television networks Such tactic was effective in Mexico because newspaper readership is low and cable TV is largely limited to the middle classes consequently the country s two major television networks Televisa and TV Azteca exert a significant influence in national politics Televisa itself not only owns around two thirds of the programming on Mexico s TV channels making it not only Mexico s largest television network but also is the largest media network in the Spanish speaking world br br br Pe abots br Analysts have given the name Pe abots to a suspected network of automated accounts on social media used by the Mexican government to spread pro government propaganda and to marginalize dissenting opinions in social media The bots were first noticed in the elections when they were used to disseminate opinions in support of Enrique Pe a Nieto in social networks in social networks such as Twitter and Facebook br According to Aristegui Noticias their usage goes against articles and of the Mexican Constitution the ones used by the current government cost an estimated million pesos monthly fee which news outlets argument only helps the government spread fake support towards the president but does not have a benefit towards Mexican people with whom EPN is highly unpopular Facebook currently holds approximately Pe abots while Twitter has less As of July Oxford University s Computational Propaganda Research Project claimed many western democracies Mexico included perform social media manipulation thus saying the manipulation comes directly from the Mexican government itself br During Pe a Nieto s subsequent presidency analysts have noted that Pe abots are used to overpower trending topics that critique government to flood trending government critical hashtags with spam and to create fake trends by pushing alternative hashtags and to push smear campaigns and threats against government critical activists and journalists Pe abots can be distinguished because their pattern of activity is distinct from that of normal interaction activity in social networks br br br Meadebots br In Twitter it was reported that about of the followers of presidential candidate from the PRI Jose Antonio Meade were bots br When Antonio Meade presented himself as a candidate for the presidential election his social media accounts such as MovimientoMEADE created by the PRI s official account PRI Nacional obtained a huge quantity of followers far too quick Some users noticed and brought it to attention after investigations it was reported of such followers were bots out of and the account was eliminated from Twitter after hours The fake accounts used the hashtags YoConMeade and Meade further revealed was that Meade s official account on Twitter JoseAMeadeK has bots fake followers out of the br br br Manipulation of news media in Mexico through television br br The Mexican government of Pe a Nieto has been accused of using various means to keep unfavorable news from reaching the Mexican people Many Mexicans have protested this practice as it clearly goes against the freedom of speech The PRI has been reported to use fake news since before Pe a Nieto The main tactic has been to spread such propaganda through radio and television This tactic is perceived as effective in Mexico because newspaper readership is low and research on the Internet and cable TV is largely limited to the middle classes consequently the country s two major television networks Televisa and TV Azteca exert a significant influence in national politics Televisa itself owns around two thirds of the programming on Mexico s TV channels making it not only Mexico s largest television network but also is the largest media network in the Spanish speaking world br In June before the Mexican presidential elections the British newspaper The Guardian published a series of allegations claiming Televisa sold favorable coverage to top politicians in its news and entertainment shows this scandal became known as the Televisa controversy The documents published by The Guardian alleged that a secretive circle within Televisa manipulated news coverage to favor PRI presidential candidate Enrique Pe a Nieto who was poised as favorite to win Televisa s secret circle supposedly commissioned videos to promote Pe a Nieto and lash out his political rivals in The Guardian documents suggest that Televisa s secret team distributed such videos through e mail posting them posted them on Facebook and YouTube some can still be seen there Another document was a PowerPoint presentation with a slide explicitly aimed at rival leftist candidate of the Party of the Democratic Revolution PRD Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador Supposedly given to The Guardian by a Televisa employee The document s authenticity was never possible to confirm however dates names and events largely coincide Televisa refused to talk the documents and denied a relationship with the PRI or its presidential candidate saying that they had provided equal media coverage to all parties Televisa published an article supposedly showing discrepancies in The Guardian documents and denying accusations br Mexican citizens complained about the perceived favoritism towards Enrique Pe a Nieto and the PRI protesting through the Yo Soy movement which Televisa covered in detail However Televisa s news media coverage is perceived to have been biased by using a media coverage tactic Mexican citizens call cortinas de humo smoke screens These introduce a news scandal giving extensive coverage to distract citizens from a potential conflict of interest or controversy that could damage the image of the politician favored by the network An example of a perceived smoke screen would be the news media coverage of Caso Michoac n and Caso Paolette distracting all the attention from the parallel Yo soy movement A few years later on the day of September factual evidence of Televisa s performing media manipulation emerged when a Televisa news anchor while live on air reading a teleprompter mistakenly read out loud that try that Jaime l Bronco Rodr guez Calder n Nuevo Leon s governor is mentioned as little as possible Newspaper El Universal caught it on video and published it social media Televisa didn t mention the story and declined to comment Lack of news coverage concerning Nuevo Le n s Governor Jaime Rodriguez is perceived due to him being the first elected governor to not be part of any political party Independent Governor and because unlike the governors from the PRI preceding him the independent governor El Bronco doesn t spend money on publicity at all preferring to communicate all news by using social media such as Twitter and Facebook While the incident may have proven Televisa s bias there wasn t anything to incriminate the PRI political party or Enrique Pe a Nieto though it did further suspicion of Televisa manipulating news media In contrast a December article of The New York Times reported Enrique Pe a Nieto spending about million dollars on publicity during his first years as president the largest publicity budget ever spent by a Mexican President Additionally percent of news journalists admitted to not believe to have enough freedom of speech and award winning news reporter Carmen Aristegui was controversially fired shortly after revealing the Mexican White House scandals br br br Violence and spying towards news journalists and civil rights activists br Far for only being receiving accusations of spreading fake news the Mexican government of EPN has also been accused of violence towards news journalists and of spying on them and also towards civil right leaders and their families During his tenure as president Pe a Nieto has been accused of failing to protect news journalists whose deaths are speculated to be politically triggered by politicians attempting to prevent them from covering political scandals The New York Times published a news report on the matter titled In Mexico it s easy to kill a journalist on it mentioning how during EPN s government Mexico became one of the worst countries on which to be a journalist The assassination of journalist Javier Valdez on May received national coverage with multiple news journalists asking for real protection as well as freedom of speech The president announced to be deeply wounded by such death Despite this Mexican citizens as well as political party of opposition perceived the presidential words as hypocritical and the outlook does not look favorable with Mexico already leading as the country most journalist killed in with assassinations br On June The New York Times in conjunction with news reporter Carmen Aristegui and even backed by a Televisa news reporter Carlos Loret de Mola reported that the Mexican Government uses a spyware software known as Pegasus to spy on targets such as Mexican News reporters and their families and Civil Rights Leaders and their families using text messages as lures Since the Mexican Government invested million worth of spyware Pegasus spyware infiltrates a person s cellphone and reports every detail of their messages e mails contacts and calendars After the revelation the Israeli manufacturer of the Pegasus spyware NSO Group re stated it only sold such technology to governments with an explicit agreement that such technology was meant only to combat organized crime by spying on it although once it sells the software it cannot control who they use it against and basically leaves the government s on their own to monitor themselves on not abusing the software The New York Times and independent forensic analysts analyzed the data of dozens of messages multiple times before proving their accusation and commented of such espionage towards news journalists and civil rights leaders as an effort from the Mexican Government to thwart the battle against corruption infecting every limb of Mexican Society and how highly unlikely it would be for such espionage it to receive Judicial Approval Edward Snowden who worked for US government s NSA before revealing it to spy on its citizens also said all evidence points to the Mexican government being the spy and on Twitter said it is a crime to the public br The hacking attempts were highly personalized for each target they would consist on sending text messages with an attached link and for the spyware to enter a users smartphone all it needed was for the smartphone owner to click on the link The news reporter Carmen Aristegui whom previously in had revealed a conflict of interest regarding the president ownership of a Mexican Casa Blanca White House and was unfairly fired from her job for airing such investigation herself received hacking attempts the most for any journalist who has been found targeted one of those attempts disguised as a message sent by an American Embassy in Mexico trying to help her with a problem with her Visa additionally Aristegui s son Emilio Aristegui received attempts for months despite being an under age year old teen News media perceived attempts at Aristegui as revenge from the Mexican government News reporter Carlos Loret de Mora received attempts While Juan E Pardinas the director of the Mexican Institute of Competitiveness also received multiple attempts where he was told men with guns were outside his house and another where a contact not on his list invited him to his father funeral because saying he was a close friend the attempt on his wife went as far as claiming Padilla was having an extramarital affair but she could only see the evidence if she clicked the link Also most of the parents protesters and the major leaders of the investigations of the Ayotzinapa Students Massacre received spyware messages so did the Women of Atenco a scandal directly tied to Enrique Pe a Nieto s time as Governor of the State of Mexico The New York Times article contained a picture of EPN br On June the day after The opposition political party National Action Party PAN denounced the Mexican government to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights for suspicions of violations towards human rights and requested them to lead an investigation citing such spying causes violations towards the article th of the Mexican Constitution as well as violating article th of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights While in response to the accusations Pe a Nieto made public that such technology was bought and indeed used by the Mexican government but he denied misuses and stated that it was only used to protect Mexicans by searching for criminal by saying he also felt spied upon but there was nothing more fake than blaming the Mexican government and that there was no proof saying he ordered the PGR an investigation and that he hoped under the law it can be applied against those that have raised false accusations against the government with the last part of the quote making journalist hacking victims feel threatened Which forced the Mexican president to call writer of the article Azam Ahmed to tell him he was not menacing him However due to his previous presidential scandals Pe a Nieto words lacked credibility to most Mexicans with journalist like Jorge Ramos complaining about how Enrique Pe a Nieto remains in power despite his illegal actions Later on the day political rival Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador AMLO who competed for the presidency against EPN in and intends to compete again in as the candidate from the MORENA political party was also revealed to be among the hacking targets with his son also as a target On June the National Human Rights Commission Mexico opened a case regarding the government espionage br As of February Reuters published an article stating the Mexican government has not properly investigated the Pegasus spyware usage to spy news journalists br br br Andr s Sep lveda claims of hacking the Mexican presidential election br On March in an article published by magazine Bloomberg Business Week a Colombian a hacker named Andr s Sep lveda claimed to have paid pesos by the Institutional Revolutionary Party PRI for hacking files including phone calls e mails and strategies pertaining Pe a Nieto s rivals respective political campaigns and also manipulate social media to create fake news against his opponents with fakes Twitter accounts whom helped him create fake trending topics and the perception of public enthusiasm towards Pe a Nieto s presidential campaign The election day he claims to have been watching a Live feed on Bogota Colombia and to start destroying evidence USBs cellphones computers right after Pe a Nieto was declared winner He said he was helped by a team of hackers which he led He also claims to have helped hack elections from other Latin American countries including Nicaragua Panama Honduras El Salvador Colombia Costa Rica Guatemala and Venezuela but said his Mexican operation was the most complex by far The hacker is on a year prison sentence for confessing and proving crimes on helping the campaign of Ivan Zuloagawithin his native Colombia While Juan Jos Rend n whom Sep lveda describes as his accomplice hasn t been proved guilty and still remains free The National Action Party PAN requested an investigation but on May the Consejo General del Instituto Nacional Electoral General Council of the National Electoral Institute discarded the investigation describing it as frivolous and that it was based on a single journalistic note presidential counselor Ciro Murayama said there wasn t enough evidence to lead an investigation and that they would sue PAN for promoting unjustified investigations leading to sourness between both political parties br br br Influence of perceived media manipulation of news in Mexican popular culture br The controversies regarding the perceived Televisa news media coverage in favor of the PRI and the spreading of fake news by the Mexican government has influenced Mexican popular culture Director and writer Luis Estrada released the black comedy film The Perfect Dictatorship it was based on the perceived media manipulation in Mexico Set in a Mexico with a tightly controlled media landscape the plot centered on a corrupt politician a fictional stand in for Enrique Pe a Nieto from a political party serving as a fictional stand in for the PRI and how he makes a deal with TV MX which serves as a stand in to Televisa to manipulate the diffusion of news towards his benefit in order to save his political career br br br
