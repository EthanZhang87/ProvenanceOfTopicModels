title: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections
id: 52547512
The Russian government was one of several foreign governments that interfered in the United States elections with the goals of sabotaging the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton boosting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump and increasing political and social discord in the United States According to the U S intelligence community the operation code named Project Lakhta was ordered directly by Russian president Vladimir Putin The hacking and disinformation campaign to damage Clinton and help Trump became the core of the scandal known as Russiagate The page Mueller Report made public in April examined over contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates br The Internet Research Agency IRA based in Saint Petersburg Russia and described as a troll farm created thousands of social media accounts that purported to be Americans supporting radical political groups and planned or promoted events in support of Trump and against Clinton They reached millions of social media users between and Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government controlled media and promoted on social media Additionally computer hackers affiliated with the Russian military intelligence service GRU infiltrated information systems of the Democratic National Committee DNC the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee DCCC and Clinton campaign officials notably chairman John Podesta and publicly released stolen files and emails through DCLeaks Guccifer and WikiLeaks during the election campaign Several individuals connected to Russia contacted various Trump campaign associates offering business opportunities to the Trump Organization and proffering damaging information on Clinton Russian government officials have denied involvement in any of the hacks or leaks br Russian interference activities triggered strong statements from U S intelligence agencies a direct warning by then U S president Barack Obama to Russian president Vladimir Putin renewed economic sanctions against Russia and closures of Russian diplomatic facilities and expulsion of their staff The Senate and House Intelligence Committees conducted their own investigations into the matter Donald Trump denied the interference had occurred br The Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of Russian interference in July including a special focus on links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies and suspected coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government Russian attempts to interfere in the election were first disclosed publicly by members of the United States Congress in September confirmed by US intelligence agencies in October and further detailed by the Director of National Intelligence office in January The dismissal of James Comey the FBI director by President Trump in May was partly because of Comey s investigation of the Russian interference br The FBI s work was taken over in May by former FBI director Robert Mueller who led a special counsel investigation until March Mueller concluded that Russian interference was sweeping and systematic and violated U S criminal law and he indicted twenty six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations The investigation also led to indictments and convictions of Trump campaign officials and associated Americans on unrelated charges The Mueller report made public in April examined numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that though the Trump campaign welcomed the Russian activities and expected to benefit from them there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates br The Republican led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation submitted the first in their five volume page report in July The committee concluded that the January intelligence community assessment alleging Russian interference was coherent and well constructed The first volume also concluded that the assessment was proper learning from analysts that there was no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions The final and fifth volume which was the result of three years of investigations was released in August ending one of the United States highest profile congressional inquiries The Committee report found that the Russian government had engaged in an extensive campaign to sabotage the election in favor of Trump which included assistance from some of Trump s own advisers br In November newly released passages from the Mueller special counsel investigation s report indicated Although WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the DNC in July and October and Stone a close associate to Donald Trump appeared to know in advance the materials were coming investigators did not have sufficient evidence to prove active participation in the hacks or knowledge that the electronic thefts were continuing br br br Background and Russian actors br br br Prior Russian election interference in Ukraine br The May Ukrainian presidential election was disrupted by cyberattacks over several days including the release of hacked emails attempted alteration of vote tallies and distributed denial of service attacks to delay the final result They were found to have been launched by pro Russian hackers Malware that would have displayed a graphic declaring far right candidate Dmytro Yarosh the electoral winner was removed from Ukraine s Central Election Commission less than an hour before polls closed Despite this Channel One Russia falsely reported that Yarosh had won broadcasting the same fake graphic that had been planted on the election commission s website Political scientist Peter Ordeshook said in These faked results were geared for a specific audience in order to feed the Russian narrative that has claimed from the start that ultra nationalists and Nazis were behind the revolution in Ukraine The same Sofacy malware used in the Central Election Commission hack was later found on the servers of the Democratic National Committee DNC Around the same time as Russia s attempt to hack the elections the Obama administration received a report suggesting that the Kremlin was building a disinformation program which could be used to interfere in Western politics br br br Vladimir Putin br br In December two unidentified senior intelligence officials told several U S news media outlets br that they were highly confident that the operation to interfere in the presidential election was personally directed by Vladimir Putin br Under Putin s direction the goals of the operation are reported to have evolved from first undermining American trust in their own democracy to undermining Clinton s campaign and by the fall of to directly helping Trump s campaign possibly because Putin believed Trump would ease economic sanctions Her presidential campaign s Russia policy advisor was Richard Lourie br The officials believe Putin became personally involved after Russia accessed the DNC computers because such an operation would require high level government approval White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest and Obama foreign policy advisor and speechwriter Ben Rhodes agreed with this assessment with Rhodes saying operations of this magnitude required Putin s consent br In January the Office of the Director of National Intelligence delivered a declassified report representing the work of the FBI the CIA and the NSA with a similar conclusion br br President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in aimed at the U S presidential election Russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the U S democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for president elect Trump We have high confidence in these judgments br Putin blamed Clinton for the mass protests in Russia against his rule according to the report Clinton was U S Secretary of State at the time FBI Director James Comey also has testified that Putin disliked Clinton and preferred her opponent and Clinton herself has accused Putin of having a grudge against her Michael McFaul who was U S ambassador to Russia said the operation could be a retaliation by Putin against Clinton Russian security expert Andrei Soldatov has said The Kremlin believes that with Clinton in the White House it will be almost impossible to lift sanctions against Russia So it is a very important question for Putin personally This is a question of national security br Russian officials have denied the allegations multiple times In June Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied any connection of Russia to the DNC hacks In December when U S intelligence officials publicly accused Putin of being directly involved in the covert operation Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he was astonished by this nonsense br Putin also has denied any Kremlin involvement in the election campaign though in June he told journalists that patriotically minded Russian hackers may have been responsible for the campaign cyberattacks against the U S and in he stated that he had wanted Trump to win the election because he talked about bringing the U S Russia relationship back to normal br br br U S counter disinformation team br The United States Department of State planned to use a unit formed with the intention of combating disinformation from the Russian government but it was disbanded in September after department heads missed the scope of propaganda before the U S election The unit had been in development for eight months prior to being scrapped Titled the Counter Disinformation Team it would have been a reboot of the Active Measures Working Group set up by the Reagan Administration It was created under the Bureau of International Information Programs Work began in with the intention of countering propaganda from Russian sources such as TV network RT formerly called Russia Today A beta website was ready and staff were hired by the U S State Department for the unit prior to its cancellation U S Intelligence officials explained to former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer John R Schindler writing in The New York Observer published at the time by Jared Kushner that the Obama Administration decided to cancel the unit as they were afraid of antagonizing Russia A State Department representative told the International Business Times after being contacted regarding the closure of the unit that the U S was disturbed by propaganda from Russia and the strongest defense was sincere communication U S Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy Richard Stengel was the point person for the unit before it was canceled Stengel had written in that RT was engaged in a disinformation campaign about Ukraine br br br Russian Institute for Strategic Studies br br In April Reuters cited several unnamed U S officials as having stated that the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies RISS had developed a strategy to sway the U S election to Donald Trump and failing that to disillusion voters The development of strategy was allegedly ordered by Putin and directed by former officers of Russian Foreign Intelligence Service SVR retired SVR general Leonid Petrovich Reshetnikov being head of the RISS at the time The Institute had been a part of the SVR until whereafter it has worked for the Russian Presidential Administration br The U S officials said the propaganda efforts began in March The first set of recommendations issued in June proposed that Russia support a candidate for U S president more favorable to Russia than Obama had been via Russia backed news outlets and a social media campaign It supported Trump until October when another conclusion was made that Hillary Clinton was likely to win and the strategy should be modified to work to undermine U S voters faith in their electoral system and a Clinton presidency by alleging voter fraud in the election RISS director Mikhail Fradkov and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the allegations br br br Preparation br According to a February criminal indictment more than two years before the election two Russian women obtained visas for what the indictment alleged was a three week reconnaissance tour of the United States including battleground states such as Colorado Michigan Nevada and New Mexico to gather intelligence on American politics The indictment alleged that another Russian operative visited Atlanta in November on a similar mission In order to establish American identities for individuals and groups within specific social media communities hundreds of email PayPal and bank accounts and fraudulent driver s licenses were created for fictitious Americans and sometimes real Americans whose Social Security numbers had been stolen br br br Social media and Internet trolls br br According to the special counsel investigation s Mueller Report officially named Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the Presidential Election the first method of Russian interference used the Internet Research Agency IRA a Kremlin linked troll farm to wage a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton The Internet Research Agency also sought to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States br By February internal IRA documents showed an order to support the candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders while IRA members were to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary Clinton and the rest of the candidates From June the IRA organized election rallies in the U S often promoting Trump s campaign while opposing Clinton s campaign The IRA posed as Americans hiding their Russian background while asking Trump campaign members for campaign buttons flyers and posters for the rallies br br Russian use of social media to disseminate propaganda content was very broad Facebook and Twitter were used but also Reddit Tumblr Pinterest Medium YouTube Vine and Google among other sites Instagram was by far the most used platform and one that largely remained out of the public eye until late The Mueller report lists IRA created groups on Facebook including purported conservative groups e g Tea Party News purported Black social justice groups e g Blacktivist LGBTQ groups LGBT United and religious groups United Muslims of America The IRA Twitter accounts included TEN GOP claiming to be related to the Tennessee Republican Party jenn abrams and Pamela Moore both claimed to be Trump supporters and both had followers br Several Trump campaign members Donald J Trump Jr Eric Trump Kellyanne Conway Brad Parscale and Michael T Flynn linked or reposted material from the IRA s TEN GOP Twitter account listed above Other people who responded to IRA social media accounts include Michael McFaul Sean Hannity Roger Stone and Michael Flynn Jr br Advertisements bought by Russian operatives for the Facebook social media site are estimated to have reached million users But many more Facebook users were contacted by accounts created by Russian actors Facebook accounts are known to have been created by Russians during the campaign Of those accounts six generated content that was shared at least million times according to research done by Jonathan Albright research director for Columbia University s Tow Center for Digital Journalism The most strident Internet promoters of Trump were paid Russian propagandists trolls who were estimated by The Guardian to number several thousand By the U S news media was focusing on the Russian operations on Facebook and Twitter and Russian operatives moved on to Instagram The Mueller Report found the IRA spent for more than Facebook advertisements from June to May which included anti Clinton and pro Trump advertisements In comparison Clinton and Trump campaigns spent million on Facebook ads br Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government controlled outlets RT and Sputnik to be popularized on pro Russian accounts on Twitter and other social media Researchers have compared Russian tactics during the U S election to the active measures of the Soviet Union during the Cold War but made easier by the use of social media br Monitoring pro Trump social media accounts over a year period researchers J M Berger Andrew Weisburd and Clint Watts found the accounts denigrated critics of Russian activities in Syria and propagated falsehoods about Clinton s health Watts found Russian propaganda to be aimed at fomenting dissent or conspiracies against the U S government and its institutions and by autumn of amplifying attacks on Clinton and support for Trump via social media Internet trolls botnets and websites br br Monitoring news on Twitter directed at one state Michigan prior to the election Philip N Howard found about half of it fabricated or untrue the other half came from real news sources In continued analysis after the election Howard and other researchers found the most prominent methods of misinformation were ostensibly organic posting not advertisements and influence operation activity increased after the and was not limited to the election br Facebook originally denied that fake news on their platform had influenced the election and had insisted it was unaware of any Russian financed advertisements but later admitted that about million Americans may have seen posts published by Russia based operatives Criticized for failing to stop fake news from spreading on its platform during the election Facebook originally thought that the fake news problem could be solved by engineering but in May it announced plans to hire content reviewers br According to an analysis by BuzzFeed News the top performing false election stories from hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs generated shares reactions and comments on Facebook br In September Facebook told congressional investigators it had discovered that hundreds of fake accounts linked to a Russian troll farm had bought in advertisements targeting the U S election audience The ads which ran between June and May primarily focused on divisive social issues roughly were geographically targeted Facebook has also turned over information about the Russian related ad buys to Special Counsel Robert Mueller Approximately adverts were involved and these were viewed by between four and five million Facebook users prior to the election On November the House Intelligence Committee released a sample of Facebook ads and pages that had been financially linked to the Internet Research Agency A analysis by The Washington Post s Outlook reviewed a number of troll accounts active in and and found that many resembled organic users Rather than wholly negative and obvious many confirmed troll accounts deployed humor and were astute in exploiting questions of culture and identity and are frequently among the first to push new divisive conversations some of which moved quickly to mainstream print media br In January a study from New York University s Center for Social Media and Politics about the influence of Russian trolls on Twitter found they had little influence on voters attitudes polarization or voting behavior The study was limited to Twitter and did not examine other social media such as the much larger Facebook It did not address the Russian hack and leak operations Another major study in by University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson suggested those probably played a significant role in the race s outcome Lastly it doesn t suggest that foreign influence operations aren t a threat at all It found that voters who were already favorably disposed to Trump were exposed the most Only percent of Twitter users accounted for percent of the exposure to accounts that Twitter identified as Russian troll accounts Highly partisan Republicans were exposed to nine times more posts than non Republicans br br br Cyberattack on Democrats br br According to the Mueller Report the second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service the GRU hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign including that of campaign chairman John Podesta and also hacking into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee DCCC and the Democratic National Committee DNC As a result the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU s personas DCLeaks and Guccifer br Starting in March the Russian military intelligence agency GRU sent spearphishing emails targeted more than individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party or the Clinton campaign according to the Special Counsel s July Indictment Using malware to explore the computer networks of the DNC and DCCC they harvested tens of thousands of emails and attachments and deleted computer logs and files to obscure evidence of their activities br These were saved and released in stages to the public during the three months before the election Some were released strategically to distract the public from media events that were either beneficial to the Clinton campaign or harmful to Trump s br The first tranche of emails and attachments was released on July three days before the Democratic convention The resulting news coverage created the impression that the Democratic National Committee was biased against Clinton s Democratic primary challenger Bernie Sanders who received of votes cast in the Democratic presidential primaries and forced DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz to resign disrupting the plans of the Clinton campaign br A second tranche was released on October a few hours after the Obama Administration released a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence accusing the Russian government of interfering in the election through hacking and just minutes after The Washington Post reported on the Access Hollywood videotape where Trump boasted about grabbing women by the pussy The stolen documents effectively distracted media and voter attention from both stories br Stolen emails and documents were given both to platforms created by hackers a website called DCLeaks and a persona called Guccifer claiming to be a lone hacker and to an unidentified organization believed to be WikiLeaks The Russians registered the domain dcleaks com using principally Bitcoin to pay for the domain and the hosting br br br Podesta hack br br John Podesta Chairman of Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign received a phishing email on March sent by Russian operatives purporting to alert him of a compromise in the system and urging him to change his password immediately by clicking on a link This allowed Russian hackers to access around emails from Podesta s private account br John Podesta later told Meet the Press that the FBI spoke to him only once regarding his hacked emails and that he had not been sure what had been taken until a month before the election on October when WikiLeaks Julian Assange started dumping them out and said they would all dump out that s when I knew that they had the contents of my email account br The WikiLeaks October dump started less than an hour after The Washington Post released the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording Access Hollywood tape WikiLeaks announced on Twitter that it was in possession of of Podesta s emails and a few hours after the Obama Administration released a statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the director of National Intelligence stating The U S Intelligence Community USIC is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e mails from U S persons and institutions including from U S political organizations br It initially released of these br The cache included emails containing transcripts of Clinton s paid speeches to Wall Street banks controversial comments from staffers about Catholic voters infighting among employees of the Clinton campaign as well as potential vice presidential picks for Clinton The Clinton campaign did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails but emphasized they were stolen and distributed by parties hostile to Clinton and that top national security officials had stated that documents can be faked as part of a sophisticated Russian misinformation campaign br Podesta s e mails once released by WikiLeaks formed the basis for Pizzagate a debunked conspiracy theory that falsely posited that Podesta and other Democratic Party officials were involved in a child trafficking ring based out of pizzerias in Washington D C br br br DNC hack br br The United States Intelligence Community concluded by January that the GRU using the names Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear had gained access to the computer network of the Democratic National Committee DNC the formal governing body of the Democratic Party in July and maintained it until at least June br when they began leaking the stolen information via the Guccifer online persona DCLeaks com and Wikileaks Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as DNC chairwoman following the release of e mails by WikiLeaks that showed DNC officials discussing Bernie Sanders and his presidential campaign in a derisive and derogatory manner Emails leaked included personal information about Democratic Party donors with credit card and Social Security numbers emails by Wasserman Schultz calling a Sanders campaign official a damn liar br Following the July publication of a large number of hacked emails by WikiLeaks the FBI announced that it would investigate the theft of DNC emails br br br Intelligence analysis of attack br In June and July cybersecurity experts and firms including CrowdStrike Fidelis FireEye Mandiant SecureWorks Symantec and ThreatConnect stated the DNC email leaks were part of a series of cyberattacks on the DNC committed by two Russian intelligence groups called Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear also known respectively as APT and APT The Dukes ThreatConnect also noted possible links between the DC Leaks project and Russian intelligence operations because of a similarity with Fancy Bear attack patterns SecureWorks added that the actor group was operating from Russia on behalf of the Russian government de Volkskrant later reported that Dutch intelligence agency AIVD had penetrated the Russian hacking group Cozy Bear in and observed them in hack the State Department in real time while capturing pictures of the hackers via a security camera in their workspace American British and Dutch intelligence services had also observed stolen DNC emails on Russian military intelligence networks br br br Intelligence reaction and indictment br On October Secretary Johnson and Director Clapper issued a joint statement that the intelligence community is confident the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e mails from U S persons and institutions including from U S political organizations and that the disclosures of hacked e mails on sites like DCLeaks com and WikiLeaks are consistent with the Russian directed efforts br In the July indictment by the Justice Department of twelve Russian GRU intelligence officials posing as a Guccifer persona for conspiring to interfere in the elections br was for hacking into computers of the Clinton campaign the Democratic National Committee state election boards and secretaries of several states The indictment describes a sprawling and sustained cyberattack on at least three hundred people connected to the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign The leaked stolen files were released in stages a tactic wreaking havoc on the Democratic Party throughout much of the election season br One collection of data that hackers obtained and that may have become a devastating weapon against the Clinton campaign was the campaign s data analytics and voter turnout models extremely useful in targeting messages to key constituencies that Clinton needed to mobilize These voters were later bombarded by Russian operatives with negative information about Clinton on social media br br br WikiLeaks br br In April CIA Director Mike Pompeo said WikiLeaks was a hostile intelligence agency aided by foreign states including Russia and that the U S Intelligence Community concluded that Russia s propaganda outlet RT had conspired with WikiLeaks br WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange have made a number of statements denying that the Russian government was the source of the material However an anonymous CIA official said that Russian officials transferred the hacked e mails to WikiLeaks using a circuitous route from Russia s military intelligence services GRU to WikiLeaks via third parties br In a leaked private message on Twitter Assange wrote that in the election it would be much better for GOP to win and that Hillary Clinton was a sadistic sociopath br br br Hacking of Congressional candidates br Hillary Clinton was not the only Democrat attacked Caches of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee documents stolen by Guccifer were also released to reporters and bloggers around the U S As one Democratic candidate put it Our entire internal strategy plan was made public and suddenly all this material was out there and could be used against me The New York Times noted The seats that Guccifer targeted in the document dumps were hardly random They were some of the most competitive House races in the country br br br Hacking of Republicans br On January FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia succeeded in collecting some information from Republican affiliated targets but did not leak it to the public In earlier statements an FBI official stated Russian attempts to access the RNC server were unsuccessful or had reportedly told the RNC chair that their servers were secure but that email accounts of individual Republicans including Colin Powell were breached Over emails from Colin Powell were posted on the website DC Leaks One state Republican Party Illinois may have had some of its email accounts hacked br br br Civil DNC lawsuit against Russian Federation br br On April the Democratic National Committee filed a civil lawsuit in federal court in New York accusing the Russian Government the Trump campaign WikiLeaks and others of conspiracy to alter the course of the presidential election and asking for monetary damages and a declaration admitting guilt The lawsuit was dismissed by the judge because New York does not recognize the specific tort claims pressed in the suit the judge did not make a finding on whether there was or was not collusion between defendants and Russia during the presidential election br br br Calls by Trump for Russians to hack or find Clinton s deleted emails br At a news conference on July Trump publicly called on Russia to hack and release Hillary Clinton s deleted emails from her private server during her tenure in the State Department br br Russia if you re listening I hope you re able to find the emails that are missing I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press br Trump s comment was condemned by the press and political figures including some Republicans he replied that he had been speaking sarcastically Several Democratic Senators said Trump s comments appeared to violate the Logan Act and Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe added that Trump s call could be treasonous br The July federal indictment of Russian GRU agents said that the first and unsuccessful attempt by Russian hackers to infiltrate the computer servers inside Clinton s offices took place on the same day July Trump made his Russia if you re listening appeal While no direct link with Trump s remark was alleged in the indictment journalist Jane Mayer called the timing striking br Trump asserted in March that he had been joking when he made the remark Katy Tur of NBC News had interviewed Trump immediately after the remark noting she gave him an opportunity to characterize it as a joke but he did not br br br Targeting of important voting blocs and institutions br In her analysis of the Russian influence on the election Kathleen Hall Jamieson argues that Russians aligned themselves with the geographic and demographic objectives of the Trump campaign using trolls social media and hacked information to target certain important constituencies br br br Attempts to suppress African American votes and spread alienation br br According to Vox the Russian Internet Research Agency IRA focused on the culture of Muslims Christians Texas and LGBTQ people to engage those communities as part of a broader strategy to deepen social and political divisions within the U S but no other group received as much attention as Black Americans whose voter turnout has been historically crucial to the election of Democrats Russia s influence campaign used an array of tactics aiming to reduce their vote for Hillary Clinton according to a December report The Tactics Tropes of the Internet Research Agency br commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee br A total Facebook pages targeting Black Americans and YouTube channels that posted videos related to police violence against African Americans br The covertly Russian Instagram account blackstagram had more than followers A variety of Facebook pages targeting African Americans and later determined to be Russian amassed a total of million individual followers the report found The Facebook page for the Russian Blacktivist garnered more hits than Black Lives Matter s non Russian Facebook page br Influence operations included recruiting typically unknowing assets who would stage events and spread content from Russian influencers spreading videos of police abuse and spreading misleading information about how to vote and whom to vote for The attempt to target Black Americans has been compared to the KGB s attempt to foster racial tensions during Operation INFEKTION br br br Arousing conservative voters br At least social media pages drawing million followers were created by Russian agents to target the American political right and promote the Trump candidacy br An example of the targeting was the adding of Blue Lives Matter material to social media platforms by Russian operatives after the Black Lives Matter movement moved to the center of public attention in America and sparked a pro police reaction br Jamieson noted there was reason to believe Donald Trump would under perform among two normally dependable conservative Republican voting blocs churchgoing Christians and military service members and their families It was thought pious Christians were put off by Trump s lifestyle as a Manhattan socialite known for his three marriages and many affairs but not for any religious beliefs who had boasted of groping women Military personnel might lack enthusiasm for a candidate who avoided service in Vietnam but who described himself as a brave soldier in having to face his personal Vietnam of the threat of sexually transmitted diseases and who mocked Gold Star parents and former prisoner of war John McCain To overcome Trump s possible poor reputation among evangelicals and veterans Russian trolls created memes that exploited typical conservative social attitudes about people of color Muslims and immigrants One such meme juxtaposed photographs of a homeless veteran and an undocumented immigrant alluding to the belief that undocumented immigrants receive special treatment CNN exit polls showed that Trump led Clinton among veterans by percentage points and won a higher percentage of the evangelical vote than either of the two previous Republican presidential nominees indicating that this tactic may have succeeded br br br Intrusions into state election systems br A report by the Senate Intelligence Committee found an unprecedented level of activity against state election infrastructure by Russian intelligence in The activity occurred in all states and is thought by many officials and experts to have been a trial run to probe American defenses and identify weaknesses in the vast back end apparatus voter registration operations state and local election databases electronic poll books and other equipment of state election systems The report warned that the United States remains vulnerable in the election br Of particular concern to the committee report was the Russians hacking of three companies that provide states with the back end systems that have increasingly replaced the thick binders of paper used to verify voters identities and registration status br br br Intrusions into state voter registration systems br During the summer and fall of Russian hackers intruded into voter databases and software systems in different states alarming Obama administration officials to the point that they took the unprecedented step of contacting Moscow directly via the Moscow Washington hotline and warning that the attacks risked setting off a broader conflict br br As early as June the FBI sent a warning to states about bad actors probing state elections systems to seek vulnerabilities In September FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Judiciary Committee that the FBI was investigating Russian hackers attempting to disrupt the election and that federal investigators had detected hacker related activities in state voter registration databases which independent assessments determined were soft targets for hackers Comey stated there were multiple attempts to hack voter database registrations Director of National Intelligence James Clapper attributed Russian hacking attempts to Vladimir Putin br In August the FBI issued a nationwide flash alert warning state election officials about hacking attempts In September U S Department of Homeland Security officials and the National Association of Secretaries of State announced that hackers had penetrated or sought to penetrate the voter registration systems in more than states over the previous few months Federal investigators attributed these attempts to Russian government sponsored hackers and specifically to Russian intelligence agencies Four of the intrusions into voter registration databases were successful including intrusions into the Illinois and Arizona databases Although the hackers did not appear to change or manipulate data Illinois officials said information on up to registered voters was stolen The FBI and DHS increased their election security coordination efforts with state officials as a result Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson reported that states had requested voting system security assistance from DHS The department also offered risk assessments to the states but just four states expressed interest as the election was rapidly approaching The reports of the database intrusions prompted alarm from Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid Democrat of Nevada who wrote to the FBI saying foreign attempts to cast doubt on free and fair elections was a danger to democracy not seen since the Cold War br A June article in The Intercept described how a top secret National Security Agency report dated May details a months long Russian hacking effort against the U S election infrastructure The NSA did not draw conclusions but reported the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system with disconcertingly uncertain results The NSA report revealed that the Russian military s GRU hackers used spearfishing attacks to successfully get employee login credentials and login information at VR Systems an election software vendor That information can be used to penetrate corporate VPNs email or cloud services allowing access to internal corporate data Two months later a second attack used trojanized Microsoft Word documents that were supposedly from a VR systems employee They targeted officials at local government organizations who were involved in the management of voter registration systems This type of attack gave the hackers the same unlimited access and capabilities as trusted users The NSA was uncertain about the results of this attack The report detailed other Russian attacks br On September federal authorities notified the election officials of states that their election systems had been targeted In most cases states said they were told the systems were not breached Over a year after the initial warnings this was the first official confirmation many state governments received that their states specifically had been targeted Moreover top elections officials of the states of Wisconsin and California have denied the federal claim California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said California voters can further rest assured that the California Secretary of State elections infrastructure and websites were not hacked or breached by Russian cyber actors Our notification from DHS last Friday was not only a year late it also turned out to be bad information br In May the Senate Intelligence Committee released its interim report on election security The committee concluded on a bipartisan basis that the response of the U S Department of Homeland Security to Russian government sponsored efforts to undermine confidence in the U S voting process was inadequate The committee reported that the Russian government was able to penetrate election systems in at least and possibly up to states and that in a smaller subset of states infiltrators could have altered or deleted voter registration data although they lacked the ability to manipulate individual votes or vote tallies The committee wrote that the infiltrators failure to exploit vulnerabilities in election systems could have been because they decided against taking action or because they were merely gathering information and testing capabilities for a future attack To prevent future infiltrations the committee made a number of recommendations including that at a minimum any machine purchased going forward should have a voter verified paper trail and no WiFi capability br br br Investigation into financial flows br By January a multi agency investigation conducted by the FBI the CIA the NSA the Justice Department the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and representatives of the DNI was underway looking into how the Russian government may have secretly financed efforts to help Trump win the election had been conducted over several months by six federal agencies Investigations into Carter Page Paul Manafort and Roger Stone were underway on January the eve of the presidential inauguration br br br Money funneled through the NRA br By January the FBI was investigating the possible funneling of illegal money by Aleksandr Torshin a deputy governor of the Central Bank of Russia through the National Rifle Association of America which was then used to help Donald Trump win the presidency Torshin is known to have close connections both to Russia s president Vladimir Putin and to the NRA and he has been charged with money laundering in other countries br The NRA reported spending million to support the Trump campaign three times what it spent on Mitt Romney in and spent more than any other independent group including the leading Trump superPAC Sources with connections to the NRA have stated that the actual amount spent was much higher than million The subunits within the organization which made the donations are not generally required to disclose their donors br Spanish special prosecutor Jos Grinda Gonzalez has said that in early the Spanish police gave wiretapped audio to the FBI of telephone discussions between Torshin and convicted money launderer and mafia boss Alexander Romanov Torshin met with Donald Trump Jr at an NRA event in May while attempting to broker a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin br Maria Butina a Russian anti gun control activist who has served as a special assistant to Torshin and came to the U S on a student visa to attend university classes in Washington claimed both before and after the election that she was part of the Trump campaign s communications with Russia Like Torshin she cultivated a close relationship with the NRA In February Butina started a consulting business called Bridges LLC with Republican political operative Paul Erickson During Trump s presidential campaign Erickson contacted Rick Dearborn one of Trump s advisors writing in an email that he had close ties both to the NRA and to Russia and asking how a back channel meeting between Trump and Putin could be set up The email was later turned over to federal investigators as part of the inquiry into Russia s meddling in the presidential election On July Butina was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and charged with conspiring to act as an unregistered Russian agent who had attempted to create a backchannel of communications between American Republicans conservatives and Russian officials by infiltrating the National Rifle Association the National Prayer Breakfast and conservative religious organizations br br br Money from Russian oligarchs br As of April Mueller s investigators were examining whether Russian oligarchs directly or indirectly provided illegal cash donations to the Trump campaign and inauguration Investigators were examining whether oligarchs invested in American companies or think tanks having political action committees connected to the campaign as well as money funneled through American straw donors to the Trump campaign and inaugural fund At least one oligarch Viktor Vekselberg was detained and his electronic devices searched as he arrived at a New York area airport on his private jet in early Vekselberg was questioned about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments made to Michael Cohen after the election through Columbus Nova the American affiliate of Vekselberg s Renova Group Another oligarch was also detained on a recent trip to the United States but it is unclear if he was searched Investigators have also asked a third oligarch who has not traveled to the United States to voluntarily provide documents and an interview br br br Intelligence analysis and reports br br br Non U S intelligence br br In part because U S intelligence agencies cannot surveil U S citizens without a warrant they were slow to recognize the pattern of Russia s efforts From late until the summer of during routine surveillance of Russians several countries discovered suspicious interactions between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents The UK Germany Estonia Poland and Australia and possibly the Netherlands and France relayed their discoveries to the U S br Because the materials were highly sensitive GCHQ director Robert Hannigan contacted CIA director John O Brennan directly to give him information Concerned Brennan gave classified briefings to U S Congress Gang of Eight during late August and September Referring only to intelligence allies and not to specific sources Brennan told the Gang of Eight he had received evidence that Russia might be trying to help Trump win the U S election It was later revealed that the CIA had obtained intelligence from sources inside the Russian government that stated that Putin gave direct orders to disparage Clinton and help Trump br On May Brennan stated to the House Intelligence Committee that Russia brazenly interfered in the U S elections He said he first picked up on Russia s active meddling last summer and that he had on August warned his counterpart at Russia s FSB intelligence agency Alexander Bortnikov against further interference br The first public U S government assertion of Russian efforts to influence the election came in a joint statement on September by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Adam Schiff the top Democrats on the Senate and House Intelligence Committees respectively br br br October ODNI DHS joint statement br br At the Aspen security conference in summer Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Vladimir Putin wanted to retaliate against perceived U S intervention in Russian affairs with the Russian protests and the ousting of Viktor Yanukovych in the Revolution of Dignity In July consensus grew within the CIA that Russia had hacked the DNC In a joint statement on October the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence expressed confidence that Russia had interfered in the presidential election by stealing emails from politicians and U S groups and publicizing the information On December intelligence sources told CNN they had gained confidence that Russia s efforts were aimed at helping Trump win the election br On October the U S government formally accused Russia of hacking the DNC s computer networks to interfere in the presidential election with the help of organizations like WikiLeaks The Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security claimed in their joint statement The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e mails on sites like DCLeaks com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian directed efforts This was corroborated by a report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI in conjunction with the CIA the FBI and the NSA on January br br br December CIA report br On December the CIA told U S legislators the U S Intelligence Community had concluded in a consensus view that Russia conducted operations to assist Donald Trump in winning the presidency stating that individuals with connections to the Russian government previously known to the intelligence community had given WikiLeaks hacked emails from the DNC and John Podesta The agencies further stated that Russia had hacked the RNC as well but did not leak information obtained from there These assessments were based on evidence obtained before the election br br br FBI inquiries br FBI has been investigating the Russian government s attempt to influence the presidential election including whether campaign associates of Donald Trump s were involved in Russia s efforts since July br Following the July publication of a large number of emails by WikiLeaks the FBI announced that it would investigate the theft of DNC emails br An earlier event investigated by the FBI was a May meeting between the Donald Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos and Alexander Downer in a London wine bar where Papadopoulos disclosed his inside knowledge of a large trove of Hillary Clinton emails that could potentially damage her campaign br Papadopoulos had gained this knowledge on March when he held a meeting with Joseph Mifsud who told Papadopoulos the Russians had dirt on Clinton in the form of thousands of stolen emails This occurred before the hacking of the DNC computers had become public knowledge and Papadopoulos later bragged that the Trump campaign was aware the Russian government had dirt on Hillary Clinton In February Michael Cohen implicated Trump before the U S Congress writing that Trump had knowledge that Roger Stone was communicating with WikiLeaks about releasing emails stolen from the DNC in br John Podesta later testified before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that in April the DNC did not know their computers had been hacked leading Adam Schiff to state So if the Clinton campaign wasn t aware in April that the hacking had even occurred the first campaign to be notified the Russians were in possession of stolen emails would have been the Trump campaign through Mr Papadopoulos br In June the FBI notified the Illinois Republican Party that some of its email accounts may have been hacked In December an FBI official stated that Russian attempts to access the RNC server were unsuccessful In an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News RNC chair Reince Priebus stated they communicated with the FBI when they learned about the DNC hacks and a review determined their servers were secure On January FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russia succeeded in collecting some information from Republican affiliated targets but did not leak it to the public br On October The New York Times said the FBI had been examining possible connections between the Trump campaign and Russia but did not find any clear links At the time FBI officials thought Russia was motivated to undermine confidence in the U S political process rather than specifically support Trump During a House Intelligence Committee hearing in early December the CIA said it was certain of Russia s intent to help Trump On December CIA Director John O Brennan sent a message to his staff saying he had spoken with FBI Director James Comey and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and that all agreed with the CIA s conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election with the motive of supporting Donald Trump s candidacy br On December the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security DHS released an unclassified report that gave new technical details regarding methods used by Russian intelligence services for affecting the U S election government political organizations and private sector br The report included malware samples and other technical details as evidence that the Russian government had hacked the Democratic National Committee Alongside the report DHS published Internet Protocol addresses malware and files used by Russian hackers An article in the S ddeutsche Zeitung discussed the difficulty of proof in matters of cybersecurity One analyst told the S ddeutsche Zeitung that U S intelligence services could be keeping some information secret to protect their sources and analysis methods Clapper later said the classified version contained a lot of the substantiation that could not be put in the public report br On March during public testimony to the House Intelligence Committee FBI director James Comey confirmed the existence of an FBI investigation into Russian interference and Russian links to the Trump campaign including the question of whether there had been any coordination between the campaign and the Russians He said the investigation began in July Comey made the unusual decision to reveal the ongoing investigation to Congress citing benefit to the public good On October Secretary Johnson and Director Clapper issued a joint statement that the intelligence community is confident the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e mails from U S persons and institutions including from U S political organizations and that the disclosures of hacked e mails on sites like DCLeaks com and WikiLeaks are consistent with the Russian directed efforts The statement also noted that the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia to influence public opinion there On December DHS and FBI released a Joint Analysis Report JAR which further expands on that statement by providing details of the tools and infrastructure used by Russian intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and infrastructure associated with the recent U S election as well as a range of U S government political and private sector entities br br br January Intelligence Community Assessment br br On January after briefing the president the president elect and members of the Senate and House the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ODNI released a de classified version of the report on Russian activities The intelligence community assessment ICA produced by the CIA the FBI the NSA and the ODNI asserted that Russia had carried out a massive cyber operation ordered by Russian president Putin with the goal to sabotage the U S elections The agencies concluded that Putin and the Russian government tried to help Trump win the election by discrediting Hillary Clinton and portraying her negatively relative to Trump and that Russia had conducted a multipronged cyber campaign consisting of hacking and the extensive use of social media and trolls as well as open propaganda on Russian controlled news platforms The ICA contained no information about how the data was collected and provided no evidence underlying its conclusions Clapper said the classified version contained substantiation that could not be made public A large part of the ICA was dedicated to criticizing Russian TV channel RT America which it described as a messaging tool for a Kremlin directed campaign to undermine faith in the U S Government and fuel political protest br On March James Clapper said in an interview with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press that the January ICA did not have evidence of collusion but that it might have become available after he left the government He agreed with Todd that the idea of collusion was not proven at that time On May in an interview with George Stephanopoulos Clapper explained more about the state of evidence for or against any collusion at the time of the January IC assessment saying there was no evidence of any collusion included in that report that s not to say there wasn t evidence He also stated he was also unaware of the existence of the formal investigation at that time In November Clapper explained that at the time of the Stephanopoulos interview he did not know about the efforts of George Papadopoulos to set up meetings between Trump associates and Kremlin officials nor about the meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr Jared Kushner Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer br In June E W Priestap the assistant director of the FBI Counterintelligence Division told the PBS Newshour program that Russian intelligence used fake news and propaganda and they also used online amplifiers to spread the information to as many people as possible during the election br br br James Comey testimony br br In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June former FBI Director James Comey said he had no doubt Russia interfered in the election and that the interference was a hostile act Concerning the motives of his dismissal Comey said I take the president at his word that I was fired because of the Russia investigation Something about the way I was conducting it the president felt created pressure on him he wanted to relieve He also said that while he was director Trump was not under investigation br br br U S government response br At least distinct investigations were started to examine aspects of Russian interference in the United States elections br br br U S Senate br Members of the U S Senate Intelligence Committee traveled to Ukraine and Poland in and learned about Russian operations to influence their elections br Senator McCain called for a special select committee of the U S Senate to investigate Russian meddling in the election and called election meddling an act of war br The Senate Intelligence Committee began work on its bipartisan inquiry in January In May the committee voted unanimously to give both chairmen solo subpoena power Soon after the committee issued a subpoena to the Trump campaign for all Russia related documents emails and telephone records In December it was also looking at the presidential campaign of Green Party s Jill Stein for potential collusion with the Russians br In May the Senate Intelligence Committee released the interim findings of their bipartisan investigation finding that Russia interfered in the election with the goal of helping Trump gain the presidency stating Our staff concluded that the intelligence community s conclusions were accurate and on point The Russian effort was extensive sophisticated and ordered by President Putin himself for the purpose of helping Donald Trump and hurting Hillary Clinton br On January Senator Ben Cardin of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee released Putin s Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe Implications for U S National Security The report said the interference in the United States elections was a part of Putin s asymmetric assault on democracy worldwide including targeting elections in a number of countries such as Britain France and Germany by Moscow sponsored hacking internet trolling and financing for extremist political groups br br br committee reports br The Senate Intelligence Committee commissioned two reports that extensively described the Russian campaign to influence social media during the election br One report The Tactics Tropes of the Internet Research Agency was produced by the New Knowledge cybersecurity company aided by researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research LLC Another The IRA Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States by the Computational Propaganda Project of Oxford University along with the social media analysis company Graphika br The New Knowledge report highlighted the energy and imagination of the Russian effort to sway American opinion and divide the country and their focus on African Americans br The report identified more than million engagements likes comments shares etc with Internet Research Agency content and faulted U S social media companies for allowing their platforms to be co opted for foreign propaganda Examples of efforts included campaigning for African American voters to boycott elections or follow the wrong voting procedures in encouraging extreme right wing voters to be more confrontational and spreading sensationalist conspiratorial and other forms of junk political news and misinformation to voters across the political spectrum br br br committee report br br On April the Senate Intelligence Committee released a unanimous heavily redacted report reviewing the January intelligence community assessment on Russian interference The committee felt that the assessment brought a coherent and well constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the U S presidential election specifically that the interference was unprecedented in its manner and aggressiveness The Senate committee heard specific intelligence reporting to support the assessment that Putin and the Russian Government demonstrated a preference for candidate Trump and that Putin approved and directed the interference br The committee praised the assessment as an impressive accomplishment noting that the assessment reflects proper analytic tradecraft despite a limited timeframe The committee also stated that interviews with those who drafted and prepared the ICA affirmed that analysts were under no political pressure to reach specific conclusions A disagreement between the CIA and the NSA of the agencies confidence level of Russia s preference for Trump was reasonable transparent and openly debated among the agencies and analysts Additionally the committee found that the Steele dossier was not used by the assessment to support any of its analytic judgments br On August the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee released the fifth and final volume of their page report ending one of the United States highest profile congressional inquiries The Committee report which was based on three years of investigations found that the Russian government had engaged in an extensive campaign to sabotage the election in favor of Trump which included assistance from some members of Trump s own advisers Volume said the Trump administration had used novel claims of executive privilege to obstruct the inquiry The report said that Trump s campaign staff were eager to accept Russia s help however after the release of the report acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Marco Rubio issued a statement stating the committee found absolutely no evidence that then candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the election br br br U S House of Representatives br After bipartisan calls to action in December br the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence launched an investigation in January about Russian election meddling including possible ties between Trump s campaign and Russia The Senate Intelligence Committee launched its own parallel probe in January as well Fifteen months later in April the House Intelligence Committee s Republican majority released its final report amid harsh criticism from Democratic members of the committee The report found no evidence of collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign br On February Republican Congressman Darrell Issa called for a special prosecutor to investigate whether Russia meddled with the U S election and was in contact with Trump s team during the presidential campaign saying it would be improper for Trump s appointee former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to lead the investigation In March Democratic ranking committee member Adam Schiff said there was sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation and claimed to have seen more than circumstantial evidence of collusion br On April Republican committee chairman Devin Nunes temporarily recused himself from the investigation after the House Ethics Committee announced that it would investigate accusations that he had disclosed classified information without authorization He was replaced by Representative Mike Conaway Nunes was cleared of wrongdoing on December br The committee s probe was shut down on March acknowledging that Russians interfered in the elections through an active measures campaign promoting propaganda and fake news but rejecting the conclusion of intelligence agencies that Russia had favored Trump in the election although some Republican committee members distanced themselves from this assertion The committee s report did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government s efforts Conaway said they had uncovered only perhaps some bad judgment inappropriate meetings br Democrats on the committee objected to the Republicans closure of the investigation and their refusal to press key witnesses for further testimony or documentation which might have further established complicity of the Trump campaign with Russia Schiff issued a page status report outlining plans to continue the investigation including a list of additional witnesses to interview and documents to request br br br Obama administration br br U S president Obama and Vladimir Putin had a discussion about computer security issues in September which took place over the course of an hour and a half During the discussion which took place as a side segment during the then ongoing G summit in China Obama made his views known on cyber security matters between the U S and Russia Obama said Russian hacking stopped after his warning to Putin One month after that discussion the email leaks from the DNC cyber attack had not ceased and President Obama decided to contact Putin via the Moscow Washington hotline commonly known as the red phone on October Obama emphasized the gravity of the situation by telling Putin International law including the law for armed conflict applies to actions in cyberspace br On December Obama ordered the U S Intelligence Community to investigate Russian interference in the election and report before he left office on January U S Homeland Security Advisor and chief counterterrorism advisor to the president Lisa Monaco announced the study and said foreign intrusion into a U S election was unprecedented and would necessitate investigation by subsequent administrations The intelligence analysis would cover malicious cyberwarfare occurring between the and elections A senior administration official said the White House was confident Russia interfered in the election The official said the order by President Obama would be a lessons learned report with options including sanctions and covert cyber response against Russia br On December White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was critical of Trump s rejection of the conclusions of the U S Intelligence Community that Russia used cyberattacks to influence the election United States Secretary of State John Kerry spoke on December about President Obama s decision to approve the October joint statement by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence br Obama said the U S government would respond to Russia via overt and covert methods in order to send an unambiguous symbol to the world that any such interference would have harsh consequences in a December interview by NPR journalist Steve Inskeep He added that a motive behind the Russian operation could better be determined after completion of the intelligence report he ordered Obama emphasized that Russian efforts caused more harm to Clinton than to Trump during the campaign At a press conference the following day he highlighted his September admonition to Putin to cease engaging in cyberwarfare against the U S Obama explained that the U S did not publicly reciprocate against Russia s actions due to a fear such choices would appear partisan President Obama stressed cyber warfare against the U S should be a bipartisan issue br In the last days of the Obama administration officials pushed as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses and attempted to keep reports at relatively low classification levels as part of an effort to widen their visibility across the federal government The information was filed in many locations within federal agencies as a precaution against future concealment or destruction of evidence in the event of any investigation br br br Punitive measures imposed on Russia br br On December the U S government announced a series of punitive measures against Russia The Obama administration imposed sanctions on four top officials of the GRU and declared persona non grata Russian diplomats suspected of spying they were ordered to leave the country within hours On December two waterfront compounds used as retreats by families of Russian embassy personnel were shut down on orders of the U S government citing spying activities one in Upper Brookville New York on Long Island and the other in Centreville Maryland on the Eastern Shore Further sanctions against Russia were undertaken both overt and covert A White House statement said that cyberwarfare by Russia was geared to undermine U S trust in democracy and impact the election President Obama said his decision was taken after previous warnings to Russia In mid July the Russian foreign ministry said the U S was refusing to issue visas to Russian diplomats to allow Moscow to replace the expelled personnel and get its embassy back up to full strength br Initially Putin refrained from retaliatory measures to the December sanctions and invited all the children of the U S diplomats accredited in Russia to New Year s and Christmas celebrations at the Kremlin He also said that steps for restoring Russian American relations would be built on the basis of the policies developed by the Trump administration Later in May Russian banker Andrey Kostin an associate of President Vladimir Putin accused the Washington elite of purposefully disrupting the presidency of Donald Trump br br br Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act br br In June the Senate voted to for a bill that had been initially drafted in January by a bipartisan group of senators over Russia s continued involvement in the wars in Ukraine and Syria and its meddling in the election that envisaged sanctions on Russia as well as Iran and North Korea the bill would expand the punitive measures previously imposed by executive orders and convert them into law An identical bill introduced by Democrats in the House in July passed to br The law forbids the president from lifting earlier sanctions without first consulting Congress giving them time to reverse such a move It targets Russia s defense industry by harming Russia s ability to export weapons and allows the U S to sanction international companies that work to develop Russian energy resources The proposed sanctions also caused harsh criticism and threats of retaliatory measure on the part of the European Union Germany and France On January the Trump administration notified Congress that it would not impose additional sanctions on Russia under legislation designed to punish Moscow s meddling in the U S election The administration insisted that the mere threat of the sanctions outlined in the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act would serve as a deterrent and that implementing the sanctions would therefore be unnecessary br br br Counter sanctions by Russia br On July as the sanctions bill was being passed by the Senate Putin pledged a response to this kind of insolence towards our country Shortly thereafter Russia s foreign ministry Sergey Lavrov demanded that the U S reduce its diplomatic and technical personnel in the Moscow embassy and its consulates in St Petersburg Ekaterinburg and Vladivostok to persons the same as the number of Russian diplomats posted in the U S and suspended the use of a retreat compound and a storage facility in Moscow Putin said he had made this decision personally and confirmed that employees of the U S diplomatic mission must leave Russia br br br Impact on election result br As of October the question of whether Donald Trump won the election because of the Russian interference had not been given much focus The question has been declared impossible to answer or has been ignored in favor of other factors that led to Trump s victory Joel Benenson the Clinton campaign s pollster has said that the answer to this question will probably never be known while Richard Burr the Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said we cannot calculate the impact that foreign meddling and social media had on this election Michael V Hayden a former director of the CIA and the NSA has asserted that the Russian attacks were the most successful covert influence operation in history but that their impact is not just unknown it s unknowable br Statistician Nate Silver writing in February described himself as fairly agnostic on the question but noted that thematically the Russian interference tactics were consistent with the reasons Clinton lost br Clinton supporters have been more likely to blame her defeat on factors like campaign mistakes or Comey s reopening of the criminal investigation into Clinton s emails than to blame it on Russian interference They have also drawn attention to the issue of whether Trump colluded with Russia in connection with the campaign In their book Shattered Inside Hillary Clinton s Doomed Campaign reporters Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes reported that immediately after the election Robby Mook and John Podesta decided to assert that Russian hacking was the real reason for the defeat br Several high level Republicans including those who would have benefited from Russia s efforts have asserted that Russian interference did not determine the election s outcome President Trump has asserted that the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever and Vice President Pence has claimed that it is the universal conclusion of our intelligence communities that none of those efforts had any impact on the outcome of the election Secretary of State Mike Pompeo added that the intelligence community s assessment is that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the election In fact the official intelligence assessment of January did not evaluate whether Russian activities had any impact on the election s outcome and CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said Pompeo s remark was erroneous br House Speaker Paul Ryan claimed that it was clear that the Russian interference didn t have a material effect on our elections br On the other hand a number of former intelligence and law enforcement officials at least one political scientist and one former U S president argue that Russian interference was decisive In support of this argument they point to the sophistication of the Russian propaganda on social media the hacking of Democratic Party emails and the timing of their public release the small shift in voter support needed to achieve victory in the Electoral College and the relatively high number of undecided voters who may have been more readily influenced James Clapper the former director of National Intelligence told Jane Mayer it stretches credulity to think the Russians didn t turn the election I think the Russians had more to do with making Clinton lose than Trump did Ex FBI agent Clint Watts has written that without the Russian influence I believe Trump would not have even been within striking distance of Clinton on Election Day Former president Jimmy Carter has publicly said he believes Trump would not have been elected without the Russian interference Carter has said Trump didn t actually win the election in He lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf When questioned Carter agreed that Trump was an illegitimate president br Three states where Trump won by very close margins margins significantly less than the number of votes cast for third party candidates in those states gave him an Electoral College majority Mayer writes that if only of these third party voters were persuaded by Russian propaganda based on hacked Clinton campaign analytics not to vote for Clinton this would have been enough to win the election for Trump br Political scientist Kathleen Hall Jamieson in a detailed forensic analysis concludes that Russian trolls and hackers persuaded enough Americans to either vote a certain way or not vote at all to affect the election results br Specifically Jamieson argued that two factors that caused a drop in intention to vote for Clinton reported to pollsters can be traced to Russian work The publicizing of excerpts of speeches by Clinton made to investment banks for high fees and disinformation on FBI head Comey s public denunciation of Clinton s actions as extremely careless see above br A Columbia study published in saw changes on election betting markets around Russian holidays when trolls would be less active An NYU study published in found Russian Twitter trolls specifically had no measurable impact br br br developments br br br Dismissal of FBI Director James Comey br br On May Trump dismissed Comey attributing his action to recommendations from United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein br Trump had been talking to aides about firing Comey for at least a week before acting and had asked Justice Department officials to come up with a rationale for dismissing him br After he learned that Trump was about to fire Comey Rosenstein submitted to Trump a memo critical of Comey s conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton s emails Trump later confirmed that he had intended to fire Comey regardless of any Justice Department recommendation Trump himself also tied the firing to the Russia investigation in a televised interview stating When I decided to fire Comey I said to myself I said You know this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story it s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won br The dismissal came as a surprise to Comey and most of Washington and was described as immediately controversial and having vast political ramifications because of the Bureau s ongoing investigation into Russian activities in the election It was compared to the Saturday Night Massacre President Richard Nixon s termination of special prosecutor Archibald Cox who had been investigating the Watergate scandal and to the dismissal of Sally Yates in January Comey himself stated It s my judgment that I was fired because of the Russia investigation I was fired in some way to change or the endeavor was to change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted br During a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on May in the Oval Office Trump told the Russian officials that firing the F B I director James Comey had relieved great pressure on him according to a White House document Trump stated I just fired the head of the F B I He was crazy a real nut job I faced great pressure because of Russia That s taken off In The Washington Post revealed that Trump also told Lavrov and Kislyak during this meeting that he wasn t concerned about Russia interfering in American elections br br br Investigation by special counsel br br On May Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to direct FBI agents and Department of Justice prosecutors investigating election interference by Russia and related matters As special counsel Mueller has the power to issue subpoenas hire staff members request funding and prosecute federal crimes in connection with his investigation br Mueller assembled a legal team Trump engaged several attorneys to represent and advise him including his longtime personal attorney Marc Kasowitz as well as Jay Sekulow Michael Bowe and John M Dowd All but Sekulow have since resigned In August Mueller was using a grand jury br br br charges br In October Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier in the month to making a false statement to FBI investigators about his connections to Russia In the first guilty plea of special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation George Papadopoulos admitted lying to the FBI about contact with Russian agents who offered the campaign thousands of damaging emails about Clinton months before then candidate Donald Trump asked Russia to find Hillary Clinton s missing emails His plea agreement said a Russian operative had told a campaign aide the Russians had emails of Clinton Papadopoulos agreed to cooperate with prosecutors as part of the plea bargain br Later that month former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort surrendered to the FBI after being indicted on multiple charges His business associate Rick Gates was also indicted and surrendered to the FBI The pair were indicted on one count of conspiracy against the United States one count of conspiracy to launder money one count of being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal one count of making false and misleading FARA statements and one count of making false statements Manafort was charged with four counts of failing to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts while Gates was charged with three All charges arise from their consulting work for a pro Russian government in Ukraine and are unrelated to the campaign It was widely believed that the charges against Manafort are intended to pressure him into becoming a cooperating witness about Russian interference in the election In February Gates pleaded guilty to fraud related charges and agreed to testify against Manafort In April when Manafort s lawyers filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the July raid on Manafort s home the warrants for the search were revealed and indicated that in addition to seeking evidence related to Manafort s work in Ukraine Mueller s investigation also concerned Manafort s actions during the Trump campaign including the meeting with a Russian lawyer and a counterintelligence officer at the Trump Tower meeting on June br In March the investigation revealed that the prosecutors have established links between Rick Gates and an individual with ties to Russian intelligence which occurred while Gates worked on Trump s campaign A report filed by prosecutors concerning the sentencing of Gates and Manafort associate Alex van der Zwaan who lied to Mueller s investigators alleges that Gates knew the individual he was in contact with had these connections br br br developments br br br indictments br On February a Federal grand jury in Washington D C indicted Russian nationals and three Russian entities on charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud and fraud with identification documents in connection with the United States national elections The page indictment cites the illegal use of social media to sow political discord including actions that supported the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump and disparaged his opponent Hillary Clinton On the same day Robert Mueller announced that Richard Pinedo had pleaded guilty to using the identities of other people in connection with unlawful activity br Lawyers representing Concord Management and Consulting appeared on May in federal court in Washington to plead not guilty to the charges The prosecutors subsequently withdrew the charges br br On July Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein released indictments returned by a grand jury charging twelve Russian intelligence officials who work for the Russian intelligence agency GRU with conspiring to interfere in the elections The individuals posing as a Guccifer persona are accused of hacking into computers of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee as well as state election boards and secretaries of several states In one unidentified state the Russians stole information on half a million voters The indictment also said a Republican congressional candidate also unidentified had been sent campaign documents stolen by the group and that a reporter was in contact with the Russian operatives and offered to write an article to coincide with the release of the stolen documents br br br Claims by Anastasia Vashukevich br In March Anastasia Vashukevich a Belarusian national arrested in Thailand said she had over hours of audio recordings that could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections She offered the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum to avoid being extradited to Belarus Vashukevich said she was close to Oleg Deripaska a Russian oligarch with ties to Putin and business links to Paul Manafort and asserted the recordings included Deripaska discussing the presidential election She said some of the recorded conversations which she asserted were made in August included three individuals who spoke fluent English and who she believed were Americans Vashukevich s claims appeared to be consistent with a video published in February by Alexei Navalny about a meeting between Deripaska and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko In the video Navalny claims Deripaska served as a liaison between the Russian government and Paul Manafort in connection with Russian interference efforts br In August Vashukevich said she no longer has any evidence having sent the recordings to Deripaska without having made them public hoping he would be able to gain her release from prison and has promised Deripaska not to make any further comment on the recordings contents br br br developments br br On March Attorney General Barr sent a four page letter to Congress regarding the Special Counsel s findings regarding Russian interference and obstruction of justice Barr said that on the question of Russian interference in the election Mueller detailed two ways in which Russia attempted to influence the election in Trump s favor but did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities On the question of obstruction of justice Barr said that Mueller wrote while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime it also does not exonerate him The Special Counsel s decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel s investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction of justice offense br On April a redacted version of the final Mueller Report was released to the public The Mueller Report found that the Russian government interfered in the election in sweeping and systematic fashion and violated U S criminal laws br On May Mueller announced that he was retiring as special counsel and the office would be shut down and he spoke publicly about the report for the first time He reiterated that his report did not exonerate the president and that legal guidelines prevented the indictment of a sitting president stating that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing Saying The report is my testimony he indicated he would have nothing to say that was not already in the report He emphasized that the central conclusion of his investigation was that there were multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election That allegation deserves the attention of every American br Soon after the release of the Mueller Report Trump began urging an investigation into the origins of the Russian investigation wanting to investigate the investigators In April Attorney General William Barr announced that he had launched a review of the origins of the FBI s investigation The origins of the probe were already being investigated by the Justice Department s inspector general and by U S attorney John Huber who was appointed in by Jeff Sessions He assigned U S Attorney John Durham to lead it br Durham was given the authority to broadly examin e the government s collection of intelligence involving the Trump campaign s interactions with Russians reviewing government documents and requesting voluntary witness statements Trump directed the American intelligence community to promptly provide assistance and information to Barr and delegated to him the full and complete authority to declassify any documents related to his probe In September it was reported that Barr has been contacting foreign governments to ask for help in this mission He personally traveled to the United Kingdom and Italy to seek information and at Barr s request Trump phoned the prime minister of Australia about the subject br br br developments br On November the Special Counsel s office released previously redacted portions of the Mueller report In September a federal judge ordered the passages disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information Act FOIA lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed News and the advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center while allowing other portions to remain redacted br In summary per Buzzfeed Although Wikileaks published emails stolen from the DNC in July and October and Stone a close associate to Donald Trump appeared to know in advance the materials were coming investigators did not have sufficient evidence to prove active participation in the hacks or knowledge that the electronic thefts were continuing In addition federal prosecutors could not establish that the hacked emails amounted to campaign contributions benefitting Trump s election chances br The newly released material also stated While the investigation developed evidence that the GRU s hacking efforts in fact were continuing at least at the time of the July WikiLeaks dissemination the Office did not develop sufficient admissible evidence that WikiLeaks knew of or even was willfully blind to that fact As reported by Buzzfeed Likewise prosecutors faced what they called factual hurdles in pursuing Stone for the hack br On November the day before the presidential election New York magazine reported that br br According to two sources familiar with the probe there has been no evidence found after months of investigation to support Barr s claims that Trump was targeted by politically biased Obama officials to prevent his election The probe remains ongoing In fact the sources said the Durham investigation has so far uncovered no

of Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election interference In the Justice department had dismissed the indictments against Prigozhin s catering firm Concord because the inability to punish the indicted would possibly lead to the exposure of law enforcement techniques in the process of trial In July the State Department offered a million reward for information on Prigozhin and the

In the two plus years since Trump left office the missing intelligence does not appear to have been found The binder contained raw intelligence the US and its NATO allies collected on Russians and Russian agents including sources and methods that informed the US government s assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to help Trump win the election According to the report in the final days of his presidency Donald Trump intended to declassify and release publicly multiple documents related to the FBI s Russian investigation Several copies of the binder with varying levels of

campaign manager in August Manafort shared Trump campaign internal polling data with Ukrainian political consultant Konstantin Kilimnik whom the Mueller Report linked to Russian intelligence while the Intelligence Committee characterized him as a Russian intelligence officer Manafort gave Kilimnik data for Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania states the Russian Internet Research Agency specifically targeted for social media and ad campaigns Trump won those three states by narrow margins and they were key to his election br In Manafort was indicted in the U S District Court for the District of

Virginia for eight charges of tax and bank fraud He was convicted of the fraud charges in August and sentenced to months in prison by Judge T S Ellis Although all the charges arose from the Special Counsel investigation none of them were for any alleged collusion to interfere with U S elections On March Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Manafort to an additional months in prison That day New

Burling and hired Sidney Powell Powell moved to compel production of additional Brady material and newly discovered evidence in October which was denied by Sullivan in December Flynn then moved to withdraw his guilty plea in January claiming that the government had acted in bad faith and breached the plea agreement br In May the United States Department of Justice DOJ filed a motion to dismiss the charge against Flynn with prejudice asserting that it no longer believed it could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Flynn had made false statements to the FBI or that the statements even if false were materially false in regards to the FBI s investigation Sullivan then appointed an amicus John Gleeson to prepare an argument against dismissal Sullivan also allowed amici to file briefs regarding the dismissal motion br Powell filed an emergency petition for a writ of mandamus in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia asking that Judge Sullivan be ordered to grant the government s motion to dismiss for Sullivan s amicus appointment of Gleeson to be vacated and for the case be assigned to another judge for any additional proceedings The appellate court panel assigned to the case ordered Sullivan to respond and briefs were also filed by the DOJ and amici In June the appeals court panel ruled in favor of Flynn on the first two requests and the panel unanimously rejected the third request Judge Sullivan petitioned the Court of Appeals for an en banc rehearing a request opposed by Flynn and the DOJ The appellate court granted Sullivan s petition in an decision and vacated the panel s ruling The case was ultimately dismissed as moot on December after President Trump pardoned Flynn on November br br br George Papadopoulos br br In March Donald

her campaign The two met several times in March In May at a London wine bar Papadopoulos told the top Australian diplomat to the United Kingdom Alexander Downer that Russia had a dirt file on rival candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked Democratic Party emails After the DNC emails were published by WikiLeaks in July the Australian government told the FBI about Papadopoulos revelation leading the FBI to launch a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign known by its code name Crossfire Hurricane which has been criticized by Trump as a witch hunt br Papadopoulos main activity during the campaign was attempting unsuccessfully to set up meetings between Russian officials including Vladimir Putin and Trump campaign officials including Trump himself In pursuit of this goal he communicated with multiple Trump campaign officials including Sam Clovis Paul Manafort Rick Gates and Corey Lewandowski br On January Papadopoulos was interviewed by FBI agents On July he was arrested at Washington Dulles International Airport and he has since been cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation On October he pleaded guilty to one felony count of

said none was forthcoming and instead the conversation then turned to the Magnitsky Act and the adoption of Russian children br The meeting was disclosed by The New York Times on July br On the same day Donald Trump Jr released a statement saying it had been a short introductory meeting focused on adoption of Russian children by Americans and not a campaign issue br Later that month The

after claiming to have been in contact with WikiLeaks and before WikiLeaks release of the Podesta emails Stone has denied having any advance knowledge of the Podesta e mail hack or any connection to Russian intelligence stating that his earlier tweet was actually referring to reports of the Podesta Group s own ties to Russia Stone ultimately named Randy Credico who had interviewed both Assange and Stone for a radio show as his intermediary with Assange br In June Stone disclosed that he had met with a Russian individual during the campaign who wanted Trump to pay two million dollars for dirt on Hillary Clinton This disclosure contradicted Stone s earlier claims that he had not met with any Russians during the campaign The meeting Stone attended was set up by Donald Trump s campaign aide Michael Caputo and is a subject of Robert Mueller s investigation br Oil industry consultant Carter Page had his communications monitored by the FBI under a FISA warrant beginning in and again

go and even the parties in power change but the main political direction does not change That s why in the grand scheme of things we don t care who s the head of the United States We know more or less what is going to happen And so in this regard even if we wanted to it wouldn t make sense for us to interfere Putin also invoked whataboutism and criticized U S foreign policy saying Put your finger anywhere on a map of the world and everywhere you will hear complaints that American officials are interfering in internal electoral processes br In March Putin suggested that Ukrainians Tatars Jews just with Russian citizenship might have been to blame for interfering with U S elections and suggested that maybe it was the Americans who paid them for this work Putin s statement was criticized by the Anti Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee both likened his comments to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion an antisemitic hoax first published in Russia in the early th century Boruch Gorin a prominent rabbi in Moscow said that the translation of Putin s comment into English lacked critical nuance and that Russian Jews were largely indifferent to it br br br Columbia
