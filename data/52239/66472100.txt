title: COVID-19 misinformation by China
id: 66472100
The Chinese government has actively engaged in disinformation to downplay the emergence of COVID in China and manipulate information about its spread around the world The government also detained whistleblowers and journalists claiming they were spreading rumors when they were publicly raising concerns about people being hospitalized for a mysterious illness resembling SARS br The blame for the failure to report cases of COVID at the onset is unclear because of the difficulty pinpointing it as a failure by either local or national officials The Associated Press reported that increasing political repression has made officials more hesitant to report cases without a clear green light from the top There are ongoing investigations in an effort to understand what happened including an investigation by the World Health Organization WHO which will probe into what Wuhan officials knew at the time of the outbreak br A February expos by the Associated Press said that China took a leading role in spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories about COVID br br br Initial response br br br Downplaying early signs br In the first weeks the dangers to the public were downplayed leaving million Wuhan residents unaware and vulnerable to the virus Political motivations were blamed in part for the reluctance by local officials to go public as they were preparing for their annual congresses in January Despite the increase in COVID cases officials continued to declare that there had likely been no more infections br In a March interview Ai Fen the director of Wuhan Central Hospital s emergency department stated in an interview that she was told by superiors that Wuhan s health commission had issued a directive that medical workers were not to disclose anything about the virus or the disease it caused to avoid sparking a panic br Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers wrote in the New York Times that The government s initial handling of the epidemic allowed the virus to gain a tenacious hold At critical moments officials chose to put secrecy and order ahead of openly confronting the growing crisis to avoid public alarm and political embarrassment br By summer China had the virus largely under control In December the BBC published a retrospective into how Chinese state media and China s online government censors had suppressed negative information and propagandized what was reported br br br Silencing of medical workers br Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital On December he had seen seven cases of a virus he thought looked like SARS He sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection He and seven other doctors were later told to come to the Public Security Bureau and told to sign a letter The letter accused them of making false comments that would disturb the social order Wang Guangbao who is a Chinese surgeon and science writer later said that by January people in medical circles thought that a SARS like virus might be spreading but the police warning discouraged them from talking openly about it Li later died of the virus and China later apologized to his family and overturned the warning in the letter br A nurse said that by early January doctors and nurses had noticed that they too were getting sick Hospital administrators made long calls to the City Government and Health Commission However medical personnel were not allowed to wear protective gear because it would cause panic Health and governance experts place much of the blame on higher level officials as local authorities in China can be punished for reporting bad news br br br Arrest or disappearance of citizen journalists br As of December around a year after the outbreak at least journalists were currently in detention in China for their reporting on the initial coronavirus outbreak br Chinese citizen journalist Chen Qiushi started reporting on the outbreak from Wuhan on January He disappeared on February On September a friend said he had been found He was being supervised by a certain government department but would not face prosecution for the moment because he had not contacted opposition groups br Fang Bin is a Chinese citizen journalist who broadcast images of Wuhan during the outbreak several times on social media He was arrested several times during February The last arrest was on February and as of September he had not been seen in public since br Li Zehua was reporting on the outbreak from Wuhan in February On February he was caught by the authorities after livestreaming part of the chase On April he returned to social media with a brief statement in which he quoted a proverb that the human mind was prone to err A friend said he may have been told by authorities to make the statement br Another citizen journalist Zhang Zhan stopped sharing information on social media in May On December she was sentenced to years in prison According to one of her attorneys she was convicted of picking quarrels and provoking trouble br br br Early response disinformation br br In the early stages of the outbreak the Chinese National Health Commission stated it had no clear evidence of human to human transmissions However at this time the high prevalence of human to human transmission was evident to doctors and other health workers but they were forbidden to express their concerns in public The Chinese government maintained the stance that human to human transmission had not been proven until January when it was finally confirmed Research published on January indicated that among officially confirmed cases human to human transmission may have started in December and the delay of disclosure on the results until then rather than earlier in January brought criticism of health authorities Wang Guangfa one of the health officials said that There was uncertainty regarding the human to human transmission he was infected by a patient within days of making the statement br On January the editor of the People s Daily the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party CCP tweeted a claim that the first building of the Huoshenshan Hospital had been completed in only hours The Daily Beast reported the next day that the building shown in the picture accompanying the tweet was actually a marketing photo of a modular container building sold by the Henan K Home Steel Structure Company and not of the actual hospital A Human Rights Watch researcher claimed that the post was part of the Chinese government s misinformation campaign to hype the government s response The tweet was later removed and replaced with a video of the modular container buildings being assembled at Huoshenshan Hospital again stating that the first building had been completed in only hours br On February China s paramount leader and CCP general secretary Xi Jinping published an article which claimed he had learned of the epidemic on January and had the same day issued a request for information on activities to contain the spread of the disease However the original public announcement of that January meeting did not mention the epidemic and Xi s claim was unsupported by the evidence br br br Propagation of multiple locations of origin br The Chinese government has made repeated claims that COVID did not originate just in Wuhan but across multiple locations around the world from Autumn of br In March The Washington Post reviewed Chinese state media as well as posts in social media and discovered that anti American conspiracy theories that were circulating among Chinese users had gained steam through a mix of unexplained official statements magnified by social media censorship and doubts stoked by state media and government officials br In March Chinese state media propagated the theory that the spread of the virus may have started in Italy before the Wuhan outbreak pointing to an interview Italian doctor Giuseppe Remuzzi gave to National Public Radio wherein he mentioned reports of unusual pneumonia cases dating back to November and December Remuzzi later said that his words were twisted br In November Chinese state media propagated a misleading account of statements by World Health Organization s top emergency director Michael Ryan speculating that the virus could have originated outside of China In an interview with Reuters on November Ryan said It is clear from a public health perspective that you start your investigations where the human cases first emerged and repeated that the WHO would seek to send an investigative team to China to probe the origins of the virus br In December Chinese state media misconstrued research from Alexander Kekul the director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle using it to suggest the virus emerged in Italy In media published by Xinhua News Agency China Daily and China Global Television Network CGTN excerpts from an interview Kekul gave to ZDF were quoted purporting that percent of the coronavirus spreading around the world at the time was from a variant originating in northern Italy In follow up interviews Kekul said his words were twisted calling the Chinese media reports pure propaganda br In December the People s Daily featured a study by scientists associated with the state backed Chinese Academy of Sciences positing that the earliest human to human transmission occurred on the Indian subcontinent three to four months before the Wuhan outbreak The study which was not peer reviewed was posted on the preprint platform SSRN It was later withdrawn from the platform at the authors request br br br Origin disinformation br br There is evidence that the Chinese government has made a vigorous effort to play down its early failures in the crisis and to mitigate the damage it has wrought to its image by claiming the virus originated outside of China Chinese state media misconstrued research from academics such as Alexander Kekul the director of the Institute for Biosecurity Research in Halle suggesting it was Italy not China where the virus began Chinese state media also misrepresented statements from Michael Ryan the World Health Organization s emergency director insinuating that the virus may have originated outside of China CNN Quartz The Washington Post Financial Times Associated Press and others have reported that Chinese government officials in response to the outbreak launched a coordinated disinformation campaign seeking to spread doubt about the origin of the coronavirus and its outbreak A review of Chinese state media and social media posts in early March conducted by The Washington Post found that anti American conspiracy theories circulating among Chinese users gained steam through a mix of unexplained official statements magnified by social media censorship and doubts stoked by state media and government officials United States Department of State officials as well as sinologist Dali Yang have said the campaign was intended to deflect attention away from the Chinese government s mishandling of the crisis br At a press conference on March two spokesmen for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhao Lijian and Geng Shuang promoted the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus had been bio engineered by Western powers and suggested that the US government specifically the US Army had spread the virus No evidence supports these claims Zhao also pushed these conspiracy theories on Twitter which is blocked in mainland China but is used as a public diplomacy tool by Chinese officials to promote the Chinese government and defend it from criticism China s ambassador to South Africa also made these claims on Twitter br An intentional disinformation campaign by China was discussed among the Group of Seven G and the Chinese efforts were condemned by the US Department of State which criticized Chinese authorities for spreading dangerous and ridiculous conspiracy claims The US summoned China s ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai to issue a stern message over the Chinese government s claims Cui had disavowed the US military conspiracy theory as crazy in a February interview and affirmed his belief in another one in mid March br The Observer reported in April that China clamped down on the publication of research on the origin of the virus requiring that all academic papers containing information on COVID be vetted by China s ministry of science and technology before they can be published CNN for example published a report about the imposition of new restrictions and central government vetting quoting an anonymous Chinese researcher s belief that the crackdown is a coordinated effort from the Chinese government to control the narrative and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China br In May Twitter placed fact check labels on two of the Chinese government tweets which had falsely suggested that the virus originated in the US and was brought to China by the Americans In November the People s Daily published the false claim that COVID was imported into China In October a University of Oxford researcher found that Chinese state media accounts spread a theory that the virus originated from American lobsters from Maine In March China Daily and Global Times republished an article by the British conspiracy website The Expos which falsely claimed COVID was created by Moderna br br br Huanan market swabs br br The market was closed on January Swab samples were taken of surfaces in the market samples from the actual animals in the market would be more conclusive but could not be collected as and the animals had been removed before public health authorities from the Chinese CDC came in Some Chinese researchers had published a preprint analysis of the Huanan swab samples in February concluding that the coronavirus in the samples had likely been brought in by humans not the animals on sale but omissions in the analysis had raised questions and the raw sample data had not yet been released br On March of the raw data from the swab samples of the Huanan live animal market were released or possibly leaked No raw genetic data had previously been accessible to any academics not working at Chinese institutions until the genetic sequences from some of the market swabs were uploaded to an international database A preliminary analysis of this data was reviewed by the international research community which said that it made an animal origin especially the common raccoon dog as an intermediate host much more likely On March an international group of researchers presented a preliminary analysis at a meeting of the World Health Organization s Scientific Advisory Group for Origins of Novel Pathogens at which Chinese COVID researchers were also present On the th of March the WHO director general said that the data should have been shared three years earlier and called on China to be more transparent in its data sharing There exists further data from further samples which has not yet been made public Maria Van Kerkhove the WHO s COVID technical lead called for it to be made public immediately br br br US Army and Fort Detrick origins br On March two spokesmen for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhao Lijian and Geng Shuang alleged at a press conference that Western powers may have bio engineered the coronavirus alluding to the US government but more specifically to the US Army as having created and spread the virus br In January Hua Chunying renewed the conspiracy theory from Zhao and Geng that the SARS CoV virus originated in the United States from the U S military biology laboratory Fort Detrick This conspiracy theory quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo and Hua continued to refer to it on Twitter while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS CoV virus In July the Chinese foreign ministry called on the WHO to investigate Fort Detrick br br br Treatment misinformation br br br Traditional Chinese medicine br br Beijing championed traditional Chinese medicine TCM as a way to treat COVID In early June China s State Council Information Office published a white paper titled Fighting COVID China In Action which details the plans that were put into place to prevent control and treat COVID including medical services that integrate TCM and scientific medicine to treat the virus The paper states that Chinese herbal formulas and drugs were administered to percent of all confirmed cases and that percent of confirmed cases in Hubei Province received TCM treatment that proved effective While TCM supporters claim that there is no downside to its use the US National Institutes of Health believe that while there may be some relief of symptoms using TCM the overall efficacy against COVID is inconclusive Edzard Ernst a retired UK based researcher of complementary medicines is quoted in the journal Nature stating For TCM there is no good evidence and therefore its use is not just unjustified but dangerous br br br Propagation of disinformation br br br Kazakh virus br In July misinformation about a deadlier virus appearing alongside COVID in Kazakhstan was traced to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Kazakhstan The misinformation was picked up by Xinhua News Agency and from there spread to other Chinese outlets and internationally br br br Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine br In January multiple Chinese state and CCP affiliated media outlets including CGTN and the Global Times raised doubts about the efficacy of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine calling for an investigation into the deaths of elderly people in Norway and Germany after receiving the vaccine According to Reuters the reports made allegations of deliberately downplaying the deaths and using propaganda power to promote the Pfizer vaccine and smearing Chinese vaccines and touted Chinese vaccines as relatively safer due to their mature technology br In April the European External Action Service published a report that cited Chinese state media outlets for selective highlighting of potential vaccine side effects and disregarding contextual information or ongoing research to present Western vaccines as unsafe br br br As part of the Cross Strait conflict br br br International response br On March the intentional disinformation campaign by China was discussed among the Group of Seven br On March CGTN aired a video in Arabic that Reporters Without Borders classified as misinformation related to the COVID pandemic br In August the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs asked Chinese state media to remove widely quoted allegations attributed to a non existing Swiss biologist that the United States
