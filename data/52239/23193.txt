Philology from Ancient Greek philolog a love of word is the study of language in oral and written historical sources It is the intersection of textual criticism literary criticism history and linguistics with strong ties to etymology Philology is also defined as the study of literary texts and oral and written records the establishment of their authenticity and their original form and the determination of their meaning A person who pursues this kind of study is known as a philologist In older usage especially British philology is more general covering comparative and historical linguistics br Classical philology studies classical languages Classical philology principally originated from the Library of Pergamum and the Library of Alexandria around the fourth century BC continued by Greeks and Romans throughout the Roman and Byzantine Empire It was eventually resumed by European scholars of the Renaissance where it was soon joined by philologies of other European Romance Germanic Celtic Eurasian Slavic etc Asian Arabic Persian Sanskrit Chinese etc and African Egyptian Nubian etc languages Indo European studies involve the comparative philology of all Indo European languages br Philology with its focus on historical development diachronic analysis is contrasted with linguistics due to Ferdinand de Saussure s insistence on the importance of synchronic analysis While the contrast continued with the emergence of structuralism and the emphasis of Noam Chomsky on syntax research in historical linguistics often relies on philological materials and findings br br br Etymology br The term philology is derived from the Greek philolog a from the terms ph los love affection loved beloved dear friend and l gos word articulation reason describing a love of learning of literature as well as of argument and reasoning reflecting the range of activities included under the notion of The term changed little with the Latin philologia and later entered the English language in the th century from the Middle French philologie in the sense of love of literature br The adjective phil logos meant fond of discussion or argument talkative in Hellenistic Greek also implying an excessive sophistic preference of argument over the love of true wisdom phil sophos br As an allegory of literary erudition philologia appears in fifth century postclassical literature Martianus Capella De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii an idea revived in Late Medieval literature Chaucer Lydgate br The meaning of love of learning and literature was narrowed to the study of the historical development of languages historical linguistics in th century usage of the term Due to the rapid progress made in understanding sound laws and language change the golden age of philology lasted throughout the th century or from Giacomo Leopardi and Friedrich Schlegel to Nietzsche br br br Branches br br br Comparative br br The comparative linguistics branch of philology studies the relationship between languages Similarities between Sanskrit and European languages were first noted in the early th century and led to speculation of a common ancestor language from which all these descended It is now named Proto Indo European Philology s interest in ancient languages led to the study of what was in the th century exotic languages for the light they could cast on problems in understanding and deciphering the origins of older texts br br br Textual br br Philology also includes the study of texts and their history It includes elements of textual criticism trying to reconstruct an author s original text based on variant copies of manuscripts This branch of research arose among ancient scholars in the Greek speaking world of the th century BC who desired to establish a standard text of popular authors for both sound interpretation and secure transmission Since that time the original principles of textual criticism have been improved and applied to other widely distributed texts such as the Bible Scholars have tried to reconstruct the original readings of the Bible from the manuscript variants This method was applied to classical studies and medieval texts as a way to reconstruct the author s original work The method produced so called critical editions which provided a reconstructed text accompanied by a critical apparatus i e footnotes that listed the various manuscript variants available enabling scholars to gain insight into the entire manuscript tradition and argue about the variants br A related study method known as higher criticism studies the authorship date and provenance of text to place such text in a historical context As these philological issues are often inseparable from issues of interpretation there is no clear cut boundary between philology and hermeneutics When text has a significant political or religious influence such as the reconstruction of Biblical texts scholars have difficulty reaching objective conclusions br Some scholars avoid all critical methods of textual philology especially in historical linguistics where it is important to study the actual recorded materials The movement known as new philology has rejected textual criticism because it injects editorial interpretations into the text and destroys the integrity of the individual manuscript hence damaging the reliability of the data Supporters of new philology insist on a strict diplomatic approach a faithful rendering of the text exactly as found in the manuscript without emendations br br br Cognitive br br Another branch of philology cognitive philology studies written and oral texts Cognitive philology considers these oral texts as the results of human mental processes This science compares the results of textual science with the results of experimental research of both psychology and artificial intelligence production systems br br br Decipherment br In the case of Bronze Age literature philology includes the prior decipherment of the language under study This has notably been the case with the Egyptian Sumerian Assyrian Hittite Ugaritic and Luwian languages Beginning with the famous decipherment and translation of the Rosetta Stone by Jean Fran ois Champollion in some individuals attempted to decipher the writing systems of the Ancient Near East and Aegean In the case of Old Persian and Mycenaean Greek decipherment yielded older records of languages already known from slightly more recent traditions Middle Persian and Alphabetic Greek br Work on the ancient languages of the Near East progressed rapidly In the mid th century Henry Rawlinson and others deciphered the Behistun Inscription which records the same text in Old Persian Elamite and Akkadian using a variation of cuneiform for each language The elucidation of cuneiform led to the decipherment of Sumerian Hittite was deciphered in by Bed ich Hrozn br Linear B a script used in the ancient Aegean was deciphered in by Michael Ventris and John Chadwick who demonstrated that it recorded an early form of Greek now known as Mycenaean Greek Linear A the writing system that records the still unknown language of the Minoans resists deciphering despite many attempts br Work continues on scripts such as the Maya with great progress since the initial breakthroughs of the phonetic approach championed by Yuri Knorozov and others in the s Since the late th century the Maya code has been almost completely deciphered and the Mayan languages are among the most documented and studied in Mesoamerica The code is described as a logosyllabic style of writing br br br Contention br In English speaking countries usage of the term philology to describe work on languages and works of literature which had become synonymous with the practices of German scholars was abandoned as a consequence of anti German feelings following World War I Most continental European countries still maintain the term to designate departments colleges position titles and journals J R R Tolkien opposed the nationalist reaction against philological practices claiming that the philological instinct was universal as is the use of language In British English usage and British academia philology remains largely synonymous with historical linguistics while in US English and US academia the wider meaning of study of a language s grammar history and literary tradition remains more widespread Based on the harsh critique of Friedrich Nietzsche some US scholars since the s have viewed philology as responsible for a narrowly scientistic study of language and literature br Disagreements in the modern day of this branch of study are followed with the likes of how the method is treated amongst other scholars as noted by both the philologists R D Fulk and Leonard Neidorf who have been quoted saying This field philology s commitment to falsification renders it at odds with what many literary scholars believe because the purpose of philology is to narrow the range of possible interpretations rather than to treat all reasonable ones as equal This use of falsification can be seen in the debate surrounding the etymology of the Old English character Unferth from the heroic epic poem Beowulf br James Turner further disagrees with how the use of the term is dismissed in the academic world stating that due to its branding as a simpleminded approach to their subject the term has become unknown to college educated students furthering the stereotypes of scrutiny of ancient Greek or Roman texts of a nit picking classicist and only the technical research into languages and families br br br In popular culture br In the Space Trilogy by C S Lewis the main character Elwin Ransom is a philologist as was
