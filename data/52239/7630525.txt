Friday afternoon by one of our clients Dyson They rang up and they said look we ve got a huge issue and that is that a lot of our products are being completely ripped off in China to the point where they re not just completely duplicating the product The Chinese government won t take it seriously it s half past two on a Friday afternoon On Saturday the Chinese Prime Minister is coming in for a UK visit can you please get the UK to raise it And I m pleased to say that on the Saturday David Cameron raised it with the Chinese Prime Minister and showed him the photos of the products I m not saying we can do that all the time but that is an illustration of what if you have the right message David Cameron yes he was doing it for Dyson yes he was doing it because we asked him to do it he was doing
