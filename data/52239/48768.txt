Georgia Georgian romanized sakartvelo IPA sak art elo is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe and West Asia It is part of the Caucasus region bounded by the Black Sea to the west Russia to the north and northeast Turkey to the southwest Armenia to the south and Azerbaijan to the southeast Georgia covers an area of square kilometres sq mi It has a population of million of which over a third live in the capital and largest city Tbilisi Georgians who are native to the region constitute a majority of the country s population and are its titular nation br Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory hosting the world s earliest known sites of winemaking gold mining and textiles The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms such as Colchis and Iberia that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state In the early fourth century Georgians officially adopted Christianity which contributed to the unification into the Kingdom of Georgia Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar Beginning in the th century the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers including the Mongols the Ottoman Empire and Persia before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in br After the Russian Revolution in Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German protection but was invaded and annexed by the Soviet Union in becoming one of its constituent republics In the s an independence movement grew quickly leading to Georgia s secession from the Soviet Union in April For much of the subsequent decade the country endured economic crises political instability and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in Georgia strongly pursued a pro Western foreign policy introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia culminating in the Russo Georgian War of and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia br Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic It is a developing country with a very high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy Sweeping economic reforms since have resulted in one of the freest business climates in the world greater economic freedom and transparency and among the fastest rates of GDP growth In Georgia became the second country in the world to legalize cannabis and the first former socialist state to do so Georgia is a member of numerous international organizations including the Council of Europe Eurocontrol BSEC GUAM Energy Community As part of the Association Trio Georgia is a candidate for membership in the European Union br br br Etymology br br br Names of Georgia br br Ancient Greeks Strabo Herodotus Plutarch Homer etc and Romans Titus Livius Tacitus etc referred to early western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians Iberoi in some Greek sources br The first mention of the name Georgia is in Italian on the mappa mundi of Pietro Vesconte dated At the early stage of its appearance in the Latin world the name was often spelled Jorgia Lore based theories were given by traveler Jacques de Vitry who explained the name s origin by the popularity of St George among Georgians while Jean Chardin thought that Georgia came from the Greek tiller of the land These centuries old explanations for the word Georgia Georgians are now mostly rejected by the scholarly community who point to the Persian word gur gur n wolf as the likely root of the word Under this hypothesis the same Persian root was later adopted in numerous other languages including Slavic and West European languages br The native name is Sakartvelo land of Kartvelians derived from the core central Georgian region of Kartli recorded from the th century and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia prior to the th century The Georgian circumfix sa X o is a standard geographic construction designating the area where X dwell where X is an ethnonym The self designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi i e Kartvelians first attested in the Umm Leisun inscription found in the Old City of Jerusalem br The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians Kartlos a great grandson of Japheth who medieval chroniclers believed to have been the root of the local name of their kingdom However scholars agree that the word Kartli is derived from the Karts a proto Kartvelian tribe that emerged as a dominant regional group in ancient times The name Sakartvelo consists of two parts Its root kartvel i specifies an inhabitant of the core central eastern Georgian region of Kartli or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire br br br State name br The official name of the country is Georgia per Article of the Georgian Constitution In Georgia s two official languages Georgian and Abkhaz the country is named Sak art velo and K rtt la respectively Prior to the adoption of the Constitution in and following the dissolution of the USSR the country was commonly called the Republic of Georgia and occasionally it still is br Several languages continue to use the Russian variant of the country s name Gruzia which the Georgian authorities have sought to replace through diplomatic campaigns Since Israel Japan and South Korea legally changed their appellation of the country to variants of the English Georgia In Lithuania became the first country in the world to adopt Sakartvelas in all official communications br br br History br br br Prehistory br br The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest known fossils of hominins in Eurasia Buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene while the first continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic close to years ago During the Upper Paleolithic settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers br Signs of agriculture date back to at least the th millennium BC especially in Western Georgia while the Mtkvari basin became stably populated in the th millennium BC as evidenced with the rise of various cultures closely associated with the Fertile Crescent including the Trialetian Mesolithic the Shulaveri Shomu culture and the Leyla Tepe culture Archaeological findings show that settlements in modern day Georgia were responsible for the first use of fibers possibly for clothing more than years ago the first cases of viticulture th millennium BC and the first signs of gold mining rd millennium BC br The Kura Araxes Trialeti and Colchian cultures coincided with the development of proto Kartvelian tribes that may have come from Anatolia during the expansion of the Hittite Empire including the Mushki Laz and Byzeres Some historians have suggested that the collapse of the Hittite world in the Late Bronze Age led to an expansion of the influence of these tribes to the Mediterranean Sea notably with the Kingdom of Tabal br br br Antiquity br br The classical period saw the rise of a number of Georgian states including Colchis in western Georgia where Greek mythology located the Golden Fleece sought after by the Argonauts Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the th century BC and an extensive trade network with Greek colonies on the eastern Black Sea shore such as Dioscurias and Phasis though the entire region would be annexed first by Pontus and then by the Roman Republic in the first century BC br Eastern Georgia remained a decentralized mosaic of various clans ruled by individual mamasakhlisi until the th century BC when it was conquered by Alexander the Great eventually leading to the creation of the Kingdom of Iberia under the protectorate of the Seleucid Empire an early example of advanced state organization under one king and an aristocratic hierarchy Various wars with the Roman Empire Parthia and Armenia made Iberia regularly change its allegiance though it remained a Roman client state for most of its history br In King Mirian III adopted Christianity as the state religion of Iberia beginning the Christianization of the Western Caucasus region and solidly anchoring it in Rome s sphere of influence by abandoning the ancient Georgian polytheistic religion heavily influenced by Zoroastrianism However the Peace of Acilisene in formalized the Sasanian control over the entire Caucasus though Christian rulers of Iberia sought to rebel at times leading to devastating wars in the th centuries most famously under the rule of King Vakhtang Gorgasali who expanded Iberia to its largest historical extent by capturing all of western Georgia and building a new capital in Tbilisi br br br Medieval unification of Georgia br br In the Sasanian Empire abolished the Kingdom of Iberia leading to the disintegration of its constituent territories into various feudal regions by the early Middle Ages The Roman Persian Wars plunged the region into chaos with both Persia and Constantinople supporting various warring factions in the Caucasus however the Byzantine Empire was able to establish control over Georgian territories by the end of the th century ruling Iberia indirectly through a local Kouropalates br In the Arabs invaded southeastern Georgia starting an extended period of Muslim domination in the region and leading to the establishment of several feudal states seeking independence from each other such as the Emirate of Tbilisi and the Principality of Kakheti Western Georgia remained mostly a Byzantine protectorate especially following the Lazic War br br The lack of a central government in Georgia allowed the rise of the Bagrationi dynasty in the early th century Consolidating lands in the southwestern region of Tao Klarjeti Prince Ashot I used infighting between Arab governors to expand his influence to Iberia and was recognized as Presiding Prince of Iberia by both the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire Though Ashot s descendants formed competing princely lines Adarnase IV managed to unify most Georgian lands except for Kakheti and Abkhazia and was crowned King of the Iberians in restoring the monarchy abolished three centuries prior br In Western Georgia the Kingdom of Abkhazia benefited from the weakening of Byzantium in the region to unify various tribes and become one of the most powerful states of the Caucasus in the th century In the th th centuries Abkhazia grew its influence through several military campaigns and came to control much of Iberia and competing with the Bagrationi Dynastic conflicts eventually weakened Abkhazia in the second half of the th century while in Tao Klarjeti Prince David III used his influence within Byzantine Anatolia to empower the Bagrationi Bagrat III heir of the Bagrationi dynasty successively became King of Abkhazia Prince of Tao Klarjeti and King of the Iberians allowing him to unify most Georgian feudal states and be crowned in as King of Georgia br br br Golden Age and Division br br For much of the th century the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state They were often backed by the Byzantine Empire which feared a dominion of the Caucasus region by the Bagrationi dynasty and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families seeking more power However ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two countries faced a new common enemy the rising Seljuk Empire in the s Following the decisive Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in Constantinople started to retreat from eastern Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish in the s br The Kingdom of Georgia reached its zenith in the th to early th centuries This period during the reigns of David IV r and his great granddaughter Tamar r has been widely termed as the Georgian Golden Age This early Georgian renaissance which preceded its Western European analogue was characterized by impressive military victories territorial expansion and a cultural renaissance in architecture literature philosophy and the sciences The Golden Age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals romantic poetry and literature and the epic poem The Knight in the Panther s Skin considered a national epic br David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats In he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle of Didgori and abolished the Emirate of Tbilisi br br The year reign of Tamar the first female ruler of Georgia is considered the most successful in Georgian history Tamar was given the title king of kings and succeeded in neutralizing her opposition while embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by the downfall of the rival powers of the Seljuks and Byzantium Supported by a powerful military lite Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated the Caucasus and extended over large parts of present day Azerbaijan Armenia eastern Turkey and northern Iran and used the vacuum of power left by the Fourth Crusade to create the Empire of Trebizond as a Georgian vassal state br The revival of the Kingdom of Georgia was set back after Tbilisi was captured and destroyed by the Khwarezmian leader Jalal ad Din in followed by devastating invasions by Mongol ruler Genghis Khan The Mongols were expelled by George V the Brilliant r known for reuniting eastern and western Georgia and restoring the country s previous strength and Christian culture After his death local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule until the total disintegration of the kingdom in the th century Georgia was further weakened by several disastrous invasions by Timur Invasions continued giving the kingdom no time for restoration with both Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans constantly raiding its southern provinces br br br Tripartite division br br The Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi independent principalities Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country and beginning in the th century various Ottoman and Iranian forces subjugated western and eastern regions of Georgia respectively This pushed local Georgian rulers to seek closer ties with Russia In the Kingdom of Imereti sent ambassadors to the Russian royal court with Russia returning the favor in In the presence of these ambassadors Alexander III of Imereti swore an oath of allegiance to Tsar Alexis of Russia on behalf of Imereti Subsequent rulers also sought assistance from Pope Innocent XII but without success br The rulers of regions that remained partly autonomous organized rebellions on various occasions As a result of incessant Ottoman Persian Wars and deportations the population of Georgia dwindled to inhabitants at the end of the th century Eastern Georgia composed of the regions of Kartli and Kakheti had been under Iranian suzerainty since the Peace of Amasya signed with neighbouring rivalling Ottoman Turkey Safavid Georgia With the death of Nader Shah in both kingdoms broke free and were reunified through a personal union under the energetic king Heraclius II who succeeded in stabilizing Eastern Georgia to a degree br br In Russia and the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk which made eastern Georgia a protectorate of Russia guaranteed its territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs br Despite its commitment to defend Georgia Russia rendered no assistance when the Iranians invaded in capturing and sacking Tbilisi and massacring its inhabitants Although Russia initiated a punitive campaign against Persia in the Russian Imperial authorities subsequently violated key promises of the Georgievsk Treaty and in proceeded to annex eastern Georgia while abolishing the Georgian royal Bagrationi dynasty as well as the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church Pyotr Bagration one of the descendants of the abolished house of Bagrationi later joined the Russian army and became a prominent general in the Napoleonic wars br br br Within the Russian Empire br br On December Tsar Paul I of Russia at the alleged request of the Georgian King George XII signed the proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia Kartli Kakheti within the Russian Empire which was finalized by a decree on January and confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on September The Bagrationi royal family was deported from the kingdom The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice chancellor Prince Kurakin br In May under the oversight of General Carl Heinrich von Knorring Imperial Russia transferred power in eastern Georgia to the government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lazarev The Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until April when Knorring assembled the nobility at the Sioni Cathedral and forced them to take an oath on the Imperial Crown of Russia Those who disagreed were temporarily arrested br In the summer of Russian troops on the Askerani River near Zagam defeated the Iranian army during the Russo Persian War and saved Tbilisi from reconquest now that it was officially part of the Imperial territories Russian suzerainty over eastern Georgia was officially finalized with Iran in following the Treaty of Gulistan Following the annexation of eastern Georgia the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti was annexed by Tsar Alexander I The last Imeretian king and the last Georgian Bagrationi ruler Solomon II died in exile in after attempts to rally people against Russia and to enlist foreign support against the latter had been in vain br From to as a result of numerous Russian wars now against Ottoman Turkey several of Georgia s previously lost territories such as Adjara were recovered and also incorporated into the empire The principality of Guria was abolished and incorporated into the Empire in while Svaneti was gradually annexed in Mingrelia although a Russian protectorate since was not absorbed until br Russian rule offered the Georgians security from external threats but it was also often heavy handed and insensitive By the late th century discontent with the Russian authorities grew into a national revival movement led by Ilia Chavchavadze This period also brought social and economic change to Georgia with new social classes emerging the emancipation of the serfs freed many peasants but did little to alleviate their poverty the growth of capitalism created an urban working class in Georgia Both peasants and workers found expression for their discontent through revolts and strikes culminating in the Revolution of Their cause was championed by the socialist Mensheviks who became the dominant political force in Georgia in the final years of Russian rule br br br Declaration of independence br br After the Russian Revolution of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was established with Nikolay Chkheidze acting as its president The federation consisted of three nations Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire Georgia declared independence on May The Menshevik Social Democratic Party of Georgia won the parliamentary election and its leader Noe Zhordania became prime minister Despite the Soviet takeover Zhordania was recognized as the legitimate head of the Georgian Government by France UK Belgium and Poland through the s br The Georgian Armenian War which erupted over parts of disputed provinces between Armenia and Georgia populated mostly by Armenians ended because of British intervention In Georgian general Giorgi Mazniashvili led an attack against the White Army led by Moiseev and Denikin to claim the Black Sea coastline from Tuapse to Sochi and Adler for the independent Georgia In Soviet Russia recognized Georgia s independence with the Treaty of Moscow But the recognition proved to be of little value as the Red Army invaded Georgia in and formally annexed it into the Soviet Union in br br br Soviet Socialist Republic br br In February during the Russian Civil War the Red Army advanced into Georgia and brought the local Bolsheviks to power The Georgian army was defeated and the Social Democratic government fled the country On February the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers and peasants soviets with Filipp Makharadze as acting head of state Georgia was incorporated into what would soon become the Soviet Union Soviet rule was firmly established only after local insurrections were defeated Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the first five year plan when it became a major centre for textile goods br Joseph Stalin an ethnic Georgian was prominent among the Bolsheviks ultimately becoming the de facto leader of the Soviet Union from until his death on March Fellow Georgians such as Lavrentiy Beria and Vsevolod Merkulov likewise held powerful positions in the Soviet government Stalin s Great Purge between and led to thousands of Georgian dissidents intellectuals and other presumed threats to Soviet authority being executed or sent to Gulag penal labor camps severely truncating the nation s cultural and intellectual life br During World War II Germany led an Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June with the aim of conquering all territory up to the Ural Mountains As the initial operation stalled the Axis launched the Fall Blau offensive in to take control of strategic Caucasian oil fields and munitions factories ultimately Axis troops were stopped before reaching Georgian borders Over Georgians constituting about percent of the population fought in the Red Army to repel the invaders and advance towards Berlin an estimated were killed br After Stalin s death Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union and implemented a policy of de Stalinization Khrushchev s purges were met with riots in Tbilisi that had to be dispersed by military force This violent turn of events that compromised Georgian loyalty to the Soviet Union contributing to the nation s consolidation Georgian demonstrations saw the return of mass anti Soviet protests but this time government backed down br Throughout the remainder of the Soviet period Georgia s economy continued to grow and experience significant improvement though it increasingly exhibited blatant corruption and alienation of the government from the people With the beginning of perestroika in the Georgian Soviet leadership proved so incapable of handling the changes that most Georgians including rank and file communists concluded that the only way forward was a break from the existing Soviet system br br br Restoration of independence br br Starting in mass protests erupted in Georgia in favor of independence led by Georgian nationalists such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia The following year the brutal suppression by Soviet forces of a large peaceful demonstration held in Tbilisi on April proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country br In October the first multi party elections were held in Soviet Georgia which turned out to be the first multi party elections in the entire Soviet Union in which the opposition groups were registered as formal political parties The Round Table Free Georgia coalition led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia secured victory in this election and formed a new government On April shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union the Supreme Council of Georgia declared independence after a referendum held on March Georgia was the first non Baltic republic of the Soviet Union to officially declare independence with Romania becoming the first country to recognize Georgia in August On May Gamsakhurdia was elected president in the first presidential election with of the vote on a turnout of over br Gamsakhurdia was soon deposed in a bloody coup d tat from December to January The coup was instigated by part of the National Guard and a paramilitary organization called Mkhedrioni horsemen The country then became embroiled in a bitter civil war which lasted until Simmering disputes within two regions of Georgia Abkhazia and South Ossetia between local separatists and the majority Georgian populations erupted into widespread inter ethnic violence and wars Supported by Russia Abkhazia and South Ossetia achieved de facto independence from Georgia with Georgia retaining control only in small areas of the disputed territories Eduard Shevardnadze Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs from to returned to Georgia in and was elected as head of state in that year s elections and as president in br During the War in Abkhazia roughly to Georgians were expelled from Abkhazia by Abkhaz separatists and North Caucasian volunteers including Chechens Around Georgians fled South Ossetia while Ossetians fled Georgia br br In Shevardnadze who won re election in was deposed by the Rose Revolution after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that November parliamentary elections were marred by fraud The revolution was led by Mikheil Saakashvili Zurab Zhvania and Nino Burjanadze former members and leaders of Shevardnadze s ruling party Mikheil Saakashvili was elected as President of Georgia in br Following the Rose Revolution a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country s military and economic capabilities as well as to reorient its foreign policy westwards The new government s efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of Adjara led to a major crisis in br The country s newly pro Western stance along with accusations of Georgian involvement in the Second Chechen War resulted in a severe deterioration of relations with Russia fueled also by Russia s open assistance and support to the two secessionist areas Despite these increasingly difficult relations in May Georgia and Russia reached a bilateral agreement by which Russian military bases dating back to the Soviet era in Batumi and Akhalkalaki were withdrawn Russia withdrew all personnel and equipment from these sites by December while failing to withdraw from the Gudauta base in Abkhazia which it was required to vacate after the adoption of the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty during the Istanbul summit br br br Russo Georgian War br br There was a Russo Georgian diplomatic crisis in April A bomb explosion on August targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers South Ossetians were responsible for instigating this incident which marked the opening of hostilities and injured five Georgian servicemen then several South Ossetian militiamen were killed by snipers South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on August These artillery bombardments caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically br On August the Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire and called for peace talks More attacks on Georgian villages located in the South Ossetian conflict zone were soon matched with gunfire from Georgian troops who then proceeded to move in the direction of the capital of the self proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia Tskhinvali on the night of August reaching its centre in the morning of August According to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer the Ossetian provocation was aimed at triggering Georgian retaliation which was needed as a pretext for a Russian military invasion According to Georgian intelligence and several Russian media reports parts of the regular non peacekeeping Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military action br Russia accused Georgia of aggression against South Ossetia and began a large land air and sea invasion of Georgia under the pretext of a peace enforcement operation on August Abkhaz forces opened a second front on August with the Battle of the Kodori Valley an attack on the Kodori Gorge held by Georgia Tskhinvali was seized by the Russian military by August Russian forces occupied Georgian cities beyond the disputed territories br During the conflict there was a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Georgians in South Ossetia including destruction of Georgian settlements after the war had ended The war displaced people and while many were able to return to their homes after the war a year later around ethnic Georgians remained displaced In an interview published in Kommersant South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity said he would not allow Georgians to return br The President of France Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated a ceasefire agreement on August Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as separate republics on August The Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia Russian forces left the buffer areas bordering Abkhazia and South Ossetia on October and the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia was dispatched to the buffer areas Since the war Georgia has maintained that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are occupied Georgian territories br br br Georgian Dream government present br br In preparation for the parliamentary elections Georgia implemented constitutional reforms to switch to a parliamentary democracy moving executive powers from the President to the Prime Minister The transition was set to start with the October parliamentary elections and to be completed with the presidential elections br Against the expectations of the ruling United National Movement UNM of president Mikheil Saakashvili a party coalition centred around the newly founded Georgian Dream party won the parliamentary elections in October bringing an end to nine years of UNM rule and marking the first peaceful electoral transfer of power in Georgia President Saakashvili acknowledged the defeat of his party on the following day Georgian Dream was founded led and financed by tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili the country s richest man who was subsequently elected by parliament as new Prime Minister Due to the incomplete transition to parliamentary democracy a year of uneasy cohabitation between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili followed until the presidential election in October which was won by Giorgi Margvelashvili from the Georgian Dream party With the completed transfer of power Prime Minister Ivanishvili stepped aside and named one of his close business associates Irakli Garibashvili as the next prime minister Ivanishvili has since been called the informal leader of Georgia arranging political reappointments from behind the scenes Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election In he was convicted in absentia on corruption charges and abuse of power which he denied br Georgian Dream won the parliamentary elections with of the vote while UNM received As result of the mixed proportional majoritarian voting system this translated into a parliamentary supermajority of out of seats This electoral imbalance became a key issue of political and civil society strife in the following years In the presidential election the Georgian Dream party backed Salome Zurabishvili who won in the second round becoming the first woman in Georgia to hold the office in full capacity This was the last direct election of a Georgian president as additional constitutional reforms removed the popular vote br After international mediation to overcome the deep political crisis in the runup to the parliamentary elections an amended electoral system was adopted specifically for the elections Nine parties were elected to parliament Georgian Dream secured over of votes which translated into out of seats They were thus able to continue to govern alone The opposition made accusations of fraud which Georgian Dream denied Thousands of people gathered outside the Central Election Commission to demand a new vote This led to a new political crisis that was temporarily resolved by an EU brokered agreement from which the Georgian Dream later withdrew In February Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia resigned and Irakli Garibashvili became Prime Minister once more br Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in Georgia has topped the list of countries which Russian exiles departed to after the war began Russians are allowed to stay in Georgia for at least one year without a visa though many Georgians view the presence of more Russian citizens in Georgia as a security risk br On March the Parliament of Georgia led by the Georgian Dream coalition attempted to pass the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence which requires Non Governmental Organizations NGOs to register as agents of foreign influence if upwards of of their funding is from foreign support The passing of the bill resulted in severe protests and criticism from the US State Department United Nations and European Union leading to the termination of further discussions of the bill On April the Georgian Parliament announced the draft of a similar law named the Proposed Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence leading to larger protests the bill has been described as the Russian law by the opposition and protestors in reference to the Russian foreign agent law Around people have joined the protests against the law which they describe as Kremlin style and a threat to democracy and free speech br br br Geography br br Georgia is a mountainous country situated almost entirely in the South Caucasus while some slivers of the country are situated north of the Caucasus Watershed in the North Caucasus The country lies between latitudes and N and longitudes and E with an area of km sq mi The Likhi Range divides the country into eastern and western halves Historically the western portion of Georgia was known as Colchis while the eastern plateau was called Iberia br The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border of Georgia The main roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between Shida Kartli and North Ossetia and the Darial Gorge in the Georgian region of Khevi The southern portion of the country is bounded by the Lesser Caucasus Mountains The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range is much higher in elevation than the Lesser Caucasus Mountains with the highest peaks rising more than metres ft above sea level br br The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount Shkhara at metres ft and the second highest is Mount Janga at m ft above sea level Other prominent peaks include Mount Kazbek at m ft Shota Rustaveli Peak m ft Tetnuldi m ft Ushba m ft and Ailama m ft Out of the abovementioned peaks only Kazbek is of volcanic origin The region between Kazbek and Shkhara a distance of about km mi along the Main Caucasus Range is dominated by numerous glaciers br The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous highland areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various interconnected mountain ranges largely of volcanic origin and plateaus that do not exceed metres ft in elevation Prominent features of the area include the Javakheti Volcanic Plateau lakes including Tabatskuri and Paravani as well as mineral water and hot springs Two major rivers in Georgia are the Rioni and the Mtkvari br br br Topography br br The landscape within the nation s boundaries is quite varied Western Georgia s landscape ranges from low land marsh forests swamps and temperate rainforests to eternal snows and glaciers while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi arid plains br Much of the natural habitat in the low lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past years because of the agricultural development of the land and urbanization The large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves e g Lake Paliastomi area At present the forest cover generally remains outside of the low lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains Western Georgia s forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below metres ft above sea level and contain species such as oak hornbeam beech elm ash and chestnut Evergreen species such as box may also be found in many areas Ca of all higher plants of Georgia are endemic to this country br br The west central slopes of the Meskheti Range in Ajaria as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by temperate rain forests Between metres ft above sea level the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life The zone is made up mainly of beech spruce and fir forests From metres ft the forest becomes largely coniferous The tree line generally ends at around metres ft and the alpine zone takes over which in most areas extends up to an elevation of metres ft above sea level br Eastern Georgia s landscape referring to the territory east of the Likhi Range is considerably different from that of the west although much like the Colchis plain in the west nearly all of the low lying areas of eastern Georgia including the Mtkvari and Alazani River plains have been deforested for agricultural purposes The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains In contrast with western Georgia nearly per cent of the forests of the region are deciduous Coniferous forests only dominate in the Borjomi Gorge and in the extreme western areas Out of the deciduous species of trees beech oak and hornbeam dominate Other deciduous species include several varieties of maple aspen ash and hazelnut br At higher elevations above metres ft above sea level particularly in the Tusheti Khevsureti and Khevi regions pine and birch forests dominate In general the forests in eastern Georgia occur between metres ft above sea level with the alpine zone extending from to metres to ft The only remaining large low land forests remain in the Alazani Valley of Kakheti br br br Climate br br The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse considering the nation s small size There are two main climatic zones roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia s climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south br Much of western Georgia lies within the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from mm in reaching a maximum during the Autumn months The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year the foothills and mountainous areas including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains experience cool wet summers and snowy winters snow cover often exceeds metres or feet inches in many regions br Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental The region s weather patterns are influenced both by dry Caspian air masses from the east and humid Black Sea air masses from the west The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by mountain ranges Likhi and Meskheti that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation The wettest periods generally occur during spring and autumn while winter and summer months tend to be the driest Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers especially in the low lying areas and relatively cold winters As in the western parts of the nation elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia where climatic conditions above metres ft are considerably colder than in the low lying areas br br br Biodiversity br br Because of its high landscape diversity and low latitude Georgia is home to about species of animals including species of vertebrates more than of the species found worldwide and many of these species are endemics A number of large carnivores live in the forests namely Brown bears wolves lynxes and Caucasian Leopards The common pheasant also known as the Colchian Pheasant is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important game bird The species number of invertebrates is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications The spider checklist of Georgia for example includes species The Rioni River may contain a breeding population of the critically endangered bastard sturgeon br Slightly more than species of fungi including lichen forming species have been recorded from Georgia but this number is far from complete The true total number of fungal species occurring in Georgia including species not yet recorded is likely to be far higher given the generally accepted estimate that only about seven per cent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered Although the amount of available information is still very small a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Georgia and species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country species of plants have been recorded from Georgia in association with fungi According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature there are species of vascular plants in Georgia br Georgia is home to four ecoregions Caucasus mixed forests Euxine Colchic deciduous forests Eastern Anatolian montane steppe and Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe It had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it st globally out of countries br br br Government and politics br br Georgia is a representative democratic parliamentary republic the President serves as the largely ceremonial head of state whereas the Prime Minister is head of government Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of Georgia composed of ministers headed by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Parliament Salome Zurabishvili is the current President of Georgia after winning of the vote in the Georgian presidential election Since February Irakli Gharibashvili has been the prime minister of Georgia br Legislative authority is vested in the Parliament of Georgia It is unicameral and has members known as deputies of whom are elected by plurality to represent single member districts and are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation Members of parliament are elected for
