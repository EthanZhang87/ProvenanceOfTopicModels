Belgium officially the Kingdom of Belgium is a country in Northwestern Europe The country is bordered by the Netherlands to the north Germany to the east Luxembourg to the southeast France to the south and the North Sea to the west It covers an area of km sq mi and has a population of more than million making it the nd most densely populated country in the world and the th most densely populated country in Europe with a density of km sq mi Belgium is part of an area known as the Low Countries historically a somewhat larger region than the Benelux group of states as it also included parts of northern France The capital and largest metropolitan region is Brussels other major cities are Antwerp Ghent Charleroi Li ge Bruges Namur and Leuven br Belgium is a sovereign state and a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system Its institutional organization is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds It is divided into three highly autonomous regions the Flemish Region Flanders in the north the Walloon Region Wallonia in the south and the Brussels Capital Region Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region as well as the richest region in terms of GDP per capita Belgium is also home to two main linguistic communities the Flemish Community which constitutes about percent of the population and the French Community which constitutes about percent of the population A small German speaking Community making up around one percent of the population exists in the East Cantons The Brussels Capital Region is officially bilingual in French and Dutch although French is the majority language and lingua franca Belgium s linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its complex system of governance made up of six different governments br Since the Middle Ages Belgium s central location has meant that the area has been relatively prosperous connected commercially and politically to its bigger neighbours The country as it exists today was established following the Belgian Revolution when it seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands which had incorporated the Southern Netherlands which comprised most of modern day Belgium after the Congress of Vienna in The name chosen for the new state is derived from the Latin word Belgium used in Julius Caesar s Gallic Wars to describe a nearby region in the period around BCE Belgium has also been the battleground of European powers earning the moniker the Battlefield of Europe a reputation reinforced in the th century by both world wars br Belgium participated in the Industrial Revolution and during the course of the th century possessed a number of colonies notably the Belgian Congo and Ruanda Urundi These colonies gained independence between and The second half of the th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch speakers and French speakers fueled by differences in language and culture and the unequal economic development of Flanders and Wallonia This continuing antagonism has led to several far reaching state reforms resulting in the transition from a unitary to a federal arrangement between and Despite the reforms tensions have persisted there is particularly significant separatist sentiment among the Flemish language laws such as the municipalities with language facilities have been the source of much controversy and the government formation period following the federal election set the world record at days Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders which boomed after the Second World War br Belgium is a developed country with an advanced high income economy The country is one of the six founding members of the European Union and its capital Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union itself hosting the official seats of the European Commission the Council of the European Union and the European Council as well as one of two seats of the European Parliament the other being Strasbourg Belgium is also a founding member of the Eurozone NATO OECD and WTO and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union and the Schengen Area Brussels also hosts the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO br br br History br br br Antiquity br br According to Julius Caesar the Belgae were the inhabitants of the northernmost part of Gaul They lived in a region stretching from Paris to the Rhine which is much bigger than modern Belgium However he also specifically used the Latin word Belgium to refer to a politically dominant part of that region which is now in northernmost France Modern Belgium corresponds to the lands of the most northerly Belgae the Morini Menapii Nervii Germani Cisrhenani and Aduatuci whom Caesar found particularly warlike and economically undeveloped Caesar described this region as having strong kinship links to the Germanic tribes east of the Rhine The area around Arlon in southern Belgium was a part of the country of the Treveri br After Caesar s conquests Gallia Belgica came to be the Latin name of a large Roman province covering most of Northern Gaul including the Treveri However areas closer to the lower Rhine frontier including the eastern part of modern Belgium subsequently became part of the frontier province of Germania Inferior which continued to interact with their neighbours outside the empire At the time when central government collapsed in the Western Roman Empire the Roman provinces of Belgica and Germania were inhabited by a mix of a Romanized population and Germanic speaking Franks who came to dominate the military and political class br br br Middle Ages br During the th century the area came under the rule of the Frankish Merovingian kings who initially established a kingdom ruling over the Romanized population in what is now northern France and then conquered the other Frankish kingdoms During the th century the empire of the Franks came to be ruled by the Carolingian dynasty whose centre of power included the area which is now eastern Belgium Over the centuries it was divided up in many ways but the Treaty of Verdun in divided the Carolingian Empire into three kingdoms whose borders had a lasting impact on medieval political boundaries Most of modern Belgium was in the Middle Kingdom later known as Lotharingia but the coastal county of Flanders west of the Scheldt became the northernmost part of West Francia the predecessor of France In in the Treaty of Meerssen modern Belgium lands all became part of the western kingdom for a period but in in the Treaty of Ribemont Lotharingia came under the lasting control of the eastern kingdom which became the Holy Roman Empire The lordships and bishoprics along the March frontier between the two great kingdoms maintained important connections between each other For example the county of Flanders expanded over the Scheldt into the empire and during several periods was ruled by the same lords as the county of Hainaut br In the th and th centuries the cloth industry and commerce boomed especially in the County of Flanders and it became one of the richest areas in Europe This prosperity played a role in conflicts between Flanders and the king of France Famously Flemish militias scored a surprise victory at the Battle of the Golden Spurs against a strong force of mounted knights in but France soon regained control of the rebellious province br br br Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands br br In the th century the Duke of Burgundy in France took control of Flanders and from there they proceeded to unite much of what is now the Benelux the so called Burgundian Netherlands Burgundy and Flanders were the first two common names used for the Burgundian Netherlands which was the predecessor of the Austrian Netherlands the predecessor of modern Belgium The union technically stretching between two kingdoms gave the area economic and political stability which led to an even greater prosperity and artistic creation br Born in Belgium the Habsburg Emperor Charles V was heir of the Burgundians but also of the royal families of Austria Castile and Aragon With the Pragmatic Sanction of he gave the Seventeen Provinces more legitimacy as a stable entity rather than just a temporary personal union He also increased the influence of these Netherlands over the Prince Bishopric of Li ge which continued to exist as a large semi independent enclave br br br Spanish and Austrian Netherlands br The Eighty Years War was triggered by the Spanish government s policy towards Protestantism which was becoming popular in the Low Countries The rebellious northern United Provinces Belgica Foederata in Latin the Federated Netherlands eventually separated from the Southern Netherlands Belgica Regia the Royal Netherlands The southern part continued to be ruled successively by the Spanish Spanish Netherlands and the Austrian House of Habsburgs Austrian Netherlands and comprised most of modern Belgium This was the theatre of several more protracted conflicts during much of the th and th centuries involving France including the Franco Dutch War the Nine Years War the War of the Spanish Succession and part of the War of the Austrian Succession br br br French Revolution and United Kingdom of the Netherlands br Following the campaigns of in the French Revolutionary Wars the Low Countries including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule such as the Prince Bishopric of Li ge were annexed by the French First Republic ending Austrian rule in the region A reunification of the Low Countries as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands occurred at the dissolution of the First French Empire in after the abdication of Napoleon br br br Independent Belgium br br In the Belgian Revolution led to the re separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois officially French speaking and neutral independent Belgium under a provisional government and a national congress Since the installation of Leopold I as king on July now celebrated as Belgium s National Day Belgium has been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy with a laicist constitution based on the Napoleonic code Although the franchise was initially restricted universal suffrage for men was introduced after the general strike of with plural voting until and for women in br The main political parties of the th century were the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party with the Belgian Labour Party emerging towards the end of the th century French was originally the official language used by the nobility and the bourgeoisie especially after the rejection of the Dutch monarchy French progressively lost its dominance as Dutch began to recover its status This recognition became official in and in the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the Constitution br The Berlin Conference of ceded control of the Congo Free State to King Leopold II as his private possession From around there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production Many Congolese were killed by Leopold s agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber In this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony henceforth called the Belgian Congo A Belgian commission in estimated that Congo s population was half what it was in br br Germany invaded Belgium in August as part of the Schlieffen Plan to attack France and much of the Western Front fighting of World War I occurred in western parts of the country The opening months of the war were known as the Rape of Belgium due to German excesses Belgium assumed control of the German colonies of Ruanda Urundi modern day Rwanda and Burundi during the war and in the League of Nations mandated them to Belgium In the aftermath of the First World War Belgium annexed the Prussian districts of Eupen and Malmedy in thereby causing the presence of a German speaking minority br German forces again invaded the country in May and Belgians over half of them Jews were killed during the subsequent occupation and the Holocaust From September to February the Allies liberated Belgium After World War II a general strike forced King Leopold III to abdicate in in favour of his son Prince Baudouin since many Belgians thought he had collaborated with Germany during the war The Belgian Congo gained independence in during the Congo Crisis Ruanda Urundi followed with its independence two years later Belgium joined NATO as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg br Belgium became one of the six founding members of the European Coal and Steel Community in and of the European Atomic Energy Community and European Economic Community established in The latter has now become the European Union for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions including the European Commission the Council of the European Union and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the European Parliament br In the early s Belgium saw several large corruption scandals notably surrounding Marc Dutroux Andre Cools the Dioxin Affair Agusta Scandal and the murder of Karel van Noppen br br br Geography br br Belgium shares borders with France km Germany km Luxembourg km and the Netherlands km Its total surface including water area is km sq mi Before its total area was believed to be km sq mi However when the country s statistics were measured in a new calculation method was used Unlike previous calculations this one included the area from the coast to the low water line revealing the country to be km sq mi larger in surface area than previously thought Its land area alone is square kilometers It lies between latitudes and N and longitudes and E br Belgium has three main geographical regions the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo Belgian Basin and the Ardennes uplands in the southeast to the Hercynian orogenic belt The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium s southernmost tip Belgian Lorraine br The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and polders Further inland lies a smooth slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the Campine Kempen The thickly forested hills and plateaus of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small gorges Extending westward into France this area is eastwardly connected to the Eifel in Germany by the High Fens plateau on which the Signal de Botrange forms the country s highest point at m ft br The climate is maritime temperate with significant precipitation in all seasons K ppen climate classification Cfb like most of northwest Europe The average temperature is lowest in January at C F and highest in July at C F The average precipitation per month varies between mm in for February and April to mm in for July Averages for the years to show daily temperature minimums of C F and maximums of C F and monthly rainfall of mm in these are about C and nearly millimeters above last century s normal values respectively br Phytogeographically Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom According to the World Wide Fund for Nature the territory of Belgium belongs to the terrestrial ecoregions of Atlantic mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests Belgium had a Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of ranking it rd globally out of countries br br br Provinces br br The territory of Belgium is divided into three Regions two of which the Flemish Region and Walloon Region are in turn subdivided into provinces the third Region the Brussels Capital Region is neither a province nor a part of a province br br br Politics and government br br Belgium is a constitutional popular monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy The bicameral federal parliament is composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Representatives The former is made up of senators appointed by the parliaments of the communities and regions and co opted senators Prior to most of the Senate s members were directly elected The Chamber s representatives are elected under a proportional voting system from electoral districts Belgium has compulsory voting and thus maintains one of the highest rates of voter turnout in the world br The King currently Philippe is the head of state though with limited prerogatives He appoints ministers including a Prime Minister that have the confidence of the Chamber of Representatives to form the federal government The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members With the possible exception of the Prime Minister the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch speaking members and French speaking members br The judicial system is based on civil law and originates from the Napoleonic code The Court of Cassation is the court of last resort with the courts of appeal one level below br br br Political culture br Belgium s political institutions are complex most political power rests on representation of the main cultural communities br Since about the significant national Belgian political parties have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities br The major parties in each community though close to the political center belong to three main groups Christian Democrats Liberals and Social Democrats br Further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century mainly to represent linguistic nationalist or environmental interests and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature br br A string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from was broken in after the first dioxin crisis a major food contamination scandal A rainbow coalition emerged from six parties the Flemish and the French speaking Liberals Social Democrats and Greens Later a purple coalition of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the election br The government led by Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt from to achieved a balanced budget some tax reforms a labor market reform scheduled nuclear phase out and instigated legislation allowing more stringent war crime and more lenient soft drug usage prosecution Restrictions on euthanasia were reduced and same sex marriage was introduced The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa and opposed the invasion of Iraq It is the only country that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia br Verhofstadt s coalition fared badly in the June elections For more than a year the country experienced a political crisis This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible partition of Belgium From December until March the temporary Verhofstadt III Government was in office This was a coalition of the Flemish and Francophone Christian Democrats the Flemish and Francophone Liberals together with the Francophone Social Democrats br On that day a new government led by Flemish Christian Democrat Yves Leterme the actual winner of the federal elections of June was sworn in by the king On July Leterme offered the resignation of the cabinet to the king as no progress in constitutional reforms had been made br In December Leterme once more offered his resignation after a crisis surrounding the sale of Fortis to BNP Paribas At this juncture his resignation was accepted and Christian Democratic and Flemish Herman Van Rompuy was sworn in as Prime Minister on December br After Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent President of the European Council on November he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert II on November A few hours later the new government under Prime Minister Yves Leterme was sworn in On April Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king after one of the coalition partners the OpenVLD withdrew from the government and on April King Albert officially accepted the resignation br The Parliamentary elections in Belgium on June saw the Flemish nationalist N VA become the largest party in Flanders and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia Until December Belgium was governed by Leterme s caretaker government awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for formation of a new government By March this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government previously held by war torn Iraq Finally in December the Di Rupo Government led by Walloon socialist Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo was sworn in br The federal election coinciding with the regional elections resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist N VA although the incumbent coalition composed of Flemish and French speaking Social Democrats Liberals and Christian Democrats maintains a solid majority in Parliament and in all electoral constituencies On July King Philippe nominated Charles Michel MR and Kris Peeters CD V to lead the formation of a new federal cabinet composed of the Flemish parties N VA CD V Open Vld and the French speaking MR which resulted in the Michel Government It was the first time N VA was part of the federal cabinet while the French speaking side was represented only by the MR which achieved a minority of the public votes in Wallonia br In May federal elections in the Flemish speaking northern region of Flanders far right Vlaams Belang party made major gains In the French speaking southern area of Wallonia the Socialists were strong The moderate Flemish nationalist party the N VA remained the largest party in parliament br In July prime minister Charles Michel was selected to hold the post of President of the European Council His successor Sophie Wilm s was Belgium s first female prime minister She led the caretaker government since October The Flemish Liberal party politician Alexander De Croo became new prime minister in October The parties had agreed on federal government months after the elections br br br Communities and regions br br Following a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburg courts in the th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively second class citizens Late that century and continuing into the th century Flemish movements evolved to counter this situation br While the people in Southern Belgium spoke French or dialects of French and most Brusselers adopted French as their first language the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making Dutch an equal language in the education system Following World War II Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimize the potential for conflict br Based on the four language areas defined in the Dutch bilingual French and German language areas consecutive revisions of the country s constitution in and established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels br br The federal government based in Brussels br The three language communities br the Flemish Community Dutch speaking br the French Community French speaking br the German speaking Community br The three regions br the Flemish Region subdivided into five provinces br the Walloon Region subdivided into five provinces br the Brussels Capital Region br The constitutional language areas determine the official languages in their municipalities as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments when the Communities and Regions were created in Flemish politicians decided to merge both Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters br The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities the territory of the Brussels Capital Region which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions is included in both the Flemish and French Communities and the territory of the German speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the Constitutional Court of Belgium The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully br br br Locus of policy jurisdiction br The Federal State s authority includes justice defense federal police social security nuclear energy monetary policy and public debt and other aspects of public finances State owned companies include the Belgian Post Group and Belgian Railways The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO It controls substantial parts of public health home affairs and foreign affairs The budget without the debt controlled by the federal government amounts to about of the national fiscal income The federal government employs around of the civil servants br Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community s language culture including audiovisual media education and the use of the relevant language Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy curative and preventive medicine and assistance to individuals protection of youth social welfare aid to families immigrant assistance services and so on br Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory These include economy employment agriculture water policy housing public works energy transport the environment town and country planning nature conservation credit and foreign trade They supervise the provinces municipalities and intercommunal utility companies br In several fields the different levels each have their own say on specifics With education for instance the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications which remain federal matters Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers The treaty making power of the Regions and Communities Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world br br br Foreign relations br br Because of its location at the crossroads of Western Europe Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbors With virtually defenseless borders Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation The Belgians have been strong advocates of European integration The headquarters of NATO and of several of the institutions of the European Union are located in Belgium br br br Armed forces br br The Belgian Armed Forces had active personnel in including in the Land Component in the Naval Component in the Air Component in the Medical Component and in joint service in addition to reserve personnel In Belgium s defense budget totaled billion billion representing of its GDP The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the Ministry of Defense which is headed by the Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training and to the Chief of Defense The Belgian military consists of volunteers conscription was abolished in and citizens of other EU states Iceland Norway Switzerland or Lichtenstein are also able to join Belgium has troops deployed in several African countries as part of UN or EU missions in Iraq for the war against the Islamic State and in eastern Europe for the NATO presence there br The effects of the Second World War made collective security a priority for Belgian foreign policy In March Belgium signed the Treaty of Brussels and then joined NATO in However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the Korean War The Belgians along with the Luxembourg government sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the Belgian United Nations Command This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported Currently the Belgian Marine Component is working closely together with the Dutch Navy under the command of the Admiral Benelux br br br Economy br br Belgium s strongly globalized economy and its transport infrastructure are integrated with the rest of Europe Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world s th largest trading nation in The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force high GNP and high exports per capita Belgium s main imports are raw materials machinery and equipment chemicals raw diamonds pharmaceuticals foodstuffs transportation equipment and oil products Its main exports are machinery and equipment chemicals finished diamonds metals and metal products and foodstuffs br The Belgian economy is heavily service oriented and shows a dual nature a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind One of the founding members of the European Union Belgium strongly supports an open economy and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies Since through the Belgium Luxembourg Economic Union Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union br br Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the Industrial Revolution in the early th century Areas in Li ge Province and around Charleroi rapidly developed mining and steelmaking which flourished until the mid th century in the Sambre and Meuse valley and made Belgium one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from to However by the s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis and the region experienced famine from to br After World War II Ghent and Antwerp experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries The and oil crises sent the economy into a recession it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced a serious decline In the s and s the economic center of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous Flemish Diamond area br By the end of the s Belgian macroeconomic policies had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about of GDP As of the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to of GDP In and real GDP growth rates of and respectively were slightly above the average for the Euro area Unemployment rates of in and in were close to the area average By October this had grown to compared to an average rate of for the European Union as a whole EU From until Belgium s currency was the Belgian franc Belgium switched to the euro in with the first sets of euro coins being minted in The standard Belgian euro coins designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch first King Albert II since King Philippe br Despite an decrease observed from to Belgium still had in the highest rail network density within the European Union with km km On the other hand the same period has seen a huge growth of the motorway network In the density of km motorways per km and inhabitants amounted to and respectively and were significantly superior to the EU s means of and br br From a biological resource perspective Belgium has a low endowment Belgium s biocapacity adds up to only global hectares in just about half of the global hectares of biocapacity available per person worldwide In contrast in Belgians used on average global hectares of biocapacity their ecological footprint of consumption This means they required about eight times as much biocapacity as Belgium contains As a result Belgium was running a biocapacity deficit of global hectares per person in br Belgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in Europe In commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively and hours a year in traffic jams Like in most small European countries more than of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport the Brussels Airport The ports of Antwerp and Zeebrugge Bruges share more than of Belgian maritime traffic Antwerp being the second European harbor with a gross weight of goods handled of t in after a growth of over the preceding five years In the port of Antwerp handled million tons after a year on year growth of br There is a large economic gap between Flanders and Wallonia Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders mostly due to its heavy industries but the decline of the steel industry post World War II led to the region s rapid decline whereas Flanders rose swiftly Since then Flanders has been prosperous among the wealthiest regions in Europe whereas Wallonia has been languishing As of the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already existing language divide Pro independence movements have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence The separatist New Flemish Alliance N VA party for instance is the largest party in Belgium br br br Science and technology br br Contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country s history The th century Early Modern flourishing of Western Europe included cartographer Gerardus Mercator anatomist Andreas Vesalius herbalist Rembert Dodoens and mathematician Simon Stevin among the most influential scientists br Chemist Ernest Solvay and engineer Zenobe Gramme cole industrielle de Li ge gave their names to the Solvay process and the Gramme dynamo respectively in the s Bakelite was developed in by Leo Baekeland Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave his name to the Solvay Institute of Sociology the Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the Universit libre de Bruxelles In he started a series of conferences the Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian Monsignor Georges Lema tre Catholic University of Louvain who is credited with proposing the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe in br Three Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine were awarded to Belgians Jules Bordet Universit libre de Bruxelles in Corneille Heymans University of Ghent in and Albert Claude Universit libre de Bruxelles together with Christian de Duve Universit catholique de Louvain in Fran ois Englert Universit libre de Bruxelles was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in Ilya Prigogine Universit libre de Bruxelles was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the Fields Medal Pierre Deligne in and Jean Bourgain in Belgium was ranked rd in the Global Innovation Index in br br br Demographics br br As of January the total population of Belgium according to its population register was The population density of Belgium is km sq mi as of January making it the nd most densely populated country in the world and the th most densely populated country in Europe The most densely populated province is Antwerp the least densely populated province is Luxembourg As of January the Flemish Region had a population of of Belgium its most populous cities being Antwerp Ghent and Bruges Wallonia had a population of of Belgium with Charleroi Li ge and Namur its most populous cities The Brussels Capital Region has inhabitants of Belgium in the municipalities three of which have over residents br In the average total fertility rate TFR across Belgium was children per woman below the replacement rate of it remains considerably below the high of children born per woman in Belgium subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world with an average age of years br br br Migration br As of nearly of the population had Belgian citizenship and other European Union member citizens account for around The prevalent foreign nationals were Italian French Dutch Moroccan Portuguese Spanish Turkish and German In there were million foreign born residents in Belgium corresponding to of the total population Of these were born outside the EU and were born in another EU Member State br At the beginning of people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around of the total population i e million new Belgians Of these new Belgians are of European ancestry and are from non Western countries most of them from Morocco Turkey and the DR Congo Since the modification of the Belgian nationality law in more than million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Italian Belgians and Moroccan Belgians of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized as have of people of Moroccan background of Italians of the French and of Dutch people br Statbel released figures of the Belgian population in relation to the origin of people in Belgium According to the data as of January of the Belgian population was of ethnic Belgian origin and were of foreign origin or nationality with of those of a foreign nationality or ethnic group originating from neighbouring countries The study also found that of the Brussels Capital Region were of non Belgian origin of which originated from neighbouring countries br br br Languages br br Belgium has three official languages Dutch French and German A number of non official minority languages are spoken as well br As no census exists there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium s three official languages or their dialects However various criteria including the language s of parents of education or the second language status of foreign born may provide suggested figures An estimated of the Belgian population are native speakers of Dutch often referred to as Flemish and of the population speaks French natively French speaking Belgians are often referred to as Walloons although the French speakers in Brussels are not Walloons br The total number of native Dutch speakers is estimated to be about million concentrated in the northern Flanders region while native French speakers number million in Wallonia and an estimated or in the officially bilingual Brussels Capital Region The German speaking Community is made up of people in the east of the Walloon Region around German and Belgian nationals are speakers of German Roughly more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community br Both Belgian Dutch and Belgian French have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France Many Flemish people still speak dialects of Dutch in their local environment Walloon considered either as a dialect of French or a distinct Romance language is now only understood and spoken occasionally mostly by elderly people Walloon is divided into four dialects which along with those of Picard are rarely used in public life and have largely been replaced by French br br br Religion br br The Constitution of Belgium provides for freedom of religion and the government respects this right in practice Belgium officially recognizes three religions Christianity Catholic Protestantism Orthodox churches and Anglicanism Islam and Judaism During the reigns of Albert I and Baudouin the Belgian royal family had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism br Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium s majority religion being especially strong in Flanders However by Sunday church attendance was for Belgium in total in Brussels and in Flanders Church attendance in in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in for the total of Belgium in Despite the drop in church attendance Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium s culture br According to the Eurobarometer of Belgian citizens believe in God in some sort of spirit or life force do not believe in any sort of spirit God or life force did not respond According to the Eurobarometer of the total population of Belgium adhered to Christianity with Catholicism being the largest denomination with Protestants comprised and Orthodox Christians were the of the total Non religious people comprised of the population and were divided between atheists and agnostics A further of the population was Muslim and were believers in other religions The same survey held in found that Christianity was the largest religion in Belgium accounting for of Belgians br br In the early s there were approximately Jews in Belgium The Jewish Community of Antwerp numbering some is one of the largest in Europe and one of the last places in the world where Yiddish is the primary language of a large Jewish community mirroring certain Orthodox and Hasidic communities in New York New Jersey and Israel In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education There are several Jewish newspapers and more than active synagogues of which are in Antwerp in the country br A inquiry in Flanders considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia showed that considered themselves religious and that believed that God created the universe On the other hand Wallonia has become one of Europe s most secular least religious regions Most of the French speaking region s population does not consider religion an important part of their lives and as much as of the population identifies as irreligious This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border br br A estimate found that approximately of the Belgian population people is Muslim Muslims constitute of the population of Brussels of Wallonia and of Flanders The majority of Belgian Muslims live in the major cities such as Antwerp Brussels and Charleroi The largest group of immigrants in Belgium are Moroccans with people The Turks are the third largest group and the second largest Muslim ethnic group numbering br br br Health br br The Belgians enjoy good health According to estimates the average life expectancy is years Since life expectancy has in line with the European average grown by two months per year Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders neoplasms disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death accidents suicide Non natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age and males up to age br Healthcare in Belgium is financed through both social security contributions and taxation Health insurance is compulsory Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public university and semi private hospitals Health care service are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions but for ineligible categories of patients and services so called rd party payment systems exist The Belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government the Flemish and Walloon Regional governments and the German Community also has indirect oversight and responsibilities br For the first time in Belgian history the first child was euthanized following the year mark of the removal of the euthanization age restrictions The child had been euthanized due to an incurable disease that was inflicted upon the child Although there may have been some support for the euthanization there is a possibility of controversy due to the issue revolving around the subject of assisted suicide br Excluding assisted suicide Belgium has the highest suicide rate in Western Europe and one of the highest suicide rates in the developed world exceeded only by Lithuania South Korea and Latvia br br br Education br br Education is compulsory from to years of age for Belgians Among OECD countries in Belgium had the third highest proportion of to year olds enrolled in postsecondary education at Though an estimated of the adult population is literate concern is rising over
