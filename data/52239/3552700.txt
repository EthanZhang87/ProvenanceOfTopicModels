title: Data fabrication
id: 3552700
In scientific inquiry and academic research data fabrication is the intentional misrepresentation of research results As with other forms of scientific misconduct it is the intent to deceive that marks fabrication as unethical and thus different from scientists deceiving themselves There are many ways data can be fabricated Experimental data can be fabricated by reporting experiments that were never conducted and accurate data can be manipulated or misrepresented to suit a desired outcome One of the biggest problems with this form of scientific fraud is that university investigations into research misconduct are often inadequate opaque and poorly conducted They challenge the idea that institutions can police themselves on research integrity br Sometimes intentional fabrication can be difficult to distinguish from unintentional academic incompetence or malpractice Examples of this include the failure to account for measurement error or the failure to adequately control experiments for any parameters being measured br Fabrication can also occur in the context of undergraduate or graduate studies wherein a student fabricates a laboratory or homework assignment Such cheating when discovered is usually handled within the institution and does not become a scandal within the larger academic community as cheating by students seldom has any academic significance br br br Consequences br A finding that a scientist engaged in fabrication will often mean the end to their career as a researcher Scientific misconduct is grounds for dismissal of tenured faculty as well as for forfeiture of research grants Given the tight knit nature of many academic communities and the high stakes involved researchers who are found to have committed fabrication are often effectively and permanently blacklisted from the profession with reputable research organizations and universities refusing to hire them funding sources refusing to sponsor them or their work and journals refusing to consider any of their articles for publication In some cases however especially if the researcher is senior and well established the academic community can close ranks to prevent injury to the scientist s career br Fabricators may also have previously earned academic credentials removed Two cases br br In Jan Hendrik Sch n was stripped of his doctorate degree by the University of Konstanz after a committee formed by Bell Labs found him guilty of fabrication related to research done during his employment there This action was undertaken even though Sch n was not accused in the matter in question of any fabrication or other misconduct relating to his work which led to or supported the degree the doctorate was revoked according to University officials solely due to Sch n behaving unworthily in the Bell Labs affair br In peer reviewers at the academic journal Nutrition raised suspicions about a publication draft submitted by Dr Ranjit Chandra a world renowned Canadian nutrition researcher at Memorial University of Newfoundland It was confirmed through investigation that Dr Chandra had published the results of a series of studies stretching over more than a decade which reported claims based on incorrectly represented analysis of in some cases non existent data By that time Dr Chandra had already been invited to the Order of Canada which was subsequently revoked in Dr Chandra retired in and Memorial University established the Marilyn Harvey Award to Recognize the Importance of Research Ethics in honour of the nurse researcher who first raised the alarm about Dr Chandra s findings in the early s br Not all alleged fraud is found to be so and debates are part of the scientific community An interesting case is the accusation against Dr Margaret Mead a world renowned anthropologist who published field work conducted early in her life which proclaimed that Samoan culture was more relaxed and harmonious about sexual relations and mores Her truthfulness and research process were roundly criticized by a later researcher in Samoa Dr Derek Freeman More recently Dr Freeman s own research quality has come under scrutiny with a hint that perhaps his own views on sexuality and his research with Elders in Samoa led him to reject Dr Mead s findings Dr Freeman s allegations harmed Dr Mead s reputation at a time when few women were scientists br br br See also br Cyril Burt br Junk science br Research paper mill br Retraction br br br br br br Further reading br Lewis Kraus Gideon Big Little Lies Dan Ariely and Francesca Gino got famous studying dishonesty Did they fabricate some of their work The New Yorker October pp
