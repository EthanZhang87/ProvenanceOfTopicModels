title: Russian information war against Ukraine
id: 65383466
The Russian information war against Ukraine was articulated by the Russian government as part of the Gerasimov doctrine They believed that Western governments were instigating color revolutions in former Soviet states which posed a threat to Russia br The concept of informatsionnaya voyna Russian lit informational war encompasses various strategies including cyberwarfare often described as technical defenses against technical attacks in warfare However cyberwarfare is just one aspect of Russia s information war which may include controlling undersea communications cables shaping national narratives manipulating the news cycle and flooding the information space with Russian bots and trolls The goal is to achieve strategic victory and exert reflexive control These efforts were used as part of its disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine br Due to effective censorship most media outlets in Russia are government controlled allowing Kremlin messaging to successfully sway the citizens of the Russian Federation to support its approach in Ukraine The Kremlin has denied waging war in Ukraine claiming it only wants to protect Russian speakers against Ukrainian Nazis This narrative has been reinforced by Russian television since giving it an advantage through repetition and familiarity According to a recent poll percent of Russians approved of this perspective between February and March br During the ongoing Russian invasion Ukraine s online propaganda largely focuses on its heroes and martyrs using their stories to emphasize Ukrainian fortitude and Russian aggression Additionally Ukraine s strategy includes employing comedy and promoting skepticism towards Russian narratives br br br Background br br Valery Gerasimov chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation describes a novel type of warfare that incorporates elements of propaganda demoralization distraction and political posturing in both peace and times of war and above all the importance of social media beyond both cyberwarfare and information war as NATO understands them He suggested a ratio of nonmilitary to military measures Nonmilitary tactics also come under the military in Russia and although United States Marine Corps research suggests that the ratio is still largely aspirational it indicates recognition of the utility of nonmilitary measures in interstate confrontation especially during what would be considered peacetime br The Russian Federation misinforms and misleads its citizens and the audience of its television channels in other countries Channel One Russia and Russia for example br br br Reasons for the conflict br br br Identity br Like Ukraine Belarus and Russia consider the Kievan Rus as their cultural ancestor Many Russians see Kyiv as the birthplace of their nation Kievan Rus reached its greatest extent under Yaroslav the Wise his sons issued its first written legal code the Russkaya Pravda shortly after his death In the s Russia waged a large scale propaganda campaign in Ukraine based on the doctrine of br Russian world and Putin said we are one nation Kyiv is the mother of Russian cities Its ideological basis was post Soviet revanchism in the Russian Federation for the cultural economic and territorial restoration of pre borders and the restoration of the former Soviet zone of influence in Europe and Asia br This revanchism sees three categories of the world s population as Russian ethnic Russians regardless of where they live a Russian speaking population regardless of nationality compatriots who have never lived on the territory of the Russian Empire the USSR and other state entities as well as their descendants br At the Bucharest summit April Putin told United States President George W Bush You understand George that Ukraine is not even a state What is Ukraine br br He regularly refers to Russians and Ukrainians as one people which is an utterly tone deaf comment that many Ukrainians hear as a denial of their culture history and language br Many Russians idealize Soviet Russia under the rule of the Communist Party as a time of prosperity and the ruling United Russia party as heir to the country s glorious past Since the collapse of the USSR Russian politicians have talked about restoring Russia s influence in post Soviet countries br According to Vladimir Bukovsky a dissident who spent a decade in Soviet prisons before his exile to the West in Vladimir Putin was totally sincere when he called the disintegration of the Soviet Union a geopolitical catastrophe br Putin sees the growth of NATO in Eastern Europe as an existential threat and has written that Russia and Ukraine are really one country This revanchism focuses on Ukraine whose withdrawal from the USSR led to its collapse Russia is restoring its unity the tragedy of this terrible catastrophe in our history has been overcome RIA Novosti Russia s primary online state news agency exulted on February The Putin regime contrasts ours and others in Ukraine and suggests that violence against others is desirable and even required br The Russian government frames its hybrid war as a conflict between Russia and NATO but while geopolitics and its desire for a post Soviet sphere play into its focus on Ukraine so do its domestic politics An independent Ukrainian democracy might inspire Russians to demand their own democracy and perhaps even challenge Mr Putin s authoritarianism br br br History of the war br In June the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine NSDC obtained materials used to train Russian information war specialists They instructed Russian soldiers to actively influence the consciousness and system of knowledge and ideas of the target country according to NSDC Secretary Andriy Parubiy br Propaganda targeting the Russian people justifying a future war against Ukraine appeared even before Russia s first incursion into Ukraine in In Maxim Kalashnikov s Independent Ukraine Failure of a Project portrayed Ukraine as a Yugoslavia on the verge of an ethnic breakup Novels such as Fyodor Berezin s War Ukrainian Front Georgiy Savitsky s Battlefield Ukraine The broken trident and Alexander Sever s Russian Ukrainian Wars posited a war against Ukraine Activists said Russia had also waged an information war against Ukraine through cinema br Kremlin run media in created the impression in Crimea that fascists anti Semites and extremists were in power in Kyiv and chaos ruled the rest of Ukraine but this had little or nothing to do with reality br br Since Ukraine s independence Russia has waged a constant information war against it especially under the pro Russian President Viktor Yanukovych In February for example Russians flatly denied that their military maneuvers in any way threatened Ukraine The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs denies the participation of the Black Sea Fleet in destabilizing the situation in Crimea These were local self defense forces Putin said of the men who tried to seize the Crimean parliament br br br Information operations br br br Censorship br br In February the Russian Minister of Defence acknowledged the existence of information operations forces in Russia In Open Media The Moscow Times and theMoscow bureau of Deutsche Welle was also shut down br A Russian law signed on March provided drastic penalties for spreading false information or protesting or discrediting Russia s actions in Ukraine Russian schools must follow the official curriculum br After the legislation made it illegal to publish information on the Ukrainian war that the Kremlin deems false some Western media withdrew their reporters due to safety concerns Independent Russian media outlets shut down including TV Rain and Novaya Gazeta whose editor had received the Nobel Peace Prize in News website Znak announced its closing and Ekho Moskvy owned by Kremlin linked Gazprom also shut down The websites of Deutsche Welle the BBC Meduza and Radio Free Europe became inaccessible from within Russia without a VPN br News sites Mediazona Republic Snob ru and Agentstvo were also blocked from the Russian internet after the law passed and became available only by VPN br br Russia also jammed commercial broadcast signals and penetrated both civilian and military communications networks Russia they own or operate Ukrainian cellular companies banks electricity They don t need to hack anything It s a secret war conducted by agents of influence Oleksandr Danylyuk former secretary of Ukraine s National Security and Defense Council br br br Cyberwarfare br br br Telecommunications br Russia s Leer RB V drone system can listen to or suppress cellular communications and even send text messages to front line soldiers Ukrainian soldiers have received texted jeers and threats from the Russians on their cell phones and family members of Ukrainian soldiers have also reported receiving calls saying that those soldiers were dead The Russian Orlan has also been extensively used in electronic warfare in Ukraine br In a article Estonian Military Academy researcher and University of Tartu co professor for oriental studies Dr Vladimir Sazonov similarly noted that Russian intelligence agencies had been conducting information warfare operations ever since the start of the war in Donbas in According to Sazonov amongst the strategies used by Russian agents included sending text messages such as a huge Russian military contingent will reach Kyiv in three days and Russian tanks are about to take over Kharkiv These messages which were sent to the mobile phones of Ukrainian soldiers potential recruits and their families before each new wave of mobilisation in the country were intended to demoralise Ukrainians and spread panic amongst civilians br However tactical communications have also been an issue for the Russian military to the point where some troops in Georgia received their orders from an Air Force officer who arrived by helicopter Then president Dmitry Medvedev ordered an expansion of the military s radio system in with a contract to a manufacturer partially owned by a former Medvedev advisor The contract was subsequently troubled by embezzlement allegations br br br Internet infrastructure br br On March Internet service provider Triolan suffered an outage in Kharkiv and other cities caused by a factory reset of several of its devices Recovery efforts were hampered by shelling in the area at the time which made it dangerous to go on site and may have damaged internet connectivity Attackers had previously disrupted its connectivity and DNS routing on February National telecoms operator Ukrtelecom in late March also suffered then recovered from a major cyber attack br In Russia as of March peering agreements were still in place but new regulation was expected to ban web hosting outside Russia and require the use of official DNS servers Transit providers Lumen and Cogent both left Russia after the invasion in early March but this had a limited effect on the Russian internet connectivity because they continued to peer with some of the larger Russian ISPs such as Rostelecom and Rascom at exchanges outside Russia br br br War propaganda br br Information warfare has deep roots in Russia In addition to presenting a Russian narrative and version of events it strives to cause confusion and cast doubt on the idea of truth Russia transmits war propaganda through news media in its ongoing war against Ukraine As early as September Alexander Dugin a Russian fascist known as Putin s brain advocated an invasion of Ukraine and other countries that had previously been part of the USSR The Soviet empire will be restored in different ways by force diplomacy economic pressure Everything will depend on place and time br On February RIA Novosti published then took down an incorrect report that Russia had won the Russo Ukrainian War and Ukraine has returned to Russia On March Marina Ovsyannikova an editor at Channel One interrupted a live broadcast to protest the Russian invasion of Ukraine carrying a poster that said in Russian and English Stop the war don t believe the propaganda here you are being lied to RT a Russian state controlled television network was officially banned in the European Union and suspended by television service providers in several other countries YouTube blocked RT and Sputnik across Europe to prevent Russian disinformation Many RT journalists resigned after Russia invaded Ukraine br br Russian teachers received detailed instructions on teaching the invasion of Ukraine The Mayakovsky Theatre in Moscow received a government email to refrain from any comments on the course of military actions in Ukraine warning that any negative comments would be regarded as treason against the Motherland br The Russian government uses the Z symbol as a pro war propaganda tool Russian civilians as a sign of support for the invasion br According to Pjotr Sauer of The Guardian many Russians still support Putin and don t believe that the special military operation in Ukraine is related to Russian propaganda and disinformation Polls conducted by the Levada Center between February and found that of respondents blamed the US and NATO for escalating tensions while only blamed Russia Similarly an independent telephone survey from February to March found that of Russian respondents approved of the military operation However a series of four online polls by Alexei Navalny s Anti Corruption Foundation found that between February and March the share of respondents in Moscow who considered Russia an aggressor increased from to while the share of those who considered Russia a peacemaker fell by half from to br br Some observers have noted a generational struggle among Russians over perception of the war with younger Russians generally opposed to it and older Russians more likely to accept the narrative presented by state controlled media in Russia Kataryna Wolczuk of Chatham House said Older Russians are inclined to believe the official narrative that Russia is defending Russian speakers in Ukraine so it s offering protection rather than aggression Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny said the monstrosity of lies in the Russian state media is unimaginable And unfortunately so is its persuasiveness for those without access to alternative information br On March YouTube blocked an unspecified number of media outlets controlled by the Russian state including RT and Sputnik citing its policy against content that denies minimizes or trivializes well documented violent events On March the British media regulator Ofcom revoked RT s broadcasting licence On April it was reported that Putin s approval rating in Russia had risen to a month after the invasion from a approval rating as prior to the invasion during the height of the COVID pandemic br State controlled television channels through which most Russians consume news presented the invasion as a liberation mission and accused Ukrainian troops of attacking civilian targets Mediazona a Russian independent media outlet reported that the FSB had fabricated a video of a woman accusing Ukraine of war crimes in Mariupol and shared screenshots of emails instructing media outlets not to reveal the source of the video br br In an op ed published in the Russian state outlet RIA Novosti Timofei Sergeytsev openly advocated the purification of Ukrainians blurring the lines between the Ukrainian government military and civilians then the cultural genocide of Ukraine through the obliteration of the Ukrainian name and culture and finally the reeducation of the remaining civilians together with a strict regime of censorship in order to incorporate them in a greater Russia br Alexei Navalny tweeted in April that warmongers among Russian state media personalities should be treated as war criminals br On April NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in a statement posted on the alliance s website accused Russia of promoting war and wanting to overthrow Ukraine br In early the United States government warned that Russia was planning a false flag operation to invade Ukraine and pointed to a pattern of Russian behavior that included invading and occupying parts of Georgia in and noted Russia s failure to honor its commitment to withdraw its troops and munitions from Moldova where they remain without the government s consent In Vladimir Putin called opponents of the war nothing more than traitors and a fifth column br Children s television has also broadcast war propaganda as when Phil the dog joined the army in to become a real defender br The throttling of information into Russia also impedes the Kremlin s own information diet The Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in that the Ukrainian invasion bears an eerie resemblance to Soviet decision making in to invade Afghanistan poor intelligence misreading the international reaction over optimism incomprehension of the costs br br br Control of news outlets br br br Public relations br Russia has learned to use respected Western media like BBC News Reuters and AFP to promote anti Ukrainian propaganda These media outlets were unprepared for the Russian Ukrainian war in and often became unintentional distributors of Russian anti Ukrainian propaganda br Russia has also learned to skillfully use Western PR companies to disseminate the narratives it needs in the interests of various Russian government institutions and private corporations br The Kremlin has instructed official Russian television outlets to rebroadcast Tucker Carlson s show as much as possible Marjorie Taylor Greene has also gotten approving coverage on Kremlin media as when she said that the US was responsible for the overthrow of the Russian puppet government in the Ukrainian Revolution of Dignity br br br Ukraine br br Many Ukrainian news outlets are financed by wealthy investors Some of these investors have close ties to Russian political power This highly concentrated ownership of Ukrainian media has set a high barrier to entry for the market br Four financial political groups control nearly all broadcasting in Ukraine br The top most viewed TV channels almost all belong to Ukraine s wealthiest

hence hindering their editorial independence Paid content disguised as news known as jeansa remains widespread in the Ukrainian media weakening their and journalists credibility especially during electoral campaigns br Media ownership remains opaque despite a February bill requiring full disclosure of ownership structures br br Inter Media Group is linked to gas trader Dmytro Firtash and

resigned Marina Ovsyannikova has been hired by the German media company Die Welt a month after she drew worldwide attention for bursting onto the set of a live broadcast on Russian state television to protest the war in Ukraine br br br RT br RT is an important Russian weapon in the information war In John Kerry then United States Secretary of State called it a state sponsored propaganda bullhorn Its audience in was million people in more than countries RT s budget according to its website was billion rubles about million at exchange rates However in a interview with the Russian independent media outlet Dozhd TV Simonyan said the budget for that year was billion rubles The RT website claims its budget was million billion rubles while a video published by RT contradicts this information by claiming its budget was million billion rubles In RT announced on its Telegram channel that RT and Rossiya Segodnya s budget from federal funding was million yet the official federal budget number for was million br In RT had the highest government spending per employee in the world thousand per person br As of Russia had spent more than billion on its propaganda In it increased the state media

content was removed The provider received a request for this from Roskomnadzor which considers the material on Right Sector a violation of Russian legislation br For several months DDoS attacks were carried out against Ukrainian information sites Censor NET Tizhden ua Ukrayinska Pravda and others as well as the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine with the appearance of ads for

some damage br br br Methods and resources br br br Disinformation br br Russia uses disinformation both to support an image of its greatness and importance or of the weakness of its enemies or sometimes to deny its actions br Kyiv hasn t been bombed by anyone Channel One pundit Artyom Sheynin assured viewers on February for example Also on February explosions and gunfire were heard through the day in Ukraine s capital and elsewhere in the country with at least people reported killed according to Reuters Most Russians get their information from television although younger Russians tend to prefer online sources These now require a VPN connection making the truth now mostly is discovered by people who already distrust the Kremlin and its state sponsored media br br The untethering of the Russian news diet from facts doesn t just affect the populace The Kremlin has been described as a bunch of old men who can t quite get over the fact that they re no longer running a superpower and who also are increasingly surrounded by people who tell them what they want to hear br Other more subtle attacks known as reflexive control systematically distort and reinterpret words leading extremists to become an accepted description for independent journalists and human rights activists or peaceful demonstrators to be arrested as security threats br br br Falsehood and adamant denial br You could spend every hour of every day trying to bat down every lie to the point where you don t achieve anything else And that s exactly what the Kremlin wants says Greg Pryatt former US ambassador to Ukraine br br br br In November the pro Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych blocked the legislatively approved course towards European integration and the Revolution of Dignity began Putin used disinformation to lay the groundwork to annex Crimea in and to support continued fighting in Ukraine s Eastern provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk wrote Forbes contributor Jill Goldenziel Again in Kremlin propaganda had the goal of preparing world public opinion for the invasion of Ukraine br In Putin for quite some time denied sending troops into Ukraine He later said Russia was protecting the Russian speaking population of Ukraine When Russia invaded Georgia in it gave many alternative explanations for its actions there as well and denied having plans to attack it In Putin again denied his invasion despite photos of military vehicles there from the North Caucasus Military District One car had forgotten to camouflage an icon of the Guards Division The soldiers also carried the Dragunov self loading sniper rifle only used by the Russian military br In March Russians said they had found evidence at the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant that Ukraine was working on a nuclear bomb Experts scoffed at the claim which they said was both impossible with the fuel there and not how anyone would run a secret weapons program br br br Malaysia Airlines Flight br The most fake tweets in a day or on a single topic by Russian disinformation agency Internet Research Agency IRA followed the shooting down of the Malaysian MH airliner Russia took extensive measures and gave many narratives to hide its involvement br In three days after the crash the Russian Internet Research Agency posted tweets from fake accounts mostly in Russian At first they said that Russian backed rebels downed a Ukrainian plane later tweets said Ukraine had shot the airliner down RT quoted a Twitter account purportedly of an air traffic controller named Carlos who said he had seen Ukrainian fighter jets following the airliner Supposedly Ukraine mistook the airliner for the Russian presidential jet In August Komsomoloskaya Pravda published a wiretap transcript of two named CIA operatives planning the MH attack ridiculed for English that recalled Google translated Russian phrases read from a script br On December the Intelligence and Security Committee of the British Parliament in a report specifically emphasized that Russia had waged a massive information war with intense multi channel propaganda to convince the world that Russia did not shoot down the plane br br br br br In Russia insisted it was merely conducting military exercises on the Ukrainian borders then declared that it needed to protect Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine Russia also amassed troops at the Ukrainian border with Belarus and held naval exercises in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov which Kyiv called an unjustified complication of international shipping that made navigation virtually impossible On February Russia said it would partially pull back from Ukraine s borders but according to the US in fact sent additional troops We can t really take the Russians for their word said Canadian ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae after Russia resumed shelling within hours of announcing a ceasefire for civilian evacuation br After shelling a nuclear power plant complex in Zaporizhzhia the Kremlin said its military seized it to prevent Ukrainians and neo Nazis from organizing provocations br On August Putin claimed that he decided to conduct a special military operation in Ukraine in full compliance with the UN Charter According to Putin the objectives of this operation are clearly defined ensuring the security of Russia and our citizens protecting the residents of Donbass from genocide On September Putin announced a partial mobilisation following a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv In his address to the Russian audience Putin claimed that the Policy of intimidation terror and violence against the Ukrainian people by the pro Western Nazi regime in Kyiv has taken on ever more terrible barbaric forms Ukrainians have been turned into cannon fodder and therefore Russia has no choice but to defend our loved ones in Ukraine br In October Russian American writer and professor Nina Khrushcheva said alluding to George Orwell s novel that in Putin s Russia war is peace slavery is freedom ignorance is strength and illegally annexing a sovereign country s territory is fighting colonialism br British historian Jade McGlynn wrote that in occupied Ukrainian territories in after seizing control over mobile internet offices and equipment and installing their own networks Russian first unrolled propaganda of the same type as in In the first six months of occupation the goal of propaganda was to convince Ukrainians living at the occupied territories that the Russian official version of the war is correct and the Ukrainian one is false This propaganda was of low quality and failed to convince the population After the initial six months they switched to a different propaganda mode in which the war was mentioned as rarely as possible and the propagandists behaved like if the occupied territories always were Russian They instead referred to Ukrainians as occupiers and to the territories claimed but not controlled by Russia such as the city of Zaporizhzhia as temporarily occupied by Ukrainian militants This narrative has been consistently advanced by the federal media the local media and the social media br br br Tropes br br Since the collapse of the USSR Russia has circulated propaganda and disinformation to demonize Ukrainians Neo Nazis play a recurring role in Russian propaganda in to justify military denazification In Mariupol Russians were told in Ukrainians fired on Russian soldiers despite the cease fire and according to TASS neo Nazis were hiding behind civilians as a human shield br According to Kacper R kawek a postdoctoral fellow with the Center for Research on Extremism at the University of Oslo simultaneously portraying Ukrainians as fascists and depraved pro gay liberals as opposed to the solid conservative values of Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine has roots in a longstanding narrative of politicians both in and outside Ukraine that ties Ukrainian speakers in Western Ukraine to far right nationalists who fought against Soviets in World War II br Russia has an extensive network of allies and front organizations and reconstructs reality and rewrites history to legitimize itself and undermine others said a article in Nature br In the early s the first such propaganda tropes presented events with the phrases after the collapse of the USSR and with the collapse of the USSR to create the impression that these phenomena arose because of the collapse of the USSR and not the reverse br Propaganda tried to portray Ukraine as economically and politically bankrupt as a state In Russia accused Ukraine of stealing Russian gas br Ukrainian figures have been allegedly quoted making provocative statements A criminal case was brought against the leader of the Ukrainian Right Sector Dmytro Yarosh for supposedly publishing an appeal to Dokka Umarov to carry out terrorist attacks in the Russian Federation A day later authorities announced that the appeal had been the work of hackers br In the same way as Russian propaganda sought to portray its swift victory as inevitable against incompetent Ukrainian commanders Russian media also sought to create fear and loathing with stereotypes of its own Chechen fighters br br br Social media br In government groups posed as independent news entities and created fake personas on Facebook Instagram Twitter YouTube Telegram and also the Russian language Odnoklassniki and V Kontakte to disseminate Russian narratives such as the alleged helplessness of Ukrainians and videos of their fighters surrendering br According to The Washington Post in the Russian military intelligence GRU created more than pseudo Ukrainian groups and social media accounts as well as leading English language publications Posing as ordinary Ukrainians intelligence operatives concocted news and disseminated comments to turn pro Russian citizens against the protesters br In early Ukrainian journalists discovered a network of dozens of social media groups run from Moscow on multiple social media that used nationalist rhetoric to undermine the Ukrainian government and mobilize protesters br br br Access to social media br

identification number and the errors in the English The fake was distributed by Russian media in particular Komsomolskaya Pravda RIA Novosti and TV Zvezda br On January on the eve of the Dutch referendum on the EU Ukraine Association Agreement Russian sources circulated a video of Azov Battalion fighters allegedly burning the flag of the Netherlands and threatening to commit terrorist acts there if the agreement was not approved Bellingcat concluded that the video was a forgery and distributed if not created by the Kremlin linked Internet Research Agency in St Petersburg br Another video released by the Donetsk People s Republic DNR and CyberBerkut had links to the IRA The Defense Intelligence Agency considers Cyberberkut a front for the Kremlin s internet activities and the Kremlin maintained plausible deniability as to the activities of the IRA by bankrolling it through Yevgeny Prigozhin known as Putin s chef It accused Ukraine s Azov Battalion of fighting alongside ISIS militants Photos and videos made by pro Russian militants showed armed men wearing ISIS and Azov symbols firing on industrial buildings The BBC identified the buildings as hangars at the Isolation mineral wool plant in Donetsk which in was converted into an art space known as the Isolation art project and seized in June by pro Russian militants br On July a video spread through the Russian media alleged that a special unit of the Security Service of Ukraine SBU stormed the base of Ukrainian volunteers using armoured personnel carriers The video purported to show the SBU beating them The video was exposed as fake as early as July the SBU uniforms had outdated elements and insignia the armoured personnel carrier had white identification lines in a form that had not been used for a long time as well as anti accumulation grilles which the SBU does not put on its equipment The actors who played SBU special forces spoke with a foreign accent threw around emotional phrases about hatred for Bandera members and unprofessionally pretended to kick the volunteers On September an armoured personnel carrier was filmed in Donetsk On September the location of the staged assault was identified the grounds of the abandoned Reaktiv chemical plant in occupied Donetsk br On August a video of the alleged brutal detention of a person at a Ukrainian checkpoint was published on a YouTube channel with no subscribers or other videos The video was distributed among the Russian occupation forces in particular through the Lost Armor website The Ukrainian mil in portal published a debunking The appearance of all Ukrainian checkpoints Majorca Marinka Gnutovo Stanitsa Luhanskaya as well as Chengar and Kharkiv was analyzed and none of them matched the video There were few cars and practically no people untrue of any of the actual checkpoints License plate numbers were also falsified The video purported to show a rebel fighter attempting to surrender under the SBU Waiting for you at home program which offered amnesty to fighters who returned to a peaceful life Since the video showed the purported fighter on the ground being kicked it may have been an attempt to discredit the program and reduce attrition in the rebel forces br In the Russian invasion in March videos were discovered purporting to show Ukrainian produced disinformation about strikes inside Ukraine which were then debunked as some other event outside Ukraine However this may be the first case of a disinformation false flag operation as the original supposedly Ukraine produced disinformation was never disseminated by anyone and was in fact preventive disinformation created specifically to be debunked and cause confusion and mitigate the impact on the Russian public of real footage of Russian strikes within Ukraine when it eventually got past Russian controlled media According to Patrick Warren head of Clemson s Media Forensics Hub It s like Russians actually pretending to be Ukrainians spreading disinformation The reason that it s so effective is because you don t actually have to convince someone that it s true It s sufficient to make people uncertain as to what they should trust br On March a video was released purporting to show a helicopter attacking a Russian convoy resulting in the destruction of military aircraft and tanks Upon further analysis the footage was found to have been produced using the Arma video game br On March a one minute deepfake video aired on the website of the Ukraine television channel In it Zelenskyy appeared to tell Ukrainian soldiers to surrender Ukraine said they had been hacked but Russian social media boosted it Zelenskyy immediately disavowed the video and responded with one of his own and Facebook and YouTube began to remove it Twitter allowed the video in tweets discussing the fake but said it would be taken down if posted deceptively Hackers inserted the disinformation into the live scrolling text news crawl It was not immediately clear who created the deepfake br br br Results br On November the European Parliament passed a resolution opposing Russian propaganda Putin responded by calling the work of the Russian news agencies RT and Sputnik effective br br br br On March YouTube blocked channels connected to RT and Sputnik across Europe then worldwide on March due to its insistence that Russia was not waging war in Ukraine Roku and DirectTV also dropped RT br br br Countermeasures br No precise equivalent appears to exist to the systemic Russian br disinformation campaign although Ukraine and other interested parties have used speeches television appearances social media cyber warfare and viral memes against Russia Not all of these actions can be attributed with certainty but the United States has deployed soft power on Ukraine s behalf at least one self identified Anonymous account has claimed to have damaged Russian infrastructure and a number of official Ukraine social media accounts have successfully created a favorable narrative br The U S government suspecting a buildup to a false flag attack released its intelligence findings about Russian troop movements before the invasion began undermining the posited plans to blame the attack on Ukraine the U S government was very forthcoming there wasn t an information vacuum that the Russians could step in and fill explained researcher Laura Edelson br br Ukraine on the other hand has created a narrative of Ukrainian bravery and indomitability If Ukraine had no messages of the righteousness of its cause the popularity of its cause the valor of its heroes the suffering of its populace then it would lose said Peter W Singer a strategist and senior fellow at New America a think tank in Washington Not just the information war but it would lose the overall war br On April R ussian opposition politician Alexei Navalny said the monstrosity of lies in the Russian state media is unimaginable And unfortunately so is its persuasiveness for those without access to alternative information He tweeted that warmongers among Russian state media personalities should be treated as war criminals From the editors in chief to the talk show hosts to the news editors they should be sanctioned now and tried someday br br br Zelenskyy br Zelenskyy s speeches have repeatedly gone viral and galvanized the Ukrainian population An underdog hero tackling evil forces attacking him is an ancient human narrative as fundamental and continuing as Gilgamesh and Luke Skywalker and Zelenskyy has told it masterfully Wearing a green military t shirt he passionately appealed for help for his people in fiery virtual speeches to the parliaments of Canada the United Kingdom and the European Union as well as a joint session of the U S Congress to a standing ovation each time br br He has spoken to the Russian people directly in Russian his first language Also in Russian he positioned himself on March as a neighbor and an ordinary guy needling Putin for recently receiving his visitors at an extraordinarily long table Come sit with me Just not meters away like with Macron and Scholz I m your neighbor What are you afraid of br Putin s previous shirtless photo ops sought to position him as a strong and virile leader Images of the younger Zelenskyy wearing body armor and drinking tea with Ukrainian soldiers starkly contrasted with news broadcasts of Putin in rococo and very socially distanced The body armor photo was taken in and he actually drank tea with the soldiers a few days before the invasion began but the images were real if out of context and the pictures of Putin at an enormously long table apparently for fear of COVID were also real br br Ukrainian media has been particularly savvy in playing up the eleventh hour rise of its president Volodymyr Zelenskyy whose line I need ammunition not a ride may rival the likes of William Shakespeare s cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war in terms of quotability br Official Ukrainian social media accounts have sought to bolster support for efforts against the invasion and spread information with targeted posts and videos used to recruit soldiers and call for international aid Some media analysts have highlighted the Ukrainian officials methods as beneficial br Several academics including Professors Rob Danish and Timothy Naftali have highlighted Zelenskyy s speaking ability and use of social media to spread information and draw upon feelings of shame and concern while building kinship with viewers Real time information about the invasion has been spread by online activists journalists politicians and members of the general population both in and out of Ukraine br Official communications of Ukrainian authorities in particular during the preparation of the announced offensive were confusing presumably intentionally to prevent Russia from having access to information A former Danish intelligence officer Jacob Funk Kirkegaard while interviewed in May opined that every public announcement from Ukraine should be viewed as essentially misinformation br br br Propaganda in other countries br Chinese diplomats government agencies and state controlled media in China have used the war as an opportunity to deploy anti American propaganda and they have amplified conspiracy theories created by Russia such as the false claims that public health facilities in Ukraine are secret US biolabs Such conspiracy theories have also been promoted by Cuban state media br Russian propaganda has also been repeated by the state controlled outlets of other countries such as Serbia and Iran In Iran the state media criticised the British embassy in Tehran after it raised the Ukrainian flag in support of Ukraine Reports from Sputnik have been actively republished by Iran s pro regime media In Latin America RT Actualidad is a popular channel that has spread disinformation about the war Authorities in Vietnam have instructed reporters not to use the word invasion and to minimize coverage of the war In South Africa the governing African National Congress published an article in its weekly newsletter ANC Today endorsing the notion that Russia had invaded Ukraine to denazify it br br br Memes br br Also shot on February a video of an elderly woman scolding a Russian soldier appears to record an actual event in Henichesk She gave him sunflower seeds so sunflowers would grow when he died br The wildly popular social media legend Ghost of Kyiv a Ukrainian fighter pilot who shot down six Russian planes cannot be confirmed said Deutsche Welle on March The story was tweeted by the official Ukraine account and authenticated by former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko but the photo of the pilot posted by Poroshenko turned out to be three years old The story s factuality has been questioned by both Russian and Western media The Ukrainian military has not verified it for one thing and some of the images were definitely repurposed from elsewhere But on February the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine suggested that The Ghost of Kyiv might be a returning reserve pilot so they did not deny it either br The defiant response of a Ukrainian border guard stationed at Zmiinyi Snake Island began a Ukrainian framing of the war as David vs Goliath which the videos of Ukrainian farmers towing off abandoned Russian tanks have helped to continue br Some Ukrainians say that the many memes that have circulated since the war began have helped them to cope with their uncertain future by making them laugh Citizen contributions can also serve the more serious purpose of combatting disinformation says Daniel Johnson a Roy H Park Fellow at UNC Hussman s School of Journalism and former U S Army
