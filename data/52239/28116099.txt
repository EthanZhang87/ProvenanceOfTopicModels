title: Operation Denver
id: 28116099
Operation Denver sometimes referred to as Operation INFEKTION was an active measure disinformation campaign run by the KGB in the s to plant the idea that the United States had invented HIV AIDS as part of a biological weapons research project at Fort Detrick Maryland Historian Thomas Boghardt popularized the codename INFEKTION based on the claims of former East German Ministry for State Security Stasi officer G nter Bohnsack who claimed that the Stasi codename for the campaign was either INFEKTION or perhaps also VORW RTS II FORWARD II However historians Christopher Nehring and Douglas Selvage found in the former Stasi and Bulgarian State Security archives materials that prove the actual Stasi codename for the AIDS disinformation campaign was Operation Denver The operation involved an extraordinary amount of effort funding radio programs courting journalists distributing would be scientific studies according to journalist Joshua Yaffa and even became the subject of a report by Dan Rather on the CBS Evening News br The Soviet Union used the campaign to undermine the United States credibility foster anti Americanism isolate America abroad and create tensions between host countries and the U S over the presence of American military bases which were often portrayed as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local populations Another reason the Soviet Union promoted the AIDS disinformation may have been its attempt to distract international attention away from its own offensive biological warfare program which was monitored for decades br br The groundwork appeared in the pro Soviet Indian newspaper Patriot which according to a KGB defector named Ilya Dzerkvelov was set up by the KGB in for the sheer purpose of publishing disinformation An anonymous letter was sent to the editor in July from a well known American scientist and anthropologist who claimed that AIDS was manufactured at Fort Detrick by genetic engineers The scientist claimed that that deadly mysterious disease was believed to be the results of the Pentagon s experiments to develop new and dangerous biological weapons and implicated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC scientists sent to Africa and Latin America to find dangerous viruses alien to Asia and Europe These results were purportedly analyzed in Atlanta and Fort Detrick and thus the most likely course of events leading to the development of AIDS The letter claimed that the Pentagon was continuing such experiments in neighboring Pakistan and as a result the AIDS virus was threatening to spread to India The title of the article AIDS may invade India suggested that the immediate goal of the KGB s disinformation was to exacerbate tensions between the U S India and Pakistan br br Two years later the KGB apparently decided to make use of its earlier disinformation to launch an international campaign to discredit the U S They wrote in a telegram to their allied secret service in Bulgaria the Bulgarian Committee for State Security KDS on September We are conducting a series of active measures in connection with the appearance in recent years in the USA of a new and dangerous disease Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS and its subsequent large scale spread to other countries including those in Western Europe The goal of these measures is to create a favorable opinion for us abroad that this disease is the result of secret experiments with a new type of biological weapon by the secret services of the USA and the Pentagon that spun out of control The telegram which referred indirectly back to the Patriot article facts in the press of the developing countries in particular India provided guidance to Bulgarian State Security regarding how to couch their AIDS disinformation Facts have already been cited in the press of the developing countries in particular India that testify to the involvement of the special services of the United States and the Pentagon in the appearance and rapid spread of the AIDS disease in the United States as well as other countries Judging by these reports along with the interest shown by the U S military in the symptoms of AIDS and the rate and geography of its spread the most likely assumption is that this most dangerous disease is the result of yet another Pentagon experiment with a new type of biological weapon This is confirmed by the fact that the disease affected initially only certain groups of people homosexuals drug addicts immigrants from Latin America A month later the Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta also a known outlet for KGB disinformation published an article from Valentin Zapevalov entitled Panic in the West or what is hiding behind the sensation surrounding AIDS It cited the dis information contained in the Patriot article but also gave further details regarding the alleged development of the AIDS virus Employees of the CDC had allegedly assisted the Pentagon by traveling to Zaire Nigeria and Latin America to collect samples of the most pathogenic viruses that could not be found in Europe or Asia These samples were then combined to develop the human immunodeficiency virus HIV that causes AIDS The disinformation campaign insisted the Pentagon then carried out isolated experiments in Haiti and within the U S itself on marginalized groups in U S society drug addicts homosexuals and the homeless Zapevalov s article was subsequently reprinted in Kuwait Bahrain Finland Sweden Peru and other countries It followed very closely the guidelines that the KGB had already sent to its Bulgarian comrades a month before br br Determining the exact role of the Stasi in the AIDS disinformation campaign has been difficult given that around of the records of its foreign intelligence division the Main Directorate for Reconnaissance HVA were destroyed or disappeared in Based on materials in the Bulgarian secret police archives the card files of the HVA and documents from or relating to the HVA scattered among the records of other divisions of the Stasi it has been possible to reconstruct some aspects of the Stasi s involvement in the disinformation campaign At the beginning of September the tenth division of the HVA HVA X responsible for organizing and coordinating the HVA s campaigns of active measures wrote the following in a draft plan for cooperation with Bulgarian State Security Operation DENVER With the goal of exposing the dangers to mankind arising from the research production and use of biological weapons and also in order to strengthen anti American sentiments in the world and to spark domestic political controversies in the USA the GDR German Democratic Republic side will deliver a scientific study and other materials that prove that AIDS originated in the USA not in Africa and that AIDS is a product of the USA s bioweapons research br The KGB confirmed that the East German HVA was playing a central role on various occasions including in a telegram to the Bulgarians in The AIDS issue br A complex of active measures regarding this issue has been carried out since in cooperation with the East German and to some extent the Czech colleagues In the initial stage the task was resolved of spreading in the mass media the version regarding the artificial origin of the AIDS virus and the Pentagon s involvement in by means of the military biological laboratory at Fort Detrick br br As a result of our joint efforts it was possible to widely disseminate this version br br As noted above the Stasi s HVA X had written that it would send its Bulgarian comrades a scientific study allegedly proving that AIDS is a product of the USA s bioweapons research From the context of the discussions between officers of the HVA X and their Bulgarian counterparts in mid September it was clear which study was meant AIDS Its Nature and Origin by Soviet East German biologist Jakob Segal and his wife Dr Lilli Segal The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non Aligned Movement in August September in a brochure entitled AIDS USA home made evil NOT out of AFRICA The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism Although both Segals given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the Communist Party of Germany had fled into exile in France in both had attained Soviet citizenship in on the basis of Jakob s birth in then Soviet annexed Lithuania and in they had returned to Germany specifically to communist East Berlin br In his report Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses VISNA and HTLV An excerpt of the Segal Report reads as follows br br It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses but who would be interested in doing this The military of course In a special top security lab was set up at the Pentagon s central biological laboratory One year after that the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US in New York City How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed to get out of the secret hush hush laboratory is quite easy to understand Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U S They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive br Elsewhere in the report Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions extrapolations and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence br The exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB Stasi or both at this time to the extent that it existed remains unclear Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work The Deputy Director of HVA X Wolfgang Mutz hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication or actually the photocopying and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September He also suggested that the operational division of the HVA with which HVA X had been cooperating in the disinformation campaign had somehow attracted Segal to his research br This operational division was in fact an office in the Sector for Science and Technology Sektor Wissenschaft und Technik SWT of the HVA responsible for intelligence gathering on AIDS and genetic engineering HVA SWT XIII This office had registered a security dossier Sicherungsvorgang SVG Wind on September regarding the protection of East German scientists in the areas of AIDS research genetic engineering and biotechnology from outside attacks in the form of espionage or manipulation by foreign agents This office in HVA SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as contact persons under the codename Diagnosis whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals they were directed to this office HVA SWT or the security as Jakob Segal called them gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear Still given their official designation as contact persons they need not have known at least officially that they were dealing with the Stasi although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB It is quite possible that HVA SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal s research even without his knowledge in the second half of at the time that Wind was registered Nevertheless none of the Stasi officers involved with Wind or Operation DENVER ever claimed that the HVA had played a role in drafting Segal s study It was clearly his own work in cooperation with his wife Lilli although he knew and expected that it would be used for propaganda br br Whatever exact relationship the Segals may or may not have had to the Soviet or East German security services the KGB praised Segal s work in its telegram to Bulgarian State Security His articles and brochures the KGB wrote had attained great renown This was especially the case in African countries where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U S researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa where it had spread from monkeys to humans The KGB wrote the Bulgarians We are currently resolving the task of bringing the active measures down to a more practical level and in particular to attain specific political results by exploiting the laboratory version for AM active measures on other issues So efforts are being made to intensify anti base sentiments in countries where American forces are deployed by using slogans suggesting that U S soldiers are the most dangerous carriers of the virus By demonstrating the defeat of the African version of AIDS origins we can whip up anti American sentiments throughout the states of the continent br br The AIDS story exploded across the world and was repeated by Soviet newspapers magazines wire services radio broadcasts and television It appeared times in Soviet media in alone It received coverage in over countries in more than languages primarily in leftist and communist media publications and was found in countries as widespread as Bolivia Grenada Pakistan New Zealand Nigeria and Malta A few versions made their way into non communist press in Indonesia and the Philippines br Dissemination was usually along a recognized pattern propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency which attributed it to others investigative journalism That the story came from a foreign source not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced added credibility to the allegations especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds To aid in media placement Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge and many stories came with cash benefits This was particularly the case in India and Ghana where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement br br To explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously the Moscow World Service announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov who claimed that in the early s a Pentagon controlled West German lab in Zaire succeeded in modifying the non lethal Green Monkey virus into the deadly AIDS virus Radio Moscow also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U S where it then spread when the prisoners escaped br Claims that the Central Intelligence Agency CIA had sent AIDS oiled condoms to other countries sprang up independently in the African press well after the disinformation operation started In a book Once Again About the CIA was published by the Novosti Press Agency with the quote br br The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology is continuously modernizing its inventory of pathogenic preparations bacteria and viruses and studying their effect on man in various parts of the world To this end the CIA uses American medical centers in foreign countries A case in point was the Pakistani Medical Research Center in Lahore set up in allegedly for combating malaria br The resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research centre Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects to include that of AIDS was to enlarge the war arsenal br br Ironically many Soviet scientists were soliciting help from American researchers to help address the Soviet Union s burgeoning AIDS problem while stressing the virus natural origins The U S refused to help as long as the disinformation campaign continued The Segal Report and the plenitude of press articles were dismissed by both Western and Soviet virologists as nonsense br Dr Meinrad Koch a West Berlin AIDS expert stated in that the Segal Report was utter nonsense and called it an evil pseudo scientific political concoction Other scientists also pointed out flaws and inaccuracies in the Segal Report including Dr Viktor Zhdanov of the D I Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow who was the top Soviet AIDS expert at the time The president of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin Other scientists and doctors from Paris East and West Berlin India and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies scientifically unfounded and otherwise impossible to seriously consider Although Segal himself never said this is fact and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges however because when they are replayed such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners br U S Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters Many of their efforts resulted in newspapers printing retractions and apologies Rebuttals appeared in reports to Congress and from the State Department saying that it was impossible at the time to build a virus as complex as AIDS medical research had only gotten so far as to clone simple viruses Antibodies were found decades earlier than the reported research started and the main academic source used for the story Segal Report contained inaccuracies about even such basic things as American geography Segal said that outbreaks appeared in New York City because it was the closest big city to Fort Detrick Philadelphia Baltimore and Washington D C are all closer while New York is miles km away br The Gorbachev administration also responded indignantly and launched a defensive denial campaign aimed at limiting the damage done to its credibility by U S efforts to raise world consciousness concerning the scope of Soviet disinformation activities The Soviet Union interfered with general attempts by U S Embassy officials to address misconceptions and expose the Soviet disinformation campaign including placing pressure on news agencies that recanted their position For example Literaturnaya Gazeta on December castigated a Brazilian newspaper which earlier in the year had run a retraction following its publication of the AIDS disinformation story In Moscow s Novosti news agency disseminated a report datelined Brazzaville Congo calling on the West to put an end to the anti African campaign and reiterating the charges that the virus was created in U S military laboratories while in Literaturnaya Gazeta warned specifically against contact with Americans br In Sovetskaya Rossiya put out an article defending their right to report different views The chief of Novosti stated that it drew upon foreign sources for much of the AIDS coverage and that the press was free under glasnost br The Mitrokhin Archive reveals that br br Faced with American protests and the denunciation of the story by the international scientific community however Gorbachev and his advisers were clearly concerned that exposure of Soviet disinformation might damage the new Soviet image in the West In August US officials were told in Moscow that the Aids story was officially disowned Soviet press coverage of the story came to an almost complete halt br The campaign faded from most Soviet media outlets but it occasionally resurfaced abroad in Third World countries as late as usually via press placement agents br br In of Americans considered it definitely or probably true that the AIDS virus was created deliberately in a government laboratory In a study by the RAND Corporation and Oregon State University revealed that nearly of African Americans thought AIDS was man made over believed AIDS was a product of a government laboratory believed it was created and spread by the CIA and believed that AIDS was a form of genocide against black people Other AIDS conspiracy theories have abounded and have been discredited by the mainstream scientific community br In popular culture the Kanye West song Heard Em Say tells listeners I know that the government administer AIDS In South Africa the former president Thabo Mbeki cited the operation s theory of Fort Detrick in denying the science of HIV br In Director of Russia s Foreign Intelligence Service SVR Yevgeny Primakov admitted that the KGB was behind the newspaper articles claiming that AIDS was created by the U S government Segal s role was exposed by KGB defector Vasili Mitrokhin in the Mitrokhin Archive Jack Koehler s book Stasi The Untold Story of the East German Secret Police describes how the Stasi cooperated with the KGB to spread the story br Insofar as the distrust in medical authorities created by the operation led to a distrust in the treatment for AIDS recommended by medical science journalist Joshua Yaffa notes that numerous studies have shown that those who disbelieve the science on the origins of H I V are less likely to engage in safe sex or to regularly take recommended medication if infected the operation may have cost many lives Yaffa argues that the delay in widespread implementation of antiretroviral therapies in South Africa may have cost as many as lives br br Cold Case Hammarskj ld documentary film with a similar premise alleging that a South African white supremacist organization had helped spread AIDS throughout Africa using UN sponsored
