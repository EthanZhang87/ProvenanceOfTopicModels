Plandemic is a trilogy of conspiracy theory films produced by Mikki Willis promoting misinformation about the COVID pandemic They feature Judy Mikovits a discredited American researcher and prominent anti vaccine activist The first video Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid was released on May under Willis production company Elevate Films The second film Plandemic Indoctornation which includes more interviewees was released on August by Brian Rose s distributor of conspiracy theory related films London Real Later on June Plandemic The Great Awakening was released on The Highwire a website devoted to conspiracy theories run by anti vaccine activist Del Bigtree br Upon its release the first video went viral becoming one of the most widespread pieces of COVID misinformation its popularity most attributed to online word of mouth It was quickly removed by multiple online platforms but this failed to stop its proliferation The video also plausibly contributed to the increasing rebellion against health protocols Due to social media companies preparedness for its release Plandemic Indoctornation received less attention br Scientists and health professionals have criticized all the installments of the trilogy for their misleading claims while Willis filmmaking style employing various modes of persuasion has been cited as lending to a conspiratorial and brainwashing character of the film Responding to the outcry directed at the first video Willis expressed doubt about Mikovits claims but continued to defend her with Indoctrination being self described as a response video to debunkers The Great Awakening was also subject to debunking by fact checkers br br The COVID pandemic was caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV first identified in December in Wuhan China becoming a pandemic in Billions of people have contracted the disease and millions eventually died from it As a result of the pandemic declaration travel restrictions social distancing measures and many other precautions were enacted to try to prevent the spread of COVID while vaccines were quickly developed and underwent phased distribution in most countries Meanwhile misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic emerged concerning the pandemic s scale the virus origin diagnosis and treatment Among the popular conspiracy theory is that the virus is a bioweapon to control the population Some people have claimed to have magical or faith based cures for the disease br Judy Anne Mikovits is a former American research scientist who is known for her discredited medical claims such as the claim murine endogenous retroviruses are linked to chronic fatigue syndrome Even prior to the pandemic Mikovits was engaged in anti vaccination activism and the promotion of conspiracy theories and was accused of scientific misconduct Prior to the release of Plandemic Mikovits had expressed support for various COVID conspiracy theories claiming for example that the COVID pandemic is a predictable flu season br Mikki Willis is a former model and actor who had been making several New Age documentary films and conspiracy videos At age he founded the New York Los Angeles Theater of the Arts where he made several experimental plays before making his feature debut film Shoe Shine Boys He owns a production company Elevate Films which operates under the c non profit Elevate Foundation founded in At one point it also operated a namesake film festival He was also co director co cinematographer and co editor of the documentary Neurons to Nirvana which makes therapeutic claims on psychedelics Residing in Ojai California Willis has a wife and business partner Nadia Salamanca as well as two sons He has a family YouTube channel Elevate Family where one of his videos encouraging young boys to be unashamed of their cross gender interests went viral In it was reported they were planning to launch an alternative learning center br br The first installment of the trilogy a minute video titled Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid promotes the conspiracist claim that vaccines are a money making enterprise that causes medical harm exploring themes of the loss of free speech and free choice also promoting parental autonomy against the pharmaceutical industry It takes the form of an interview between Willis and Mikovits who makes unsupported and false statements about SARS CoV the disease it causes and her own controversial history br br Fact checking website PolitiFact highlighted eight false or misleading statements made in the video br br That Mikovits was held in jail without charge Mikovits was briefly held on remand after an accusation of theft from her former employer the Whittemore Peterson Institute but charges were dropped There is no evidence to support her statement notebooks removed from the Institute were planted or that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and its director Anthony Fauci bribed investigators When asked both Mikovits and Willis said it was an error to say Mikovits had not been charged she had meant to say the charges were dropped Mikovits later said I ve been confused for a decade and that in the future she would try to be clearer when she talks about the criminal charge I ll try to learn to say it differently br That the virus was manipulated This possibility is still being investigated According to Nature magazine Most scientists say SARS CoV probably has a natural origin and was transmitted from an animal to humans However a lab leak has not been ruled out and many are calling for a deeper investigation into the hypothesis that the virus emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology WIV located in the Chinese city where the first COVID cases were reported br That the SARS CoV virus evolved from SARS CoV within a decade and that is inconsistent with natural causes This is incorrect SARS CoV is similar but is not directly descended from SARS CoV SARS and the viruses have only genetic similarity br That hospitals receive from Medicare if they call it COVID when a patient dies This statement which had previously been made on The American Spectator and WorldNetDaily was rated half true by PolitiFact and Snopes payments are made but the amount is open to dispute and there is no evidence this influences diagnosis The evidence suggests COVID may be under diagnosed br That hydroxychloroquine is effective against coronaviruses This statement originates in work by Didier Raoult that subsequently received a statement of concern from the editors of the scientific journal in which it was published The first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID found no evidence of benefit and some evidence of harm The NIH said there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use to treat COVID As of May other bodies were running additional controlled trials to investigate hydroxychloroquine s safety and efficacy br That flu vaccines increase the chance of contracting COVID by This statement is false it misinterprets a disputed article that studied the influenza season predating the COVID pandemic The statement the flu vaccine increases the chance of contracting COVID does not appear in the original article The article s author Greg G Wolff said coronavirus cases increased from non vaccinated to vaccinated with an odds ratio of with confidence interval and the article highlight said Vaccinated personnel did not have significant odds of respiratory illnesses The article refers to seasonal coronaviruses that cause the common cold but COVID was added by the website disabledveterans org br That despite the goal of preventing coronaviruses flu vaccines contain coronaviruses In reality there are no vaccines with coronaviruses br That Wearing the mask literally activates your own virus You re getting sick from your own reactivated coronavirus expressions This statement is unsupported by evidence Masks prevent airborne transmission of the virus especially during the up to day asymptomatic period when carriers may not be aware they have the disease A virus may be deactivated but cannot add to one s infection level if it leaves the body even temporarily br br The journal Science also repeats some of the statements made by PolitiFact and fact checked some of Mikovits and Willis other statements br br That Italy s COVID epidemic is linked to influenza vaccines and the presence of coronaviruses in dogs There is no relation between these br That SARS CoV was created between the North Carolina laboratories Fort Detrick the U S Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the Wuhan laboratory Considering relations between the US and the Wuhan lab stopped the claim is false br That Mikovits is not anti vaccine According to Science she once wore a piece of Vaxxed II merchandise promoting the sequel to a film that says MMR vaccines cause autism and that she once sent Science a PowerPoint presentation calling for an immediate moratorium for all vaccines br That the Department of Health and Human Services HHS colluded and destroyed Mikovits reputation and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI kept this secret but did nothing to help her Science said Mikovits has presented no direct evidence that HHS heads colluded against her br That Mikovits article on Science revealed that the common use of animal and human fetal tissues was unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases which the article does not say br That Mikovits Ph D thesis Negative Regulation of HIV Expression in Monocytes revolutionized the treatment of HIV AIDS the thesis had no discernible impact on the treatment of HIV AIDS br Mikovits also alludes to several conspiracy theories that state Bill Gates is implicated in causing the pandemic to profit from an eventual vaccine and makes false and unsupported statements such as the claim that beaches should remain open because of healing microbes in the saltwater and sequences in the sand that can protect against the coronavirus The video states the numbers of COVID deaths are purposely being misreported to control people External videos such as one in which a chiropractor says tonic water can treat or prevent COVID and one of a press conference among doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi in Bakersfield California says the COVID pandemic is over hyped These external videos were also disputed beforehand br br According to Willis producing Plandemic was a struggle At that time he was aware getting involved in controversial topics would risk his reputation and would likely embroil him in heated discussions And of course there s been tons of it I ve just been navigating all of that he told the Los Angeles Times Willis concern arose from his perception of the pharmaceutical industry s corruption a concern that began with the deaths of his mother from cancer and of his brother from AIDS during his s br Willis met Mikovits for the first time in via mutual friends Willis told the Ojai Valley News Because of Mikovits direct connection with those involved with the pandemic I reached out to her for advice We met had a meeting and what she revealed to me I knew the world needed to know Principal photography took a day and editing took two weeks Willis said he stopped editing a socially conscious documentary film he produced in arguing Plandemic was urgent He was unsure whether to make a continuation After hiring a cinematographer and researcher to join the project Willis calculated it had a budget at less than US br Willis a low budget filmmaker who was years old at the time of Plandemic s release teamed up with Salamanca to market the video among their efforts were creating an Instagram account They intentionally chose conspiratorial branding to gain attention The project s title a portmenteau of plan and pandemic was the most popular choice in a Facebook poll conducted by Willis runners up were The Invisible Enemy and The Oath br br Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid was released on May It was promoted by American far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones on InfoWars and spread virally on social media garnering millions of views making it one of the most widespread pieces of COVID misinformation Judy Mikovits became a trending search on Google for two days Two weeks prior to release tweets used the term plandemic most of which were merely retweets After the video s release the word plandemic was used more on Twitter According to CrowdTangle QAnon Facebook groups endorsed the video A Facebook spokesman recalled its hired fact checkers wasting a huge amount of time to verify the video s claims partly due to its duration and the number of claims Before being removed one of the videos featuring the work attracted one million views Despite its removal viewings of the video on the original site continued br A YouTube spokesperson said the platform would remove videos supporting the claims of Plandemic without sufficient evidence saying s uggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm Vimeo s Trust Safety team removed the video for violating its policies on misinformation Twitter said hashtags like PlagueofCorruption and PlandemicMovie had been blacklisted and that not all of Mikovits attempts to spread propaganda on the platform violated its policies By the time the video was removed from Facebook it had been watched million times had attracted comments and had been shared nearly times On TikTok the video continued to find popularity via excerpted clips some of which were removed from the platform Google Drive and the Internet Archive were also used to spread the video the former removed the files after being notified by The Washington Post br According to Zarine Kharazian assistant editor of the Atlantic Council s Digital Forensic Research Lab as the film was removed from mainstream social media platforms a censorship backfire that was characterized as a form of Streisand effect occurred links to copies were promoted on alt tech platforms some of which were designed to host controversial content were shared with people s interest attracted by the video s perceived taboo nature On Facebook posts flagged as misinformation are more likely to be spread than those ignored Shahin Nazar and Toine Pieters of the journal Frontiers in Public Health called the marketing campaign of encouraging people via decentralized social media to propagate the anti vaccine belief sophisticated noting that it might have been a major contributor to the lack of compliance towards health protocols According to The Verge end to end encrypted services like WhatsApp and private groups meant the video was still being spread unbeknown to the public br br Scientists medical doctors and public health experts condemned Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid for promoting misinformation and NBC News called it a hodgepodge of conspiracy theories Governmental organizations including the Indonesian COVID Task Force also labeled the video as a hoax describing it as brainwashing and a red herring to divert the public s attention from real issues Experts like specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring and disinformation researcher Erin Gallagher said the video s professionally crafted atmosphere cinematography and ominously dramatic score made the stated claims sound true according to Spring That makes them as dangerous if not more so than advice with a mix of truth and misleading medical myths br Science journalist Tara Haelle described the video as pseudoscientific propaganda and said it succeeded at promoting misinformation because it plays on the viewers confusion and desperation for answers The opening sequence best targets people unfamiliar with Mikovits painting her as the scientific industry s underdog giving a good first impression on her and editing The video also uses various modes of persuasion such as the Gish gallop giving excessive arguments to sound convincing as well as scientific looking images and harrowing stock footage of dying people during the AIDS scene Writing for the Deseret News Amy Iverson expressed sympathy for those who stumbled upon the video in search for someone to blame for the effects of the pandemic however noted we cannot turn to outrageous unchecked claims from a few loud voices to ease our concerns And we definitely should not spread their unsubstantiated claims br Meanwhile the British musician Seal expressed love for the video and called the responses to it unjustified Other public figures including the mixed martial arts fighter Nick Catone spread the video s misinformation and Melissa Ackison a Republican politician supported the video The video s legacy continues long after its release in February The Washington Post reported an anti mask Facebook page called Shop Mask Free Los Angeles used Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid to support its claims By this time the Post reported some of the links had suffered from link rot br The Los Angeles Times contacted yoga teacher and author Shiva Rea who was a member of the board of directors of the Elevate Foundation Rea stated she was not associated with the foundation or the film and found Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid to be very disturbing br br Willis said that although he expected the provocative marketing to garner interest the actual scope of popularity was unexpected Speaking to the Los Angeles Times Willis said he is not anti vaccine and that he was merely trying to start a conversation about science He described himself as open minded I have a profound love and respect of doctors despite how many doctors are mad at me now Willis said he is also skeptical of Mikovits claims in the video We re working very hard right now to validate the majority of the claims that were made and expressed a willingness to be involved in civil discussions with doctors on all sides br ProPublica health care reporter and investigative journalist Marshall Allen contacted Willis who said Plandemic is not a piece that s intended to be perfectly balanced When asked whether Plandemic might be fairly called propaganda he said the definition fits although he did not feel it contains anything misleading According to Allan based on the definition of propaganda Willis feels of news reporting is propaganda br br The Center for Inquiry s CFI Benjamin Radford and researcher Paul Offit asked Willis eight questions about the accuracy of the claims made in the video either asking for evidence and clarification or asking questions such as considering that bacteria don t kill viruses how would healing microbes reduce or treat coronavirus infection Willis agreed to answer all of the questions but he never did Radford said on the CFI s website br If the claims made by Mikovits and Willis in Plandemic are based in truth and facts you d think they would be eager to offer evidence supporting their claims What better way to turn the tables on scientists skeptics and journalists than to offer a referenced fact based point by point rebuttal to critics who offer them a platform Where are their responses Why are they suddenly so quiet Why are they afraid to answer questions What do they have to hide br br The second installment an minute film titled Plandemic Indoctornation was released on August Willis said the film is a response video to all the debunkers and that he worked with a coalition of doctors and attorneys to make the film to reform our medical systems such that they re not under the stranglehold of Big Pharma PolitiFact categorized it as a pseudo documentary br The film says there is a worldwide conspiracy seeking to control humanity through fear and to make money for the putative conspirators the COVID pandemic is described as a key moment in a decades long plan The film says people and institutions including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC Google and the fact checking agencies it employs climate scientists John Oliver and Bill Gates coordinate with each other to enact the conspiracy br Plandemic Indoctornation says COVID was engineered in a laboratory that Event a disaster response exercise was a plan to release a real virus into the population and that the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation was ejected from India The film also says a defensive patent applied by the CDC during the SARS outbreak was meant to control the proprietary rights to the disease to the virus and to its detection and all of the measurement of it These were later unproven Event was not a virus conspiracy plot and the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation does not have technology allowing it to covertly implant an invisible proof of vaccination The CDC s defensive patent covers the genetic material detection methods for human coronaviruses so public research and communication were not jeopardized by commercial parties seeking exclusive private control br br Immediately after the release of Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid Willis said he was contacted by an independent producer who said he had worked on projects with HBO Netflix and Amazon The producer asked Willis if he had an interest in collaborating on making a feature length version though the Los Angeles Times found the companies had expressed no interest in the film Soon after Plandemic s release another set of teams announced the clips from Plandemic The Hidden Agenda Behind Covid would be part of a documentary feature film br Plandemic Indoctornation was released by an online distributor called London Real on the website Digital Freedom Platform which has promoted several discredited theories about the COVID pandemic and was founded and managed by podcaster Brian Rose Because the film s release was promoted in advance social media platforms were able to prepare for its release rather than scrambling to react to misinformation already circulating on their networks As part of their policy to counter disinformation about the pandemic Facebook Twitter and other platforms took steps to limit the spread of the film as soon as it was posted affixing warnings to links shared by users YouTube removed multiple copies of the film and sixteen clips presenting specific sections from its servers Although no steps to block the content were taken Facebook warned users when clicking the film s URL which was blacklisted by TikTok and Instagram br According to London Real Plandemic Indoctornation was watched million times by the end of its first day of release but the Digital Forensic Research Lab called the film a total flop that achieved much less social media engagement than the original video Because social media companies were forewarned by the viral nature of the first video the distribution of Plandemic Indoctornation was limited The Daily Dot said the only platform where it succeeded in getting exposure was Facebook where it had views of posts linking to the film on BitChute where it had views br br Critics compared Plandemic Indoctornation unfavorably with the first video Jane Lytvynenko at BuzzFeed News gave it zero stars saying while the first video presents a protagonist Mikovits and a fairly clear narrative the film does neither it is bloated confused and filled with nonsense switching between topics without clearly establishing how all the information presented relate to each other Its subjects are said to be clich with respect to the first video Lytvynenko said Willis initial claim the first video is a trailer for a feature film is incorrect while Plandemic Indoctornation discusses the same themes and includes Mikovits most of the material in the first video is not used in the feature length film br br Willis teamed up with Del Bigtree the founder of the anti vaccination group Informed Consent Action Network to release another film Plandemic The Great Awakening on Bigtree s website The Highwire In February a rough cut was screened at the Rabbit Room section of the st Conscious Life Expo in Los Angeles a New Age and far right conspiracy event where he won a humanitarian award in The trailer was released on May and the film itself on June Its promotional tagline placed at a slick official website is Censored Debunked The fact checking organization Logically reported that the trailer had earned two million views on Twitter as of May The minute film is said to be dedicated to conspiracy theorist G Edward Griffin with archival clips of him used sporadically br The film begins with Willis claiming that his AIDS infected brother died of consuming the treatment drug zidovudine PolitiFact and Agence France Presse found no evidence that it caused the deaths of AIDS patients The clip circulated in Instagram but was then flagged by parent company Meta Willis then says that COVID lockdowns are synchronized tyranny aimed at controlling the masses The trailer includes out of context clips of world leaders and politicians discussing the Great Reset at the World Economic Forum WEF and features personalities who have promoted misinformation about the pandemic and vaccines including Ghent University professor Mattias Desmet and Vladimir Zelenko The film also misleadingly depicts WEF founder Klaus Schwab as creating a purported plot for a unified world government as well as being a Nazi due to him being born in Nazi Germany It also falsely covers the George Floyd protests additionally calling Black Lives Matter a pro communist organization antifa protests and a Washington state bill regarding gender
