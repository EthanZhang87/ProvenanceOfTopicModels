title: Anti-vaccine activism
id: 73735462
Anti vaccine activism which collectively constitutes the anti vax movement is a set of organized activities proclaiming opposition to vaccination and these collaborating networks have often fought to increase vaccine hesitancy by disseminating vaccine based misinformation and or forms of active disinformation As a social movement it has utilized multiple tools both within traditional news media and also through various forms of online communication Activists have primarily though far from entirely focused on issues surrounding children with vaccination of the young receiving pushback and they have sought to expand beyond niche subgroups into national political debates br Although concepts such as various myths and conspiracy theories alongside outright disinformation and misinformation have been spread by the anti vaccination movement and fringe doctors in a way that has significantly increased vaccine hesitancy and altered public policy around the ethical legal and medical matters related to vaccines no serious sense of hesitancy or of debate in the broad sense exists within mainstream medical circles about the benefits of vaccination One scholarly article from has described the present scientific consensus as clear and unambiguous At the same time however the anti vax movement has partially succeeded in distorting common understandings of science in popular culture br br br Strategies and tactics br br br Arguments used br In a paper in the British Medical Journal two medical historians suggested that the arguments made against the safety and effectiveness of vaccines in the late th century are similar to those of the early anti vaccinationists Both the th and th century arguments included vaccine safety issues vaccine failures infringement of personal liberty and an unholy alliance between the medical establishment and the government to reap huge profits for the medical establishment at the expense of the public However the authors only considered the use of newspaper articles and letters books journals and pamphlets to warn against the dangers of vaccination and did not address the impact of the internet Comments on YouTube videos during the COVID pandemic clustered similarly around concerns about side effects effectiveness and lack of trust in corporations and government br br br Misrepresentation br In some instances anti vaccine organizations have used names intended to sound non partisan on the issue e g National Vaccine Information Center USA Vaccination Risk Awareness Network Canada Australian Vaccination Network In November the Australian Vaccination Network was ordered by the New South Wales Administrative Decisions Tribunal to change their name so that consumers are aware of the anti vaccination nature of the group Lateline reported that former AVN president Meryl Dorey claimed she was a victim of hate groups and vested interests in response to the ruling br br br Information quality br Although physicians and nurses are still rated as the most trusted source for vaccine information some vaccine hesitant individuals report being more comfortable discussing vaccines with providers of complementary and alternative CAM treatments With the rise of the internet many people have turned online for medical information In some instances anti vaccine activists seek to steer people away from vaccination and health care providers and towards alternative medicines sold by certain of the activists br Anti vaccination writings on the internet have been argued to be characterized by a number of differences from medical and scientific literature These include br br Promiscuous copying and reduplication br Ignoring corrections even when an initial report or data point is shown to be false br Lack of references difficulty in checking sources and claims br Personal attacks on individual doctors br A high degree of interlinkage between sites br Dishonest or fallacious arguments br For example a study examined Instagram posts related to the HPV vaccine which can prevent some types of cancer Anti vaccine posts were more likely than pro vaccine posts to be sent by non healthcare individuals to include personal narratives and to reference other Instagram users links or reposts Anti vaccine posts were also more likely to involve concealment or distortion particularly conspiracy theories and unsubstantiated claims In total of antivaccine posts made inaccurate claims including exaggerating the risks of vaccines and minimizing risks of disease br br br Disinformation tactics br A number of specific disinformation tactics have been noted in anti vaccination messaging including br Conspiracies theories alleging lies trickery cover ups and secret knowledge br Messages crafted for psychological appeal rather than truthfulness br Fake experts br Impossible expectations claiming that anything less than certainty in a scientific claim implies doubt and that doubt means there is no consensus br Selective cherry picking using obscure or debunked sources while ignoring counter evidence and scientific consensus br Shifting hypotheses Continually introducing new theories about vaccines being harmful moving to new claims when existing ones are shown to be false br Misrepresentation false logic and illogical analogies br Personal attacks on critics ranging from online criticism publicly revealing personal details and threats to offline activities such as legal actions targeting of employers and violence br Targeting China s vaccine During the pandemic as retaliation for China s attempts to blame the United States for the pandemic The Pentagon targeted China s Sinovac COVID vaccine by spreading anti vaccine misinformation in the Philippines br br br Economics of vaccine disinformation br Information is more likely to be believed after repeated exposure Disinformers use this illusory truth effect as a tactic repeating false information to make it feel familiar and influence belief Anti vaccine activists have leveraged social media to develop interconnected networks of influencers that shape people s opinion recruit allies impact policy and monetize vaccine related disinformation br In the Journal of Communication published a study of the political economy underlying vaccine disinformation Researchers identified English language actors that provided almost exclusively anti vaccination publications Their websites monetized disinformation through appeals for donations sales of content based media and other merchandise third party advertising and membership fees Some maintained a group of linked websites attracting visitors with one site and appealing for money and selling merchandise on others Their activities to gain attention and obtain funding displayed a hybrid monetization strategy They attracted attention by combining eye catching aspects of junk news and online celebrity promotion At the same time they developed campaign specific communities to publicize and legitimize their position similar to radical social movements br br br Misrepresentation of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System br In the United States the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS is used to gather information on potential vaccine adverse reactions but is susceptible to unverified reports misattribution underreporting and inconsistent data quality Raw unverified data from VAERS has often been used by the anti vaccine community to justify misinformation regarding the safety of vaccines it is generally not possible to find out from VAERS data if a vaccine caused an adverse event or how common the event might be br br br Legal action br Since Republicans gained a majority in the House in January the House Judiciary Committee has used legal action to actively oppose both disinformation research and government involvement in fighting disinformation One of the projects targeted is the Virality Project which has examined the spread of false claims about vaccines The House Judiciary Committee has sent letters subpoenas and threats of legal action to researchers demanding notes emails and other records from researchers and even student interns dating back to Institutions include the Stanford Internet Observatory at Stanford University the University of Washington the Atlantic Council s Digital Forensic Research Lab and the social media analytics firm Graphika Researchers emphasize that they have academic freedom to study disinformation as well as freedom of speech to report their results br Despite conservative claims that the government acted to censor speech online no evidence has emerged that government officials coerced the companies to take action against accounts The actions of the House Judiciary Committee have been described as an attempt to chill research creating a chilling effect through increased time demands legal costs and online harassment of researchers br br br Harassment br Persons undertaking efforts to counter vaccine misinformation including public health experts who use social media have been targeted for harassment by anti vaccine activists For example Slovakian physician Vladim r Kr m ry was a prominent member of the government advisory team during the COVID pandemic in Slovakia and was the first person in that country to receive a COVID vaccine Due to his prominent role in the vaccination campaign Kr m ry and his family became a target of anti vaccine activists who physically threatened him and his family br In June Texas based physician and researcher Peter Hotez tweeted his concerns about Robert F Kennedy Jr sharing misinformation about vaccines on Joe Rogan s podcast Rogan Kennedy and Twitter owner Elon Musk asked Hotez to participate in a debate on the podcast Upon declining the invitation Hotez was harassed by their fans with anti vaccine activist Alex Rosen confronting him at his home br In his book The Deadly Rise of Anti science A Scientist s Warning Hotez describes how he and other scientists who publicly defend vaccines have been attacked on social media harassed with threatening emails intimidated and confronted physically by opponents of vaccination He attributes the increase in aggressiveness of the anti vaccination movement to the influence of the extreme wing of the Republican Party Hotez estimates that roughly preventable deaths from COVID mainly among Republicans occurred in the US because of refusal to be vaccinated br At the extreme end opposition to vaccination has resulted in substantial violence against vaccinators In Pakistan more than polio team workers have lost their lives team members include not only vaccinators but police and security personnel from targeted killing and terrorism while working on polio vaccination campaigns br br br Countering anti vaccine activism br Various efforts have been suggested and undertaken to address concerns about vaccines and counter anti vaccine disinformation Efforts include social media advertising campaigns by public health organizations in support of public health goals br Best practices for combating vaccine mis and disinformation include addressing issues openly clearly identifying areas of scientific consensus and areas of uncertainty and being sensitive to the cultural and religious values of communities In countering anti vaccine disinformation both factual and emotional aspects need to be addressed br Whether people will update a mistaken belief is complicated and involves psychological factors and social goals as well as accuracy of information There is some evidence that both debunking and pre bunking of disinformation can be effective at least in the short term Elements that may help to correct inaccurate information include warning people before they are exposed to misinformation high perceived credibility of message sources affirmations of identity and social norms graphical presentation and focusing attention on clear core messages br Alternative explanations of a situation need to fit plausibly into the original scenario and ideally indicate why the incorrect explanation was previously thought to be correct br The cultivation of critical thinking health and science awareness and media literacy skills are all recommended to help people more critically assess the credibility of the information they see People who seek out multiple reputable news sources at local and national levels are more likely to detect disinformation than those who rely on few sources from a particular viewpoint Particularly on social media beware of sensational headlines that appeal to emotion fact check information broadly not just through your usual sources and consider possible agendas or conflicts of interest of those relaying information br br br Operation of social media br Other suggestions for countering anti vaccine activism focus on changing the operation of social media platforms Interventions such as accuracy nudges and source labeling change the context in which information is presented For example correct information can be directly presented to counter disinformation br Other possibilities include flagging or removing misleading information on social media platforms Research suggests that a majority of individuals in the United States would support the removal of harmful misinformation posts and the suspension of accounts This position is less popular with Republicans than Democrats br While private entities like Facebook Twitter and Telegram could legally establish guidelines for moderation of information and disinformation on their platforms subject to local and international laws such companies do not have strong incentives to control disinformation or to self regulate Algorithms that are used to maximize user engagement and profits can lead to unbalanced poorly sourced and actively misleading information br Criticized for its role in vaccine hesitancy Facebook announced in March that it would provide users with authoritative information on the topic of vaccines Facebook introduced several policies chosen to reduce the impact of anti vaccine content without actually removing it These included reducing the ranking of anti vaccine sources in searches and not recommending them rejecting ads and targeted advertising that contained vaccine misinformation and using banners to present vaccine information from authoritative sources A study examined the six months before and after the policy changes It found a moderate but significant decrease in the number of likes for anti vaccine posts following the policy changes Likes of pro vaccine posts were unchanged Facebook has been criticized for not being more aggressive in countering disinformation In response to efforts to police misinformation anti vaccine communities on social media have adopted coded language to refer to vaccinated persons and the vaccines themselves br Supply side interventions reduce circulation of misinformation directly at their sources through actions such as application of social media policies regulation and legislation br A study published in the journal Vaccine examined advertisements posted in the three months prior to the Facebook s policy changes It found that of the anti vaccine advertisements on Facebook were placed by just two organizations funded by well known anti vaccination activists The Children s Health Defense World Mercury Project chaired by Robert F Kennedy Jr and Stop Mandatory Vaccination run by campaigner Larry Cook posted of the advertisements The ads often linked to commercial products such as natural remedies and books Kennedy was suspended from Facebook in August but reinstated in June br In however state governments that were politically aligned with anti vaccine activists successfully sought a preliminary injunction to prevent the Biden Administration from seeking to pressure social media companies into fighting misinformation The order issued by United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit severely limits the ability of the White House the surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to communicate with social media companies about content related to Covid that the government views as misinformation In October this injunction was paused by the Supreme Court of the United States pending further litigation br br br Use of algorithms and data br Algorithms and user data can be used to identify selected subgroups who can then be provided with specialized content This type of approach has been used both by anti vaccine activists br and by health providers who hope to counter vaccine related disinformation br For example in the United States the CDC s Social Vulnerability Index SVI has been used to identify communities that have traditionally been under served or are at elevated risk for infection morbidity and mortality Programs have been developed in such communities to address disinformation and vaccine hesitancy br br br Community engagement br Steps have been taken to counter anti vaccine messaging by directly engaging with communities Outreach efforts include call centers and texting campaigns partnering with local community leaders and holding community based vaccine clinics Creating digital and science literacy resources and distributing them via schools libraries municipal offices churches and other community groups can help to counter misinformation in under resourced communities br The Black Doctors COVID Consortium in Philadelphia is one example of a successful direct outreach initiative Another is the New York State Vaccine Equity Task Force br In line with the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts SAGE s C s model outreach to communities has focused on addressing mistrust and increasing Confidence providing information to improve risk assessment Complacency and improving access to COVID vaccines Convenience It has been necessary to counter disinformation in all three areas br Recommendations for combating vaccine disinformation include increasing the presence of trusted health agencies and credible information on social media partnering with social media platforms to promote evidence based public health information and identifying and responding to emerging concerns and disinformation campaigns br Networked communities of public health officials and other stakeholders connecting with the public through a variety of credible and trusted messengers are recommended Sharing of messages through such networks could help to debunk and counter highly networked and coordinated disinformation attacks br A networked community approach would differ from the current model of US public health communication which tends to rely on a single credible messenger e g Anthony Fauci and is susceptible to disinformation attacks To deal with disinformation community networks would need to address issues of liberty and human rights as well as vaccine safety effectiveness and access Networks could also help to show support for those attacked by anti vaccine activists br br br History br br br th and th century br Ideas that would eventually coalesce into anti vaccine activism have existed for longer than vaccines themselves Some philosophical approaches e g homeopathy vitalism are incompatible with the microbiological paradigm that explains how the immune system and vaccines work Vaccine hesitancy and anti vaccine activism exist within a broader context that involves cultural tradition religious belief approaches to health and disease and political affiliation br Opposition to variolation for smallpox a predecessor to vaccination was organized as early as the s around the premise that vaccination was unnatural and an attempt to thwart divine judgment Religious arguments against inoculation the earliest arguments against vaccination were soon advanced For example in a sermon entitled The Dangerous and Sinful Practice of Inoculation the English theologian Reverend Edmund Massey argued that diseases are sent by God to punish sin and that any attempt to prevent smallpox via inoculation is a diabolical operation It was customary at the time for popular preachers to publish sermons which reached a wide audience This was the case with Massey whose sermon reached North America where there was early religious opposition particularly by John Williams A greater source of opposition there was William Douglass a medical graduate of Edinburgh University and a Fellow of the Royal Society who had settled in Boston br Vaccination itself was invented by British physician Edward Jenner who published his findings on the efficacy of the practice for smallpox in By the practice had been widely endorsed in the scientific community and by several world leaders Philadelphia physician John Redman Coxe noting that even then false accounts were circulated of negative effects of vaccination wrote br br Such are the falsehoods which impede the progress of the brightest discovery which has ever been made But the contest is in vain Time has drawn aside the veil which obstructed our knowledge of this invaluable blessing and in the examples of the Emperor of Constantinople of the Dowager Empress of Russia and the King of Spain we may date the downfall of further opposition br Coxe s expectation of an end to opposition to vaccination proved premature and through much of the nineteenth century the principles practices and impact of vaccination were matters of active scientific debate The principles behind vaccination were not clearly understood until the end of the nineteenth century The importance of hygiene in the preparation storage and administration of vaccines was not always understood or practiced Reliable statistics on vaccine efficacy and side effects were difficult to obtain before the s br br br Anti Compulsory Vaccination League br In the United Kingdom the Compulsory Vaccination Act of required that every child be vaccinated within three or four months of birth It set a precedent for the state regulation of physical bodies and was fiercely resisted br The following year in John Gibbs published the first anti compulsory vaccination pamphlet Our Medical Liberties br By the s anti vaccinationism in Britain was active in the working class labor aristocracy and lower middle class It had become associated with alternative medicine and was part of a larger culture of social and political dissent that included both labor unions and religious dissenters br br In June the publication Human Nature campaigned in the United Kingdom against The Vaccination Humbug reporting that many petitions had been presented to Parliament against Compulsory Vaccination for smallpox including from parents who alleged that their children had died through the procedure and complaining that these petitions had not been made public The journal reported the formation of the Anti Compulsory Vaccination League To overthrow this huge piece of physiological absurdity and medical tyranny and quoted Richard Gibbs a cousin of John Gibbs who ran the Free Hospital at the same address as stating I believe we have hundreds of cases here from being poisoned with vaccination I deem incurable One member of a family dating syphilitic symptoms from the time of vaccination when all the other members of the family have been clear We strongly advise parents to go to prison rather than submit to have their helpless offspring inoculated with scrofula syphilis and mania br Notable members of the Anti Compulsory Vaccination League included James Burns George Dornbusch and Charles Thomas Pearce After the death of Richard B Gibbs in the Anti Compulsory Vaccination League languished until when it was revived under the leadership of Mary Hume Rothery and the Rev W Hume Rothery The Anti Compulsory Vaccination League published the Occasional Circular which later merged into the National Anti Compulsory Vaccination Reporter br br br Anti Vaccination Society of America br In the United States many states and local school boards established immunization requirements beginning with a compulsory school vaccination law in Massachusetts in br The Anti Vaccination Society of America was founded in after a visit to the United States by British anti vaccine activist William Tebb and opposed compulsory smallpox vaccination for smallpox from the final decades of the th century through the s During this period smallpox vaccination was the only form of vaccination that was widely practiced and the society published a periodical opposing it called Vaccination br A series of American legal cases beginning in various states and culminating with that of Henning Jacobson of Massachusetts in upheld the mandating of compulsory smallpox vaccination for the good of the public The court ruled in Jacobson v Massachusetts that the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in each person to be at all times and in all circumstances wholly freed from restraint There are manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good br br br London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination br br In William Tebb enlarged and reorganized the Anti Compulsory Vaccination League in the UK with the formation of the London Society for the Abolition of Compulsory Vaccination with William Young as secretary The Vaccination Inquirer established by Tebb in was adopted as the official organ of the Society A series of fourteen Vaccination Tracts was begun by Young in and completed by Garth Wilkinson in William White was the first editor of the Vaccination Inquirer and after his death in he was succeeded by Alfred Milnes Frances Hoggan and her husband authored an article for the Vaccination Inquirer in September which argued against compulsory vaccination The London Society focused on lobbying parliamentary support in the s and early s They gained support from several members of the House of Commons of which the most prominent was Peter Alfred Taylor the member for Leicester which was described as the Mecca of antivaccination br br br The National Anti Vaccination League br The UK movement grew and as the influence of the London Society overshadowed the Hume Rotherys and it took the national lead it was decided in February to re form the Society as The National Anti Vaccination League Arthur Phelps was elected as president In the league took on a school leaver named Lily Loat who was elected as the league s Secretary by In George Bernard Shaw wrote a supportive letter to the National Anti Vaccination League equating methods of vaccination with rubbing the contents of the dustpan into the wound br br br Anti Vaccination League of America br In the Anti Vaccination League of America was created by Charles M Higgins and industrialist John Pitcairn Jr with anti vaccination campaigns focused on New York and Pennsylvania Members were opposed to compulsory vaccination laws Higgins was the League s chief spokesman and pamphleteer Historian James Colgrove noted that Higgins attempted to overturn the New York State s law mandating vaccination of students in public schools The League should not be confused with the Anti Vaccination Society of America that was formed in Higgins was criticized by medical experts for spreading misinformation and ignoring facts as to the efficacy of vaccination The League dissolved after the death of Higgins in br br br th century br Anti vaccine activism ebbed for much of the twentieth century but never completely vanished In the UK the National Anti Vaccination League continued to publish new issues of its journal until by which time the global campaign for smallpox eradication through vaccination had made the disease so uncommon that compulsory vaccination for smallpox was no longer required in the United Kingdom br New vaccines were developed and used against diseases such as diphtheria and whooping cough In the UK these were often introduced on a voluntary basis without arousing the same kind of anti vaccination response that had accompanied compulsory smallpox vaccination br In the United States numerous measles outbreaks occurred in the s and s and were shown to be more frequent in states that lacked mandatory vaccination requirements This led to calls in the s for a national level vaccination requirement for children entering schools br Joseph A Califano Jr appealed to state governors and by all states legally required vaccination for school entrance Many of these laws allowed exemptions in response to lobbyists In New York State a law allowed exemptions from receiving polio vaccine for members of religious organizations such as Christian Scientists br br br st century br br br Lancet MMR autism fraud br br Anti vaccine activism in the s regained prominence through exploratory research based on cases that made claims about a link between the MMR vaccine and autism These claims were subsequently extensively investigated and found to be false and the original study turned out to be based on faked data The scientific consensus is that there is no link between the MMR vaccine and autism and that the MMR vaccine s benefits in preventing measles mumps and rubella greatly outweigh its potential risks br The idea of an autism link was first suggested in the early s and came to public notice largely as a result of the Lancet MMR autism fraud which Dennis K Flaherty at the University of Charleston characterized as perhaps the most damaging medical hoax of the last years The fraudulent research paper authored by Andrew Wakefield and published in The Lancet falsely claimed the vaccine was linked to colitis and autism spectrum disorders The paper was retracted in but is still cited by anti vaccine activists br The claims in the paper were widely reported leading to a sharp drop in vaccination rates in the UK and Ireland Promotion of the claimed link which continued in anti vaccination propaganda for the next three decades despite being refuted was estimated to have led to an increase in the incidence of measles and mumps resulting in deaths and serious permanent injuries Following the initial claims in multiple large epidemiological studies were undertaken Reviews of the evidence by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the American Academy of Pediatrics the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academy of Sciences the UK National Health Service and the Cochrane Library all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism Physicians medical journals and editors have described Wakefield s actions as fraudulent and tied them to epidemics and deaths br An investigation by journalist Brian Deer found that Wakefield the author of the original research paper linking the vaccine to autism had multiple undeclared conflicts of interest had manipulated evidence and had broken other ethical codes After a subsequent year investigation the General Medical Council ruled that Wakefield had acted dishonestly and irresponsibly in doing his research carrying out unauthorized procedures for which he was not qualified and acting with callous disregard for the children involved br Wakefield was found guilty by the General Medical Council of serious professional misconduct in May and was struck off the Medical Register meaning he could no longer practise as a physician in the UK br The Lancet paper was partially retracted in and fully retracted in when Lancet s editor in chief Richard Horton described it as utterly false and said that the journal had been deceived In January Deer published a series of reports in the British Medical Journal in which a signed editorial stated of the journalist It has taken the diligent scepticism of one man standing outside medicine and science to show that the paper was in fact an elaborate fraud A journal article described the vaccine autism connection as the most damaging medical hoax of the last years br Wakefield continues to promote anti vaccine beliefs and conspiracy theories in the United States br In February Wakefield denied that he bore any responsibility for the measles epidemic that started at Disneyland among unvaccinated children that year He also reaffirmed his discredited belief that MMR contributes to the current autism epidemic By that time at least measles cases had been reported Paul Offit disagreed saying that the outbreak was directly related to Dr Wakefield s theory br Wakefield and other anti vaccine activists were active in the American Somali community in Minnesota where a drop in vaccination rates was followed by the largest measles outbreak in the state in nearly years in br The anti vaccination movement was historically apolitical but in the s and s the movement in the United States has increasingly targeted conservatives As measles outbreaks increased so did calls to eliminate exemptions from vaccine administration As of American states had suggested legislation to eliminate or increase the difficulty of exemptions including California Concurrently American anti vaccine activists reached out to libertarian and right leaning groups such as the Tea Party movement to broaden their base While earlier anti vaccination activists focused on health impacts and safety of vaccines recent themes increasingly involve philosophical arguments about liberty medical freedom and parental rights br With the growing anti vaccine movement from the s onwards the United States has seen a resurgence of certain vaccine preventable diseases The measles virus lost its elimination status in the US as the number of measles cases continued to rise in the late s with a total of outbreaks in and outbreaks in as of April br br br measles outbreaks br Vaccine hesitancy led to declining rates of vaccination for measles culminating in the measles outbreaks The most significant of these in proportion to national population was the Samoa measles outbreak br In July two month old children died in Samoa after receiving incorrectly prepared MMR vaccinations These two deaths were picked up by anti vaccine groups and used to incite fear towards vaccination on social media causing the government to suspend its measles vaccination programme for ten months despite advice from the WHO The incident caused many Samoan residents to lose trust in the healthcare system UNICEF and the World Health Organization estimate that the measles vaccination rate in Samoa fell from in to in similar to some of the poorest countries in Africa br In August an infected passenger on one of the more than annual flights between New Zealand and Samoa probably brought the disease from Auckland to Upolu A full outbreak of measles began on the island in October and continued for the next four months As of January there were over cases of measles and deaths out of a Samoan population of Over three percent of the population were infected The cause of the outbreak was attributed to decreased vaccination rates from in to in even though nearby islands had rates near a rate of deaths per infected and cases of the population of measles in Samoa Sixty one out of the first deaths were four years old and under and all but seven were under After the outbreak anti vaxxers employed racist tropes and misinformation to credit the scores of measles deaths to poverty and poor nutrition or even to the vaccine itself but this has been discounted by the international emergency medical support that arrived in November and December There was no evidence of acute malnutrition clinical vitamin A deficiency or immune deficiency as claimed by various anti vaxxers br br br COVID pandemic activism br br During the COVID pandemic anti vaccine activists undertook various efforts to hinder people who wanted to receive the vaccines with such activities occurring in countries including Australia Israel the United Kingdom and the United States These included attempts to physically blockade vaccination sites and making false reservations for vaccination appointments to clog up vaccination booking systems Protests were also organized by the activists to raise awareness for their cause br In some instances anti vaccine rhetoric has been traced to state sponsored internet troll activities designed to create social dissension Worldwide foreign disinformation campaigns have been associated with declining vaccination rates in target countries br Anti vaccine activism online both before and during the pandemic has been linked to extreme levels of falsehoods rumors hoaxes and conspiracy theories br Anti vaccine activists have falsely claimed in social media posts that numerous deaths or injuries had to do with reactions to vaccines In one highly publicized instance in early after Buffalo Bills football player Damar Hamlin experienced an in game episode of commotio cordis there was an increase in rhetoric and disinformation from figures such as Charlie Kirk and Drew Pinsky making unfounded claims about Hamlin s cardiac arrest and COVID vaccines In another incident college basketball player Bronny James experienced cardiac arrest at the Galen Center at the University of Southern California leading to assertions that this was a result of receiving a COVID vaccine it was later revealed that the episode had been caused by a congenital heart defect Also anti vaccine activists believed Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins died in from the COVID vaccine while in actuality it was a drug overdose In December The New York Times published a detailed investigation of the distortion and misrepresentation of the circumstances surrounding the death of year old George Watts Jr by Robert F Kennedy Jr and other anti vaccine activists Some unvaccinated persons opposed to COVID vaccination began referring to themselves in social media groups as purebloods a term historically connoting racial purity br Prominent biomedical researcher Peter Hotez asserted that he and other American scientists who publicly defend vaccines have been attacked on social media harassed with threatening emails intimidated and confronted physically by opponents of vaccination He further attributes the increase in aggressiveness of the anti vaccination movement to the influence of the extreme wing of the Republican Party Hotez estimates that roughly preventable deaths from COVID mainly among Republicans occurred in the US because of refusal to be vaccinated A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found evidence of higher excess mortality for Republican voters compared with Democratic voters in Florida and Ohio after but not before COVID vaccines were available to all adults in the US br br br See also br br Anti vaccinationism in chiropractic br Big Pharma conspiracy theories br COVID vaccine misinformation and hesitancy br Germ theory denialism br List of anti vaccination
