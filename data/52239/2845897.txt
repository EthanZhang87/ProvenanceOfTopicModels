title: Propaganda in Nazi Germany
id: 2845897
The propaganda used by the German Nazi Party in the years leading up to and during Adolf Hitler s dictatorship of Germany from to was a crucial instrument for acquiring and maintaining power and for the implementation of Nazi policies br br br Themes br br Nazi propaganda promoted Nazi ideology by demonising the enemies of the Nazi Party notably Jews and communists but also capitalists and intellectuals It promoted the values asserted by the Nazis including heroic death F hrerprinzip leader principle Volksgemeinschaft people s community Blut und Boden blood and soil and pride in the Germanic Herrenvolk master race Propaganda was also used to maintain the cult of personality around Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and to promote campaigns for eugenics and the annexation of German speaking areas After the outbreak of World War II Nazi propaganda vilified Germany s enemies notably the United Kingdom the Soviet Union and the United States and in exhorted the population to total war br br br History br br br Mein Kampf br Adolf Hitler devoted two chapters of his book Mein Kampf itself a propaganda tool to the study and practice of propaganda He claimed to have learned the value of propaganda as a World War I infantryman exposed to very effective British and ineffectual German propaganda The argument that Germany lost the war largely because of British propaganda efforts expounded at length in Mein Kampf reflected then common German nationalist claims Although untrue German propaganda during World War I was mostly more advanced than that of the British it became the official truth of Nazi Germany thanks to its reception by Hitler br Mein Kampf contains the blueprint of later Nazi propaganda efforts Assessing his audience Hitler writes in chapter VI br br Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual of those to whom it is directed The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses The broad masses of the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned judgment in given cases but a vacillating crowd of human children who are constantly wavering between one idea and another The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning This sentiment however is not complex but simple and consistent It is not highly differentiated but has only the negative and positive notions of love and hatred right and wrong truth and falsehood br As to the methods to be employed he explains br br Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and in so far as it is favorable to the other side present it according to the theoretical rules of justice yet it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favorable to its own side The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted and their understanding is feeble On the other hand they quickly forget Such being the case all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials and those must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward Every change that is made in the subject of a propagandist message must always emphasize the same conclusion The leading slogan must of course be illustrated in many ways and from several angles but in the end one must always return to the assertion of the same formula br br br Early Nazi Party br Hitler put these ideas into practice with the reestablishment of the V lkischer Beobachter a newspaper published by the Nazi Party NSDAP from December onwards whose circulation reached in It was joined in by Joseph Goebbels s Der Angriff another unabashedly and crudely propagandistic paper br During most of the Nazis time in opposition their means of propaganda remained limited With little access to mass media the party continued to rely heavily on Hitler and a few others speaking at public meetings until One study finds that the Weimar government s use of pro government radio propaganda slowed Nazi growth In April Hitler appointed Goebbels head of party propaganda Goebbels a former journalist and Nazi Party officer in Berlin soon proved his skills Among his first successes was the organisation of riotous demonstrations that succeeded in having the American anti war film All Quiet on the Western Front banned in Germany br br br In power br br A major political and ideological cornerstone of Nazi policy was the unification of all ethnic Germans living outside the Reich s borders e g in Austria and Czechoslovakia under one Greater Germany In Mein Kampf Hitler denounced the pain and misery of ethnic Germans outside Germany and declared the dream of a common fatherland for which all Germans must fight Throughout Mein Kampf he pushed Germans worldwide to make the struggle for political power and independence their main focus made official in the Heim ins Reich policy beginning in br On March a Ministry of Propaganda was established with Goebbels as its Minister Its goals were to establish enemies in the public mind the external enemies which had imposed the Treaty of Versailles on Germany and internal enemies such as Jews Romani homosexuals Bolsheviks and cultural trends including degenerate art br For months prior to the beginning of World War II in German newspapers and leaders had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organising or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland On August Hitler told his generals br br I will provide a propagandistic casus belli Its credibility doesn t matter The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth br The main part of this propaganda campaign was the false flag Operation Himmler which was designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany in order to justify the invasion of Poland br Research finds that the Nazis use of radio propaganda helped it consolidate power and enroll more party members br There are a variety of factors that increased the obedience of German soldiers in terms of following the Nazi orders that were given to them regarding Jews Omer Bartov a professor on subjects such as German studies and European history mentioned in his book Hitler s Army Soldiers Nazis and War in the Third Reich how German soldiers were told information that influenced their actions Bartov mentioned that General Joachim Lemelsen a corps commander explained to his German troops regarding their actions toward Jews We want to bring back peace calm and order to this land German leaders tried to make their soldiers believe that Jews were a threat to their society Thus German soldiers followed orders given to them and participated in the demonisation and mass murders of Jews In other words German soldiers saw Jews as a group that was trying to infect and take over their homeland Bartov s description of Nazi Germany explains the intense discipline and unity that the soldiers had which played a role in their willingness to obey orders that were given to them These feelings that German soldiers had toward Jews grew more and more as time went on as the German leaders kept pushing further for Jews to get out of their land as they wanted total annihilation of Jews br br br World War II br br Until the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad on February German propaganda emphasised the prowess of German arms and the humanity German soldiers had shown to the peoples of occupied territories Pilots of the Allied bombing fleets were depicted as cowardly murderers and Americans in particular as gangsters in the style of Al Capone At the same time German propaganda sought to alienate Americans and British from each other and both these Western nations from the Soviet Union One of the primary sources for propaganda was the Wehrmachtbericht a daily radio broadcast from the High Command of the Wehrmacht the OKW Nazi victories lent themselves easily to propaganda broadcasts and were at this point difficult to mishandle Satires on the defeated accounts of attacks and praise for the fallen all were useful for Nazis Still failures were not easily handled even at this stage For example considerable embarrassment resulted when the Ark Royal proved to have survived an attack that German propaganda had hyped br Goebbels instructed Nazi propagandists to describe the invasion of the Soviet Union Operation Barbarossa as the European crusade against Bolshevism and the Nazis then formed different units of the Waffen SS consisting of mainly volunteers and conscripts br After Stalingrad the main theme changed to Germany as the main defender of what they called Western European culture against the Bolshevist hordes The introduction of the V and V vengeance weapons was emphasised to convince Britons of the hopelessness of defeating Germany br br On June the Nazis permitted the Red Cross to visit the concentration camp Theresienstadt to dispel rumors about the Final Solution which was intended to kill all Jews In reality Theresienstadt was a transit camp for Jews en route to extermination camps In a sophisticated propaganda effort fake shops and caf s were erected to imply that the Jews lived in relative comfort The guests enjoyed the performance of a children s opera Brundib r written by inmate Hans Kr sa The hoax was so successful for the Nazis that they went on to make a propaganda film Theresienstadt The shooting of the film began on February Directed by Kurt Gerron it was meant to show how well the Jews lived under the benevolent protection of Nazi Germany After the shooting most of the cast and even the filmmaker himself were deported to the concentration camp of Auschwitz where they were murdered Hans Fritzsche who had been head of the Radio Chamber was tried and acquitted by the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal br br br Antisemitism during World War II br br Antisemitic wartime propaganda served a variety of purposes It was hoped that people in Allied countries would be persuaded that Jews should be blamed for the war The Nazis also wished to ensure that German people were aware of the extreme measures being carried out against the Jews on their behalf in order to incriminate them and thus guarantee their continued loyalty through fear by Nazi conjectured scenarios of supposed post war Jewish reprisals Especially from onwards the announcement that Jews were being exterminated served as a group unification factor to preclude desertion and force the Germans to continue fighting Germans were fed the knowledge that too many atrocities had been committed especially against the Jews to allow for an understanding to be reached with the Allies br Nazi media vilified arch enemies of Nazi Germany as Jewish Franklin D Roosevelt or in the cases of Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill abject puppets of an international Jewish conspiracy intent on ruining Germany and Nazism br Problems in propaganda arose easily in this stage expectations of success were raised too high and too quickly which required explanation if they were not fulfilled and blunted the effects of success and the hushing of blunders and failures caused mistrust The increasing hardship of the war for the German people also called forth more propaganda that the war had been forced on the German people by the refusal of foreign powers to accept their strength and independence Goebbels called for propaganda to toughen up the German people and not make victory look easy br After Hitler s death his successor as chancellor of Germany Goebbels informed the Reichssender Hamburg radio station The station broke the initial news of Hitler s death on the night of May an announcer claimed he had died that afternoon as a hero fighting against Bolshevism Hitler s successor as head of state Karl D nitz further asserted that the U S forces were continuing the war solely to spread Bolshevism within Europe br br br Media br br br Books br The Nazis and sympathisers published many propaganda books Most of the beliefs that would become associated with the Nazis such as German nationalism eugenics and antisemitism had been in circulation since the th century and the Nazis seized on this body of existing work in their own publications br The most notable is Hitler s Mein Kampf detailing his beliefs The book outlines major ideas that would later culminate in World War II It is heavily influenced by Gustave Le Bon s The Crowd A Study of the Popular Mind which theorised propaganda as a way to control the seemingly irrational behavior of crowds Particularly prominent is the violent antisemitism of Hitler and his associates drawing among other sources on the fabricated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion which implied that Jews secretly conspired to rule the world This book was a key source of propaganda for the Nazis and helped fuel their common hatred against the Jews during World War II For example Hitler claimed that the international language Esperanto was part of a Jewish plot and makes arguments toward the old German nationalist ideas of Drang nach Osten and the necessity to gain Lebensraum living space eastwards especially in Russia Other books such as Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes Racial Science of the German People by Hans G nther and Rasse und Seele Race and Soul by Dr Ludwig Ferdinand Clau published under different titles between and attempt to identify and classify the differences between the German Nordic or Aryan type and other supposedly inferior peoples These books were used as texts in German schools during the Nazi era br The pre existing and popular genre of Schollen roman or novel of the soil also known as blood and soil novels was given a boost by the acceptability of its themes to the Nazis and developed a mysticism of unity br The immensely popular Red Indian stories by Karl May were permitted despite the heroic treatment of the hero Winnetou and coloured races instead the argument was made that the stories demonstrated the fall of the Red Indians was caused by a lack of racial consciousness to encourage it in the Germans Other fictional works were also adapted Heidi was stripped of its Christian elements and Robinson Crusoe s relationship to Friday was made a master slave one br Children s books also made their appearance In Julius Streicher published Der Giftpilz The Poisonous Mushroom a storybook that equated the Jewish people to poisonous mushrooms and aimed to educate children about the Jews The book was an example of antisemitic propaganda and stated that The following tales tell the truth about the Jewish poison mushroom They show the many shapes the Jew assumes They show the depravity and baseness of the Jewish race They show the Jew for what he really is The Devil in human form br br br Textbooks br Geopolitical atlases emphasised Nazi schemes demonstrating the encirclement of Germany depicting how the prolific Slav nations would cause the German people to be overrun and in contrast showing the relative population density of Germany was much higher than that of the Eastern regions where they would seek Lebensraum Textbooks would often show that the birth rate amongst Slavs was prolific compared to Germans Geography text books stated how crowded Germany had become Other charts would show the cost of disabled children as opposed to healthy ones or show how two child families threatened the birthrate Math books discussed military applications and used military word problems physics and chemistry concentrated on military applications and grammar classes were devoted to propaganda sentences Other textbooks dealt with the history of the Nazi Party Elementary school reading text included large amounts of propaganda Children were taught through textbooks that they were the Aryan master race Herrenvolk while the Jews were untrustworthy parasitic and Untermenschen subhumans Course content and textbooks unnecessarily included information that was propagandistic an attempt to sway the children s views from an early age br Maps showing the racial composition of Europe were banned from the classroom after many efforts that did not define the territory widely enough for party officials br Fairy tales were put to use with Cinderella being presented as a tale of how the prince s racial instincts lead him to reject the stepmother s alien blood present in her daughters for the racially pure maiden Nordic sagas were likewise presented as the illustration of the F hrerprinzip which was developed with such heroes as Frederick the Great and Otto von Bismarck br Literature was to be chosen within the German spirit rather than a fixed list of forbidden and required which made the teachers all the more cautious although Jewish authors were impossible for classrooms While only William Shakespeare s Macbeth and The Merchant of Venice were actually recommended none of the plays were actually forbidden even Hamlet denounced for flabbiness of soul br Biology texts however were put to the most use in presenting eugenic principles and racial theories this included explanations of the Nuremberg Laws which were claimed to allow the German and Jewish peoples to co exist without the danger of mixing Science was to be presented as the most natural area for introducing the Jewish Question once teachers took care to point out that in nature animals associated with those of their own species br Teachers guidelines on racial instruction presented both the handicapped and Jews as dangers Despite their many photographs glamorising the Nordic type the texts also claimed that visual inspection was insufficient and genealogical analysis was required to determine their types and report any hereditary problems However the National Socialist Teachers League NSLB stressed that at primary schools in particular they had to work on only the Nordic racial core of the German Volk again and again and contrast it with the racial composition of foreign populations and the Jews br br br Books in occupied countries br In occupied France the German Institute encouraged the translation of German works although chiefly German nationalists not ardent Nazis produced a massive increase in the sale of translated works The only books in English to be sold were English classics and books with Jewish authors or Jewish subject matter such as biographies were banned except for some scientific works Control of the paper supply allowed Germans the easy ability to pressure publishers about books br br br Comics br The Nazi controlled government in German occupied France produced the Vica comic book series during World War II as a propaganda tool against the Allied forces The Vica series authored by Vincent Krassousky represented Nazi influence and perspective in French society and included such titles as Vica Contre le service secret Anglais and Vica d fie l Oncle Sam br br br Films br br The Nazis produced many films to promote their views using the party s Department of Film for organising film propaganda An estimated million people attended film screenings put on by the NSDAP Reichsamtsleiter Karl Neumann declared that the goal of the Department of Film was not directly political in nature but was rather to influence the culture education and entertainment of the general population br On September a Department of Film was incorporated into the Chamber of Culture The department controlled the licensing of every film prior to its production Sometimes the government selected the actors for a film financed the production partially or totally and granted tax breaks to the producers Awards for valuable films would decrease taxes thus encouraging self censorship among movie makers br Under Goebbels and Hitler the German film industry became entirely nationalised The National Socialist Propaganda Directorate which Goebbels oversaw had at its disposal nearly all film agencies in Germany by Occasionally certain directors such as Wolfgang Liebeneiner were able to bypass Goebbels by providing him with a different version of the film than would be released Such films include those directed by Helmut K utner Romanze in Moll Romance in a Minor Key Gro e Freiheit Nr The Great Freedom No and Unter den Br cken Under the Bridges br Schools were also provided with motion picture projectors because the film was regarded as particularly appropriate for propagandising children Films specifically created for schools were termed military education br Triumph des Willens Triumph of the Will by film maker Leni Riefenstahl chronicled the Nazi Party Congress of in Nuremberg It followed an earlier film of the Nuremberg Rally produced by Riefenstahl Der Sieg des Glaubens Triumph of the Will features footage of uniformed party members though relatively few German soldiers who are marching and drilling to militaristic tunes The film contains excerpts from speeches given by various Nazi leaders at the Congress including Hitler Frank Capra used scenes from the film which he described partially as the ominous prelude of Hitler s holocaust of hate in many parts of the United States government s Why We Fight anti Axis seven film series to demonstrate what the personnel of the U S military would be facing in World War II and why the Axis had to be defeated br During three antisemitic films were shown The Rothschilds Jud S and Der ewige Jude br Der ewige Jude The Eternal Jew was directed by Fritz Hippler at the insistence of Goebbels though the writing is credited to Eberhard Taubert The movie is done in the style of a feature length documentary the central thesis being the immutable racial personality traits that characterise the Jew as a wandering cultural parasite Throughout the film these traits are contrasted to the Nazi state ideal while Aryan men find satisfaction in physical labour and the creation of value Jews only find pleasure in money and a hedonist lifestyle The movie is resolved with Hitler giving a speech hinting at the coming Final Solution his plan to exterminate millions of Jews One historian has noted that so radical was the film s antisemitism that the Propaganda Ministry had doubts about showing it to the public it was most successful amongst Party activists the general public was less impressed br The main medium was Die Deutsche Wochenschau a newsreel series produced for cinemas from Newsreels were explicitly intended to portray German interests as successful Themes often included the virtues of the Nordic or Aryan type German military and industrial strength and the evils of Germany s enemies br br br Fine art br br By Nazi standards fine art was not propaganda Its purpose was to create ideals for eternity This produced a call for heroic and romantic art which reflected the ideal rather than the realistic Explicitly political paintings were very rare Still more rare were antisemitic paintings because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane Nevertheless selected themes common in propaganda were the most common topics of art br Sculpture was used as an expression of Nazi racial theories The most common image was of the nude male expressing the ideal of the Aryan race Nudes were required to be physically perfect At the Paris Exposition of Josef Thorak s Comradeship stood outside the German pavilion depicting two enormous nude males clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side in a pose of defense and racial camaraderie br Landscape painting featured mostly heavily in the Greater German Art exhibition in accordance with themes of blood and soil Peasants were also popular images reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature frequently with large families With the advent of war war art came to be a significant though still not predominating proportion br The continuing of the German Art Exhibition throughout the war was put forth as a manifestation of German s culture br br br Magazines br In and after the Zeitschriften Dienst was sent to magazines to provide guidelines on what to write for appropriate topics Nazi publications also carried various forms of propaganda br Neues Volk was a monthly publication of the Office of Racial Policy which answered questions about acceptable race relations While mainly focused on race relations it also included articles about the strength and character of the Aryan race compared to Jews and other defectives br The NS Frauen Warte aimed at women included such topics as the role of women in the Nazi state Despite its propaganda elements it was predominantly a women s magazine It defended anti intellectualism urged women to have children even in wartime put forth what the Nazis had done for women discussed bridal schools and urged women to greater efforts in total war br Der Pimpf was aimed at boys and contained both adventure and propaganda br Das Deutsche M del in contrast recommended that girls take up hiking tending the wounded and preparing to care for children Far more than NS Frauen Warte it emphasised the strong and active German woman br br br Signal br br Signal was a propaganda magazine published by the Wehrmacht during World War II and distributed throughout occupied Europe and neutral countries Published from April to March Signal had the highest sales of any magazine published in Europe during the period circulation peaked at million in At various times it was published in at least twenty languages An English edition was distributed in the British Channel Islands of Guernsey Jersey Alderney and Sark which were occupied by the Wehrmacht during the war br The promoter of the magazine was the chief of the Wehrmacht propaganda office Colonel Hasso von Wedel Its annual budget was million Reichsmarks roughly million at the pre war exchange rate br The image that Signal transmitted was that of Nazi Germany and its New Order as the great benefactor of European peoples and of Western civilisation in general The danger of a Soviet invasion of Europe was strongly pointed out The quality of the magazine itself was quite high featuring complete reviews from the front lines rich in information and photos even displaying a double center page full color picture In fact many of the most famous Second World War photos that are seen today come from Signal The magazine contained little to no antisemitic propaganda as the contents were mainly military br br br Newspapers br The V lkischer Beobachter People s Observer was the official daily newspaper of the NSDAP since December It disseminated Nazi ideology in the form of brief hyperboles directed against the weakness of parliamentarism the evils of Jewry and Bolshevism the national humiliation of the Versailles Treaty and other such topics It was joined in by Der Angriff The Attack a weekly and later daily paper founded by Joseph Goebbels It was mainly dedicated to attacks against political opponents and Jews one of its most striking features were vehemently antisemitic cartoons by Hans Schweitzer but also engaged in the glorification of Nazi heroes such as Horst Wessel The Illustrierter Beobachter was their weekly illustrated paper br Other Nazi publications included br br Das Reich a more moderate and highbrow publication aimed at intellectuals and foreigners br Der St rmer the most virulently antisemitic of all br Das Schwarze Korps an SS publication aiming at a more intellectual tone br After Hitler s rise to power in all of the regular press came under complete Nazi editorial control through the policy of Gleichschaltung and short lived propaganda newspapers were also established in the conquered territories during World War II Alfred Rosenberg was a key member of the Nazi Party who gained control of their newspaper which was openly praised by Hitler However Hitler was dissatisfied by Rosenberg s work and slandered Rosenberg behind his back discrediting his work br br br Newspapers in occupied countries br In Ukraine after the Nazis cracked down on newspapers most papers printed only articles from German agencies producing the odd effect of more anti American and anti British articles than anti Communist ones They also printed articles about antecedents of German rule over Ukraine such as Catherine the Great and the Goths br In Norway during the s the newspaper Aftenposten was supportive of Nazi Germany and after Norway was occupied in the newspaper was used by the Germans to spread propaganda The editor was replaced by a member of Vidkun Quisling s government br br br Photography br br The Nazis used photographers to document events and promote ideology Photographers included Heinrich Hoffmann and Hugo Jaeger Hoffmann worked in his father s photographic shop and as a photographer in Munich from He joined the Nazi Party on April After Hitler took over the party in he named Hoffmann as his official photographer a post he held for over a quarter century A photograph taken by Hoffmann in Munich s Odeonsplatz on August shows a young Hitler among the crowds cheering the outbreak of World War I and was used in Nazi propaganda Hitler and Hoffmann became close friends in fact when Hitler became the ruler of Germany Hoffmann was the only man authorised to take official photographs of him Hoffmann s photographs were published as postage stamps postcards posters and picture books Following Hoffmann s suggestion both he and Hitler received royalties from all uses of Hitler s image even on postage stamps which made Hoffmann a millionaire In he was elected to the Reichstag and in Hitler appointed him a Professor br Nine photographs taken by Hoffman reveal how Hitler rehearsed poses and his hand gestures He asked Hoffmann to take pictures so that he could see how he looked while speaking Egon Hanfstaengl son of Hitler s one time foreign press officer Ernst Putzi Hanfstaengl said in a documentary Fatal Attraction of Hitler He had that ability which is needed to make people stop thinking critically and just emote br br br Posters br br Poster art was a mainstay of the Nazi propaganda effort aimed both at Germany itself and occupied territories It had several advantages The visual effect being striking would reach the viewer easily Posters were also unlike other forms of propaganda difficult to avoid br Imagery frequently drew on heroic realism Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally with lighting posed to produce grandeur In a symbolic nod to the military exploits of the Teutonic Knights in medieval times Nazi propaganda posters depicted German soldiers as knights in shining armor defending the German nation and Europe from the supposed threat of Bolshevist Jewry br Parole der Woche wall newspapers were published by the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda The first edition was distributed on March Every week an estimated posters were administered to the public from to Word of the Week posters were politically skewed and meant to rally public opinion in support of the Nazi efforts The posters set out to educate and unify the German people before and especially during World War II br The posters were placed in train cars buses platforms ticket windows anywhere there was dense traffic flow Very few individuals at the time owned a car most biked walked or used public transportation daily Exposure to the Word of the Week posters was high in German cities The messages and Nazi ideologies stared out at the mass public for a week at a time in tens of thousands of places German pedestrians were likely to pass in the course of a day br Jeffery Herf author of The Jewish Enemy Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust described the poster campaign as a combination of a newspaper editorial political leaflet political poster and tabloid journalism Hitler personally appointed artist Hans Schweitzer known as Mj lnir with the task of translating Nazi ideology into images for the wall newspaper The posters were centimeters high and centimeters wide The visual style of the posters was bold text and Nazi influenced colors it meant to capture the attention of the German passersby The text was big so that several people could read it at the same time and from a distance of a few feet br The majority of the posters were centred on Jews and the Allied countries of the United Kingdom the United States and the Soviet Union During the time period when antisemitic articles decreased in publications antisemitic rhetoric was ramped up in The Word of the Week posters From to about twenty five percent of The Word Of The Week posters included an attack on Jews The Jews were depicted as enemies because of their supposed economic war capitalism and connection to the Bolshevik revolution in Russia The Nazi regime fostered the idea that the Jews were the masterminds behind all oppositional political forces Images often showed a Jewish figure positioned behind or above symbols of economic and political influence Additionally it was also common to depict the Allied forces of Britain the U S and the USSR as overtaken by Jewry br Posters were also used in schools depicting for instance an institution for the feeble minded on one hand and houses on the other to inform the students that the annual cost of this institution would build homes for healthy families br br br Radio br br Before Hitler came to power he rarely used radio to connect with the public and when he did so non party newspapers were allowed to publish his speeches This changed soon after he came to power in Hitler s speeches became widely broadcast all over Germany especially on the radio itself introduced by the Ministry of Propaganda They were shown in weekly newsreels and reprinted in large editions in books and pamphlets all across Germany Hitler s speeches became so significant to the Nazis that even restaurants and pubs were expected to have their radios on whenever he was delivering one and in some cities public speakers were used so passersby could hear them The Nazis also sold cheap radios so that people could hear speeches at home These were called the People s Receivers and were sold for marks while cheaper versions were sold for marks Nazi propaganda emphasised and portrayed his speeches so that their main points appeared in weekly posters and were all over Germany by the hundreds of thousands br Nazi propaganda also used radio as an important tool to promote genocide br br br Internal broadcasts br Recognising the importance of radio in disseminating the Nazi message Goebbels approved a scheme whereby millions of cheap radio sets the Volksempf nger were subsidised by the government In the Radio as the Eighth Great Power speech Goebbels proclaimed br br It would not have been possible for us to take power or to use it in the ways we have without the radio It is no exaggeration to say that the German revolution at least in the form it took would have been impossible without the aeroplane and the radio Radio reached the entire nation regardless of class standing or religion That was primarily the result of the tight centralisation the strong reporting and the up to date nature of the German radio Above all it is necessary to clearly centralise all radio activities to place spiritual tasks ahead of technical ones to provide a clear worldview br By the start of the Second World War over of German households had one of these radios which were deliberately limited in range in order to prevent loyal citizens from considering other viewpoints in foreign broadcasts Radio broadcasts were also played over loudspeakers in public places and workplaces br In private homes however people could easily turn off the radio when bored and did so once the novelty of hearing the voice from a box wore off this caused the Nazis to introduce many non propaganda elements such as music advice and tips serials and other entertainment This was accelerated during the war to prevent people from tuning in enemy propaganda broadcasts though Goebbels claimed in his Das Reich article that it was to make the radio a good companion to the people he admitted the truth in his diary br br br External broadcasts br br As well as domestic broadcasts the Nazi regime used radio to deliver its message to both occupied territories and enemy states One of the main targets was the United Kingdom to which William Joyce broadcast regularly gaining the nickname Lord Haw Haw Joyce first appeared on German radio on September reading the news in English but soon became noted for his often mischievous propaganda broadcasts Joyce was executed for treason in Although Joyce was the most notorious and most regularly heard of British propagandists other broadcasters included Norman Baillie Stewart Jersey born teacher Pearl Vardon British Union of Fascists members Leonard Banning and Susan Hilton Barry Payne Jones of The Link and Alexander Fraser Grant whose show was aimed specifically at Scotland also broadcasting through the New British Broadcasting Service br Broadcasts were also made to the United States notably by Robert Henry Best and Axis Sally Mildred Gillars Best a freelance journalist based in Vienna was initially arrested following the German declaration of war on the U S but soon became a feature on propaganda radio attacking the influence of Jews in the U S and the leadership of Franklin D Roosevelt who succeeded Winston Churchill in Nazi propaganda as World Enemy Number One Best was later sentenced to life imprisonment for treason and died in prison in Gillars a teacher in Germany mostly broadcast on similar themes as well as peppering her speech with allegations of infidelity against the wives of servicemen Her most notorious broadcast was the Vision of Invasion radio play broadcast immediately prior to D Day from the perspective of an American mother who dreamed that her soldier son died violently in Normandy br France also received broadcasts from Radio Stuttgart where Paul Ferdonnet an antisemitic journalist was the main voice during the Phoney War Following the occupation Radio Paris and Radio Vichy became the main organs of propaganda with leading far right figures such as Jacques Doriot Philippe Henriot and Jean H rold Paquis regularly speaking in support of the Nazis Others who broadcast included Gerald Hewitt a British citizen who lived most of his life in Paris and had been associated with Action Fran aise br Domestic broadcasters were also used to galvanise support for occupation in Belgium where Ward Hermans regularly spoke in support of the Nazis from his base in Bremen and the Italian Social Republic to where Giovanni Preziosi broadcast a vehemently antisemitic show from his base in Munich Pro Nazi radio broadcasts in the Arabic language aired in North Africa crafted with the help of Mohammad Amin al Husayni and other Arab exiles in Berlin to highlight Arab nationalism They recast Nazi racist ideology to target Jews alone not all Semites Downplaying Mussolini s operations in Africa they touted the anti colonialism of the Axis Powers br br br Speakers br The Nazi Party relied heavily on speakers to make its propaganda presentations most heavily before they came to power but also afterwards In Mein Kampf Hitler recounted that he had realised that it was not written matter but the spoken word that brought about changes as people would not read things that they disagreed with but would linger to hear a speaker Furthermore speakers having their audiences before them could see their reactions and adjust accordingly to persuade His own oratory was a major factor in his rise and he despised those who came to read pre written speeches br Such speakers were particularly important when the information put across was not desired to reach foreigners who could access the mass media Schools were instituted to substitute for the political conflict that had formed the old speakers In Walter Tiessler speaking of his own experience as an early speaker urged that they continue br Sturmabteilung speakers were used though their reliance on instinct sometimes offended well educated audiences but their blunt and folksy manner often had its own appeal br The ministry would provide such speakers with information such as how to spin the problems on the eastern front or how to discuss the cuts in food rations The party propaganda headquarters sent the Redner Schnellinformation Speakers Express Information out with guidelines for immediate campaigns such as antisemitic campaigns and what information to present br Specific groups were targeted with such speakers Speakers for instance were created specifically for Hitler Youth These would among other things lecture Hitler Youth members and the BDM on the need to produce more children br Speakers often addressed political or military rallies which were well orchestrated events with banners and marching bands br br br Historiography br Nazi propaganda is a relatively recent topic of close study Historians of all persuasions including Eastern Bloc writers agree about its remarkable effectiveness Their assessment of its significance however whether it shaped or merely directed and exploited public opinion is influenced by their approach to wider questions raised by the study of Nazi Germany such as the question of whether the Nazi state was a fully totalitarian dictatorship as argued by Hannah Arendt or whether it also depended on a certain societal consensus br In addition to media archives an important primary source for the study of the Nazi propaganda effort are the reports on civilian morale and public opinion that the Sicherheitsdienst and later the RMVP compiled from on Another are the Deutschland Berichte reports gathered by underground agents of the Sopade that particularly dealt with German popular opinion br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br Bytwerk Randall The Argument for Genocide in Nazi Propaganda
