id: 46188299
Propaganda is a form of communication that aims to shape people s beliefs actions and behaviours It is typically not impartial It is often biased misleading or even false to promote a specific agenda or perspective Propagandists use various techniques to manipulate people s opinions including selective presentation of facts the omission of relevant information and the use of emotionally charged language br Propaganda can take many forms including political speeches advertisements news reports and social media posts Its goal is usually to influence people s attitudes and behaviors either by promoting a particular ideology or by persuading them to take a specific action The term propaganda has acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples br br br Pre modern precedents br br Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists The Behistun Inscription c BC detailing the rise of Darius I to the Persian throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda The Arthashastra written by Chanakya c BC a professor of political science at Takshashila University and a prime minister of the Maurya Empire in ancient India discusses propaganda in detail such as how to spread propaganda and how to apply it in warfare His student Chandragupta Maurya c BC founder of the Maurya Empire employed these methods during his rise to power The best known originator of Roman historiography was Quintus Fabius Pictor rd century BCE His style of writing history defending the Roman state actions and using propaganda heavily eventually became a defining characteristic of Roman historiography Another example of early propaganda is the th century work The War of the Irish with the Foreigners written by the D l gCais to portray themselves as legitimate rulers of Ireland br br Propaganda during the Reformation helped by the spread of the printing press throughout Europe and in particular within Germany caused new ideas thoughts and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the th century The printing press was invented in approximately and quickly spread to other major cities around Europe by the time the Reformation was underway in there were printing centres in over of the major European cities These centres became the primary producers of both Reformation works by the Protestant Reformers and anti Reformation works put forth by the Roman Catholics br During the U S s Colonial period religious writers and trading companies circulated glowing tracts urging settlement in the Americas but often left out the risk and perils During the era of the American Revolution the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers which specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists The most famous single publication was Common Sense a pamphlet by Thomas Paine that played a major role in articulating the demand for independence On occasion outright disinformation was used as when Benjamin Franklin circulated false stories of atrocities committed by the Seneca Indians in league with the British Later The Federalist Papers were written under pseudonyms by three framers of the Constitution in order to influence public support for ratification br In the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars both sides made heavy use of it during military campaigns with media literate For instance Secretary of War Henry Dundas and Secretary at War William Windham funded writers to promote English interests In France the Girondists distributed broadsheets among enemy troops offering them rewards for desertion Napoleon cultivated his own image through the use of propaganda and excelled at garnering public support and capitalizing on his victories br br br th century br Propaganda as generally understood is a modern phenomenon that emerged from the creation of literate and politically active societies informed by a mass media where governments increasingly saw the necessity for swaying public opinion in favour of its policies br The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras produced some of the earliest propaganda of the Modern Period br A notable example was perhaps during the Indian Rebellion of where Indian sepoys rebelled against the British East India Company s rule in India Incidents of rape committed by Indian rebels against English women or girls were exaggerated to great effect by the British media to justify continued British colonialism in the Indian subcontinent At the time British newspapers had printed various accounts about English women and girls being raped by the Indian rebels It was later found that some of these accounts were false stories created to perpetuate the common stereotypes of the native people of India as savages who need to be civilised by British colonialists a mission sometimes known as The White Man s Burden One such account published by The Times regarding an incident where English girls as young as were supposedly raped by the Indian rebels in Delhi was criticised as a false propaganda story by Karl Marx who pointed out that the story was reported by a clergyman in Bangalore far from the events of the rebellion br In the U S prior to the Civil War slavery proponents and abolitionists both disseminated their ideas through literature and lobbying Early anti slavery periodicals included Anti Slavery Reporter and Freedom s Journal the last attacking the return to Africa colonization programs favored by many prominent politicians Activists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Dwight Weld were very effective in anti slavery societies writings in winning over public opinion On the pro slavery side the Ostend Manifesto October made a case for acquiring Cuba as a slave state as a way of getting around the Missouri Compromise In the wake of Dred Scott v Sandford several books were written to bolster the decision For instance George Fitzhugh s Cannibals All or Slaves Without Masters argued that the master slave relationship was better than wage slavery under capitalist exploitation Another Frederick A Ross s Slavery Ordained of God used divine will to justify slavery and controversially equated slavery to the treatment of women i e both slaves and women are children Lastly came Augusta Jane Evans Wilson s Macaria or Altars of Sacrifice popular in the North and South persuasively defended Confederate policy and predicted horrible consequences if the slaves were freed br In the late th and early th centuries propaganda techniques became more refined and effective due to on the one hand the growth of new communication technologies e g underseas cables wireless radio silent motion pictures and on the other the development of modern advertising and public relations Gabriel Tarde s Laws of Imitation and Gustave Le Bon s The Crowd A Study of the Popular Mind were two of the first codifications of propaganda techniques which influenced many writers afterward including Sigmund Freud Hitler s Mein Kampf is heavily influenced by Le Bon s theories br br br First World War br br The first large scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of war in In the war s initial stages propaganda output was greatly increased by the British and German governments to persuade their populace in the justness of their cause to encourage voluntary recruitment and above all to demonise the enemy Heavy use was made of posters as well as the new medium of film br br br Germany br At the start of the war Germany expanded its unofficial propaganda machinery establishing the Central Office for Foreign Services which among other duties was tasked with propaganda distribution to neutral nations persuading them to either side with Germany or to maintain their stance of neutrality After the declaration of war Britain immediately cut the undersea communications cables that connected Germany to the outside world thereby cutting off a major propaganda outlet The Germans relied instead on the powerful wireless Nauen Transmitter Station to broadcast pro German news reports to the world Among other techniques used to keep up the morale of the troops mobile cinemas were regularly dispatched to the front line for the entertainment of the troops Newsreels would portray current events with a pro German slant German propaganda techniques heavily relied on emphasising the mythological and martial nature of the Germanic Volk and the inevitability of its triumph br Germany published several newspapers and magazines for the occupied areas The Gazette des Ardennes was designed for French readers in Belgium and France Francophone prisoners of war and generally as a propaganda vehicle in neutral and even enemy countries Editor Fritz H Schnitzer had a relatively free hand and he tried to enhance his credibility by factual information He realized until the closing days of the war that it was necessary to produce an increasingly optimistic report to hide the weakening position of the Central Powers in the summer and fall of br The British made a careful analysis of the German propaganda campaigns In terms of content the official propaganda had multiple themes br A It proclaimed that German victory was a certainty br B It explained Germany was fighting a war of defence br C Enemy atrocities in were denounced including its starvation plan for German civilians use of dum dum bullets and the use of black soldiers br D The rhetoric exalted Germany s historic mission to promote high culture and true civilization celebrating the slogan work order duty over the enemy s liberty equality fraternity br E It explained that German victory would benefit all of mankind freeing the seas for all nations and enabling the downtrodden colonies of the Allies to liberate themselves br F Germany needed to land to expand as an outlet for its surplus population talent organizing ability financial capital and manufacturing output br G The riches of the world especially raw materials controlled by the British and the French must be disgorged by the enemy to the benefit of Germany br The propaganda designed for the home market included points A through G Propaganda directed at neutral opinion downplayed D and F and left out theme G The Germans realized they needed to appeal to vocal supporters in countries allied with the Central Powers especially Austria Bulgaria and Turkey They put special emphasis on the Muslim world using Turkey as their leverage Much of the propaganda was oriented toward minorities in the Allied countries as they tried to stir up Muslims in India and Russia and ethnic groups in Eastern Europe especially the Poles In prioritizing the goal of destabilizing the enemy Berlin realized that it was often counterproductive to promote German glories Other elements that were hostile or indifferent to Germany especially among the far left and the Muslims could best be reached through their own spokesman Hence large sums upwards of nine tons of gold were given the Bolsheviks to spread their own anti tsarist propaganda br br br Britain br br British propaganda during World War I called an impressive exercise in improvisation was hastily expanded at the beginning of the war and was rapidly brought under government control as the War Propaganda Bureau Wellington House under the overall leadership of journalist Charles Masterman The Bureau began its propaganda campaign on September when Masterman invited leading British authors to Wellington House to discuss ways of best promoting Britain s interests during the war Those who attended included William Archer Arthur Conan Doyle Arnold Bennett John Masefield Ford Madox Ford G K Chesterton Henry Newbolt John Galsworthy Thomas Hardy Rudyard Kipling Gilbert Parker G M Trevelyan and H G Wells Several of the writers agreed to write pamphlets and books that would promote the government s point of view these were printed and published by such well known publishers as Hodder Stoughton Methuen Oxford University Press John Murray Macmillan and Thomas Nelson br br After January the Bureau s activities were subsumed under the office of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs In May Masterman began recruiting artists including Muirhead Bone Francis Dodd Eric Kennington and others to paint pictures of the war in France and the home front In early it was decided that a senior government figure should take over responsibility for propaganda and on March Lord Beaverbrook owner of the Daily Express newspaper was made Minister of Information The British effort soon far surpassed the German in its quality and ability to sway the public mood both at home and abroad br A variety of propaganda methods were used by the British during the war with emphasis on the need for credibility Written forms of distributed propaganda included books pamphlets official publications ministerial speeches or royal messages They were targeted at influential individuals such as journalists and politicians rather than a mass audience Pamphlets were distributed to various foreign countries primarily the United States these pamphlets were academic in tone and factual in nature distributed through unofficial channels By million copies had been circulated by Wellington House in various languages br British propagandists also sought to influence the foreign press by providing it with information through the Neutral Press Committee and the Foreign Office Special telegraph agencies were established in various European cities including Bucharest Bilbao and Amsterdam in order to facilitate the spread of information br Recruitment was a central theme of domestic propaganda until the introduction of conscription in January The most common theme for recruitment posters was patriotism which evolved into appeals for people to do their fair share Among the most famous of the posters used in the British Army recruitment campaign of World War I were the Lord Kitchener Wants You posters which depicted Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener above the words WANTS YOU br One major propaganda avenue was the use of atrocity stories These aimed to mobilise hatred of the German enemy by spreading details of their atrocities real or alleged and was used extensively by Britain reaching a peak in with much of the atrocities related to Germany s invasion of Belgium One of the first significant publications to be produced by the Bureau was the Report on Alleged German Outrages in early This pamphlet documented atrocities both actual and alleged committed by the German army against Belgian civilians Other atrocity stories included the fate of the nurse Edith Cavell and the Sinking of the RMS Lusitania These had a significant impact both in Britain and in America making front page headlines in major newspapers br br br United States br Before the United States declared war in the Woodrow Wilson administration established a propaganda department along similar lines Propaganda experts Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays participated in the Committee on Public Information CPI which was tasked with swaying popular opinion to encourage enlistment and war bond sales The CPI deployed posters films and provided themes for speeches by four minute men at public functions and also encouraged censorship of the American press The American press played an unwitting role too by relying on daily war news cables controlled by the British government and by spreading false stories of German atrocities in Belgium and German occupied eastern France supplied by the British as well Starting after World War I propaganda had a growing negative connotation This was due in part to the book How We Advertised America the First Telling of the Amazing Story of the Committee on Public Information that Carried the Gospel of Americanism to Every Corner of the Globe in which the impact of the CPI and the power of propaganda was overemphasised Also exposure of fact that the atrocity stories were false created public distrust The CPI was so unpopular that after the war Congress closed it down without providing funding to organise and archive its papers br The war propaganda campaign of the CPI produced within six months such an intense anti German hysteria as to permanently impress American business and Adolf Hitler among others with the potential of large scale propaganda to control public opinion br The use of film by the U S Signal Corps and the Committee on Public Information during World War features in the documentary Mobilizing Movies br br br Russian Revolution br br br White propaganda br The Protocols of the Elders of Zion a fraudulent anti Semitic conspiracy text was first printed in a Black Hundreds newspaper shortly before the Revolution of It became widely circulated as an explanation for the uprisings As the October Revolution unfolded causing White movement affiliated Russians to flee to the West The Protocols was carried along with them and assumed a new purpose Until then The Protocols had remained obscure it now became an instrument for blaming Jews for the Russian Revolution It was a directly political weapon used against the Bolsheviks who were depicted as overwhelmingly Jewish allegedly executing the Judeo Bolshevist plan embodied in The Protocols The purpose was to discredit communism prevent the West from recognizing the Soviet Union and bring about the downfall of Vladimir Lenin s regime br br br Red propaganda br Russian revolutionaries of the th and th centuries distinguished two different aspects covered by the English term propaganda Their terminology included two terms Russian agitatsiya or agitation and Russian or propaganda see agitprop agitprop is not however limited to the Soviet Union as it was considered before the October Revolution to be one of the fundamental activities of any Marxist activist this importance of agit prop in Marxist theory may also be observed today in Trotskyist circles who insist on the importance of leaflet distribution br Soviet propaganda meant dissemination of revolutionary ideas teachings of Marxism and theoretical and practical knowledge of Marxist economics while agitation meant forming favourable public opinion and stirring up political unrest These activities did not carry negative connotations as they usually do in English and were encouraged Expanding dimensions of state propaganda the Bolsheviks actively used transportation such as trains aircraft and other means br Joseph Stalin s regime built the largest fixed wing aircraft of the s Tupolev ANT exclusively for this purpose Named after the famous Soviet writer Maxim Gorky who had recently returned from fascist Italy it was equipped with a powerful radio set called Voice from the sky printing and leaflet dropping machinery radio stations photographic laboratory film projector with sound for showing movies in flight library etc The aircraft could be disassembled and transported by railroad if needed The giant aircraft set a number of world records br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Post war br Before and during World War I the clergyman Gerald Lee wrote about news engineering as a means of social control and his second cousin Ivy Lee applied this perspective to his work as a publicist After the war propaganda experts returning from national service brought similar perspectives to the study and practice of publicity helping shape it into the field of public relations br Edward Bernays s CPI service ended with the dissolution of the American Press Mission to the Paris Peace Conference Shortly after Bernays returned to the US an old CPI colleague offered him civilian work as a freelance publicist for the Lithuanian National Council In Bernays founded what he called a publicity direction firm hiring fellow publicist and former journalist Doris Fleischman as his first employee Bernays and Fleischman brought a scientific management approach to publicity They described their work as the engineering of consent seeking to understand and influence the group mind through the application of social science and psychology In his book Crystallizing Public Opinion Bernays coined the term public relations counsel for the services that he and Fleischman provided He later wrote br br The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country br We are governed our minds are molded our tastes formed our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organised Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society br Walter Lippmann returning from his post as an army propagandist became a strong critic of the CPI In the early s he explored the role of journalism and propaganda in democratic societies in his books Liberty and the News Public Opinion and The Phantom Public br The documentary film Century of the Self by Adam Curtis explores the influence of these ideas on public relations and politics throughout the th century br According to Alex Carey one distinctive feature of the th century was the professionalising and institutionalising of propaganda as it became an increasingly prominent sophisticated and self conscious tactic of both government and business br br br Nazi Germany br br After the defeat of Germany in the First World War military officials such as Erich Ludendorff suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat Adolf Hitler came to echo this view believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in see also Dolchsto legende Later the Nazis adapted many British propaganda techniques during their time in power Most propaganda in Germany was produced by the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda Joseph Goebbels was placed in charge of this ministry shortly after Hitler took power in All journalists writers and artists were required to register with one of the Ministry s subordinate chambers for the press fine arts music theatre film literature or radio br Hitler met nearly every day with Goebbels to discuss the news and Goebbels would obtain Hitler s thoughts on the subject Goebbels then met with senior Ministry officials to pass down the official Party line on world events Broadcasters and journalists required prior approval before their works were disseminated Along with posters the Nazis produced a number of films and books to spread their beliefs br On March The Third Reich established a Ministry of Propaganda appointing Joseph Goebbels as its Minister Goals were to establish external enemies countries that allegedly inflicted the Treaty of Versailles on Germany by territorial claims and ethnocentrism and internal enemies such as Jews Romani homosexuals Bolsheviks and topics like degenerate art br A major political and ideological cornerstone of Nazi policy was the unification of all ethnic Germans living outside of the Reich s borders under one Greater Germany e g Austria and Czechoslovakia In Mein Kampf Hitler made a direct remark to those outside of Germany He stated that pain and misery were being forced upon ethnic Germans outside of Germany and that they dream of common fatherland He finished by stating they needed to fight for one s nationality Throughout Mein Kampf he pushed Germans worldwide to make the struggle for political power and independence their main focus Nazi propaganda used the Heim ins Reich policy for this which began in br For months prior to the beginning of World War II in German newspapers and leaders had carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland On August Adolf Hitler told his generals br br I will provide a propagandistic casus belli Its credibility doesn t matter The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth br The main part of this propaganda campaign was the false flag project Operation Himmler which was designed to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany which was subsequently used to justify the invasion of Poland br br br Nuremberg Laws br In racist laws in Nazi Germany were introduced known as the Nuremberg Laws the laws forbade non Aryans and political opponents of the Nazis from the civil service and any sexual relations and marriage between people classified as Aryan and non Aryan Jews Gypsies blacks was prohibited as Rassenschande or race defilement The Nuremberg Laws were based on notions of racial purity and sought to preserve the Aryan race who were at the top of the Nazi racial hierarchy and were said to be the ubermenschen herrenvolk master race and to teach the German nation to view the Jews as subhumans br Hitler and Nazi propagandists played on the anti Semitism and resentment present in Germany The Jews were blamed for things such as robbing the German people of their hard work while themselves avoiding physical labour Der St rmer a Nazi propaganda newspaper told Germans that Jews kidnapped small children before Passover because Jews need the blood of a Christian child maybe to mix in with their Matzah Posters films cartoons and fliers were seen throughout Germany which attacked the Jewish community One of the most infamous such films was The Eternal Jew directed by Fritz Hippler br br br Political opponents br Soon after the takeover of power in Nazi concentration camps were established for political opponents The first people that were sent to the camps were Communists They were sent because of their ties with the Soviet Union and because Nazism greatly opposed Communism br br br France in the s br France a democratic society in the s but the people were kept in the dark about critical issues of foreign policy The government tightly controlled all of the media to promulgate propaganda to support the government s foreign policy of appeasement to the aggressions of Italy and especially Nazi Germany There were daily newspapers all owned separately The five major national papers based in Paris were all under the control of special interests especially right wing political and business interests that supported appeasement They were all venal taking large secret subsidies to promote the policies of various special interests Many leading journalists were secretly on the government payroll The regional and local newspapers were heavily dependent on government advertising and published news and editorials to suit Paris Most of the international news was distributed through the Havas agency which was largely controlled by the government Radio was a potentially powerful new medium but France was quite laggard in consumer ownership of radio sets and the government impose very strict controls After stations were allowed only three brief daily bulletins of seven minutes each to cover all the day s news The Prime Minister s office closely supervised the news items that were to be broadcast Newsreels were tightly censored they were told to feature none controversial but glamorous entertainers film premieres sporting events high fashion new automobiles an official ceremonies Motion pictures likely likewise were censored and were encouraged to reinforce stereotypes to the effect that the French were always lovers of liberty and justice contending against cruel and barbarous Germans The government subsidized films that glorified military virtues and the French Empire The goal was to tranquilize public opinion to give it little or nothing to work with so as not to interfere with the policies of the national government When serious crises emerged such as the Munich crisis of people were puzzled and mystified by what was going on When war came in Frenchman had little understanding of the issues and little correct information They suspiciously distrusted the government with the result that French morale in the face of the war with Germany was badly prepared br br br Second World War br br World War II saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war building on the experience of WW both by Hitler s propagandist Joseph Goebbels and the British Political Warfare Executive as well as the United States Office of War Information OWI br Propaganda was an important instrument for Nazi party in acquiring and maintaining power legitimizing their own authority demoralizing enemies and spreading Nazi ideology Before Germany s halt in early German propaganda actively hid the truth about war crimes and atrocities made in the German occupied Europe the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda RMVP used propaganda to emphasize the humanity that had been shown to the people by the German forces br Within the US the British Security Coordination activities worked to counter pro German sentiment and isolationist opinion Because of public distrust following the revelation of false atrocity stories during WW and the heavy association of propaganda with the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany the U S government referred to its own propaganda effort as a strategy of truth this time using as its main method newsreels and an information format Enlisting the cooperation of the news media industry and Hollywood the OWI portrayed the war as a contest against democracy and dictatorship good and evil While the OWI focused on the home front the Allies and neutral countries the military and the Office of Strategic Services OSS engaged in psychological warfare by directing propaganda against the Axis powers br The British broadcast black propaganda through fake German language radio stations to Europe It was disguised to sound like legitimate German radio broadcasts but it had a negative twist designed to undermine German morale The Germans undertook a similar program The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda used English language broadcasts such as Germany Calling broadcast to the UK Presenter William Joyce a British fascist gained the nickname Lord Haw Haw from the popular press br In the US animation became popular especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U S war effort e g Der Fuehrer s Face which ridicules Hitler and advocates the value of freedom Some American war films in the early s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the Axis Powers Others were intended to help Americans understand their Allies in general as in films like Know Your Ally Britain and Our Greek Allies Apart from its war films Hollywood did its part to boost American morale in a film intended to show how stars of stage and screen who remained on the home front were doing their part not just in their labors but also in their understanding that a variety of peoples worked together against the Axis menace Stage Door Canteen features one segment meant to dispel Americans mistrust of the Soviets and another to dispel their bigotry against the Chinese br br br Cold War propaganda br br During the Cold War propaganda became highly ideological rather than tactical and the rivalry among the United States Soviet Union and People s Republic of China generated the most pervasive and intense propaganda seen thus far br All sides used film television and radio programming to influence their own citizens each other and Third World nations The United States Information Agency operated the Voice of America as an official government station Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty which were in part supported by the Central Intelligence Agency provided grey propaganda in news and entertainment programs to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union respectively The Soviet Union s official government station Radio Moscow broadcast white propaganda while Radio Peace and Freedom broadcast grey propaganda Both sides also broadcast black propaganda programs in periods of special crises br In the United Kingdom s Foreign Office created the IRD Information Research Department which took over from wartime and slightly post war departments such as the Ministry of Information and dispensed propaganda via various media such as the BBC and publishing br Its main targets were in the Third World However it was also set out to be of use to British media and opinion formers As well as supplying material to the BBC World Service secret lists were compiled of approved journalists and trade unionists to whom material was offered if not always accepted br Possibly its most notorious project was the joint operation with the CIA to set up Encounter magazine edited by Stephen Spender from to Spender resigned after it emerged that the Congress for Cultural Freedom which published the magazine was being covertly funded by the CIA br The ideological and border dispute between the Soviet Union and People s Republic of China resulted in a number of cross border operations One technique developed during this period was the backwards transmission in which the radio program was recorded and played backwards over the air This was done so that messages meant to be received by the other government could be heard while the average listener could not understand the content of the program br When describing life in capitalist countries in the US in particular propaganda focused on social issues such as poverty and anti union action by the government Workers in capitalist countries were portrayed as ideologically close Propaganda claimed rich people from the US derived their income from weapons manufacturing and claimed that there was substantial racism or neo fascism in the US br When describing life in Communist countries western propaganda sought to depict an image of a citizenry held captive by governments that brainwash them The West also created a fear of the East by depicting an aggressive Soviet Union In the Americas Cuba served as a major source and a target of propaganda from both black and white stations operated by the CIA and Cuban exile groups Radio Habana Cuba in turn broadcast original programming relayed Radio Moscow and broadcast The Voice of Vietnam as well as alleged confessions from the crew of the USS Pueblo br George Orwell s novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda Though not set in the Soviet Union these books are about totalitarian regimes that constantly corrupt language for political purposes These novels were ironically used for explicit propaganda The CIA for example secretly commissioned an animated film adaptation of Animal Farm in the s with small changes to the original story to suit its own needs br During the Cuban Revolution in Fidel Castro stressed the importance of propaganda in his struggle both against Fulgencio Batista and the United States saying Propaganda is the heart of our struggle We must never abandon propaganda br br br Vietnam War br br br Pro South br From the beginning of its involvement in Vietnam the United States government engaged in covert psychological operations Thomas Anthony Dooley III a medical intelligence recruit became the public face of Operation Passage to Freedom a refugee program secretly designed by CIA officer Edward Lansdale The refugee surge from North to South appeared spontaneous to the American public but was partly engineered by Lansdale s hoax threats of dropping nuclear bombs on Hanoi Although celebrated for independent humanitarian activities after his death the public learned that Thomas Dooley had been recruited as an intelligence operative by the Central Intelligence Agency and numerous descriptions of atrocities by the Viet Minh in his book Deliver Us From Evil had been fabricated Dooley later did similar propaganda work in Laos br br Lansdale went on to run black propaganda operations out of Saigon in collaboration with dictator Ngo Diem The CIA s forged Communist pamphlets were so convincing they even fooled some of the Viet Minh and US journalist Joseph Alsop reported Lansdale s disinformation as fact The agency also manipulated astrology reports in the North in order to negatively effect the morale of the population br br br Pro North br Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the Vietnam War as means of controlling people s opinions Radio stations like Radio Hanoi were an integral part of North Vietnamese propaganda operations Communist Vietnamese politician Mai Chi Tho commenting on the use of propaganda stated Ho Chi Minh may have been an evil man Nixon may have been a great man The Americans may have had the just cause we may not have had the just cause But we won and the Americans were defeated because we convinced the people that Ho Chi Minh is the great man that Nixon is a murderer and the Americans are the invaders The key factor is how to control people and their opinions Only Marxism Leninism can do that br br br U S home front br On the U S home front information was tightly controlled and the government maintained an upbeat official line about the conduct of the War However during the Nixon administration revelations from the Pentagon Papers and about the My Lai Massacre and the war s expansion into Cambodia and Laos exposed the government s secrecy and manipulation of information This led to a credibility gap when much evidence contradicted the upbeat official line By more than of those polled thought the U S military involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake br br br Yugoslav Wars br br During the Yugoslav Wars propaganda was used as a military strategy by governments of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Most sides used Hit Songs to sway the public to their side br Propaganda was used to incite fear and hatred and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities Bosniaks Croats Albanians and other non Serbs Serb media made a great effort in justifying revising or denying mass war crimes committed by Serb forces during these wars br According to the ICTY verdicts against Serb political and military leaders during the Bosnian war the propaganda was a part of the Strategic Plan by Serb leadership aimed at linking Serb populated areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina together gaining control over these areas and creating a sovereign Serb nation state from which most non Serbs would be permanently removed The Serb leadership was aware that the Strategic Plan could only be implemented by the use of force and fear thus by the commission of war crimes br Croats also used propaganda against Serbs throughout and against Bosniaks during the Croat Bosniak War which was part of the larger Bosnian War During La va Valley ethnic cleansing Croat forces seized the television broadcasting stations for example at Skradno and created its own local radio and television to carry propaganda They also seized the public institutions raised the Croatian flag over public institution buildings and imposed the Croatian Dinar as the unit of currency During this time Busova a s Bosniaks were forced to sign an act of allegiance to the Croat authorities fell victim to numerous attacks on shops and businesses and gradually left the area out of fear that they would be the victims of mass crimes According to ICTY Trial Chambers in Bla ki case Croat authorities created a radio station in Kiseljak to broadcast nationalist propaganda A similar pattern was applied in Mostar and Gornji Vakuf where Croats created a radio station called Radio Uskoplje Local propaganda efforts in parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by the Croats were supported by Croatian daily newspapers such as Ve ernji list and Croatian Radiotelevision especially by controversial reporters Dijana uljak and Smiljko agolj who are still blamed by the families of Bosniak victims in Vranica case for inciting massacre of Bosnian POWs in Mostar when broadcasting a report about alleged terrorists arrested by Croats who victimised Croat civilians The bodies of Bosnian POWs were later found in Goranci mass grave Croatian Radiotelevision presented Croat attack on Mostar as a Bosnian Muslim attack on Croats in alliance with the Serbs According to ICTY in the early hours of May the Croatian Defence Council HVO attacked Mostar using artillery mortars heavy weapons and small arms The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows The HVO attack had been well prepared and planned br During the ICTY trials against Croat war leaders many Croatian journalists participated as defence witnesses trying to relativise war crimes committed by Croatian troops against non Croat civilians Bosniaks in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbs in Croatia During the trial against general Tihomir Bla ki later convicted of war crimes Ivica Mlivon i Croatian columnist in Slobodna Dalmacija tried to defend general Bla ki presenting claims in his book Zlo in s pe atom about alleged genocide against Croats most of it unproven or false which were considered by the Trial Chambers as irrelevant for the case After the conviction he continued to write in Slobodna Dalmacija against the ICTY presenting it as the court against Croats with chauvinistic claims that the ICTY cannot be unbiased because it is financed by Saudi Arabia Muslims br br br Propaganda films br At the turn of the th century films emerged as the new cultural agents depicting events and showing foreign images to mass audiences in European and American cities Politics and film began to intertwine with the reconstruction of the Boer War for a film audience and recordings of war in the Balkans The new medium proved very useful for political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy They also provided a forceful voice for independent critics of contemporary events br The earliest known propaganda film was a series of short silent films made during the Spanish American War in created by Vitagraph Studios br At an epic minute running time the Romanian Independen a Rom niei is the first fictional film in the world with a deliberate propagandistic message Filmed with a budget that would not be reached by a Romanian movie until Michael the Brave supported by the Romanian communist regime also for propagandistic purposes the movie was meant to shift the perception of the Romanian public towards an acceptance of Romanian involvement into an expected Balkan conflict the First Balkan War br Another of the early fictional films to be used for propaganda was The Birth of a Nation br br br World War I br br Film was still relatively new to urban audiences with the outbreak of hostilities in Governments use of film as propaganda reflected this The British and Americans initial struggles in the official use of film led to eventual success in their use of the medium The Germans were off to a faster start in recognising film s value as a tool of perpetuating pro German sentiment in the US through The American Correspondent Film Company as well as on the front lines with their mobile cinemas which showed feature films and newsreels br Though the Allied governments were slow to use film as a medium for conveying a desired position and set of beliefs individuals such as Charlie Chaplin were considerably more successful with The Bond and Zepped br br br Interwar period br br In the years following the October Revolution of the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films The development of Russian cinema in the s by such filmmakers as Dziga Vertov and Sergei Eisenstein saw considerable progress in the use of the motion picture as a propaganda tool yet it also served to develop the art of moviemaking Eisenstein s films in particular s The Battleship Potemkin are seen as masterworks of the cinema even as they glorify Eisenstein s Communist ideals In depicting the Russian Revolution Potemkin sought to create a new history for Russia one led and triumphed over by the formerly oppressed masses Eisenstein was heavily influenced by the ideology of the Bolshevik revolution which results in it providing better insight into the mindset of the later revolution than that which it depicted Its dual purpose beyond forging a national Russian identity was to bring its revolutionary Communist message to the West Its influence was feared in Germany to the extent that the government banned the film when it was released in the late s Another of Eisenstein s films s October depicted the Bolshevik perspective on the October Revolution culminating in the storming of the Winter Palace which provided Soviet viewers with the victory that the workers and peasants lacked in Battleship Potemkin ending with Lenin as played by an unknown worker declaring that the government is overthrown Because no documentary material existed of the storming of the palace Eistenstein s re creation of the event has become the source material for historians and filmmakers giving it further legitimacy as the accepted historical record which illustrates its success as a propaganda film br Between the Great Wars American films celebrated the bravery of the American soldiers while depicting war as an existential nightmare Films such as The Big Parade depicted the horrors of trench warfare the brutal destruction of villages and the lack of provisions br Meanwhile Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films about the suffering of the German minority in Czechoslovakia and Poland which were crucial towards creating popular support for occupying the Sudetenland and attacking Poland Films like the Heimkehr Homecoming depicted the plight of homesick ethnic Germans in Poland longing to return to the Reich which in turn set the psychological conditions for the real attack and acceptance of the German policy Lebensraum living space br br br World War II br br The s and s which saw the rise of totalitarian states and the Second World War are arguably the Golden Age of Propaganda Nazi control of the German film industry is the most extreme example of the use of film in the service of a fascist national program and in Hitler created the Reich Ministry for People s Enlightenment and Propaganda and appointed the youthful Joseph Goebbels as its head Fritz Hippler producer of one of the most powerful propaganda films of the time s The Eternal Jew Der ewige Jude ran the film department under Goebbels The Eternal Jew purported to be a documentary depicting the Jewish world insinuating that the Jewish population consisted of avaricious barbarians putting on a front for civilized European society remaining indifferent and unaffected by the war During this time Leni Riefenstahl a filmmaker working in Nazi Germany created one of the best known propaganda films Triumph of the Will a film commissioned by Hitler to chronicle the Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg Despite its controversial subject the film is still recognized for its revolutionary approach to using music and cinematography Another of Riefenstahl s films s Olympia was meant to prove that the Reich was a democratic and open society under Nazi rule It had the perfect venue the Berlin Olympics in which to showcase Adolf Hitler s Aryan ideals and prowess One of the most notable shots is Hitler congratulating the African American Jesse Owens on his four gold medals whose successes spoiled Hitler s wish to depict those of African descent as racially inferior The film won a number of prestigious film awards but fell from grace particularly in the United States when in November the world learned of the program against the Jews Riefenstahl s cinematic masterpiece though temporarily effective propaganda was unable to mitigate the growing awareness of the political realities in Nazi Germany br In the United States during World War II President Franklin D Roosevelt recognized that the direct style of propaganda would not win over the American public He assigned Lowell Mellett to the post of coordinator of government film Although he had no jurisdiction over Hollywood films he pressured the industry into helping the war effort On January Mellett stated in then confidential testimony that he was assigned to persuade the film industry to insert morale building and citizenry arousing themes in its films by all means possible Luckily many directors recognized the necessity and likely the commercial success they would reap of supporting the battle against fascism as public opinion lay with the war effort One such filmmaker Frank Capra created a seven part U S government sponsored series of films to support the war effort entitled Why We Fight This series is considered a highlight of the propaganda film genre Other propaganda movies such as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo and Casablanca have become so well loved by film viewers that they can stand on their own as dramatic films apart from their original role as propaganda vehicles Charlie Chaplin once again joined the U S war effort creating The Great Dictator in which he played the Hitler like character of Adenoid Hynkel this was preceded by some nine months by the short subject starring The Three Stooges You Nazty Spy as Moe Howard was the first American actor as Moe Hailstone to spoof Hitler in film br Animation became popular especially for winning over youthful audiences Walt Disney and Looney Tunes were among those that actively aided the U S war effort through their cartoons which provided training and instructions for viewers as well as a political commentary on the times One of the most popular Der Fuehrer s Face was a means of relieving the aggression against Hitler by making him a somewhat comical figure while showcasing the freedom America offered Disney s Food Will Win the War attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power Also popular in the Soviet Union the government produced such animated shorts as What Hitler Wants which depicts a devilish Hitler giving Russian factories to capitalists enslaving and riding once free Soviet citizens but shows that the U S S R will be prepared to fight paying the Germans back in triplicate ready to beat the fascist pirates br Many of the dramatic war films in the early s in the United States were designed to create a patriotic mindset and convince viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the enemy Despite fears that too much propaganda could diminish Hollywood s entertainment appeal reducing its targeted audience and decreasing profits military enlistment increased and morale was considered to be higher in part attributed to America s innovative propaganda One of the conventions of the genre was to depict a racial and socioeconomic cross section of the United States either a platoon on the front lines or soldiers training on a base which come together to fight for the good of the country In Italy at the same time film directors like Roberto Rossellini produced propaganda films for similar purposes br Similar to Nazi Germany the U S S R prepared its citizens for war by releasing dramas such as Sergei Eisenstein s iconic Alexander Nevsky The U S S R also screened films depicting partisan activity and the suffering inflicted by the Nazis such as Girl No which showed a Russian girl enslaved by an inhumane German family Films were shown on propaganda trains while newsreels were screened in subway stations to reach those who were unable to pay to see films in the theater br br br Cold War br br Psychological combat was in fashion during the Cold War and was used heavily by both sides br When describing life in Communist countries western propaganda sought to depict an image of a brainwashed citizenry which was then held captive by their government The CIA s Office of Policy Coordination adapted George Orwell s Animal Farm into an animated movie in that was released in England In the American Federation of Labor disseminated a map entitled Gulag Slavery Inc of the Soviet Union showing the locations of forced labor camps administered by the Gulag It was widely reprinted across the United States and internationally The U S government made various anti communist education documentaries known as Armed Forces Information Films AFIF first shown to the Armed Forces then released to commercial television or as educational films in schools They include Communism Communist Weapon of Allure Communist Blueprint for Conquest Red Nightmare Challenge of Ideas and Communism Some were used to portray the American Left as infiltrated by communism such as Communist Target Youth produced by J Edgar Hoover which painted the anti HUAC riots of the s as the work of communism Anarchy USA presents the civil rights movement as a part of a communist plot for world domination br Red Dawn was a commercial Hollywood film that depicts an alternate s in which the United States is invaded by the Soviet Union Cuba Nicaragua and other Latin American allies of the U S S R and a group of small town high school students engage in guerrilla warfare in their resistance of the occupation eventually beating the communists br Pork Chop Hill was the most notable s American anti war propaganda piece about the Korean war Milestone was known for his previous anti war films including s All Quiet on the Western Front and Shangganling The Battle of Sangkumryung Ridge or Triangle Hill which was the most influential film on the Chinese in that era Both Pork Chop Hill and Shangganling depict a single battle in which a small dedicated unit defends a small holdout with very little hope of reprieve Like all propaganda the importance of the film is not the battle itself but the outstanding characteristics of such individuals who would commit such acts of patriotism for their home and country br br br Post br Over years since its creation film continues to resonate with viewers and helps influence or reinforce a particular viewpoint Following the attacks many Americans were split on the success of the government s response and the ensuing war in Afghanistan and Iraq Similar to the Vietnam War filmmakers expressed their view of the attacks and feelings about the war through films most notably Fahrenheit The film sparked debate across the country presenting mixed assessments on the role of the U S government and its response along with the controversy that normally arises when depicting recent traumatic events Director Michael Moore omits footage of the planes striking the Twin Towers cutting directly to the aftermath and destruction Alan Petersen s Fahrenhype was released in response to Fahrenheit s success in theaters Petersen called Fahrenheit the Road Runner of manipulation removing all avenues of thought through over determination leaving no room for the viewer s own judgment It received considerably less press and screentime than Moore s controversial piece br Ayman al Zawahiri stated that We are in a media battle for the hearts and minds of our umma community of Muslims Towards winning the hearts and minds of the MENA region Al Qaeda and its affiliates have produced propaganda films and documentaries depicting jihadist attacks last will and testament videos training and interviews all meant to boost morale among supporters Al Qaeda

br As mentioned previously Walt Disney s Food Will Win the War attempts to make US citizens feel good by using US agriculture as a means of power In the United States Department of Agriculture USDA introduced its Basic nutrition guide a precursor to the food pyramid In the same year the United States Office of War Information released Food for Fighters about the importance of nutrition in wartime Between the s and s the Green Revolution increased agriculture production around the world which led to further increases in farm size and a reduction in the number of farms Advances in

people to question where their food comes from and what is actually in it The use of antibiotics and hormones in cattle and birds artificial food additives like artificial colours flavors artificial

effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population In poor developing countries China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening Confucius Institutes and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students br According to Anne Marie Brady the Foreign Ministry first set up a system of designated officials to give information in times of crisis in and greatly expanded the system to lower levels in the mid s China s spin had been directed only at foreigners but in the s leaders realised that managing public crises was useful for domestic politics this included setting up provincial level News Coordinator Groups and inviting foreign PR firms to give seminars br Brady writes that Chinese foreign propaganda officials took cues from the Blair government s spin doctoring during the mad cow disease crisis of and the Bush government s use of the U S media after the terrorist attacks of September According to her the Blair model allows for a certain amount of negative coverage to be shown during a crisis which is believed to help release some of the social tension surrounding it She believes information managers in China used this approach during coal mining disasters of br According to Brady trained official spokespeople are now available on call in every central government ministry as well as in local governments to deal with emerging crises these spin doctors are coordinated and trained by the Office of Foreign Propaganda State Council Information Office br During the July r mqi riots Communist Party officials moved swiftly in a public relations campaign According to Newsweek Party officials felt that the recent riots risked tarnishing China s global image and underwent a public relations program involving quickly getting out the government s official version of the events as well as transporting foreign journalists to riot affected areas The growth in new technologies such as email and SMS forced the CCP s hand into taking up spin br Instead of attempting a media blackout as with the Tibetan unrest the Party has adopted a series of more advanced techniques to influence the information leaving China The day after violence in r mqi the State Council Information Office set up a Xinjiang Information Office in r mqi to assist foreign reporters It invited foreign media to Xinjiang to tour the riot zones visit hospitals and look at the aftermath themselves Journalists were also given CDs with photos and TV clips They try to control the foreign journalists as much as possible by using this more sophisticated PR work rather than ban ning them according to Professor Xiao Qiang quoted by Newsweek br Israel br br Israel s efforts to communicate directly with citizens of other nations to inform and influence their perceptions with the aim of garnering support or tolerance for the Israeli government s strategic objectives have been termed hasbara Historically these efforts have evolved from being called propaganda by early Zionists with Theodor Herzl

televised campaign used provocative tactics to decrease the amount of youth using tobacco and to change attitudes towards the tobacco industry br In early the U S Department of Defense launched an information operation colloquially referred to as the Pentagon military analyst program The goal of the operation is to spread the administrations s talking points on Iraq by briefing retired commanders for network and cable television appearances where they have been presented as independent analysts br On May after this program was revealed in The New York Times the House passed an amendment that would make permanent a domestic propaganda ban that until now has been enacted annually in the military authorization bill br The Shared values initiative was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a new America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely without persecution in post America Funded by the United

Command Centcom was working with a California corporation to develop software that would allow the US government to secretly manipulate social media sites by using fake online personas to influence internet conversations and spread pro American propaganda A Centcom spokesman stated that the interventions were not targeting any US based web sites in English or any other language and also said that the propaganda campaigns were not targeting Facebook or Twitter br In October The Daily Telegraph reported that Facebook banned hundreds of pages and accounts which it says were fraudulently flooding its site with partisan political content although they came from the US instead of being associated with Russia br In the Stanford Internet Observatory and Graphika studied banned accounts on Twitter Facebook Instagram and five other social media platforms that used deceptive tactics to promote pro Western narratives in the Middle East and Central Asia br Vice News noted that U S leaning social media influence campaigns are ultimately very similar to those run by adversarial countries while EuroNews quoted Stanford researcher Shelby Grossman as saying I was shocked that the tactics we saw being used were identical to the tactics used by authoritarian regimes br The Intercept reported in December that the United States military ran a network of social media accounts and online

their propaganda tool Inspired by the Vietcong s tactics insurgents were using rapid movement to keep the coalition off balance By using low technology strategies to convey their messages they were able to gain support Graffiti slogans were used on walls and houses praising the virtues of many group leaders while condemning the Iraqi government Others used flyers leaflets articles and self published newspapers and magazines to get the point across br Insurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the US Government were trying to influence The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success In addition a domestic Arabic language television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country br br br US propaganda in Iraq br br To achieve their aim of a moderate pro western Iraq US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis but differentiating between good and bad Islam has proved challenging for the US br The US implemented black propaganda by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro American information but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein One radio station used was Radio Tikrit Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts this was brought forth by The New York Times in The article stated that it was the Lincoln Group who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda However their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing br The US was more successful with the Voice of America campaign which is an old Cold War tactic that exploited people s desire for information While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power br In November the Chicago Tribune and the Los Angeles Times alleged that the United States military had manipulated news reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the insurgency Lt Col Barry Johnson a military spokesman in Iraq said the program is an important part of countering misinformation

truth to sink in to kind of catapult the propaganda br While the United States official stance was to remove Saddam Hussein s power in Iraq with allegations that his government held weapons of mass destruction or was related to Osama bin Laden over time the Iraq war as a whole has been seen in a negative light Video and picture coverage in the news has shown shocking and disturbing images of torture and other evils being done under the Iraqi Government br Russian nationals used different propaganda tools to interfere with the United States election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton Russia created political propaganda for the United States election to confuse voters from interpreting which news information was false or misleading Different tactics used to interfere with the United States included fake social media accounts on Twitter Facebook and other cites false political rallies and online political advertisements Russian nationals used new online propaganda which is not to convince or persuade but rather to cause distraction and paranoia The Select Committee On Intelligence in the United States Senate found that technology aided to providing more convincing and
