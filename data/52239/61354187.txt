id: 61354187
Russian interference in the United States elections was a matter of concern at the highest level of national security within the United States government in addition to the computer and social media industries In the RAND Corporation was one of the first to release research describing Russia s playbook for interfering in U S elections developed machine learning tools to detect the interference and tested strategies to counter Russian interference In February and August United States Intelligence Community USIC experts warned members of Congress that Russia was interfering in the presidential election in then President Donald Trump s favor USIC analysis released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence DNI in March found that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Joe Biden to US media organizations US officials and prominent US individuals including some close to former President Trump and his administration The New York Times reported in May that federal investigators in Brooklyn began a criminal investigation late in the Trump administration into possible efforts by several current and former Ukrainian officials to spread unsubstantiated allegations about corruption by Joe Biden including whether they had used Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani as a channel br br br Reports of attempted interference br br br Overview br In response to Russian interference in the United States elections special counsel Robert Mueller conducted a two year long investigation The resulting report concluded that Russia interfered in sweeping and systematic fashion In his July congressional testimony Mueller stated that the Russians continue to interfere in U S elections as we sit here and that many more countries have developed disinformation campaigns targeting U S elections based partly on the Russian model br Also in July the Senate Intelligence Committee released the first volume of a bipartisan report on Russian interference in the United States elections a report that included recommendations for securing the elections The second volume of that report noted based on social media data from October that Russian disinformation efforts may be focused on gathering information and data points in support of an active measures campaign targeted at the U S presidential election br In a highly classified report the Central Intelligence Agency stated We assess that President Vladimir Putin and the senior most Russian officials are aware of and probably directing Russia s influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U S Vice President supporting the U S president and fueling public discord ahead of the U S election in November The existence of this report published at the end of August was made public knowledge on September in reports from The Washington Post and The New York Times br U S officials have accused Russia China and Iran of trying to influence the elections Between January and late July Twitter identified and shut down over phony accounts created by Iranian influence operations According to Christopher A Wray the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Russia is attempting to interfere with the United States elections Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in July Wray stated We are very much viewing as just kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in Dan Coats the former Director of National Intelligence believes that Russia and China will both attempt to influence the elections As of September intelligence officials point to Russia as the more acute threat to the election saying that China has been expressing its preferences by public rhetoric rather than engaging in covert operations to denigrate a candidate or otherwise interfere in the election itself Wray testified to the House Committee on Homeland Security on September that Russian efforts to damage the Biden campaign were very active br According to United States intelligence officials interviewed by The New York Times Russian operations would be intended to help President Trump potentially by exacerbating disputes around the results especially if the race is too close to call The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have stated that Russian cyberattacks have targeted U S state local territorial and tribal government networks as well as aviation networks br br br Social media disinformation and voting infrastructure br Various disinformation campaigns on social media have targeted the Democratic Party candidates running in the Democratic Party presidential primaries This has prompted considerable concern regarding the ability of social media companies to cope with disinformation and manipulation By August Facebook and Twitter had banned advertisements that use misinformation to attempt the suppression of voter turnout br Microsoft developed an open source software called ElectionGuard to help safeguard the elections In mid July Microsoft announced that it had over the prior year notified nearly customers they ve been targeted or compromised by nation state attacks Based on attacks that had targeted political organizations and on experience from and Microsoft anticipated attacks targeting U S election systems political campaigns or NGOs that work closely with campaigns Of the nation state attacks that had originated from Russia Microsoft claimed that they followed the same pattern of engagement as Russian operations in and On September Microsoft announced that it would provide free security updates for Windows which reached its end of life on January on federally certified voting machines through the United States elections On October Microsoft announced that Phosphorus a group of hackers linked to the Iranian government had attempted to compromise e mail accounts belonging to journalists prominent Iranian expatriates U S government officials and the campaign of a U S presidential candidate While Microsoft did not disclose which campaign had been the target of the cyber attack unnamed sources informed Reuters that it had been that of Donald Trump br On October Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company has detected a highly sophisticated set of campaigns to interfere with the elections These campaigns originated from Russia and from Iran Fake accounts based in Russia posed as Americans of varied political backgrounds and worked to undermine the campaign of Joe Biden aiming to sow discontent with Biden from both the left and the right br A September report from The Washington Post demonstrated that due to bad default passwords and weak encryption hackers with physical access can easily get into voting machines designed for use in the United States elections and remote hacking was possible if the machines were accidentally misconfigured br On February The Washington Post reported that according to unnamed US officials Russia was interfering in the Democratic primary in an effort to support the nomination of Senator Bernie Sanders Sanders issued a statement after the news report saying in part I don t care frankly who Putin wants to be president My message to Putin is clear stay out of American elections and as president I will make sure that you do Sanders acknowledged that his campaign was briefed about Russia s alleged efforts about a month prior Sanders suggested that Russians were impersonating people claiming to be his supporters online in order to create an atmosphere of toxicity and give Bernie Bros a bad reputation a suggestion that Twitter rejected According to Laura Rosenberger Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans faith in democratic institutions and processes br In March the University of Wisconsin Madison and the Brennan Center for Justice published a report indicating that Russia linked social media accounts have been spreading Instagram posts calculated to sow division among American voters According to the report Russian operatives were increasingly impersonating real political candidates and groups rather than creating fictional groups According to Twitter s head of site integrity Russian agents also attempted in to create the impression of more election interference than is actually happening to undermine confidence in the process Shortly thereafter the New York Times reported that according to American intelligence officials Russian operatives have been stoking via private Facebook groups anger among African Americans emphasizing allegations of police brutality in the United States highlighting racism in the United States against African Americans and promoting and pressuring hate groups including white and black extremist groups in order to create strife within American society though American intelligence officials provided few details about the alleged operations A CNN investigation found that Russian efforts had partly been outsourced to troll farms in Ghana and Nigeria In May Twitter suspended accounts that exhibited behavior plausibly but not definitively indicative of Russian election interference tactics including association with a Ghana troll farm br br Government officials and American corporate security officers braced for a repeat of s election infrastructure hacking and similar twenty first century attacks and conducted what were characterized as pre emptive counter strikes on botnet infrastructure which might be used in a large scale coordination of hacking Some incidents earlier in the year appeared to foreshadow such possibilities Following his dismissal in a December interview Chris Krebs the Trump administration s director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA described monitoring Election Day from CISA s joint command center along with representatives from the military s United States Cyber Command the National Security Agency NSA the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI the United States Secret Service USSS the Election Assistance Commission EAC representatives of vendors of voting machine equipment and representatives of state and local governments as well as his agency s analysis preceding and subsequent to that day saying It was quiet There was no indication or evidence that there was any sort of hacking or compromise of election systems on before or after November third Responding to spurious claims of foreign outsourcing of vote counting as a rationale behind litigation attempting to stop official vote counting in some areas Krebs also affirmed that All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America br However acts of foreign interference did include Russian state directed application of computational propaganda approaches more conventional state sponsored Internet propaganda smaller scale disinformation efforts information laundering and trading up the chain propaganda tactics employing some government officials Trump affiliates and US media outlets as described below br br br Briefings to Congress br On February American intelligence officials advised members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the election in an effort to get Trump re elected The briefing was delivered by Shelby Pierson the intelligence community s top election security official and an aide to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire Trump allies on the committee challenged the findings and Trump was angered to learn of the briefing as he believed Democrats might weaponize the information against him He chastised Maguire for allowing the briefing to occur and days later he appointed Richard Grenell to replace Maguire br William Evanina director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center told members of Congress during a classified briefing on July that Russia was working to boost the campaign of Trump and undermine that of Biden Details of Evanina s report were not made public The Biden campaign confirmed to the Associated Press that they had faced multiple related threats but were reluctant to reveal specifics for fear of giving adversaries useful intelligence Evanina later stated in a press release We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti Russia establishment On August CNN reported that intelligence officials had provided senators representatives and both the Biden and Trump campaigns with information indicating Russia is behind an ongoing disinformation push targeting Biden That same day Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell a member of the House Intelligence Committee asserted that Republican senators investigating Biden and his son were acting as Russian launderers of this information br br br Giuliani Derkach and Johnson br br According to the Treasury Department Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani collaborated with active Russian agent Andrii Derkach a Ukrainian lawmaker to spread anti Biden material during Trump s impeachment The Treasury Department said that Derkach waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U S officials in the upcoming Presidential Election including by the release of edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U S officials br Their efforts were aided by journalists like John Solomon a contributor to Fox News who according to Jane Mayer was pivotal for the dissemination of disinformation about Biden She stated No journalist played a bigger part in fueling the Biden corruption narrative than John Solomon br In late the chairman of the Senate committee investigating the matter Ron Johnson was warned by American intelligence officials of a risk he could be playing into the hands of Russian intelligence to spread disinformation During this period Richard Burr R NC chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee also warned Johnson that Johnson s investigation could aid Russian efforts to promote distrust in the United States political system Senators had also been briefed in late about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for election interference Johnson initially said he would release findings in spring as Democrats would be selecting their presidential nominee but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump s urging in May after it became clear Biden would be the nominee In March Johnson decided to postpone the issuing of a subpoena for former Ukrainian official and employee of a Democratic lobby firm Blue Star Strategies Andrii Telizhenko a close ally of Rudy Giuliani who had made appearances on the pro Trump cable channel One America News after Senator Mitt Romney backed away on voting for Mr Telizhenko as the Senators from the Democratic Party pressured Senator Romney on Mr Telizhenko s vote Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re election campaign The State Department revoked Telizhenko s visa in October and CNN reported the American government was considering sanctioning him as a Russian agent br In May Andrii Derkach a Giuliani associate whom Evanina had named as a key participant in Russian interference released snippets of alleged recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Petro Poroshenko the Ukrainian president during the years Biden s son Hunter worked for Burisma Holdings The Bidens had been accused without evidence of malfeasance relating to Burisma The recordings which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country s prosecutor general The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son Poroshenko denied In June that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma In September the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach stating he has been an active Russian agent for over a decade maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services br Giuliani Trump s personal attorney had spent significant time working in Ukraine during to gather information about the Bidens making frequent American television appearances to discuss it Attorney general Bill Barr confirmed in February that the Justice Department had created an intake process to analyze Giuliani s information This information included a September statement by former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin falsely claiming he had been fired at Biden s insistence because Shokin was investigating Biden s son The statement disclosed that it had been prepared at the request of attorneys for Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash which since July included Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing both close associates of Trump and Giuliani Firtash fighting extradition to the United States where he was under federal indictment is believed by the Justice Department to be connected to high levels of Russian organized crime which allegedly installed him as a broker for Ukrainian imports of Russian natural gas He is also reportedly close to the Kremlin to support Russian interests in Ukraine br According to officials interviewed by The Daily Beast then National Security Advisor John Bolton told his staff not to meet with Giuliani as did his successor Robert C O Brien because Bolton had been informed that Giuliani was spreading conspiracy theories that aligned with Russian interests in disrupting the election These officials were also concerned that Giuliani would be used as a conduit for disinformation including leaks of emails that would mix genuine with forged material in order to implicate Hunter Biden in corrupt dealings br The New York Times reported in November that Giuliani had directed associate Lev Parnas to approach Firtash about hiring the couple with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Biden which Parnas s attorney described was part of any potential resolution to Firtash s extradition matter Giuliani denied any association with Firtash though he told CNN he met with a Firtash attorney for two hours in New York City at the time he was seeking information about the Bidens As vice president Biden had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate brokers such as Firtash to reduce the country s reliance on Russian gas After his October indictment Parnas asserted that he Giuliani diGenova and Toensing had a deal with Firtash in which the oligarch would provide information to discredit Biden in exchange for Giuliani persuading the Justice Department to drop its efforts to extradite Firtash br The Washington Post reported in October that after they began representing Firtash Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face to face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped Prior to that mid August meeting Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial Trump Ukraine whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department as well as on Giuliani s activities in Ukraine Bloomberg News reported that its sources told them Giuliani s high profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash as it would appear to be a political quid pro quo Barr declined to intervene in the Firtash case Firtash denied involvement in collecting or financing damaging information on the Bidens br br br Developments in summer and fall br By the summer of Russian intelligence had advanced to information laundering in which divisive propaganda was reported on Russia affiliated news websites with the expectation the stories would be picked up and spread by more legitimate news outlets In August The New York Times reported that a video published by RT s Ruptly video platform of Black Lives Matter protesters apparently burning a bible in Portland Oregon edited in a misleading way went viral after it being shared with an inaccurate caption on social media by a far right personality and then conservative politicians The Times said the clip appear ed to be one of the first viral Russian disinformation hits of the presidential campaign An NBC report in the wake of this incident found that Ruptly edited user generated protest videos to highlight violence over peaceful protest br In September Facebook and Twitter announced that they had been alerted to the existence of Peace Data a website set up by Russia s Internet Research Agency to interfere with the election The social media companies deleted accounts that had been used in an operation to recruit American journalists to write articles critical of Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris On September the intelligence branch of the Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to state and federal law enforcement that Russia was amplifying concerns about postal voting and other measures taken to protect voters during the COVID pandemic According to DHS analysts Russian malign influence actors had been spreading misinformation since at least March Trump had repeatedly asserted without evidence that voting by mail would result in widespread fraud br ABC News reported in September that the Homeland Security Department had withheld the July release of an intelligence bulletin to law enforcement that warned of Russian efforts to promote allegations about the poor mental health of Joe Biden DHS chief of staff John Gountanis halted the release pending review by secretary Chad Wolf The bulletin stated that analysts had high confidence of the Russian efforts which were similar to efforts by Trump and his campaign to depict Biden as mentally unfit A DHS spokesperson said the bulletin was delayed because it did not meet the department s standards The bulletin had not been released as of the date of the ABC News report Later in September Brian Murphy a former DHS undersecretary for intelligence and analysis asserted in a whistleblower complaint that Wolf told him the intelligence notification should be held because it made the President look bad Murphy also claimed Wolf told him to cease providing intelligence assessments on the threat of Russian interference in the US and instead start reporting on interference activities by China and Iran Murphy said Wolf told him this directive came from White House national security advisor Robert O Brien The DHS inspector general released findings in May that affirmed the accounts of ABC News and Murphy The intelligence report on Russian interference appeared to have been delayed and altered changes that appear to be based in part on political considerations br On September Reuters reported that hackers had tried and failed to breach the systems of SKDKnickerbocker a political consulting firm that specializes in working for Democratic Party politicians and that had been working with the Biden campaign for two months Microsoft who detected the cyberattack informed SKDKnickerbocker that Russian state backed hackers were the likely perpetrators br Analysts and officials interviewed by The New York Times in September indicated that a primary tactic of Russian disinformation campaigns was to amplify misleading statements from Trump chiefly about postal voting Russia s Internet Research Agency also created a fictitious press organization the Newsroom for American and European Based Citizens in order to feed propaganda to right wing social media users NAEBC accounts were blocked or suspended by Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn but their content got more traction on alt tech platforms Gab and Parler according to a Reuters report br H R McMaster Trump s former national security advisor said on October that Trump was aiding and abetting Putin s efforts by not being direct about this This sustained campaign of disruption disinformation and denial is aided by any leader who doesn t acknowledge it br On October The Washington Post reported that the State Department had revoked the travel visa of Giuliani associate Andrii Telizhenko br On October threatening emails were sent to Democrats in at least four states The emails warned that You will vote for Trump on Election Day or we will come after you Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe announced that evening that the emails using a spoofed return address had been sent by Iran He added that both Iran and Russia are known to have obtained American voter registration data possibly from publicly available information and that This data can be used by foreign actors to attempt to communicate false information to registered voters that they hope will cause confusion sow chaos and undermine your confidence in American democracy A spokesman for Iran denied the allegation In his announcement Ratcliffe said that Iran s intent had been to intimidate voters incite social unrest and damage President Trump raising questions as to how ordering Democrats to vote for Trump would be damaging to Trump It was later reported that the reference to Trump had not been in Ratcliffe s prepared remarks as signed off by the other officials on the stage but that he added it on his own br br br New York Post story br br In October the FBI reportedly launched an investigation into whether a story published in the tabloid journal New York Post on October might be part of a Russian disinformation effort targeting Biden The story titled Biden Secret Emails displayed an email supposedly showing that Hunter Biden had arranged for his father then vice president Joe Biden to meet with a top advisor to Burisma The Biden campaign said that no such meeting ever happened The Post s source for the data was Giuliani who says he got it from the hard drive of a laptop that was allegedly dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April and never picked up The shop owner told reporters that he thought the person who dropped it off was Hunter Biden but wasn t sure He said he eventually gave the laptop to the FBI keeping a copy of the hard drive for himself that he later gave to Giuliani A year and a half earlier in early White House officials had been warned that the Russians were planning to leak forged emails in the weeks before the election and that Giuliani could be the conduit for such a leak br Most of the New York Post story was written by a staff reporter who did not allow his name to be used on it because he doubted the story s credibility According to an investigation by The New York Times editors at the New York Post pressed staff members to add their bylines to the story and at least one refused in addition to the original author Of the two writers eventually credited on the article the second did not know her name was attached to it until after it was published Giuliani was later quoted as saying he had given the hard drive to the New York Post because either nobody else would take it or if they took it they would spend all the time they could to try to contradict it before they put it out Several days after the story was published more than former senior intelligence officials signed a letter saying that while they have no evidence the story has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation The New York Times reported that no solid evidence has emerged that the laptop contained Russian disinformation br br br Hall County Georgia br On October the government of Hall County Georgia had all its election related information released by Russian hackers using DoppelPaymer ransomware br br br DNI report br br According to a declassified DNI report released on March there was evidence of broad efforts by both Russia and Iran to shape the election s outcome However there was no evidence that any votes ballots or voter registrations were directly changed While Iran sought to undermine confidence in the vote and harm Trump s reelection prospects the report found that Russia s efforts had been aimed at denigrating President Biden s candidacy and the Democratic Party supporting former President Trump undermining public confidence in the electoral process and exacerbating sociopolitical divisions in the US central to Moscow s interference effort having been reliance on Russian intelligence agencies proxies to launder influence narratives by using media organizations U S officials and people close to Trump to push misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against Biden As an example of such activity by Russia the report cited a documentary aired on One America News Network in January which was identified by news media as The Ukraine Hoax Impeachment Biden Cash and Mass Murder br The report specifically identified individuals controlled by the Russian government as having been involved in Russia s interference efforts such as Konstantin Kilimnik and Andrii Derkach The report said that Putin was likely to have had purview over the activities of Andrii Derkach According to the report Putin had authorized the Russian influence operations Following the publication of the DNI report House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff issued a statement that said Through proxies Russia ran a successful intelligence operation that penetrated the former president s inner circle br br br Government reaction br Dan Coats appointed Shelby Pierson as the U S election security czar in July creating a new position in a move seen as an acknowledgment that foreign influence operations against U S elections will be ongoing indefinitely Election security task forces established before the midterm elections at the FBI the Department of Homeland Security the National Security Agency and the United States Cyber Command have been expanded and made permanent The Department of Homeland Security indicated that the threat of ransomware attacks upon voter registration databases was a particular concern br Prior to resigning as U S Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen attempted to organize a meeting of the U S Cabinet to discuss how to address potential foreign interference in the elections Mick Mulvaney the White House Chief of Staff reportedly warned her to keep the subject away from Trump who views the discussion as questioning the legitimacy of his victory in Mitch McConnell the Senate Majority Leader has blocked various bills intended to improve election security from being considered including some measures that have had bipartisan support Election security legislation remains stalled in the Senate as of February However various states have implemented changes such as paper ballots Florida has expanded its paper ballot backup system since but experts warn that its voting systems are still vulnerable to manipulation a particular concern being the electronic poll books that store lists of registered voters All election supervisors in Florida have been required to sign nondisclosure agreements and consequently information such as the identity of which four counties had been hacked by Russian intelligence in remains unknown to the public Democratic members of Congress cited the lack of effort to secure U S elections against foreign interference particularly from Russia as among grounds to begin an impeachment inquiry br On September the United States issued economic sanctions against seven Russians affiliated with the Internet Research Agency an organization that manipulates social media for misinformation purposes The sanctions were described as a warning against foreign interference in United States elections br On December FBI Director Christopher A Wray told ABC News as far as the election itself goes we think Russia represents the most significant threat According to William Evanina director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center Russia is using social media and many other tools to inflame social divisions promote conspiracy theories and sow distrust in our democracy and elections br Bloomberg News reported in January that American intelligence and law enforcement were examining whether Russia was involved in promoting disinformation to undermine Joe Biden as part of a campaign to disrupt the election The following month the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service warned that Russia would attempt to interfere in the Georgian parliamentary election in October as well as the US election in November br On July House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to FBI Director Wray requesting a briefing on a concerted foreign interference campaign targeting the United States Congress The request for an all Congress briefing also signed by Rep Adam Schiff and Sen Mark Warner was made public one week later save for a classified addendum that was not released to the media br br br Trump administration reaction br The Trump administration reacted to the briefing by American intelligence officials to the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the election in an effort to get Trump re elected by rejecting the efforts were in favor of Trump and by firing Joseph Maguire who was involved in those reports br By contrast Trump and his national security adviser Robert O Brien accepted reports the Russians were supporting the nomination of Bernie Sanders br Three weeks after Trump loyalist Richard Grenell was appointed acting Director of National Intelligence intelligence officials briefed members of Congress behind closed doors that they had not concluded that the Kremlin is directly aiding any candidate s re election or any other candidates election which differed from testimony they had provided the previous month indicating that Russia was working to aid Trump s candidacy Two intelligence officials pushed back on suggestions the new testimony was politically motivated One intelligence official asserted the earlier testimony had overreached and that Democrats had mischaracterized it Kash Patel a former aide to congressman Devin Nunes who joined Grenell at the ODNI imposed limits on what intelligence officials could tell Congress about foreign influence operations The briefers reportedly did not intend to contradict their previous testimony though they avoided repeating it br Trump and his surrogates asserted that China rather than Russia posed the greater risk to election security and was trying to help Biden win In August Trump tweeted that Chinese State Media and Leaders of CHINA want Biden to win the U S Election Donald Trump Jr asserted at the August Republican convention that Beijing Biden is so weak on China that the intelligence community recently assessed that the Chinese Communist Party favors Biden Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe stated during an August Fox News appearance China is using a massive and sophisticated influence campaign that dwarfs anything that any other country is doing Attorney general Bill Barr and national security advisor Robert O Brien made similar assertions Intelligence community officials have publicly and privately said that the underlying intelligence indicates that while China would prefer Trump not be reelected the nation had not been actively interfering and that Russia remained the far greater threat working to undermine Biden Trump also asserted that China was trying to stoke race protests in an effort to help Biden which was also not supported by the intelligence community s assessment The United States intelligence community released analysis in March finding that China had considered interfering with the election but decided against it on concerns it would fail or backfire br Following Joe Biden s apparent win which Trump was actively disputing through numerous lawsuits Chris Krebs the director of the Department of Homeland Security s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement on November There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised Trump tweeted on November that he had fired Krebs as a result of this statement br br br Putin administration reaction br Russian officials denied that it had interfered in the election or that it was interfering in the election On September Putin released a formal statement seeking mutual guarantees of non interference in U S and Russian elections and asking the United States to approve a comprehensive program of practical measures to reset our relations in the use of information and communication technologies ICT br br br Interference from the administration br In a June interview with George Stephanopoulos Donald Trump said that he would accept information from other nations about his opponents in the United States presidential election br According to reporting by The Wall Street Journal The Washington Post and The New York Times Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani repeatedly pressed the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden the son of Joe Biden leading to the ongoing Trump Ukraine scandal Biden was viewed as a potentially strong Trump challenger in the presidential election and the purpose of the requested investigation was alleged to be to damage Biden s election campaign for president Reports suggested that Trump threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless they investigated Biden The controversy triggered the commencement of the formal process of impeachment inquiries against Trump on September with House speaker Nancy Pelosi directing six House committee chairmen to proceed under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry br On October while discussing negotiations on a possible agreement in the ongoing China United States trade war he said that if they China don t do what we want we have tremendous power He then said that China should start an investigation into presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden Chair of the Federal Election Commission Ellen Weintraub then retweeted a June statement explaining that it is illegal for any person to solicit accept or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U S election br As of early October there is evidence President Trump Vice President Mike Pence U S Attorney General William Barr as well as Trump s personal attorney Giuliani solicited help from Ukraine and China for assistance in discrediting Trump s political opponents Trump also dispatched Barr to meet with Italian officials as part of Trump s efforts to discredit the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the election Trump also pressed Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison to give Barr information that Trump hoped would discredit the Mueller inquiry in a call that like Trump s earlier call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky used diplomatic contacts to advance Trump s personal political interests According to a report in the Times of London Trump also personally contacted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to seek help to discredit the Mueller investigation br A Department of Homeland Security intelligence bulletin warning about Russian interference in the election was planned for release on July but was blocked by acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf s chief of staff The bulletin intended to be distributed among law enforcement agencies indicated that Russian disinformation operations would denigrate the mental health of Joe Biden br br br Aftermath br br Russian interference in the election was significantly less severe than it had been in Experts suggested a variety of possible explanations not mutually exclusive These include a hardening of American cyber defenses reluctance on Russia s part to risk reprisals and the fact that misinformation intended to delegitimize the election was already prevalent within the United States thanks to unfounded claims by Trump and others br On April the Biden administration expelled Russian diplomats and sanctioned six Russian companies that support Russia s cyber activities in addition to individuals and entities for its role in the interference and the United States federal government data breach br The New York Times reported in May that federal investigators in Brooklyn began a criminal investigation late in the Trump administration into possible efforts by several current and former Ukrainian officials to spread unsubstantiated allegations about corruption by Joe Biden Investigators were examining whether the Ukrainians used Giuliani as a channel for the allegations though he was not a specific subject of the investigation in contrast to a long running investigation
