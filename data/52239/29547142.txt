Culture jamming sometimes also guerrilla communication is a form of protest used by many anti consumerist social movements to disrupt or subvert media culture and its mainstream cultural institutions including corporate advertising It attempts to expose the methods of domination of mass society br Culture jamming employs techniques originally associated with Letterist International and later Situationist International known as d tournement It uses the language and rhetoric of mainstream culture to subversively critique the social institutions that produce that culture Tactics include editing company logos to critique the respective companies products or concepts they represent or wearing fashion statements that criticize the current fashion trends by deliberately clashing with them Culture jamming often entails using mass media to produce ironic or satirical commentary about itself commonly using the original medium s communication method Culture jamming is also a form of subvertising br Culture jamming is intended to expose questionable political assumptions behind commercial culture and can be considered a reaction against politically imposed social conformity Prominent examples of culture jamming include the adulteration of billboard advertising by the Billboard Liberation Front and contemporary artists such as Ron English Culture jamming may involve street parties and protests While culture jamming usually focuses on subverting or critiquing political and advertising messages some proponents focus on a different form which brings together artists designers scholars and activists to create works that transcend the status quo rather than merely criticize it br br br Origins of the term etymology and history br The term was coined by Mark of The Upstairs Burned and Mark in The Fascist States in a Flint Michigan fanzine called Death and Gravey in Subsequently it was mistakingly attributed to being created in by Don Joyce of American sound collage band Negativland with the release of their album JamCon The phrase culture jamming comes from the idea of radio jamming where public frequencies can be pirated and subverted for independent communication or to disrupt dominant frequencies used by governments In one of the tracks of the album they stated br br As awareness of how the media environment we occupy affects and directs our inner life grows some resist The skillfully reworked billboard directs the public viewer to a consideration of the original corporate strategy The studio for the cultural jammer is the world at large br According to Vince Carducci although the term was coined by Negativland culture jamming can be traced as far back as the s One particularly influential group that was active in Europe was the Situationist International and was led by Guy Debord The SI asserted that in the past humans dealt with life and the consumer market directly They argued that this spontaneous way of life was slowly deteriorating as a direct result of the new modern way of life Situationists saw everything from television to radio as a threat and argued that life in industrialized areas driven by capitalist forces had become monotonous sterile gloomy linear and productivity driven In particular the SI argued humans had become passive recipients of the spectacle a simulated reality that generates the desire to consume and positions humans as obedient consumerist cogs within the efficient and exploitative productivity loop of capitalism Through playful activity individuals could create situations the opposite of spectacles For the SI these situations took the form of the d rive or the active drift of the body through space in ways that broke routine and overcame boundaries creating situations by exiting habit and entering new interactive possibilities br The cultural critic Mark Dery traces the origins of culture jamming to medieval carnival which Mikhail Bakhtin interpreted in Rabelais and his World as an officially sanctioned subversion of the social hierarchy Modern precursors might include the media savvy agit prop of the anti Nazi photomonteur John Heartfield the sociopolitical street theater and staged media events of s radicals such as Abbie Hoffman Joey Skaggs the German concept of Spa guerilla and in the Situationist International SI of the s and s The SI first compared its own activities to radio jamming in when it proposed the use of guerrilla communication within mass media to sow confusion within the dominant culture In the Guerrilla Girls formed to expose discrimination and corruption in the art world br Mark Dery s New York Times article on culture jamming The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax was the first mention in the mainstream media of the phenomenon Dery later expanded on this article in his Open Magazine pamphlet Culture Jamming Hacking Slashing and Sniping in the Empire of the Signs a seminal essay that remains the most exhaustive historical sociopolitical and philosophical theorization of culture jamming to date Adbusters a Canadian publication espousing an environmentalist critique of consumerism and advertising began promoting aspects of culture jamming after Dery introduced founder and editor Kalle Lasn to the term through a series of articles he wrote for the magazine In her critique of consumerism No Logo the Canadian cultural commentator and political activist Naomi Klein examines culture jamming in a chapter that focuses on the work of Jorge Rodriguez Gerada Through an analysis of the Where the Hell is Matt viral videos researchers Milstein and Pulos analyze how the power of the culture jam to disrupt the status quo is currently being threatened by increasing commercial incorporation For example T Mobile utilized the Liverpool street underground station to host a flashmob to sell their mobile services br br br Tactics br br Culture jamming is a form of disruption that plays on the emotions of viewers and bystanders Jammers want to disrupt the unconscious thought process that takes place when most consumers view a popular advertising and bring about a d tournement Activists that utilize this tactic are counting on their meme to pull on the emotional strings of people and evoke some type of reaction The reactions that most cultural jammers are hoping to evoke are behavioral change and political action There are four emotions that activists often want viewers to feel These emotions shock shame fear and anger are believed to be the catalysts for social change Culture jamming also intersects with forms of legal transgression Semiotic disobedience for example involves both authorial and proprietary disobedience while techniques such as coercive disobedience comprise acts of culture jamming combined with a demonstration of the retaliatory actions legal consequences handed down by the ruling apparatus br The basic unit in which a message is transmitted in culture jamming is the meme Memes are condensed images that stimulate visual verbal musical or behavioral associations that people can easily imitate and transmit to others The term meme was coined and first popularized by geneticist Richard Dawkins but later used by cultural critics such as Douglas Rushkoff who claimed memes were a type of media virus Memes are seen as genes that can jump from outlet to outlet and replicate themselves or mutate upon transmission just like a virus br Culture jammers will often use common symbols such as the McDonald s golden arches or Nike swoosh to engage people and force them to think about their eating habits or fashion sense In one example jammer Jonah Peretti used the Nike symbol to stir debate on sweatshop child labor and consumer freedom Peretti made public exchanges between himself and Nike over a disagreement Peretti had requested custom Nikes with the word sweatshop placed in the Nike symbol Nike refused Once this story was made public it spread worldwide and contributed to the already robust conversation about Nike s use of sweatshops which had been ongoing for a decade prior to Peretti s stunt br Jammers can also organize and participate in mass campaigns Examples of cultural jamming like Perretti s are more along the lines of tactics that radical consumer social movements would use These movements push people to question the taken for granted assumption that consuming is natural and good and aim to disrupt the naturalization of consumer culture they also seek to create systems of production and consumption that are more humane and less dominated by global corporate late capitalism br Past mass events and ideas have included Buy Nothing Day virtual sit ins and protests over the Internet producing subvertisements and placing them in public spaces and creating and enacting place jamming projects where public spaces are reclaimed and nature is re introduced into urban places br The most effective form of jamming is to use an already widely recognizable meme to transmit the message Once viewers are forced to take a second look at the mimicked popular meme they are forced out of their comfort zone Viewers are presented with another way to view the meme and are forced to think about the implications presented by the jammer More often than not when this is used as a tactic the jammer is going for shock value For example to make consumers aware of the negative body image that big name fashion brands are frequently accused of causing a subvertisement of Calvin Klein s Obsession was created and played worldwide It depicted a young woman with an eating disorder throwing up into a toilet br Another way that social consumer movements hope to utilize culture jamming effectively is by employing a metameme A metameme is a two level message that punctures a specific commercial image but does so in a way that challenges some larger aspect of the political culture of corporate domination An example would be the true cost campaign set in motion by Adbusters True cost forced consumers to compare the human labor cost and conditions and environmental drawbacks of products to the sales costs Another example would be the Truth campaigns that exposed the deception tobacco companies used to sell their products br Following critical scholars like Paulo Freire Culture jams are also being integrated into the university classroom setting in which students and teachers gain the opportunity not only to learn methods of informed public critique but also to collaboratively use participatory communication techniques to actively create new locations of meaning For example students disrupt public space to bring attention to community concerns or utilize subvertisements to engage with media literacy projects br br br

scholars and activists such as Amory Starr and Joseph D Rumbo have argued that culture jamming is futile because it is easily co opted and commodified by the market which tends to defuse its potential for consumer resistance A newer understanding of the term has been called for that would encourage artists scholars and activists to come together and create innovative flexible and practical mobile
