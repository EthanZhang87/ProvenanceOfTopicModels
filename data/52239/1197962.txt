Information and communications technology ICT is an extensional term for information technology IT that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications telephone lines and wireless signals and computers as well as necessary enterprise software middleware storage and audiovisual that enable users to access store transmit understand and manipulate information br ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisuals and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone networks with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling signal distribution and management ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device encompassing radio television cell phones computer and network hardware satellite systems and so on as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning ICT also includes analog technology such as paper communication and any mode that transmits communication br ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving It covers any product that will store retrieve manipulate process transmit or receive information electronically in a digital form e g personal computers including smartphones digital television email or robots Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals in the st century br br br Etymology br The phrase information and communication technologies has been used by academic researchers since the s The abbreviation ICT became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in and then in the revised National Curriculum for England Wales and Northern Ireland in However in the Royal Society recommended that the use of the term ICT should be discontinued in British schools as it has attracted too many negative connotations From the National Curriculum has used the word computing which reflects the addition of computer programming into the curriculum br Variations of the phrase have spread worldwide The United Nations has created a United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force and an internal Office of Information and Communications Technology br br br Monetization br The money spent on IT worldwide has been estimated as US trillion in and has been growing at less than per year since The estimate growth of the entire ICT is The biggest growth of is expected in the area of new technologies IoT Robotics AR VR and AI br The IT budget of the US federal government was nearly billion IT costs as a percentage of corporate revenue have grown since putting a strain on IT budgets When looking at current companies IT budgets are recurrent costs used to keep the lights on in the IT department and are the cost of new initiatives for technology development br The average IT budget has the following breakdown br br personnel costs internal after correction br software costs external purchasing category after correction br hardware costs external purchasing category after correction br costs of external service providers external services after correction br The estimate of money to be spent in is just over US trillion br br br Technological capacity br The world s technological capacity to store information grew from optimally compressed exabytes in to in over in and to optimally compressed exabytes in and some zetta bytes in This is the informational equivalent to stacks of CD ROM from the earth to the moon in and the equivalent of stacks of printed books from the earth to the sun in br The world s technological capacity to receive information through one way broadcast networks was exabytes of optimally compressed information in optimally compressed exabytes in optimally compressed zettabytes in and zettabytes in br The world s effective capacity to exchange information through two way telecommunication networks was petabytes of optimally compressed information in petabytes in optimally compressed exabytes in optimally compressed exabytes in and some exabytes in br The world s technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general purpose computers grew from MIPS in to x MIPS in br br br Sector in the OECD br The following is a list of OECD countries by share of ICT sector in total value added in br br br ICT Development Index br The ICT Development Index ranks and compares the level of ICT use and access across the various countries around the world In ITU International Telecommunication Union released the latest rankings of the IDI with Denmark attaining the top spot followed by South Korea The top countries in the rankings include most high income countries where the quality of life is higher than average which includes countries from Europe and other regions such as Australia Bahrain Canada Japan Macao China New Zealand Singapore and the United States almost all countries surveyed improved their IDI ranking this year br br br The WSIS process and development goals br On December the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution endorsing the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society WSIS to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing today s information society According to this resolution the General Assembly related the Summit to the United Nations Millennium Declaration s goal of implementing ICT to achieve Millennium Development Goals It also emphasized a multi stakeholder approach to achieve these goals using all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector in addition to governments br To help anchor and expand ICT to every habitable part of the world is the deadline for achievements of the UN Millennium Development Goals MDGs which global leaders agreed upon in the year br br br In education br There is evidence that to be effective in education ICT must be fully integrated into the pedagogy Specifically when teaching literacy and math using ICT in combination with Writing to Learn produces better results than traditional methods alone or ICT alone br The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO a division of the United Nations has made integrating ICT into education as part of its efforts to ensure equity and access to education The following which was taken directly from a UNESCO publication on educational ICT explains the organization s position on the initiative Information and Communication Technology can contribute to universal access to education equity in education the delivery of quality learning and teaching teachers professional development and more efficient education management governance and administration UNESCO takes a holistic and comprehensive approach to promote ICT in education Access inclusion and quality are among the main challenges they can address The Organization s Intersectoral Platform for ICT in education focuses on these issues through the joint work of three of its sectors Communication Information Education and Science br br Despite the power of computers to enhance and reform teaching and learning practices improper implementation is a widespread issue beyond the reach of increased funding and technological advances with little evidence that teachers and tutors are properly integrating ICT into everyday learning Intrinsic barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all as result in varying effectiveness in the integration of ICT in the classroom br br br Mobile learning for refugees br br School environments play an important role in facilitating language learning However language and literacy barriers are obstacles preventing refugees from accessing and attending school especially outside camp settings br Mobile assisted language learning apps are key tools for language learning Mobile solutions can provide support for refugees language and literacy challenges in three main areas literacy development foreign language learning and translations Mobile technology is relevant because communicative practice is a key asset for refugees and immigrants as they immerse themselves in a new language and a new society Well designed mobile language learning activities connect refugees with mainstream cultures helping them learn in authentic contexts br br br Developing countries br br br Africa br br ICT has been employed as an educational enhancement in Sub Saharan Africa since the s Beginning with television and radio it extended the reach of education from the classroom to the living room and to geographical areas that had been beyond the reach of the traditional classroom As the technology evolved and became more widely used efforts in Sub Saharan Africa were also expanded In the s a massive effort to push computer hardware and software into schools was undertaken with the goal of familiarizing both students and teachers with computers in the classroom Since then multiple projects have endeavoured to continue the expansion of ICT s reach in the region including the One Laptop Per Child OLPC project which by had distributed over million laptops to nearly two million students and teachers br The inclusion of ICT in the classroom often referred to as M Learning has expanded the reach of educators and improved their ability to track student progress in Sub Saharan Africa In particular the mobile phone has been most important in this effort Mobile phone use is widespread and mobile networks cover a wider area than internet networks in the region The devices are familiar to student teacher and parent and allow increased communication and access to educational materials In addition to benefits for students M learning also offers the opportunity for better teacher training which leads to a more consistent curriculum across the educational service area In UNESCO started a yearly symposium called Mobile Learning Week with the purpose of gathering stakeholders to discuss the M learning initiative br Implementation is not without its challenges While mobile phone and internet use are increasing much more rapidly in Sub Saharan Africa than in other developing countries the progress is still slow compared to the rest of the developed world with smartphone penetration only expected to reach by Additionally there are gender social and geo political barriers to educational access and the severity of these barriers vary greatly by country Overall million children in Sub Saharan Africa were not in school in the year owing not just to the geographical divide but also to political instability the importance of social origins social structure and gender inequality Once in school students also face barriers to quality education such as teacher competency training and preparedness access to educational materials and lack of information management br br br Growth in modern society and developing countries br In modern society ICT is ever present with over three billion people having access to the Internet With approximately out of Internet users owning a smartphone information and data are increasing by leaps and bounds This rapid growth especially in developing countries has led ICT to become a keystone of everyday life in which life without some facet of technology renders most of clerical work and routine tasks dysfunctional br The most recent authoritative data released in shows that Internet use continues to grow steadily at globally in in developed countries in the developing world the number of Internet users in developing countries has doubled in five years with two thirds of all people online now living in the developing world br br br Limitations br However hurdles are still large Of the billion people not yet using the Internet live in developing countries In the world s Least Connected Countries LCCs which are home to billion people access to ICTs remains largely out of reach particularly for these countries large rural populations ICT has yet to penetrate the remote areas of some countries with many developing countries dearth of any type of Internet This also includes the availability of telephone lines particularly the availability of cellular coverage and other forms of electronic transmission of data The latest Measuring the Information Society Report cautiously stated that the increase in the aforementioned cellular data coverage is ostensible as many users have multiple subscriptions with global growth figures sometimes translating into little real improvement in the level of connectivity of those at the very bottom of the pyramid an estimated million people worldwide live in places which are still out of reach of mobile cellular service br Favourably the gap between the access to the Internet and mobile coverage has decreased substantially in the last fifteen years in which was the deadline for achievements of the UN Millennium Development Goals MDGs which global leaders agreed upon in the year and the new data show ICT progress and highlight remaining gaps ICT continues to take on a new form with nanotechnology set to usher in a new wave of ICT electronics and gadgets ICT newest editions into the modern electronic world include smartwatches such as the Apple Watch smart wristbands such as the Nike FuelBand and smart TVs such as Google TV With desktops soon becoming part of a bygone era and laptops becoming the preferred method of computing ICT continues to insinuate and alter itself in the ever changing globe br Information communication technologies play a role in facilitating accelerated pluralism in new social movements today The internet according to Bruce Bimber is accelerating the process of issue group formation and action and coined the term accelerated pluralism to explain this new phenomena ICTs are tools for enabling social movement leaders and empowering dictators in effect promoting societal change ICTs can be used to garner grassroots support for a cause due to the internet allowing for political discourse and direct interventions with state policy as well as change the way complaints from the populace are handled by governments Furthermore ICTs in a household are associated with women rejecting justifications for intimate partner violence According to a study published in this is likely because access to ICTs exposes women to different ways of life and different notions about women s role in society and the household especially in culturally conservative regions where traditional gender expectations contrast observed alternatives br br br In health care br Telehealth br A review found that in general outcomes of such ICT use which were envisioned as early as are or can be as good as in person care with health care use staying similar br Artificial intelligence in healthcare br Use and development of software for COVID pandemic mitigation br mHealth br Clinical decision support systems and expert systems br Health administration and hospital information systems br Other health information technology and health informatics br br br In science br Applications of ICTs in science research and development and academia include br br Internet research br Online research methods br Science communication and communication between scientists br Scholarly databases br Applied metascience br br br Models of access br Scholar Mark Warschauer defines a models of access framework for analyzing ICT accessibility In the second chapter of his book Technology and Social Inclusion Rethinking the Digital Divide he describes three models of access to ICTs devices conduits and literacy Devices and conduits are the most common descriptors for access to ICTs but they are insufficient for meaningful access to ICTs without third model of access literacy Combined these three models roughly incorporate all twelve of the criteria of Real Access to ICT use conceptualized by a non profit organization called Bridges org in br br Physical access to technology br Appropriateness of technology br Affordability of technology and technology use br Human capacity and training br Locally relevant content applications and services br Integration into daily routines br Socio cultural factors br Trust in technology br Local economic environment br Macro economic environment br Legal and regulatory framework br Political will and public support br br br Devices br The most straightforward model of access for ICT in Warschauer s theory is devices In this model access is defined most simply as the ownership of a device such as a phone or computer Warschauer identifies many flaws with this model including its inability to account for additional costs of ownership such as software access to telecommunications knowledge gaps surrounding computer use and the role of government regulation in some countries Therefore Warschauer argues that considering only devices understates the magnitude of digital inequality For example the Pew Research Center notes that of Americans own a smartphone although most scholars in this field would contend that comprehensive access to ICT in the United States is likely much lower than that br br br Conduits br A conduit requires a connection to a supply line which for ICT could be a telephone line or Internet line Accessing the supply requires investment in the proper infrastructure from a commercial company or local government and recurring payments from the user once the line is set up For this reason conduits usually divide people based on their geographic locations As a Pew Research Center poll reports rural Americans are less likely to have broadband access than other Americans thereby making them less likely to own the devices Additionally these costs can be prohibitive to lower income families accessing ICTs These difficulties have led to a shift toward mobile technology fewer people are purchasing broadband connection and are instead relying on their smartphones for Internet access which can be found for free at public places such as libraries Indeed smartphones are on the rise with of Americans using smartphones as their primary medium for internet access and of Americans owning a smartphone br br br Literacy br br In Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole studied a tribe in Liberia the Vai people who have their own local script Since about half of those literate in Vai have never had formal schooling Scribner and Cole were able to test more than subjects to measure the mental capabilities of literates over non literates This research which they laid out in their book The Psychology of Literacy allowed them to study whether the literacy divide exists at the individual level Warschauer applied their literacy research to ICT literacy as part of his model of ICT access br Scribner and Cole found no generalizable cognitive benefits from Vai literacy instead individual differences on cognitive tasks were due to other factors like schooling or living environment The results suggested that there is no single construct of literacy that divides people into two cognitive camps rather there are gradations and types of literacies with a range of benefits closely related to the specific functions of literacy practices Furthermore literacy and social development are intertwined and the literacy divide does not exist on the individual level br br Warschauer draws on Scribner and Cole s research to argue that ICT literacy functions similarly to literacy acquisition as they both require resources rather than a narrow cognitive skill Conclusions about literacy serve as the basis for a theory of the digital divide and ICT access as detailed below There is not just one type of ICT access but many types The meaning and value of access varies in particular social contexts Access exists in gradations rather than in a bipolar opposition Computer and Internet use brings no automatic benefit outside of its particular functions ICT use is a social practice involving access to physical artifacts content skills and social support And acquisition of ICT access is a matter not only of education but also of power Therefore Warschauer concludes that access to ICT cannot rest on devices or conduits alone it must also engage physical digital human and social resources Each of these categories of resources have iterative relations with ICT use If ICT is used well it can promote these resources but if it is used poorly it can contribute to a cycle of underdevelopment and exclusion br br br Environmental impact br br br Progress during the century br In the early st century a rapid development of ICT services and electronical devices took place in which the internet servers multiplied by a factor of to million and its still increasing This increase can be explained by moores law which states that the development of ICT increases every year by so it will double in numbers every four to five years Alongside this development and the high investments in increasing demand for ICT capable products a high environmental impact came with it Software and Hardware development as well as production causing already in the same amount of CO emissions as global air travels br There are two sides of ICT the positive environmental possibilities and the shadow side On the positive side studies proved that for instance in the OECD countries a reduction of energy use is caused by an increase in ICT capital by On the other side the more digitization is happening the more energy is consumed that means for OECD countries increase in internet users causes a raise of electricity consumption per capita and for emerging countries the impact is more than times as high br Currently the scientific forecasts are showing an increase up to TWh in which is times more than it was in br br br Implication br To tackle the environmental issues of ICT the EU commission plans proper monitoring and reporting of the GHG emissions of different ICT platforms countries and infrastructure in general Further the establishment of international norms for reporting and compliance are promoted to foster transparency in this sector br Moreover it is suggested by scientists to make more ICT investments to exploit the potentials of ICT to alleviate CO emissions in general and to implement a more effective coordination of ICT energy and growth policies Consequently applying the principle of the coase theorem makes sense It recommends to make investments there where the marginal avoidance costs of emissions are the lowest therefore in the developing countries with comparatively lower technological standards and policies as high tech countries With these measures ICT can reduce environmental damage from economic growth and energy consumption by facilitating communication and infrastructure br br br In problem solving br ICTs could also be used to address environmental issues including climate change in various ways including ways beyond education br br br See also br br br br br br Sources br This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed under CC BY SA IGO Text taken from A Lifeline to learning
