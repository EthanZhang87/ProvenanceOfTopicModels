On August Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan pipeline was subject to a terrorist attack near Refahiye in Turkey responsibility for which was originally taken by Kurdistan Workers Party PKK but there is

Without Borders criticized the internet attacks The Internet has become a battleground in which information is the first victim br The attacks involved Denial of service attacks The New York Times

Russian hosting offices did not cease on August and stopgeorgia ru a Russian anti Georgian website was still running br On August The Washington Post reported that although a cease fire was reached communication infrastructure could not completely resume normal operation br br br Analysis br The Russian authorities denied the allegations that they were responsible for the attacks instead pointing the finger at ordinary citizens It was asserted that the Russian Business Network RBN the group from Saint Petersburg organised these cyber attacks RBN was considered to be one of leading cyber crime networks in the world whose founder allegedly is related to an influential person in Russian politics br Dancho Danchev a Bulgarian Internet security analyst claimed that the Russian attacks on Georgian websites used all the success factors for total outsourcing of the bandwidth capacity and legal responsibility to the average Internet user br Security researcher for Arbor Networks Jose Nazario told CNET that Georgian assault on the website of Russian newspaper served as a proof of actual Georgian response to the cyber attacks br Don Jackson an employee of Secureworks observed that botnets were prepared to attack Georgia in advance before the war These botnets became operational just before Russian bombing of Georgia commenced on August Don Jackson lent credence to the idea that the Russian government was behind the attack rather than the RBN Furthermore Jackson found that not all the computers that were assaulting Georgian websites were controlled by RBN servers but also were using Internet addresses belonging to state owned telecommunications companies in Russia br The CNN reported that according to specialists the cyberwar against Georgia signals a new kind of cyberwar one for which the United States is not fully prepared br The ex chief of Computer Emergency Response Team of Israel Gadi Evron believed the attacks on Georgian internet infrastructure resembled a cyber rampage rather than cyber warfare Evron admitted that although the attacks could be indirect Russian military action the attackers could have attacked more strategic targets or eliminated the Georgian Internet infrastructure kinetically Six distinct botnets managed by distinct servers were accounted for by Shadowserver Foundation br Jonathan Zittrain one of the founders of Harvard s Berkman Klein Center for Internet Society said that the Russian army was capable of targeting Georgia s Internet infrastructure while Bill Woodcock the research director at Packet Clearing House suggested the attacks were professionally coordinated The Russian newspaper pro Georgian Skandaly ru was also targeted by attacks upon which Woodcock commented This was the first time that they ever attacked an internal and an external target as part of the same attack The attack script against Georgia was discovered on almost every Russian news site by Gary Warner an expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Bill Woodcock also said cyber attacks would stay around as a part of military campaigns in the future due to their low cost br The Economist described in detail in December how detailed manuals how to carry out DDoS attack against Georgian sites was available for any volunteer on Russian sites such as StopGeorgia Even the US and UK embassies Tbilisi were designated targets The paper could not definitely link the attacks to the Russian authorities br In March Greylogic researchers assumed that the attacks were possibly conducted by Russian GRU and the FSB who used the Stopgeorgia ru forum as a facade to cover up the state responsibility br John Bumgarner member of the United States Cyber Consequences Unit US CCU did a research on the cyberattacks during the Russo Georgian War The report published in August concluded that the Russian cyber warfare against Georgia stressed the importance of worldwide partnership to ensure cyber safety The report stated that the Russian military planning was known to the cyber attackers who were supposedly civilians Bumgarner s research concluded that The first wave of cyber attacks launched against Georgian media sites were in line with tactics used in military operations Most of the cyber attack tools used in the campaign appear to have been written or customized to some degree specifically for the campaign against Georgia the research stated The attackers possibly knew that the invasion of Georgia would begin before it even started br Michael Chertoff wrote in that the war demonstrated that the cyber war was the war of the future The US Department of Defense published the first cyber strategy br br br See also br cyberattacks on Estonia br Cyxymu br Cyberwarfare in
