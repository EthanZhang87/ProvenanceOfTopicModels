id: 62276
Belgium is a constitutional hereditary and popular monarchy The monarch is titled King or Queen of the Belgians Dutch Koning in der Belgen French Roi Reine des Belges German K nig in der Belgier and serves as the country s head of state and commander in chief of the Belgian Armed Forces There have been seven Belgian monarchs since independence in br The incumbent Philippe ascended the throne on July following the abdication of his father Albert II br br br Origins br br When Belgium gained independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government The Congress voted on the question on November supporting monarchy by votes to In February the Congress nominated Louis Duke of Nemours the son of the French king Louis Philippe but international considerations deterred Louis Philippe from accepting the honour for his son br Following this refusal the National Congress appointed Erasme Louis Baron Surlet de Chokier to be the Regent of Belgium on February Leopold of Saxe Coburg Saalfeld since also called Prince of Saxe Coburg and Gotha was designated as King of the Belgians by the National Congress and swore allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of Saint James s Church at Coudenberg Palace in Brussels on July This day has since become a national holiday for Belgium and its citizens br br br Hereditary and constitutional br As a hereditary constitutional monarchy system the role and operation of Belgium s monarchy are governed by the Constitution The royal office of King is designated solely for a descendant of the first King of the Belgians Leopold I br Since he is bound by the Constitution above all other ideological and religious considerations political opinions and debates and economic interests the King is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of Belgian national unity and independence Belgium s monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing in ceremony br The Kingdom of Belgium was never an absolute monarchy Nevertheless in the historian Ramon Arango wrote that the Belgian monarchy is not truly constitutional br br br Leopold I Leopold II and Albert I br King Leopold I was head of Foreign Affairs as an ancien r gime monarch the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king Leopold I quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the Soci t G n rale de Belgique br br Leopold s son King Leopold II is chiefly remembered for the founding and capitalization of the Congo Free State as a personal fiefdom There was scandal when the atrocities in the Congo Free State were made public causing the Free State to be taken over by the Belgian Government Many Congolese were killed as a result of Leopold s policies in the Congo before the reforms of direct Belgian rule The Free State scandal is discussed at the Museum of the Congo at Tervuren in Belgium br On several occasions Leopold II publicly expressed disagreement with the ruling government e g on August and in against Prime Minister Auguste Beernaert and was accused by Yvon Gouet of noncompliance with the country s parliamentary system br Leopold II died without surviving legitimate sons The line now descends from his nephew and successor Albert I of Belgium who ruled while of Belgium was overrun by the forces of Kaiser Wilhelm II and is notable for his forays into colonial rule of the Belgian Congo and later abeyant Wilhelm the League of Nations mandate in Ruanda Urundi In Albert died under mysterious circumstances as he climbed solo on the Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche les Dames br br br Leopold III and Baudouin br Louis Wodon the chef de cabinet of Leopold III from to thought the King s oath to the Constitution implied a royal position over and above the Constitution He compared the King to a father the head of a family Regarding the moral mission of the king it is permissible to point to a certain analogy between his role and that of a father or more generally of parents in a family The family is of course a legal institution as is the state But what would a family be where everything was limited among those who compose it to simply legal relationships In a family when one considers only legal relationships one comes very close to a breakdown in the moral ties founded on reciprocal affection without which a family would be like any other fragile association According to Arango Leopold III of Belgium shared these views about the Belgian monarchy br In towards the end of the reign of Baudouin Senator Yves de Wasseige a former member of the Belgian Constitutional Court cited four points of democracy which the Belgian Constitution lacks br br the King chooses the ministers br the King is able to influence the ministers when he speaks with them about bills projects and nominations br the King promulgates bills and br the King must agree to any change of the Constitution br br br Constitutional political and historical consequences br The Belgian monarchy was from the beginning a constitutional monarchy patterned after that of the United Kingdom Raymond Fusilier wrote the Belgian regime of was also inspired by the French Constitution of the Kingdom of France the United States Declaration of Independence of and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces It should be observed that all monarchies have suffered periods of change as a result of which the power of the sovereign was reduced but for the most part those periods occurred before the development of the system of constitutional monarchy and were steps leading to its establishment The characteristic evidence of this is in Great Britain where there was an evolution from the time when kings ruled through the agency of ministers to that time when ministers began to govern through the instrumentality of the Crown br Unlike the British constitutional system in Belgium the monarchy underwent a belated evolution which came after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system because in an independent state parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously Hans Daalder professor of political science at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden wrote Did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision which implied that the view of the King as the Keeper of the Nation with rights and duties of its own retained legitimacy br For Raymond Fusilier the Belgian monarchy had to be placed at least in the beginning between the regimes where the king rules and those in which the king does not rule but only reigns The Belgian monarchy is closer to the principle the King does not rule but the Belgian kings were not only at the head of the dignified part of the Constitution The Belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the King s will coincides with that of the ministers who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government For Francis Delp r e to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the State The Belgian historian Jean Stengers wrote that some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity That is very naive He is only a piece on the chessboard but a piece which matters br br br List of kings of the Belgians br br The monarchs of Belgium originally belonged to the House of Saxe Coburg and Gotha The family name was changed by Albert I in to the House of Belgium and the armorial bearings of Saxony from the House of Saxe Coburg Gotha were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms br In the King Phillippe codified the coats of arms of himself and those of his family through a Royal Decree The personal arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe Coburg Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians The national Coat of arms of Belgium remains unchanged i e it does not incorporate the Saxon arms br Since the Carnet Mondain the title Saxe Cobourg Gotha along with of Belgium is again in use for all the descendants of Leopold I with the exception of King Philippe his wife his sister and his brother who keep their title of Belgium therefore the descendants of Astrid of Belgium do not bear this title but that of of Austria Este of their father br For completeness the family tree should include Princess Delphine of Belgium born Princess Delphine is the legally acknowledged half sibling of King Philippe of Belgium and her children are also recognised as members of the royal family br br br Title br The proper title of the Belgian monarch is King of the Belgians rather than King of Belgium as is common for other monarchies throughout Europe The title is linked to a concept of popular monarchy as defined by Kingsley Martin in his work The Evolution of Popular Monarchy published in According to Martin the term is meant to emphasize the bond and connection to the people of the land over the territory the state controls His work further implies that such a monarch is de facto appointed by the people as a nominal figurehead rather than being an authoritarian ruler br Belgium is the only extant European monarchy in which the heir to the throne does not ascend immediately upon the death or abdication of his or her predecessor According to Article of the Belgian constitution the heir accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament The joint session has to be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch The new Belgian monarch is required to take the Belgian constitutional oath I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory which is uttered in the three official languages French Dutch and German br Members of the Belgian royal family are often known by two names a Dutch and a French one For example the current monarch is called Philippe in French and Filip in Dutch the fifth King of the Belgians was Baudouin in French and Boudewijn in Dutch br In contrast to King Philippe s title of King of the Belgians Princess Elisabeth is called Princess of Belgium as the title Prince of the Belgians does not exist She is also Duchess of Brabant the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Belgian throne This title precedes the title Princess of Belgium br In the other official language of German monarchs are usually referred to by their French names The same is true for English with the exception of Leopold where the accent is removed for the purpose of simplicity br Because of the First World War and the resultant strong anti German sentiment the family name was changed in from Saxe Coburg Gotha to van Belgi de Belgique or von Belgien of Belgium depending upon which of the country s three official languages Dutch French and German is in use It is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by Belgium s royalty e g marriage licenses In addition to this change of name the armorial bearings of Saxony were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms see above Other Coburgers from the multi branched Saxe Coburg family have also changed their name such as George V who adopted the family name of Windsor after the British royal family s place of residence Only Simeon Sakskoburggotski kept his Saxony Coburg family name but he was ousted from the Bulgarian throne in at the age of nine br Nevertheless the Royal Decree published on July and signed on July by King Philip reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in the all royal versions of the family s coat of arms The reinstatement of the Saxe Coburg Gotha main royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philip and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle br br br Constitutional role br br The Belgian monarchy symbolises and maintains a feeling of national unity by representing the country in public functions and international meetings br In addition the monarch has a number of responsibilities in the process of the formation of the Government The procedure usually begins with the nomination of the Informateur by the monarch After the general election the Informateur officially informs the monarch of the main political formations which may be available for governance After this phase the monarch can appoint another informateur or appoint a Formateur who will have the charge of forming a new government of which he or she generally becomes the Prime Minister br Article of the Constitution of Belgium vests the federal executive power in the monarch Under Section III this power includes the appointment and dismissal of ministers the implementation of the laws passed by the Federal Parliament the submission of bills to the Federal Parliament and the management of international relations The monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by Parliament In accordance with Article of the Belgian Constitution the monarch is required to exercise his powers through the ministers His acts are not valid without the countersignature of the responsible minister who in doing so assumes political responsibility for the act in question This means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the Federal Government which is accountable to the Chamber of Representatives in accordance with Article of the Constitution br The monarch receives the prime minister at the Palace of Brussels at least once a week and also regularly calls other members of the government to the palace in order to discuss political matters During these meetings the monarch has the right to be informed of proposed governmental policies the right to advise and the right to warn on any matter as the monarch sees fit The monarch also holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties and regular members of parliament All of these meetings are organised by the monarch s personal political cabinet which is part of the Royal Household br The monarch is the Commander in Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces and makes appointments to the higher positions The names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the Ministry of Defence The monarch s military duties are carried out with the help of the Military Household which is headed by a General office Belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers br The monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power in accordance with the Belgian Constitution together with the two chambers of the Federal Parliament the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate All laws passed by the Federal Parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch br Previously children of the King were entitled to a seat in the senate Senator by right when they were This right was abolished in as part of the Sixth Belgian state reform br br br Inviolability br br The Inviolability of Monarchy is a legal principle in Belgium that protects the King or Queen from legal prosecution civil or criminal during their reign This principle is enshrined in Article of the Belgian Constitution br According to this principle the King or Queen cannot be held responsible for their actions as monarch nor can they be subjected to legal proceedings during their reign This is intended to ensure that the monarch can perform their duties without fear of political interference or retribution br However it is important to note that the principle of inviolability does not extend to the actions of the monarch outside of their official duties If a monarch commits a crime or engages in unlawful activities outside of their role as head of state they can still be held legally accountable for their actions br In Belgium the principle of inviolability is seen as an important safeguard for the constitutional monarchy which is a key component of the country s political system It is also seen as a way to ensure that the monarch can act as a unifying figure for the country representing all Belgians regardless of political affiliation or ideology br Overall the principle of inviolability of the monarchy in Belgium is a key feature of the country s political system designed to protect the monarch and preserve the stability of the constitutional monarchy br br br Traditions br The Court still keeps some old traditions most famous is the tradition that the Reigning King of the Belgians becomes the godfather of a seventh son and the Queen the godmother of a seventh daughter The child is then given the name of the Sovereign and receives a gift from the palace and Burgomaster of the city br Similar traditions are attached to the Russian Tsar and the President of Argentina br Another tradition is the centuries old ceremonial welcome the new king receives in the country during the Joyous Entry this tradition apparently dates back to the Dukes of Brabant br br br Popular support br Popular support for the monarchy had historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia The generally pro monarchy Catholic Party and later Christian Social Party dominated in Flanders while the more industrialised Wallonia had more support for the Belgian Labour Party and later Socialist Party For example the referendum saw Flanders voting strongly in favour of King Leopold III returning whereas Wallonia was largely against However in recent decades these roles have reversed as religiosity in Flanders has decreased and the King is seen as protecting the country against Flemish separatism and the country s partition br br br Royal Household br br The King s Household Dutch Het Huis van de Koning French La Maison du Roi German Das Haus des K nigs was reorganised in and consists of seven autonomous departments and the Court s
