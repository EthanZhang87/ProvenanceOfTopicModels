International Business Machines Corporation using the trademark IBM nicknamed Big Blue is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk New York and present in over countries IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the world with research facilities across a dozen countries having held the record for most annual U S patents generated by a business for consecutive years from to br IBM was founded in as the Computing Tabulating Recording Company CTR a holding company of manufacturers of record keeping and measuring systems It was renamed International Business Machines in and soon became the leading manufacturer of punch card tabulating systems During the s and s the IBM mainframe exemplified by the System was the world s dominant computing platform with the company producing percent of computers in the U S and percent of computers worldwide br IBM entered the microcomputer market in the s with the IBM Personal Computer which soon became known as PC one of IBM s best selling products Due to a lack of foresight by IBM the PC was not well protected by intellectual property laws As a consequence IBM quickly began losing its market dominance to emerging competitors in the PC market while at the same time the openness of the PC platform has ensured PC s longevity as the most popular microcomputer standard br Beginning in the s the company began downsizing its operations and divesting from commodity production most notably selling its personal computer division to the Lenovo Group in IBM has since concentrated on computer services software supercomputers and scientific research Since its supercomputers have consistently ranked among the most powerful in the world and in it became the first company to generate more than patents in one year beating this record in with over patents As of the company held patents br As one of the world s oldest and largest technology companies IBM has been responsible for several technological innovations including the automated teller machine ATM dynamic random access memory DRAM the floppy disk the hard disk drive the magnetic stripe card the relational database the SQL programming language and the UPC barcode The company has made inroads in advanced computer chips quantum computing artificial intelligence and data infrastructure IBM employees and alumni have won

Average It is among the world s largest employers with over employees worldwide in Despite its relative decline within the technology sector IBM remains the seventh largest technology company by revenue and th largest overall company by revenue in the United States It is also consistently ranked among the world s most recognizable and valuable brands br br IBM originated with several technological innovations developed and commercialized in the late th century Julius E Pitrap patented the computing scale in Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record workers arrival and departure times on a paper tape On June their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company the Computing Tabulating Recording Company CTR based in Endicott New York The five companies had employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton New York Dayton Ohio Detroit Michigan Washington D C and Toronto Canada br Collectively the companies manufactured a wide array of machinery for sale and lease ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders meat and cheese slicers to tabulators and punched cards Thomas J Watson Sr fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson called on Flint and in was offered a position at CTR Watson joined CTR as general manager and then months later was made President when antitrust cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved Having learned Patterson s pioneering business practices Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR s companies He implemented sales conventions generous sales incentives a focus on customer service an insistence on well groomed dark suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker His favorite slogan THINK became a mantra for each company s employees During Watson s first four years revenues reached million million today and the company s operations expanded to Europe South America Asia and Australia Watson never liked the clumsy hyphenated name Computing Tabulating Recording Company and chose to replace it with the more expansive title International Business Machines which had previously been used as the name of CTR s Canadian Division the name was changed on February By most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company IBM br br The Nazis made extensive use of Hollerith punch card and alphabetical accounting equipment and IBM s majority owned German subsidiary Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH Dehomag supplied this equipment from the early s This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to

companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications It was followed by the IBM System in Together the and made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early s They and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS VS and MVS and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor had a near monopoly level market share and became the thing IBM was most known for during this period
