title: Dihydrogen monoxide parody
id: 623166
The dihydrogen monoxide parody is a parody that involves calling water by an unfamiliar chemical name usually dihydrogen monoxide DHMO and listing some of water s properties in a particularly alarming manner such as accelerating corrosion rust and causing suffocation drowning It often calls for dihydrogen monoxide to be banned regulated or labeled as dangerous It plays into chemophobia and demonstrates how a lack of scientific literacy and an exaggerated analysis can lead to misplaced fears The parody has been used with other chemical names for water such as hydrogen hydroxide dihydrogen oxide and hydric acid It is also used in many prank shows to scare people as they think it is a lethal acid br br br History br In on April Fools Day an edition of the Durand Express a weekly newspaper in Durand Michigan reported that dihydrogen oxide had been found in the city s water pipes and warned that it was fatal if inhaled and could produce blistering vapors The first appearance of the parody on the Internet was attributed to the Coalition to Ban Dihydrogen Monoxide a parody organization at the University of California Santa Cruz following on campus postings and newsgroup discussions in br This new version of the parody was created by housemates while attending UC Santa Cruz in revised by Craig Jackson in and was published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact in March It received widespread public attention in when Nathan Zohner a year old student gathered petitions to ban DHMO as the basis of his science project titled How Gullible Are We br Jackson s original site included the following warning br br A mock material safety data sheet has also been created for DHMO br br br Molecular terminology and naming conventions br The water molecule has the chemical formula H O meaning the molecule is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom Literally the term dihydrogen monoxide means two hydrogen one oxygen the prefix di in dihydrogen means two the prefix mono in monoxide means one and oxide designates oxygen in a compound the consecutive o s that would occur in monooxide are combined into one br Using chemical nomenclature other names for water include hydrogen oxide hydrogen hydroxide which characterises it as a base and several designating it as an acid such as hydric acid or hydroxyl acid The term used in the original text hydroxyl acid is a non standard name br Under the revisions of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry there is no single correct name for every compound The primary function of chemical nomenclature is to ensure that each name refers unambiguously to a single substance It is considered less important to ensure that each substance should have a single unambiguous name although the number of acceptable names is limited Water is one acceptable name for this compound even though it is neither a systematic nor an international name and is specific to just one phase of the compound its liquid form The other IUPAC recommendation is oxidane br br br Public use br br In several students circulated a dihydrogen monoxide contamination warning on the University of California Santa Cruz campus via photocopied fliers br In Craig Jackson created a web page for the Coalition to Ban DHMO br The Friends of Hydrogen Hydroxide website was created by Dan Curtis Johnson partly as a foil on the Coalition page claiming to oppose its subversive agenda The site points out that hydrogen hydroxide is environmentally safe and enhances the functionality growth and health of many forms of life br In Nathan Zohner a year old student at Eagle Rock Junior High School in Idaho Falls Idaho gathered votes to ban the chemical out of ninth graders surveyed Zohner received the first prize at Greater Idaho Falls Science Fair for analysis of the results of his survey In recognition of his experiment journalist James K Glassman coined the term Zohnerism to refer to the use of a true fact to lead a scientifically and mathematically ignorant public to a false conclusion br In late drawing inspiration from Jackson s web page and Zohner s research Tom Way created a website at DHMO org including links to some legitimate sites such as the Environmental Protection Agency and National Institutes of Health br On April April Fools Day a member of the Australian Parliament announced a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide internationally br In a staffer in New Zealand Green Party MP Sue Kedgley s office responded to a request for support for a campaign to ban dihydrogen monoxide by saying she was absolutely supportive of the campaign to ban this toxic substance This was criticized in a press release by the National Party one of whose MPs fell for the very same joke six years later br In radio talk show host Neal Boortz mentioned on the air that the Atlanta water system had been checked and found to be contaminated with dihydrogen monoxide and set about relating the hazards associated with that dangerous chemical A local TV station even covered the scandal A spokesperson for the city s water system told the reporter that there was no more dihydrogen monoxide in the system than what was allowed under the law br The idea was used for a segment of an episode of the Penn Teller documentary show Penn Teller Bullshit in which actress Kris McGaha and a camera crew gathered signatures from people considering themselves concerned environmentalists to sign a petition to ban DHMO br In March Aliso Viejo California almost considered banning the use of foam containers at city sponsored events because dihydrogen monoxide is part of their production A paralegal had asked the city council to put it on the agenda he later attributed it to poor research The bill was pulled from the agenda before it could come to a vote but not before the city received a raft of bad publicity br In in Louisville Kentucky David Karem executive director of the Waterfront Development Corporation a public body that operates Waterfront Park wished to deter bathers from using a large public fountain Counting on a lack of understanding about water s chemical makeup he arranged for signs reading DANGER WATER CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF HYDROGEN KEEP OUT to be posted on the fountain at public expense br In Jacqui Dean New Zealand National Party MP fell for the joke writing a letter to Associate Minister of Health Jim Anderton asking Does the Expert Advisory Committee on Drugs have a view on the banning of this drug br On April then Canadian Member of Parliament Andrew Scheer who was later elected leader of the Conservative Party used the DHMO parody as the basis for an April Fool s Day media release on his website in which he claimed to have presented a bill to ban the substance from all federal government buildings br In February during the campaign of the Finnish parliamentary election a voting advice application asked the candidates whether the availability of hydric acid also known as dihydrogen monoxide should be restricted of the candidates answered in favor of the restriction br In April as part of an April Fools Day prank two radio personalities at Gator Country a station in Lee County Florida were suspended for a few days after telling listeners that dihydrogen monoxide was coming out of their water taps The prank resulted in several calls by consumers to the local utility company necessitating that the company send out a press release stating that the water was safe br br br See also br Sense and reference br br br br br
