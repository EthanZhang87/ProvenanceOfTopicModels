PolitiFact com is an American nonprofit project operated by the Poynter Institute in St Petersburg Florida with offices there and in Washington D C It began in as a project of the Tampa Bay Times then the St Petersburg Times with reporters and editors from the newspaper and its affiliated news media partners reporting on the accuracy of statements made by elected officials candidates their staffs lobbyists interest groups and others involved in U S politics Its journalists select original statements to evaluate and then publish their findings on the PolitiFact com website where each statement receives a Truth O Meter rating The ratings range from True for statements the journalists deem as accurate to Pants on Fire from the taunt Liar liar pants on fire for claims the journalists deem as not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim br PunditFact a related site that was also created by the Times editors is devoted to fact checking claims made by political pundits Both PolitiFact and PunditFact were funded primarily by the Tampa Bay Times and ad revenues generated on the website until and the Times continues to sell ads for the site now that it is part of Poynter Institute for Media Studies a non profit organization that also owns the newspaper PolitiFact increasingly relies on grants from several nonpartisan organizations and in launched a membership campaign and began accepting donations from readers br In addition to political claims the site monitors the progress elected officials make on their campaign promises including a Trump O Meter for President Donald Trump an Obameter for President Barack Obama and a Biden Promise Tracker for President Joe Biden PolitiFact com s local affiliates review promises by elected officials of regional relevance as evidenced by PolitiFact Tennessee s Haslam O Meter which tracked former Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam s rhetoric and Wisconsin s Walk O Meter which tracked former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker s efforts br PolitiFact won the Pulitzer Prize in for its reporting during the United States presidential election and has been praised and criticized by independent observers conservatives and liberals alike Both liberal and conservative bias have been alleged at different points and criticisms have been made that PolitiFact attempts to fact check statements that cannot be truly fact checked A survey of stories from to found that statements made by Republicans were almost three times as likely to be labeled as false as those of Democrats A larger analysis by the American Press Institute found that PolitiFact was statistically more likely to be critical of Republicans while a text analysis by the University of Washington in was not able to detect any systematic differences in the treatment of Democrats and Republicans in articles by PolitiFact but noted that the analysis cannot determine whether there are partisan biases in Politifact s judgments about truthfulness nor selection of which statements to examine br br br History br PolitiFact com was started in August by Times Washington Bureau Chief Bill Adair in conjunction with the Congressional Quarterly br In January PolitiFact com expanded to its second newspaper the Cox Enterprises owned Austin American Statesman in Austin Texas the feature called PolitiFact Texas covered issues that are relevant to Texas and the Austin area br In March the Times and its partner newspaper The Miami Herald launched PolitiFact Florida which focuses on Florida issues The Times and the Herald share resources on some stories that relate to Florida br Since then PolitiFact com expanded to other papers such as The Atlanta Journal Constitution The Providence Journal Milwaukee Journal Sentinel The Plain Dealer Richmond Times Dispatch the Knoxville News Sentinel and The Oregonian The Knoxville News Sentinel ended its relationship with PolitiFact com after br In Adair was named Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at Duke University and stepped down as Bureau Chief at the Times and as editor at PolitiFact com The Tampa Bay Times senior reporter Alex Leary succeeded Bill Adair as Bureau Chief on July and Angie Drobnic Holan was appointed editor of PolitiFact in October Adair remains a PolitiFact com contributing editor br In The Plain Dealer ended its partnership with PolitiFact com after they reduced their news staff and were unwilling to meet the required several PolitiFact investigations per week br The organization was acquired in February by the Poynter Institute a non profit journalism education and news media research center that also owns the Tampa Bay Times br In March in preparation for the presidential elections PolitiFact partnered with Noticias Telemundo for fact checking of information given to the Spanish language audience In April PolitiFact joined forces with Kaiser Health News KHN for health news fact checking In October insight was given into PolitiFact s Truth O Meter s step by step process of assessing an item s truth as considered true by the Politifact team revealing confirmed facts and including accreditations br br br Lie of the Year br br Since PolitiFact com has declared one political statement from each year to be the Lie of the Year br br br In December they declared the Lie of the Year to be Sarah Palin s assertion that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of would lead to government death panels that dictated which types of patients would receive treatment br br br In December PolitiFact com dubbed the Lie of the Year to be the contention among some opponents of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that it represented a government takeover of healthcare PolitiFact com argued that this was not the case since all health care and insurance would remain in the hands of private companies br br br PolitiFact s Lie of the Year for was a statement by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee DCCC that a budget proposal by Congressman Paul Ryan entitled The Path to Prosperity and voted for overwhelmingly by Republicans in the House and Senate meant that Republicans voted to end Medicare PolitiFact determined that though it is true the Republican plan would change Medicare fundamentally by forcing the elderly to use private health plans the very thing Medicare was intended to substitute for a radically transformed program could still be termed Medicare so it was not technically true that Republicans voted to end Medicare PolitiFact had originally labeled nine similar statements as false or pants on fire since April br br br For PolitiFact chose the claim made by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that President Obama sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China at the cost of American jobs The Italians in the quote was a reference to Fiat who had purchased a majority share of Chrysler in after a U S government bailout of Chrysler PolitiFact had rated the claim Pants on Fire in October PolitiFact s assessment quoted a Chrysler spokesman who had said Jeep has no intention of shifting production of its Jeep models out of North America to China As of percent of Jeeps sold in the U S were assembled in the U S with roughly percent North American parts content The vehicle with the most North American parts content came in at br br br The Lie of the Year was President Barack Obama s promise that If you like your health care plan you can keep it As evidence PolitiFact cited analysts estimate of million cancellation letters sent to American health insurance consumers PolitiFact also noted that in an online poll readers overwhelmingly agreed with the selection This stands in stark contrast to its October statement that Obama s description of his plan is accurate and we rate his statement True br br br PolitiFact s Lie of the Year was Exaggerations about Ebola referring to separate statements made by various commentators and politicians about the Ebola virus being easy to catch that illegal immigrants may be carrying the virus across the southern border that it was all part of a government or corporate conspiracy These claims were made in the midst of the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa when four cases were diagnosed in the United States in travelers from West Africa and nurses who treated them PolitiFact wrote The claims all wrong distorted the debate about a serious public health issue br br br PolitiFact s Lie of the Year was the various statements made by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump Politifact found that of Trump s statements that they reviewed were rated Mostly False False or Pants on Fire Statements that were rated Pants on Fire included his assertion that the Mexican government sends the bad ones over the border into the United States and his claim that he saw thousands and thousands of people cheering the collapse of the World Trade Center on br br br PolitiFact s Lie of the Year was fake news referring to fabricated news stories including the Pizzagate conspiracy theory br br br PolitiFact s Lie of the Year was Donald Trump s claim that Russian election interference is a made up story The annual poll found of the respondents agreed that Trump s Pants on Fire statement deserved the distinction Raul Labrador s statement that Nobody dies because they don t have access to health care and Sean Spicer s statement that Trump s audience was the largest audience to witness an inauguration period came in second and third place getting and of the vote respectively In its article PolitiFact points to multiple occasions where Donald Trump stated that Russia had not interfered with the election despite multiple government agencies claiming otherwise br br br Politifact s Lie of the Year was that survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting were crisis actors These conspiracy theories were spread on blogs and social media by sources including InfoWars and targeted students including X Gonz lez and David Hogg who became prominent gun control activists in the wake of the shooting and helped organize the March for our Lives br br br Politifact s Lie of the Year was Donald Trump s claim that the anonymous whistleblower who reported possible presidential misconduct got the report of his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky almost completely wrong The whistleblower complaint alleged that President Trump urged President Zelensky to conduct an investigation into Trump s political rival in return for promised military aid br br br The Lie of the Year was misinformation related to the COVID pandemic specifically theories that either deny the existence of the disease outright or claim that the disease is much less deadly than it actually is In particular Donald Trump was mentioned as a main supporter of such conspiracy theories br br br The Lie of the Year was lies related to the United States Capitol attack and its significance br br br The Lie of the Year was disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine being propagated by Vladimir Putin br br br Reception br PolitiFact com was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in for its fact checking initiative during the presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than political claims separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters br A Wall Street Journal opinion editorial by Joseph Rago in December called PolitiFact part of a larger journalistic trend that seeks to recast all political debates as matters of lies misinformation and facts rather than differences of world view or principles br TV critic James Poniewozik at Time characterized PolitiFact as having the hard earned and important position as referee in the mudslinging contest a truth vigilante as it were and PolitiFact is trying to do the right thing here And despite the efforts of partisans to work the refs by complaining about various calls they ve made in the past they re generally doing a hard important thing well They often do it better than the rest of the political media and the political press owes them for doing it Poniewozik also suggested they need to improve their rating system to address the irresponsible the unprovable the dubious Otherwise they re doing exactly what they were founded to stop using language to spread false impressions br Mark Hemingway writing in the neoconservative magazine The Weekly Standard criticized all fact checking projects by news organizations including PolitiFact the Associated Press and the Washington Post writing that they aren t about checking facts so much as they are about a rearguard action to keep inconvenient truths out of the conversation br In December Northeastern University journalism professor Dan Kennedy wrote in The Huffington Post that the problem with fact checking projects was there are only a finite number of statements that can be subjected to thumbs up thumbs down fact checking br Matt Welch in the February issue of Reason magazine criticized PolitiFact and other media fact checkers for focusing much more on statements by politicians about their opponents rather than statements by politicians and government officials about their own policies thus serving as a check on the exercise of rhetoric but not a check on the exercise of power br PolitiFact retracted its fact check about a lab leak as the possible origin of COVID The site had originally stated that the lab leak was a conspiracy theory that has been debunked since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic However after some scientists said they were too quick to discount a possible link the lab leak theory PolitiFact changed its evaluation of the claim to unsupported by evidence and in dispute br br br Allegations of political bias br br PolitiFact has drawn allegations of political bias from both left leaning and right leaning media outlets Overall right leaning outlets get more negative results from fact checkers than those on the left including at PolitiFact which some right wing commentators have interpreted as evidence of bias br In February University of Minnesota political science professor Eric Ostermeier analyzed PolitiFact stories issued from January through January He found that the number of statements analyzed from Republicans and from Democrats was comparable but Republicans had been assigned substantially harsher grades receiving false or pants on fire more than three times as often as Democrats The report found that In total of the statements by political figures judged false or pants on fire over the last month were given to Republicans or percent compared to just statements for Democrats percent br Ostermeier observed that PolitiFact was not transparent about how the comments were selected for analysis and raised the possibility that the more negative evaluations of Republican comments might be the result of selection bias concluding The question is not whether PolitiFact will ultimately convert skeptics on the right that they do not have ulterior motives in the selection of what statements are rated but whether the organization can give a convincing argument that either a Republicans in fact do lie much more than Democrats or b if they do not that it is immaterial that PolitiFact covers political discourse with a frame that suggests this is the case In response PolitiFact editor Bill Adair stated in MinnPost W e re accustomed to hearing strong reactions from people on both ends of the political spectrum We are a news organization and we choose which facts to check based on news judgment We check claims that we believe readers are curious about claims that would prompt them to wonder Is that true br An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University showed results consistent with the findings of the aforementioned study concluding that PolitiFact was three times as likely to rank statements from Republicans as Pants on Fire and twice as likely to rank statements from Democrats as Entirely True The disparity in these evaluations came despite roughly equally attention paid to statements made by representatives of the two parties percent for the GOP versus percent for the Democrats with percent attention paid to statements from independents br br br Funding br Since PolitiFact has received funding from br br br See also br br The Fact Checker br
