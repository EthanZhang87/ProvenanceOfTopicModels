id: 3169985
Wearside Jack is the nickname given to John Samuel Humble January July a British man who pretended to be the Yorkshire Ripper in a hoax audio recording and several letters during the period br Humble sent a taped message spoken in a Wearside accent and three letters taunting the authorities for failing to catch him The message recorded on an audio cassette caused the investigation to be moved away from the West Yorkshire area home of the real killer Peter Sutcliffe and thereby helped prolong his attacks on women and hindered his potential arrest for eighteen months br More than years after the event a fragment from one of Humble s envelopes was traced to him through DNA and in Humble was sentenced to eight years in prison for perverting the course of justice br br br The hoax br br br The three letters br Between March and the end of June Humble sent three letters claiming to be the Yorkshire Ripper Postmarked from Sunderland two were addressed to Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield of the West Yorkshire Police who was heading the Ripper inquiry and one to the Daily Mirror br First letter March br Written to Detective George Oldfield br br Dear Sir br I am sorry I cannot give my name for obvious reasons I am the Ripper I ve been dubbed a maniac by the Press but not by you you call me clever and I am You and your mates haven t a clue that photo in the paper gave me fits and that bit about killing myself no chance I ve got things to do My purpose to rid the streets of them sluts My one regret is that young lassie McDonald did not know cause changed routine that night Up to number now you say but remember Preston get about you know You were right I travel a bit You probably look for me in Sunderland don t bother I am not daft just posted letter there on one of my trips Not a bad place compared with Chapeltown and Manningham and other places Warn whores to keep off streets cause I feel it coming on again br Sorry about young lassie br Yours respectfully br Jack the Ripper br Might write again later I not sure last one really deserved it Whores getting younger each time Old slut next time I hope Huddersfield never again too small close call last one br Preston was a reference to the murder of Joan Harrison The Yorkshire Ripper was believed at the time to have killed her but the supposed connection was wrongly thought not to be in the public domain leading the hoaxer s claim to gain undeserved credibility Sutcliffe denied any knowledge and was not charged for this crime It remained unsolved until when DNA evidence from the crime scene was matched to those of a deceased man named Christopher Smith died who had been convicted of other offences including attempted rape and manslaughter br br br The Wearside Jack tape br On June Humble sent a cassette to Assistant Chief Constable Oldfield where he introduced himself only under the name Jack and claimed responsibility for the Ripper murders to that point br br I m Jack I see you are still having no luck catching me I have the greatest respect for you George but Lord You are no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started I reckon your boys are letting you down George They can t be much good can they br The recording on a cassette tape ended with a segment from the single Thank You for Being a Friend by Andrew Gold George Oldfield and other senior officers were informed by the FBI that the creator of the tape was a blatant hoaxer The US profiling expert Robert Ressler indicated in his co written book Whoever Fights Monsters that he contacted them to inform them immediately after he heard the recording br Despite this the police focused on Humble s Wearside accent Together with voice analysts they decided based on dialectology that the accent was distinctive to the Castletown area of Sunderland This led to men being investigated to no avail as the killer Sutcliffe came from Bradford Police also commenced a substantial publicity campaign including Dial the Ripper hotlines advertising hoardings and advertisements in newspapers Chief Constable Ronald Gregory diverted million from the inquiries budget into the publicity campaign alone A few weeks after being played the recording the voice experts began to try to persuade the police that the tape was created by a hoaxer but were not listened to br Interviewed by Joan Smith for The Sunday Times in Olive Smelt a victim of Sutcliffe who survived his attack in Halifax was angry that the police had ignored her insistence that the perpetrator was a local man Other survivors evidence photofits which were close to Sutcliffe s appearance were also rejected A confidential police document issued in September by the West Yorkshire Police murder incident room instructed detectives to disregard from their inquiries any suspect without a North East accent br Peter Sutcliffe who committed the murders was interviewed and released nine times over five years Four of these occasions followed the police decision to search for the man heard on the tape Each time he was rejected as a suspect because he did not have a North East accent In July Sutcliffe was interviewed by two Detective Constables who became suspicious One of the officers Detective Constable Andrew Laptew in his report wrote that there was good evidence he was the killer but the document was downgraded because of Sutcliffe s Yorkshire accent and the lack of a match with the hoaxer s handwriting br A then unknown victim of Sutcliffe at the time of Humble s first letter was Yvonne Pearson whose body lay undiscovered hidden under a discarded sofa in Bradford This detail raised the suspicion of a Northumbria Police Detective Inspector that the Wearside Jack evidence was a hoax as the writer of the letter made no reference to this crime and submitted a report to West Yorkshire police in September but the report was ignored One coincidence between Harrison s then falsely suspected killer and Wearside Jack was the secretion of their B group blood cells in their saliva and semen retrieved from her murder scene and from the gum of one of the letters a quality shared by only of men It was this which was taken as definitive proof the Yorkshire Ripper was the same man as had sent the letters and the tape br br br Hoax confirmed br While the West Yorkshire Police were investigating the leads Sutcliffe murdered three more women and attacked two others It was only after Sutcliffe s confession that Wearside Jack was demonstrated to be a hoax ACC Oldfield took early retirement following what he considered to be a total humiliation he died in aged It emerged during Humble s own trial that Sutcliffe had told police after his arrest in that While ever that was going on I felt safe I m not a Geordie I was born at Shipley br br br John Humble br br br Earlier life br The son of Sam and Violet Humble Humble attended Hylton Road Junior School and Havelock Senior School on Fordfield Road in the Ford Estate in Sunderland He had above average school results and gained a few qualifications before leaving school at His limited periods of employment included a bricklaying apprenticeship which he gave up after three years six months in a hospital laundry and a short period as a security guard br In Humble married a woman having been in a relationship with her for six weeks In the early years of the marriage he was said to be a good step father for her two children but he became abusive to his wife and was eventually convicted of common assault leading to the couple s separation around Humble returned to the Ford estate to live with his brother in br br br DNA match leads to arrest br br A breakthrough came in after senior officers from West Yorkshire Police s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team HMET headed by Detective Chief Superintendent Chris Gregg decided to review the case A small piece of the gummed seal from one of the envelopes was located in a forensic laboratory in London and following publicity about the cold case review the original hoax tape was retrieved from a retired scientist who had worked on the original investigation br As a result of this cold case review DNA from envelopes sent by Humble as part of the hoax were matched in the United Kingdom National DNA Database with samples police had obtained from Humble in an unrelated incident in when he had been arrested and cautioned for being drunk and disorderly By this time Humble had become a chronic alcoholic The odds of a specific individual matching the DNA sample were one in a billion very strongly indicating Humble was the culprit br Humble who was living on the Ford Estate in Sunderland was arrested on October Described as an unemployed labourer at the time of his arrest at home Humble and his brother were so inebriated that the police were required to wait almost a day before he could be interviewed when he sobered up he needed to be told he was now in police custody br At times during police interviews Humble appeared ashamed of what he had done referring to the acts as evil and saying he deserved to be imprisoned Humble admitted responsibility for the letters and the cassette but denied perverting the course of justice and his legal team pushed in vain for a lesser charge of wasting police time He was charged on four counts of perverting the course of justice br Humble was motivated according to Gregg after Humble s conviction by a wish for notoriety a hatred of the police and a fixation with the Jack the Ripper Whitechapel murders in late th century London The contempt for the police dated back to when he was imprisoned for assaulting an off duty police officer for which he served three months in a young offenders institution and an earlier conviction for burglary and theft in Humble s preoccupation with the Whitechapel murders influenced the writing of the hoax letters some passages being paraphrased from the th century letters of the earlier serial killer br Before Sutcliffe was arrested Humble twice phoned the police anonymously to indicate they had been hoaxed because he felt guilty for misleading the investigation but his calls were discounted One call to Northumbria Police on September was days after Barbara Leach was killed the first of Sutcliffe s victims to be murdered after Humble s hoax influenced the police investigation The call which was brief was recorded but hundreds of hoax calls were received by the police It also became known that his neighbours had been interviewed by police searching for Wearside Jack but he had not Humble was then living a mile from Castletown where the Yorkshire Ripper was mistakenly thought to be living because of Humble s tape br br br Trial and conviction br Humble was remanded on October He was tried at Leeds Crown Court on January and initially pleaded not guilty He admitted to being Wearside Jack on February and on March changed his plea to guilty on four counts of perverting the course of justice br The prosecution said Humble did not contact the police to acknowledge his direct responsibility even when it was obvious his tapes and letters were diverting police resources away from the real Ripper His defence counsel said in court that Humble had attempted suicide in November by jumping off the foot m bridge spanning the River Wear as well as on other occasions Instead of dying he landed on a boat and was rescued by the police spending three months in hospital as a result of his injuries and undergoing psychiatric treatment The defence said he had lived an inadequate life and had been driven to alcoholism by his guilt br On March Humble was sentenced to eight years in prison In July he launched an appeal against his sentence which was rejected in October of the same year br br br Release and death br Humble was released in after serving four years of his sentence he was given a new identity as John Samuel Anderson br On August Northumbria Police said that Humble had died at his home in South Shields on July he died from heart failure and the effects of his alcoholism br I m Jack a novel by Mark Blacklock also from Sunderland is a fictionalised account of Humble in his prison cell mocking the ghost of George Oldfield with further letters br br br See also br Colin Norris case another
