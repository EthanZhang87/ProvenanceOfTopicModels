Jonathan Swift November October was an Anglo Irish satirist author essayist political pamphleteer first for the Whigs then for the Tories poet and Anglican cleric who became Dean of St Patrick s Cathedral Dublin hence his common sobriquet Dean Swift br Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity Gulliver s Travels and A Modest Proposal He is regarded by the Encyclop dia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language He originally published all of his works under pseudonyms such as Lemuel Gulliver Isaac Bickerstaff M B Drapier or anonymously He was a master of two styles of satire the Horatian and Juvenalian styles br His deadpan ironic writing style particularly in A Modest Proposal has led to such satire being subsequently termed Swiftian br br br Biography br br br Early life br Jonathan Swift was born on November in Dublin in the Kingdom of Ireland He was the second child and only son of Jonathan Swift and his wife Abigail Erick or Herrick of Frisby on the Wreake His father was a native of Goodrich Herefordshire but he accompanied his brothers to Ireland to seek their fortunes in law after their Royalist father s estate was brought to ruin during the English Civil War His maternal grandfather James Ericke was the vicar of Thornton in Leicestershire In the vicar was convicted of Puritan practices Sometime thereafter Ericke and his family including his young daughter Abigail fled to Ireland br Swift s father joined his elder brother Godwin in the practice of law in Ireland He died in Dublin about seven months before his namesake was born He died of syphilis which he said he got from dirty sheets when out of town br His mother returned to England after his birth leaving him in the care of his uncle Godwin Swift a close friend and confidant of Sir John Temple whose son later employed Swift as his secretary br At the age of one child Jonathan was taken by his wet nurse to her hometown of Whitehaven Cumberland England He said that there he learned to read the Bible His nurse returned him to his mother still in Ireland when he was three More background to the Whitehaven connection Archived April at the Wayback Machine br br Swift s family had several interesting literary connections His grandmother Elizabeth Dryden Swift was the niece of Sir Erasmus Dryden grandfather of poet John Dryden The same grandmother s aunt Katherine Throckmorton Dryden was a first cousin of Elizabeth wife of Sir Walter Raleigh His great great grandmother Margaret Godwin Swift was the sister of Francis Godwin author of The Man in the Moone which influenced parts of Swift s Gulliver s Travels His uncle Thomas Swift married a daughter of poet and playwright Sir William Davenant a godson of William Shakespeare br Swift s benefactor and uncle Godwin Swift took primary responsibility for the young man sending him with one of his cousins to Kilkenny College also attended by philosopher George Berkeley He arrived there at the age of six where he was expected to have already learned the basic declensions in Latin He had not and thus began his schooling in a lower form Swift graduated in when he was br br He attended Trinity College Dublin in financed by Godwin s son Willoughby The four year course followed a curriculum largely set in the Middle Ages for the priesthood The lectures were dominated by Aristotelian logic and philosophy The basic skill taught to students was debate and they were expected to be able to argue both sides of any argument or topic Swift was an above average student but not exceptional and received his B A in by special grace br br br Adult life br Swift was studying for his master s degree when political troubles in Ireland surrounding the Glorious Revolution forced him to leave for England in where his mother helped him get a position as secretary and personal assistant of Sir William Temple at Moor Park Farnham Temple was an English diplomat who had arranged the Triple Alliance of He had retired from public service to his country estate to tend his gardens and write his memoirs Gaining his employer s confidence Swift was often trusted with matters of great importance Within three years of their acquaintance Temple introduced his secretary to William III and sent him to London to urge the King to consent to a bill for triennial Parliaments br Swift took up his residence at Moor Park where he met Esther Johnson then eight years old the daughter of an impoverished widow who acted as companion to Temple s sister Lady Giffard Swift was her tutor and mentor giving her the nickname Stella and the two maintained a close but ambiguous relationship for the rest of Esther s life br In Swift left Temple for Ireland because of his health but returned to Moor Park the following year The illness consisted of fits of vertigo or giddiness now believed to be M ni re s disease and it continued to plague him throughout his life During this second stay with Temple Swift received his M A from Hart Hall Oxford in He then left Moor Park apparently despairing of gaining a better position through Temple s patronage in order to become an ordained priest in the Established Church of Ireland He was appointed to the prebend of Kilroot in the Diocese of Connor in with his parish located at Kilroot near Carrickfergus in County Antrim br Swift appears to have been miserable in his new position being isolated in a small remote community far from the centres of power and influence While at Kilroot however he may well have become romantically involved with Jane Waring whom he called Varina the sister of an old college friend A letter from him survives offering to remain if she would marry him and promising to leave and never return to Ireland if she refused She presumably refused because Swift left his post and returned to England and Temple s service at Moor Park in and he remained there until Temple s death There he was employed in helping to prepare Temple s memoirs and correspondence for publication During this time Swift wrote The Battle of the Books a satire responding to critics of Temple s Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning though Battle was not published until br Temple died on January Swift normally a harsh judge of human nature said that all that was good and amiable in mankind had died with Temple He stayed on briefly in England to complete editing Temple s memoirs and perhaps in the hope that recognition of his work might earn him a suitable position in England His work made enemies among some of Temple s family and friends in particular Temple s formidable sister Martha Lady Giffard who objected to indiscretions included in the memoirs Moreover she noted that Swift had borrowed from her own biography an accusation that Swift denied Swift s next move was to approach King William directly based on his imagined connection through Temple and a belief that he had been promised a position This failed so miserably that he accepted the lesser post of secretary and chaplain to the Earl of Berkeley one of the Lords Justice of Ireland However when he reached Ireland he found that the secretaryship had already been given to another He soon obtained the living of Laracor Agher and Rathbeggan and the prebend of Dunlavin in St Patrick s Cathedral Dublin br Swift ministered to a congregation of about at Laracor which was just over four and a half miles km from Summerhill County Meath and twenty miles km from Dublin He had abundant leisure for cultivating his garden making a canal after the Dutch fashion of Moor Park planting willows and rebuilding the vicarage As chaplain to Lord Berkeley he spent much of his time in Dublin and travelled to London frequently over the next ten years In he anonymously published the political pamphlet A Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome br br br Writer br Swift resided in Trim County Meath after He wrote many of his works during this period In February Swift received his Doctor of Divinity degree from Trinity College Dublin That spring he travelled to England and then returned to Ireland in October accompanied by Esther Johnson now and his friend Rebecca Dingley another member of William Temple s household There is a great mystery and controversy over Swift s relationship with Esther Johnson nicknamed Stella Many notably his close friend Thomas Sheridan believed that they were secretly married in others like Swift s housekeeper Mrs Brent and Rebecca Dingley who lived with Stella all through her years in Ireland dismissed the story as absurd Swift certainly did not wish her to marry anyone else in when their mutual friend William Tisdall informed Swift that he intended to propose to Stella Swift wrote to him to dissuade him from the idea Although the tone of the letter was courteous Swift privately expressed his disgust for Tisdall as an interloper and they were estranged for many years br During his visits to England in these years Swift published A Tale of a Tub and The Battle of the Books and began to gain a reputation as a writer This led to close lifelong friendships with Alexander Pope John Gay and John Arbuthnot forming the core of the Martinus Scriblerus Club founded in br Swift became increasingly active politically in these years Swift supported the Glorious Revolution and early in his life belonged to the Whigs As a member of the Anglican Church he feared a return of the Catholic monarchy and Papist absolutism From to and again in Swift was in London unsuccessfully urging upon the Whig administration of Lord Godolphin the claims of the Irish clergy to the First Fruits and Twentieths Queen Anne s Bounty which brought in about a year already granted to their brethren in England He found the opposition Tory leadership more sympathetic to his cause and when they came to power in he was recruited to support their cause as editor of The Examiner In Swift published the political pamphlet The Conduct of the Allies attacking the Whig government for its inability to end the prolonged war with France The incoming Tory government conducted secret and illegal negotiations with France resulting in the Treaty of Utrecht ending the War of the Spanish Succession br Swift was part of the inner circle of the Tory government and often acted as mediator between Henry St John Viscount Bolingbroke the secretary of state for foreign affairs and Robert Harley Earl of Oxford lord treasurer and prime minister Swift recorded his experiences and thoughts during this difficult time in a long series of letters to Esther Johnson collected and published after his death as A Journal to Stella The animosity between the two Tory leaders eventually led to the dismissal of Harley in With the death of Queen Anne and the accession of George I that year the Whigs returned to power and the Tory leaders were tried for treason for conducting secret negotiations with France br Swift has been described by scholars as a Whig in politics and Tory in religion and Swift related his own views in similar terms stating that as a lover of liberty I found myself to be what they called a Whig in politics But as to religion I confessed myself to be an High Churchman In his Thoughts on Religion fearing the intense partisan strife waged over religious belief in seventeenth century England Swift wrote that Every man as a member of the commonwealth ought to be content with the possession of his own opinion in private However it should be borne in mind that during Swift s time period terms like Whig and Tory both encompassed a wide array of opinions and factions and neither term aligns with a modern political party or modern political alignments br Also during these years in London Swift became acquainted with the Vanhomrigh family Dutch merchants who had settled in Ireland then moved to London and became involved with one of the daughters Esther Swift furnished Esther with the nickname Vanessa derived by adding Essa a pet form of Esther to the Van of her surname Vanhomrigh and she features as one of the main characters in his poem Cadenus and Vanessa The poem and their correspondence suggest that Esther was infatuated with Swift and that he may have reciprocated her affections only to regret this and then try to break off the relationship Esther followed Swift to Ireland in and settled at her old family home Celbridge Abbey Their uneasy relationship continued for some years then there appears to have been a confrontation possibly involving Esther Johnson Esther Vanhomrigh died in at the age of having destroyed the will she had made in Swift s favour Another lady with whom he had a close but less intense relationship was Anne Long a toast of the Kit Cat Club br br br Final years br br Before the fall of the Tory government Swift hoped that his services would be rewarded with a church appointment in England However Queen Anne appeared to have taken a dislike to Swift and thwarted these efforts Her dislike has been attributed to A Tale of a Tub which she thought blasphemous compounded by The Windsor Prophecy where Swift with a surprising lack of tact advised the Queen on which of her bedchamber ladies she should and should not trust The best position his friends could secure for him was the Deanery of St Patrick s this was not in the Queen s gift and Anne who could be a bitter enemy made it clear that Swift would not have received the preferment if she could have prevented it With the return of the Whigs Swift s best move was to leave England and he returned to Ireland in disappointment a virtual exile to live like a rat in a hole br br Once in Ireland however Swift began to turn his pamphleteering skills in support of Irish causes producing some of his most memorable works Proposal for Universal Use of Irish Manufacture Drapier s Letters and A Modest Proposal earning him the status of an Irish patriot This new role was unwelcome to the Government which made clumsy attempts to silence him His printer Edward Waters was convicted of seditious libel in but four years later a grand jury refused to find that the Drapier s Letters which though written under a pseudonym were universally known to be Swift s work were seditious Swift responded with an attack on the Irish judiciary almost unparalleled in its ferocity his principal target being the vile and profligate villain William Whitshed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland br Also during these years he began writing his masterpiece Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World in Four Parts by Lemuel Gulliver first a surgeon and then a captain of several ships better known as Gulliver s Travels Much of the material reflects his political experiences of the preceding decade For instance the episode in which the giant Gulliver puts out the Lilliputian palace fire by urinating on it can be seen as a metaphor for the Tories illegal peace treaty having done a good thing in an unfortunate manner In he paid a long deferred visit to London taking with him the manuscript of Gulliver s Travels During his visit he stayed with his old friends Alexander Pope John Arbuthnot and John Gay who helped him arrange for the anonymous publication of his book First published in November it was an immediate hit with a total of three printings that year and another in early French German and Dutch translations appeared in and pirated copies were printed in Ireland br Swift returned to England one more time in and stayed once again with Alexander Pope The visit was cut short when Swift received word that Esther Johnson was dying and rushed back home to be with her On January Johnson died Swift had prayed at her bedside even composing prayers for her comfort Swift could not bear to be present at the end but on the night of her death he began to write his The Death of Mrs Johnson He was too ill to attend the funeral at St Patrick s Many years later a lock of hair assumed to be Johnson s was found in his desk wrapped in a paper bearing the words Only a woman s hair br br br Death br br Death became a frequent feature of Swift s life from this point In he wrote Verses on the Death of Dr Swift his own obituary published in In his good friend and collaborator John Gay died In John Arbuthnot another friend from his days in London died In Swift began to show signs of illness and in he may have suffered a stroke losing the ability to speak and realising his worst fears of becoming mentally disabled I shall be like that tree he once said I shall die at the top He became increasingly quarrelsome and long standing friendships like that with Thomas Sheridan ended without sufficient cause To protect him from unscrupulous hangers ons who had begun to prey on the great man his closest companions had him declared of unsound mind and memory However it was long believed by many that Swift was actually insane at this point In his book Literature and Western Man author J B Priestley even cites the final chapters of Gulliver s Travels as proof of Swift s approaching insanity Bewley attributes his decline to terminal dementia br In part VIII of his series The Story of Civilization Will Durant describes the final years of Swift s life as such br br Definite symptoms of madness appeared in In guardians were appointed to take care of his affairs and watch lest in his outbursts of violence he should do himself harm In he suffered great pain from the inflammation of his left eye which swelled to the size of an egg five attendants had to restrain him from tearing out his eye He went a whole year without uttering a word br In Alexander Pope died Then on October Swift at nearly died After being laid out in public view for the people of Dublin to pay their last respects he was buried in his own cathedral by Esther Johnson s side in accordance with his wishes The bulk of his fortune was left to found a hospital for the mentally ill originally known as St Patrick s Hospital for Imbeciles which opened in and which still exists as a psychiatric hospital br br Text extracted from the introduction to The Journal to Stella by George A Aitken and from other sources br Jonathan Swift wrote his own epitaph br br W B Yeats poetically translated it from the Latin as br br Swift has sailed into his rest br Savage indignation there br Cannot lacerate his breast br Imitate him if you dare br World besotted traveller he br Served human liberty br br br Swift Stella and Vanessa an alternative view br British politician Michael Foot was a great admirer of Swift and wrote about him extensively In Debts of Honour he cites with approbation a theory propounded by Denis Johnston that offers an explanation of Swift s behaviour towards Stella and Vanessa br Pointing to contradictions in the received information about Swift s origins and parentage Johnston postulates that Swift s real father was Sir William Temple s father Sir John Temple who was Master of the Rolls in Dublin at the time It is widely thought that Stella was Sir William Temple s illegitimate daughter So Swift was Sir William s brother and Stella s uncle Marriage or close relations between Swift and Stella would therefore have been incest an unthinkable prospect br It follows that Swift could not have married Vanessa either without Stella appearing to be a cast off mistress which he would not contemplate Johnston s theory is expounded fully in his book In Search of Swift He is also cited in the Dictionary of Irish Biography and the theory is presented without attribution in the Concise Cambridge History of English Literature br br br Works br Swift was a prolific writer The collection of his prose works Herbert Davis ed Basil Blackwell comprises fourteen volumes A edition of his complete poetry Pat Rodges ed Penguin is pages long One edition of his correspondence David Woolley ed P Lang fills three volumes br br br Major prose works br br Swift s first major prose work A Tale of a Tub demonstrates many of the themes and stylistic techniques he would employ in his later work It is at once wildly playful and funny while being pointed and harshly critical of its targets In its main thread the Tale recounts the exploits of three sons representing the main threads of Christianity who receive a bequest from their father of a coat each with the added instructions to make no alterations whatsoever However the sons soon find that their coats have fallen out of current fashion and begin to look for loopholes in their father s will that will let them make the needed alterations As each finds his own means of getting around their father s admonition they struggle with each other for power and dominance Inserted into this story in alternating chapters the narrator includes a series of whimsical digressions on various subjects br In Sir William Temple Swift s patron published An Essay upon Ancient and Modern Learning a defence of classical writing see Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns holding up the Epistles of Phalaris as an example William Wotton responded to Temple with Reflections upon Ancient and Modern Learning showing that the Epistles were a later forgery A response by the supporters of the Ancients was then made by Charles Boyle later the th Earl of Orrery and father of Swift s first biographer A further retort on the Modern side came from Richard Bentley one of the pre eminent scholars of the day in his essay Dissertation upon the Epistles of Phalaris The final words on the topic belong to Swift in his Battle of the Books published in which he makes a humorous defence on behalf of Temple and the cause of the Ancients br br In a cobbler named John Partridge published a popular almanac of astrological predictions Because Partridge falsely determined the deaths of several church officials Swift attacked Partridge in Predictions for the Ensuing Year by Isaac Bickerstaff a parody predicting that Partridge would die on March Swift followed up with a pamphlet issued on March claiming that Partridge had in fact died which was widely believed despite Partridge s statements to the contrary According to other sources Richard Steele used the persona of Isaac Bickerstaff and was the one who wrote about the death of John Partridge and published it in The Spectator not Jonathan Swift br The Drapier s Letters was a series of pamphlets against the monopoly granted by the English government to William Wood to mint copper coinage for Ireland It was widely believed that Wood would need to flood Ireland with debased coinage in order to make a profit In these letters Swift posed as a shopkeeper a draper to criticise the plan Swift s writing was so effective in undermining opinion in the project that a reward was offered by the government to anyone disclosing the true identity of the author Though hardly a secret on returning to Dublin after one of his trips to England Swift was greeted with a banner Welcome Home Drapier no one turned Swift in although there was an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute the publisher John Harding Thanks to the general outcry against the coinage Wood s patent was rescinded in September and the coins were kept out of circulation In Verses on the Death of Dr Swift Swift recalled this as one of his best achievements br Gulliver s Travels a large portion of which Swift wrote at Woodbrook House in County Laois was published in It is regarded as his masterpiece As with his other writings the Travels was published under a pseudonym the fictional Lemuel Gulliver a ship s surgeon and later a sea captain Some of the correspondence between printer Benj Motte and Gulliver s also fictional cousin negotiating the book s publication has survived Though it has often been mistakenly thought of and published in bowdlerised form as a children s book it is a great and sophisticated satire of human nature based on Swift s experience of his times Gulliver s Travels is an anatomy of human nature a sardonic looking glass often criticised for its apparent misanthropy It asks its readers to refute it to deny that it has adequately characterised human nature and society Each of the four books recounting four voyages to mostly fictional exotic lands has a different theme but all are attempts to deflate human pride Critics hail the work as a satiric reflection on the shortcomings of Enlightenment thought br In Swift s A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People in Ireland Being a Burden on Their Parents or Country and for Making Them Beneficial to the Publick was published in Dublin by Sarah Harding It is a satire in which the narrator with intentionally grotesque arguments recommends that Ireland s poor escape their poverty by selling their children as food to the rich I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food Following the satirical form he introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by deriding them br br Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients taxing our absentees using nothing except what is of our own growth and manufacture rejecting foreign luxury introducing a vein of parsimony prudence and temperance learning to love our country quitting our animosities and factions teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants Therefore I repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glympse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice br br br Essays
