A half truth is a deceptive statement that includes some element of truth The statement might be partly true the statement may be totally true but only part of the whole truth or it may use some deceptive element such as improper punctuation or double meaning especially if the intent is to deceive evade blame or misrepresent the truth br br br Purpose br The purpose and or consequence of a half truth is to make something that is really only a belief appear to be knowledge or a truthful statement to represent the whole truth or possibly lead to a false conclusion The order in which the true and false information is presented in a half truth can make a difference in ultimate believability Barchetti and colleagues show that when two unrelated statements are but together with syntax that suggests causality the statement is believed if the premise is true even if the conclusion is unrelated or false Conversely if the false statement is placed in the premise the combined statement is less likely to be believed Thus order of presentation can influence the credibility of a half true statement and has been named the half truth effect According to the justified true belief theory of knowledge in order to know that a given proposition is true one must not only believe in the relevant true proposition but one must also have a good reason for doing so A half truth deceives the recipient by presenting something believable and using those aspects of the statement that can be shown to be true as a good reason to believe the statement is true in its entirety or that the statement represents the whole truth A person deceived by a half truth considers the proposition to be knowledge and acts accordingly br br br Examples br The classic story about blind men and an elephant Each blind man touches a different part of the elephant and reaches a different conclusion about the nature of the elephant while each man s experience of the elephant is accurate none of them have a full understanding of the nature of the beast One may be touching the tail and believe that the elephant is long and thin another may be touching the belly and say that it is round and big br Former U S President Bill Clinton famously engaged in a half truth when he gave the testimony of I did not have sexual relations with that woman Miss Lewinsky Here he engaged in an equivocation fallacy to deliberately indicate one particular meaning of the phrase sexual relations while intending another meaning in order to deliberately mislead the court while still being able to later claim that my statements were technically correct br br br Politics br Some forms of half truths are an inescapable part of politics in representative democracies The reputation of a political candidate can be irreparably damaged if they are exposed in a lie so a complex style of language has evolved to minimise the chance of this happening If someone has not said something they cannot be accused of lying As a consequence politics has become a world where half truths are expected and political statements are rarely accepted at face value br William Safire defines a half truth for political purposes as a statement accurate enough to require an explanation and the longer the explanation the more likely a public reaction of half belief br It has been shown that the order of the half truth makes a difference in reported belief in the statement That is when a statement begins with a true statement followed by another unrelated statement either true or false the statement is believed However when the false statement is put in front then the entire package is less believed regardless if the second part of the argument is true or false This also indicates the anchoring effect which is a tendency of people to believe the first thing said which acts as an anchor point in believing or disbelieving what follows and is also found in reference pricing used in price promotions Consumer behaviour and psychology studies show the heavy influence of the order and presentation of information in what beliefs people generally may be likely to form as well as decoy items that may be the early information br In his work The Magic Lantern The Revolution of Witnessed in Warsaw Budapest Berlin and Prague Timothy Garton Ash responded to V clav Havel s call for living in truth br br Now we expect many things of politicians in a well functioning parliamentary democracy But living in truth is not one of them In fact the essence of democratic politics might rather be described as working in half truth Parliamentary democracy is at its heart a system of limited adversarial mendacity in which each party attempts to present part of the truth as if it were the whole br Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead was quoted as saying There are no whole truths all truths are half truths It is trying to treat them as whole truths that play the devil If this is true statements or truths which according to Whitehead are all half truths are susceptible to creating deceptive and false conclusions br br br Meme theory br Richard Brodie links half truths to memes writing the truth of any proposition depends on the assumptions you make in considering it the distinct memes you use in thinking about it Brodie considers half truths a necessary part of human interaction because they allow practical application of ideas when it is impractical to convey all the information needed to make a fully informed decision although some half truths can lead to false conclusions or inferences in the world of logic br br br Quotations br The notion of half truths has existed in various cultures giving rise to several epigrammatic sayings br br Karl Kraus an Austrian journalist critic playwright and poet noted An aphorism can never be the whole truth it is either a half truth or a truth and a half br Arthur Koestler a Hungarian British author and journalist wrote Two half truths do not make a truth and two half cultures do not make a culture br br br Selective truth br br Selective truth is an act of telling some part of truth selectively both intentionally or unintentionally br Both intentional and unintentional selective truth are not a truth at all br br br Ethics and morality br While selective truth information is not the truth information whether telling selective truth is considered as deceptive or lying and the morality are subject to debate Some scholars think it is deceptive and lying and some scholars think the obverse Some philosophers consider selective truth deceptive but not lying Some philosophers simply consider it is not lying br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br SNSF research project Half Truths Truth Fiction and Conspiracy in the
