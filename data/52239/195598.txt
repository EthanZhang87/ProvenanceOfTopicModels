The United States Information Agency USIA was a United States government agency devoted to the practice of public diplomacy which operated from to br Previously existing United States Information Service USIS posts operating out of U S embassies worldwide since World War II became the field operations offices of the USIA In USIA was merged with the Bureau of Educational Cultural Affairs of the Department of State into a new agency called the United States International Communications Agency USICA Use of the name United States Information Agency USIA was restored in br In prior to the reorganization of intelligence agencies by President George W Bush President Bill Clinton assigned USIA s cultural exchange and non broadcasting intelligence functions to the newly created under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the U S Department of State and the now independent agency the International Broadcasting Bureau USIA s broadcasting functions were moved to the Broadcasting Board of Governors which had been created in br Since the merger of USIA with the Department of State public diplomacy and public affairs sections at U S missions have carried on this work When USIA was abolished in USIS posts once again were operated by the Department of State br Former USIA director of TV and film service Alvin Snyder recalled in his memoir that the U S government ran a full service public relations organization the largest in the world about the size of the twenty biggest U S commercial PR firms combined Its full time professional staff of more than spread out among some countries burnished America s image and trashed the Soviet Union hours a week with a tower of babble comprised of more than languages to the tune of over billion per year The USIA was the biggest branch of this propaganda machine br br br Stated mission br br President Dwight D Eisenhower established the United States Information Agency on August during the postwar tensions with the communist world known as the Cold War The USIA s mission was to understand inform and influence foreign publics in promotion of the national interest and to broaden the dialogue between Americans and U S institutions and their counterparts abroad The USIA was established to streamline the U S government s overseas information programs and make them more effective It operated all of the foreign information activities formerly carried out by the Department of State s International Information Administration and Technical Cooperation Administration as well as the Mutual Security Agency USIA was also responsible for the overseas administration of the exchange of persons program formerly conducted by IIA The USIA was the largest full service public relations organization in the world spending over billion per year to highlight the views of the U S while diminishing those of the Soviet Union through about different countries br Its stated goals were to explain and advocate U S policies in terms that are credible and meaningful in foreign cultures to provide information about the official policies of the United States and about the people values and institutions which influence those policies to bring the benefits of international engagement to American citizens and institutions by helping them build strong long term relationships with their counterparts overseas and to advise the President and U S government policy makers on the ways in which foreign attitudes would have a direct bearing on the effectiveness of U S policies The Department of State provided foreign policy guidance br During the Cold War some American officials believed that a propaganda program was essential to convey the United States and its culture and politics to the world and to offset negative Soviet propaganda against the US With heightened fears about the influence of communism some Americans believed that the films produced by the Hollywood movie industry when critical of American society damaged its image in other countries The USIA exist ed as much to provide a view of the world to the United States as it did to give the world a view of America Films produced by the USIA could by law not be screened publicly within the United States due to the Smith Mundt Act This restriction also meant that Americans could not view the material even for study at the National Archives br Within the US the USIA was intended to assure Americans that t he United States was working for a better world Abroad the USIA tried to preserve a positive image of the U S regardless of negative depictions from communist propaganda One notable example was Project Pedro This secretly funded project created newsreels in Mexico during the s that portrayed Communism unfavorably and the United States positively Articles reflecting the views promoted by the USIA were frequently published under fictitious bylines such as Guy Sims Fitch br The agency regularly conducted research on foreign public opinion about the United States and its policies in order to inform the president and other key policymakers It conducted public opinion surveys throughout the world It issued a variety of reports to government officials including a twice daily report on foreign media commentary around the world br br br Media and divisions br br From the beginning President Dwight Eisenhower said that audiences would be more receptive to the American message if they were kept from identifying it as propaganda Avowedly propagandistic materials from the United States might convince few but the same viewpoints presented by the seemingly independent voices would be more persuasive The USIA used various forms of media including personal contact radio broadcasting libraries book publication and distribution press motion pictures television exhibits English language instruction and others Through these different forms the United States government distributed its materials more easily and engaged a greater concentration of people br Four main divisions were established when the USIA began its programs br br Broadcasting information br Libraries and exhibits br Press services br Motion picture service br The first division dealt with broadcasting information both in the United States and around the world The radio was one of the most widely used forms of media at the onset of the Cold War as television was not widely available The Smith Mundt Act authorized information programs including Voice of America Voice of America was intended as an unbiased and balanced Voice from America as originally broadcast during World War II The VOA was used to tell America s stories to information deprived listeners behind the Iron Curtain By the VOA was broadcasting in languages to up to million listeners In VOA gained its Charter requiring its news to be balanced br The second division of the USIA consisted of libraries and exhibits The Smith Mundt Act and the Fulbright Hays Act of both authorized international cultural and educational exchanges including the Fulbright Scholarship Program USIA would mount exhibitions in its libraries overseas to reach people in other countries Fulbrighters were grant recipients under the USIA educational and cultural exchange program To ensure that those grant programs would be fair and unbiased persons of educational and cultural expertise in the grant subject areas selected the grantee recipients br The USIA s third division included press services Within its first two decades the USIA publishe d sixty six magazines newspapers and other periodicals totaling almost million copies annually in twenty eight languages br The fourth division dealt with the motion picture service After the USIA failed in its effort to collaborate with Hollywood filmmakers to portray America in a positive light the agency began producing their own documentaries br br br Non broadcast educational and information efforts br By the time the agency was reorganized in the educational and informational efforts encompassed a wide range of activities outside of broadcasting These were focused in four areas the agency produced extensive electronic and printed materials br br Information service br Speakers and Specialists Program br Information Resource Centers br Foreign press centers br Its The Washington File information service was intended to provide in the words of the agency both time sensitive and in depth information in five languages incorporating full transcripts of speeches

Speakers and Specialists Program sending Americans abroad for various public speaking and technical assistance roles These speakers were referred to as American Participants or AmParts br Third the agency operated more than Information Resource Centers abroad These included some public access libraries in developing countries br Finally the USIA operated foreign press centers in Washington New
