id: 74869673
The election denial movement in the United States is a widespread false belief among certain conservatives that any United States election not resulting in a desired Republican victory has been rigged and stolen through voter fraud by Democrats Adherents of the movement are referred to as election deniers Voter fraud conspiracy theories have spread online and through conservative conferences community events and door to door canvassing Since the United States presidential election many Republican politicians have sought elective office or taken legislative steps to address what they assert is weak election integrity leading to widespread fraudulent elections though no evidence of systemic voter fraud has come to light and voter fraud is extremely rare br The movement came to prominence after Donald Trump was defeated in the United States presidential election Trump had a history of questioning elections before he ran for office notably the reelection of Barack Obama He grew the movement among his supporters by making consistently false allegations of fraud during the and in particular the presidential election With these false and unsubstantiated claims Trump and his associates sought to overturn the election of Joe Biden he and others have been indicted on federal and state charges involving election subversion Trump s false allegations came to be known as his big lie Trump has since endorsed only Republican candidates who agree the election had been stolen from him and he has not committed to accepting the results of the presidential election in which he is a candidate By April Trump had embraced mail in balloting and early voting which he had for years vilified as corrupt and contributors to his election loss br br br Context br br Going back decades some influential Republicans who have expressed concerns around election security have been accused of using the fear of voter fraud as a pretext for voter suppression A notable quote that has been used as evidence of bad faith efforts to address voter fraud comes from Paul Weyrich co founder of the conservative Heritage Foundation who said in a speech in I don t want everybody to vote our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down Aspects of election denialism have been noted to relate to the great replacement theory which has been embraced by some Republican politicians to demonstrate their loyalty to Donald Trump Trump has falsely claimed that Democrats are encouraging illegal immigration to allow noncitizens to vote and create a permanent Democratic majority br br br Prevalence of voter fraud br Election experts have found that election fraud is vanishingly rare not systemic and not at levels that could have impacted a presidential election In response to Donald Trump s claims of millions of fraudulent votes the Brennan Center in evaluated voter fraud data and arrived at a fraud rate of That year the center also analyzed the Heritage Foundation s database of voter fraud as tiny reaching back to and one in which the vast majority of cases would still occur under the Foundation s proposed election reforms br br br Origins of the movement br Professor Andrew Smolar and Dr Geoffrey Kabaservice believe this election denial movement began with the Tea Party after Obama s election citing the Birtherism conspiracy theory as helping to dissolve trust in institutions and objective truth Other dates that have been suggested for the start of this movement include and br Analyst Chris Sautter argues the movement is the latest stage of wrangling about election rules that began in the s regarding severe restrictions to stop Blacks from voting in most of the South The Voting Rights Act of outlawed discrimination and enabled the federal government to block new restrictions During the Reagan presidency in the s the Republican National Committee RNC launched ballot security and voter integrity campaigns to reduce what it alleged to be voter fraud They focused on minority communities with large Democratic majorities They stationed off duty police officers in conspicuous locations near polling places distributed leaflets suggesting voters could be subjected to prosecution and made unsupported challenges of registered voters Federal courts concluded the techniques were designed to frighten minority voters in violation of the Voting Rights Act of Republican party officials were forced to sign a consent decree agreeing to stop However in the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its ruling on Shelby County v Holder This enabled Republican legislatures in at least states to impose new obstacles for the elections br br br Disputed elections br br br President br br br br After Barack Obama was declared the winner of the Electoral College while still trailing in the popular vote count early on election night Trump tweeted the election was a total sham because Obama lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election adding the electoral college is a disaster for a democracy and We can t let this happen We should march on Washington and stop this travesty Final election results showed Obama won the popular vote by nearly five million ballots In the presidential election Trump won the electoral college but lost the popular vote by nearly three million ballots br ABC News writer Terrence Smith described Trump s statements as the first example showing a broader playbook of election denial br Despite Trump s comments unsuccessful Republican nominee Mitt Romney accepted the results and conceded defeat br br br br During the Republican primaries Trump alleged without evidence that his opponent Senator Ted Cruz stole the Iowa presidential caucuses after he had won them br During the presidential campaign Trump asserted that the only way he could lose was if there was election fraud Trump political advisor Roger Stone created a Stop the Steal organization in in the event Trump lost it was revived after Trump s loss in br Trump claimed without evidence that millions of undocumented migrants voted illegally for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election costing him the popular vote victory As a result Trump established an election integrity commission in May but the commission was disbanded several months later with member Matthew Dunlap the Maine secretary of state writing to commission chair Mike Pence and vice chair Kris Kobach that contrary to public statements by Trump and Kobach the commission did not find substantial voter fraud Dunlap alleged the true purpose of the commission was to create a pretext to pave the way for policy changes designed to undermine the right to vote Critics said the commission s intent was to disenfranchise or deter legal voters Kobach then the Kansas secretary of state had a history of making false or unsubstantiated allegations of voting fraud to advocate for voting restrictions The commission did not find a single instance of a non citizen voting br In spite of accepting the election result at the time Hillary Clinton expressed doubts about that election in a interview br br There was a widespread understanding that this election in was not on the level Clinton said during an interview for the latest episode of The Atlantic s politics podcast The Ticket We still don t know what really happened There s just a lot that I think will be revealed History will discover the Democratic Party s presidential nominee continued But you don t win by million votes and have all this other shenanigans and stuff going on and not come away with an idea like Whoa something s not right here That was a deep sense of unease br br br br br Donald Trump complained of widespread voter fraud leading up to and following the U S presidential election which was widely debunked Having never conceded Trump used this allegation of fraud as justification to try multiple times to subvert the election results and remain in office Trump has demanded those seeking his endorsement to support his unfounded allegations of fraud Many of those involved in the plots including the riot on January have been convicted charged or are under investigation for crimes such as insurrection br Three witnesses close to Trump testified to the January committee that they were aware Trump acknowledged he had lost within days after the election br br br br br Trump has not committed to accepting the results of the U S presidential election if he loses Trump s niece Mary L Trump and Former Rep Anthony Gonzalez R among others predict that he would once again deny the results of a loss and try to steal the election According to NPR the continuation of election denial tactics by Trump for the election is likely In the lead up to the election the Republican Party has made false claims of massive noncitizen voting by immigrants in an attempt to delegitimize the election if Trump loses States have found very few noncitizens on their voting rolls and in the extremely rare instances of votes cast by noncitizens they are legal immigrants who are often mistaken that they have a right to vote An election fraud database maintained by the conservative Heritage Foundation in indicated instances of irregularities among noncitizens since br Many Republicans notably Trump long criticized ballot harvesting and the early voting it enables as rife with fraud and cheating encouraging their voters to vote only at polling places on election day The Dinesh D Souza film Mules was centered on false allegations of illegal ballot harvesting by unnamed nonprofit organizations supposedly associated with the Democratic Party to commit election fraud After disappointing Republican results in the and elections some Trump aligned organizations such as Turning Point USA recognized they needed to adopt similar ballot collection methods for the elections which they named ballot chasing Turning Point said it would raise money to create the largest and most impactful ballot chasing operation the movement has ever seen Kari Lake who refused to concede her loss in the Arizona gubernatorial race said she would launch the largest ballot chasing operation in our nation s history Media Matters reported in March that Lara Trump the new co chair of the Republican National Committee had said on a recent podcast that the RNC would launch a legal ballot harvesting effort br Lara Trump said on the same podcast that I m gonna say million plus Americans who still are like what the hell happened in They didn t get any answers She baselessly claimed that the odds of mail in ballots giving Biden swing state victories was one in one quadrillion to the fourth power After insisting for several years that mail in balloting is totally corrupt and contributed to his election loss by April Donald Trump and the RNC were encouraging his supporters to adopt mail in and early voting br During the campaign Trump often referred to election integrity to allude to his continuing lie that the election was rigged and stolen as well as baseless predictions of future mass election fraud As he did during the election cycle without evidence Trump told supporters that Democrats might try to rig the election Many Republicans believe a conspiracy theory claiming Democrats engage in systematic election fraud to steal elections insisting election integrity is a major concern though voting fraud is extremely rare By Republican politicians conservative cable news outlets and talk radio echoed a narrative of former Trump advisor Steve Bannon that if Democrats don t cheat they don t win Appearing with Trump in April House Speaker Mike Johnson baselessly suggested potentially hundreds of thousands of votes might be cast by undocumented migrants as president Trump falsely asserted that millions of votes cast by undocumented migrants had deprived him of a popular vote victory in the election Politico reported in June that the RNC sought to deploy an army of poll workers and attorneys in swing states who could refer what they deemed questionable ballots in Democratic voting precincts to a network of friendly district attorneys to challenge In April RNC co chair Lara Trump said the party had the ability to install poll workers who could handle ballots rather than merely observe polling places She also said that the expiration of the consent decree prohibiting the RNC from intimidation of minority voters gives us a great ability in the election Trump s political operation said in April that it planned to deploy more than attorneys and volunteers to polling places across battleground states with an election integrity hotline for poll watchers and voters to report alleged voting irregularities Trump told a rally audience in December that they needed to guard the vote in Democratic run cities He had complained that his campaign was not adequately prepared to challenge his loss in courts some critics said his election integrity effort is actually intended to gather allegations to overwhelm the election resolution process should he challenge the election results Marc Elias a Democratic election lawyer who defeated every Trump court challenge after the election remarked I think they are going to have a massive voter suppression operation and it is going to involve very very large numbers of people and very very large numbers of lawyers br Days after the RNC voted Lara Trump and Michael Whatley to lead the organization former OANN anchor Christina Bobb was named to head the RNC election integrity program which Lara Trump said occupied an entire wing of the building A staunch Trump advocate Bobb was involved in attempts to overturn the U S presidential election and promoted the false allegation that the election had been stolen from Trump by fraud Bobb and seventeen other Republicans were each indicted on nine counts of fraud forgery and conspiracy in April for their alleged involvement in the Trump fake electors plot in Arizona br In April the RNC released a robocall script falsely alleging Democrats committed massive fraud in the election The script added If Democrats have their way your vote could be canceled out by someone who isn t even an American citizen br By May election deniers in support of Trump had moved closer to the GOP mainstream A report released on May by States United Action found that representatives and senators out of lawmakers overall can be categorized as election deniers and that two senate candidates and house candidates were on the ballot to join them By the prevalence of election deniers was noted to have increased among top Republican officials in the RNC In May The Associated Press reported that under Lara Trump the RNC has sought alliances with election deniers conspiracy theorists and alt right advocates the party had previously kept at arm s length It also reported that Lara Trump supported a nationwide policy of not counting any ballots after Election Day which was noted to be illegal Trump and several Republicans have stated they will not accept the results of the election if they believe they are unfair br br br Statewide br br br br After the Georgia gubernatorial election Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams lost to Republican candidate Brian Kemp and claimed that the election was stolen from her as well as claiming the election was rigged and not a free or fair election br br br br In addition to making false claims about the previous election a centerpiece of her Arizona gubernatorial campaign Kari Lake refused to concede her loss traveling the country into to promote her election fraud allegations amid speculation she was considering a run for Senate or being named as Trump s running mate in Her several lawsuits challenging her loss were thrown out as has a lawsuit to stop using electronic machines A July suit filed by Republican Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer alleging Lake defamed him by claiming he had rigged the election against her was in December cleared to proceed to trial Lake is a Republican candidate in the Arizona Senate Election br br br Prevalence of election denialism br br br Role of conservative media br Conservative news outlets such as Fox News Newsmax and OANN promoted false election fraud allegations during the weeks following the election including conspiracy theories that voting machines had been rigged to favor Biden Voting machine companies Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic filed defamation suits against those three cable networks some of their employees and others Fox News agreed to pay a million settlement to Dominion in April after it was revealed that top on air personalities and executives knew the allegations were false but continued to promote them anyway br br br Elected officials br An October Washington Post analysis found that of Republican nominees for House Senate and key statewide offices in nearly every state that year denied or questioned the presidential election outcome Secretaries of state oversee elections in states In nearly one in three Republican candidates for those offices supported overturning the presidential election results The America First Secretary of State Coalition co founded and led by Nevada Republican Jim Marchant was created in to promote election deniers for secretary of state in the United States secretary of state elections All but one of nearly twenty candidates the group endorsed in lost in the general election According to analysis by the nonpartisan States United Action election denialism cost Republican candidates from to percentage points of votes in the midterm elections br Trump made his election fraud claims a litmus test for Republican candidates and the heart of his platform After Mike Johnson won the October Speaker of the United States House election David A Graham posited that only members of the election denial movement had a chance to win the speakership with only Republican votes br br br Voters br As of August a large majority of Republican voters and Republican leaning independents continued to believe Joe Biden was not legitimately elected in br br br Analysis br Sarah Longwell a Republican political strategist who strongly opposes Trumpism wrote in April that she asked Trump voters in focus groups why they continue to believe the election was stolen from him She perceived that for many it was a hard to explain tribal response to a message that is echoed throughout the participants social and media environment br br Analysis of polls by Charles Stewart a Distinguished Professor of Political Science at MIT shows that there are deep ideological roots involving belief in conspiracies racial tensions and religion as well as partisanship He argues Among Republicans conspiracism has a potent effect on embracing election denialism followed by racial resentment Among independents the strongest influences on denialism are Christian nationalism and racial resentment And although election denialism is rare among Democrats what variation does exist is mostly explained by levels of racial resentment br Some election experts and historians contend that left unabated election denial could further reduce concessions by losing candidates disrupt the peaceful transfers of power and weaken or even dismantle American democracy Lisa Bryant a political science professor at California State University Fresno warned of the erosion of trust in the democratic process and the institutions it produces which might lead to a breakdown in the rule of law if the government and by extension the laws they create are not viewed as legitimate br br br Priorities and supporters of the movement br Following Trump s loss amid his false allegations of fraud Republican lawmakers initiated a sweeping effort to make voting laws more restrictive in several states across the country and to take control of the administrative management of elections at the state and local level Some planned to deploy an army of poll workers and lawyers to challenge votes in Democratic districts br The Washington Post reported in June on indications that county level Republicans in swing states might be preparing to challenge and delay their certifications of voting results in Such delays might cause a state to miss deadlines that ensure its electoral college votes are counted in Washington on January In four state elections since county election officials withheld certifications citing mistrust in voting machines or ballot errors though they could not produce evidence of actual voting fraud the certifications proceeded after state interventions which included warnings of potential and in Arizona actual criminal charges Voting rights activists were concerned that the continuing false allegations of election fraud since might lead to social unrest if efforts to delay certifications at the local level were overruled by state officials or courts The failure of a state to have its electoral college votes counted on January could result in neither presidential candidate reaching the minimum electoral votes causing the election to be thrown to the House In that scenario the election outcome would be determined by a simple majority count of state legislature representations Republicans controlled of legislatures in br br br Notable supporters of the election denial movement br Dennis Montgomery promoted widely debunked evidence for both the birther conspiracy theory movement and the election denial movement among other far right conspiracies was frequently widely cited by supporters of President Trump s efforts to overturn the election br br By My Pillow founder Mike Lindell had become a prominent figure in the movement spending millions of his money for conferences activist networks a media platform legal actions and research Through his My Pillow advertising placements he became a major financial backer of an expanding network of right wing podcasters and influencers Lindell s legal firm said in an October court filing that Lindell was in arrears by millions of dollars in fees and that the firm could no longer afford to represent him which Lindell confirmed br Organizations funded by dark money have met quietly with officials in Republican controlled states to create an incubator of policies that would restrict ballot access and amplify false claims that fraud is rampant in elections Led by the Heritage Foundation the groups include the Honest Elections Project which is among a network of conservative organizations associated with Leonard Leo a longtime prominent figure in the Federalist Society br The Conservative Partnership Institute CPI was founded in by former Republican senator and Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint CPI employs Mark Meadows and Jeffrey Clark and has been described as the nerve center for the MAGA movement CPI s funding increased from million to million in CPI includes the Election Integrity Network led by Cleta Mitchell Mitchell was a Trump advisor after the election who participated in the Trump Raffensperger phone call during which Trump pressured the Georgia secretary of state to find ballots that would secure him a victory in the state Trump and others including Meadows and Clark were indicted in the Georgia election racketeering prosecution for allegedly running a criminal racketeering enterprise Mitchell was one of individuals a special grand jury recommended for indictment on multiple charges though prosecutor Fani Willis declined to charge her By Mitchell said she was taking the lessons we learned in as she held seminars around the country to recruit election deniers to monitor elections because the only way Democrats win is to cheat br In the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School identified several individuals or groups that together were spending tens of millions to support election deniers in that year s midterm elections These included the billionaire couple Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein Trump s Save America PAC and Home Depot co founder Bernard Marcus Former Overstock com CEO Patrick Byrne said he spent million to convince people that the election was stolen he was also a major funder of the Maricopa County presidential ballot audit that sought but failed to find election fraud in the presidential election Byrne has been the largest funder of The America Project which pushes election denial narratives That group was founded by former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn in with an agenda that includes undermining trust in elections Byrne Flynn and others attended a December Oval Office meeting with Trump to discuss ways to overturn the president s election loss br Oracle Corporation founder Larry Ellison joined a November conference call with Sean Hannity and Senator Lindsey Graham to discuss ways to challenge the legitimacy of the election By October Ellison was donating millions of dollars to a SuperPAC to support four Senate candidates who had cast doubt on the election results br The Dinesh D Souza film Mules film falsely alleges unnamed nonprofit organizations associated with the Democratic Party paid mules to illegally collect and deposit ballots into drop boxes in five swing states during the presidential election br Some analysts and politicians both Republican and Democrat have suggested that election denial may include an element of grifting to solicit donations from unwitting supporters With an email campaign Trump raised about million for what he told donors was an official election defense fund that did not actually exist By September a federal grand jury was investigating whether Trump and his allies were soliciting donations on the basis of claims they knew were false which might violate federal wire fraud laws The Smith special counsel investigation was also examining the fundraising of former Trump attorney Sidney Powell by September br Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts was asked in June if Heritage would accept the results of the presidential election regardless of its outcome He replied Yes if there isn t massive fraud like there was in When presented with data from the Heritage Foundation election fraud database indicating there were only proven instances of voter fraud in the United States since Roberts responded that fraud is very hard to document and the Democrat party is very good
