title: Double-Cross System
id: 33090
The Double Cross System or XX System was a World War II counter espionage and deception operation of the British Security Service MI Nazi agents in Britain real and false were captured turned themselves in or simply announced themselves and were then used by the British to broadcast mainly disinformation to their Nazi controllers Its operations were overseen by the Twenty Committee under the chairmanship of John Cecil Masterman the name of the committee comes from the number in Roman numerals XX i e a double cross br The policy of MI during the war was initially to use the system for counter espionage It was only later that its potential for deception purposes was realised Of the agents from the German intelligence services Abwehr and Sicherheitsdienst SD some were apprehended while many of the agents who reached British shores turned themselves in to the authorities others were apprehended after they made elementary mistakes during their operations In addition some were false agents who had tricked the Germans into believing they would spy for them if they helped them reach England e g Treasure Fido Later agents were instructed to contact agents who unknown to the Abwehr were controlled by the British The Abwehr and SD sent agents over by parachute drop submarine or travel via neutral countries The last route was most commonly used with agents often impersonating refugees After the war it was discovered that all the agents Germany sent to Britain had given themselves up or had been captured with the possible exception of one who committed suicide br br br Early agents br Following a July conference in Kiel the Abwehr German intelligence began an espionage campaign against Britain involving intelligence gathering and sabotage Spies were sent over from Europe in various ways some parachuted or were delivered by submarine Others entered the country on false passports or posing as refugees Public perception in Britain was that the country was full of well trained German spies who were deeply integrated into society There was widespread spy mania as Churchill put it The truth was that between September and November fewer than agents arrived in the country mostly of Eastern European extraction they were badly trained and poorly motivated br The agents were not difficult to spot and it became easier still when the German Enigma machine encryption was broken MI with advance warning of infiltration had no trouble picking up almost all of the spies sent to the country Writing in John C Masterman who had later in the war headed the Twenty Committee said that by MI actively ran and controlled the German espionage system in the United Kingdom It was not an idle boast post war records confirmed that none of the Abwehr agents bar one who committed suicide went unnoticed br Once caught the spies were deposited in the care of Lieutenant Colonel Robin Stephens at Camp Latchmere House Richmond After Stephens a notorious and brilliant interrogator had picked apart their life history the agents were either spirited away to be imprisoned or killed or if judged acceptable offered the chance to turn double agent on the Germans br Control of the new double agents fell to Thomas Argyll Robertson usually called Tar from his initials a charismatic MI agent A Scot and something of a playboy Robertson had some early experience with double agents just prior to the war he had been case officer to Arthur Owens code name Snow Owens was an oddity and it became apparent that he was playing off the Germans and British although to what end Robertson was unable to uncover Robertson dispatched an ex RNAS officer called Walter Dicketts code name Celery to neutral Lisbon in early to meet Owens German spymaster Nikolaus Ritter from the Abwehr to establish Owens bona fides Unknown to Dicketts Owens had betrayed him to the Germans before Dicketts entered Germany to be interrogated by experts from the Abwehr in Hamburg Although Dicketts managed to get himself recruited as a German agent while continuing to report to MI Owens claimed that Dicketts survival meant he had been turned by the Germans When both agents returned to England Robertson and his team spent countless hours trying to establish which agent was telling the truth In the end Owens was interned for endangering Dicketts life and for revealing the important information that his German radio transmitter was controlled by MI The whole affair resulted in the collapse of the entire Snow network comprising the double agents Owens GW Biscuit Charlie Summer and Celery The experiment had not appeared to be a success but MI had learned lessons about how Abwehr operated and how double agents might be useful br Robertson believed that turning German spies would have numerous benefits disclosing what information Abwehr wanted and to mislead them as part of a military deception It would also discourage them from sending more agents if they believed an operational network existed Section B A a subordinate of B section under Guy Liddell was formed and Robertson was put in charge of handling the double agent program br Robertson s first agents were not a success Giraffe George Graf was never really used and Gander Kurt Goose MI had a penchant for amusingly relevant code names had been sent to Britain with a radio that could only transmit and both were quickly decommissioned The next two attempts were even more farcical G sta Caroli and Wulf Schmidt a Danish citizen landed via parachute in September The two were genuine Nazis had trained together and were friends Caroli was coerced into turning double in return for Schmidt s life being spared whilst Schmidt was told that Caroli had sold him out and in anger swapped sides br Caroli quickly became a problem he attempted to strangle his MI handler before making an escape carrying a canoe on a motorcycle He vaguely planned to row to Holland but came unstuck after falling off the bike in front of a policeman He was eventually recaptured and judged too much trouble to be used Schmidt was more of a success codenamed Tate he continued to contact Germany until May These eccentric spies made Robertson aware that handling double agents was going to be a difficult task br br br Methods of operation br The main form of communication that agents used with their handlers was secret writing Letters were intercepted by the postal censorship authorities and some agents were caught Later in the war wireless sets were provided by the Germans Eventually transmissions purporting to be from one double agent were facilitated by transferring the operation of the set to the main headquarters of MI On the British side the fight against the Abwehr and SD was made much easier by the breaking of German ciphers Abwehr hand ciphers were cracked early in the war and SD hand ciphers and Abwehr Enigma ciphers followed on November by Dilly Knox agents sent messages to the Abwehr in the simple code which was then sent on using an enigma machine with the simple codes broken it helped break the daily enigma code The Abwehr used a different version of Enigma machines in November a machine was captured in Algiers during Operation Torch it was found to have no plug board however the three rotors had been changed to rotate and times rather than once every letters plus a plate on the left acted as a fourth rotor The capture of a machine greatly helped the quicker decoding of German messages The signals intelligence allowed an accurate assessment of whether the double agents were really trusted by the Germans and what effect their information had br A crucial aspect of the system was the need for genuine information to be sent along with the deception material This need caused problems early in the war with those who controlled the release of information being reluctant to provide even a small amount of relatively innocuous genuine material Later in the war as the system became better organised genuine information was integrated into the deception system It was used to disguise the development of Gee the Allies navigation aid for bombers ch One of the agents sent genuine information about Operation Torch to the Germans It was postmarked before the landing but due to delays deliberately introduced by the British authorities the information did not reach the Germans until after the Allied troops were ashore The information impressed the Germans as it appeared to date from before the attack but it was militarily useless to them br br br Operation outside the United Kingdom br It was not only in the United Kingdom that the system was operated A number of agents connected with the system were run in neutral Spain and Portugal Some even had direct contact with the Germans in occupied Europe One of the most famous of the agents who operated outside of the UK was Du an Popov Tricycle There was even a case in which an agent started running deception operations independently from Portugal using little more than guidebooks maps and a very vivid imagination to convince his Abwehr handlers that he was spying in the UK This agent Juan Pujol Garc a Garbo created a network of phantom sub agents and eventually convinced the British authorities that he could be useful He and his fictitious network were absorbed into the main double cross system and he became so respected by Abwehr that they stopped landing agents in Britain after The Germans became dependent on the spurious information that was fed to them by Garbo s network and the other double cross agents br br br Operation Fortitude and D Day landings br The British put their double agent network to work in support of Operation Fortitude a plan to deceive the Germans about the location of the Normandy Landings in France Allowing one of the double agents to claim to have stolen documents describing the invasion plans might have aroused suspicion Instead agents were allowed to report minutiae such as insignia on soldiers uniforms and unit markings on vehicles The observations in the south central areas largely gave accurate information about the units located there Reports from south west England indicated few troop sightings when in reality many units were housed there Reports from the south east depicted the real and the notional Operation Quicksilver forces Any military planner would know that to mount an invasion of Europe from England Allied units had to be staged around the country with those that would land first placed nearest to the invasion point German intelligence used the agent reports to construct an order of battle for the Allied forces that placed the centre of gravity of the invasion force opposite Pas de Calais the point on the French coast closest to England and therefore a likely invasion site The deception was so effective that the Germans kept divisions in reserve near Calais even after the invasion had begun lest it prove to be a diversion from the main invasion at Calais Early battle reports of insignia on Allied units only confirmed the information the double agents had sent increasing the Germans trust in their network Agent Garbo was informed in radio messages from Germany after the invasion that he had been awarded the Iron Cross br br br V weapons deception br br The British noticed that during the V flying bomb attacks of the weapons were falling mi km short of Trafalgar Square the actual Luftwaffe aiming points such as Tower Bridge being unknown to the British Duncan Sandys was told to get MI controlled German agents such as Zig Zag and Tate to report the V impacts back to Germany To make the Germans aim short the British used these double agents to exaggerate the number of V s falling in the north and west of London and to underreport those falling in the south and east ch Around June only one of seven impacts was reported south of the Thames when of the V s had fallen there Although the Germans plotted a sample of V s which had radio transmitters showing that they had fallen short the telemetry was ignored in favour of the agents reports br When the Germans received a false double cross V report that there was considerable damage in Southampton which had not been a target the V s were temporarily aimed at the south coast ports The double cross deception had caused a re targeting from London not just inaccurate aiming When V s launched from Heinkel He s on July at Southampton were inaccurate British advisor Frederick Lindemann recommended that the agents report heavy losses to save hundreds of Londoners each week at the expense of only a few lives in the ports When the Cabinet learned of the deception on August Herbert Morrison ruled against it saying that they had no right to decide that one man should die while another should survive However R V Jones refused to call off the plan absent written orders which never came and the deception continued p br When the V rocket blitz began with only a few minutes from launch to impact the deception was enhanced by providing locations damaged by bombing verifiable by aerial reconnaissance for impacts in central London but each time tagged with an earlier impact that had fallen mi km short of central London From mid January to mid February the mean point of V impacts edged eastward at the rate of a couple of miles a week with more and more V s falling short of central London Of the V s aimed at London more than half landed outside the London Civil Defence Region p br br br List of agents br br br Notes br
