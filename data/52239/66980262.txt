title: 5G misinformation
id: 66980262
Misinformation related to G technology is widespread in many countries of the world The spreading of false information and conspiracy theories has also been propagated by the general public and celebrities In social media misinformation related to G has been presented as facts and shared extensively There are no scientifically proven adverse health impacts from the exposure to G radio frequency radiation with levels below those suggested by the guidelines of regulating bodies including the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection ICNIRP Furthermore studies have shown that there is no noticeable increase in the everyday radiofrequency electromagnetic exposure since despite the increased use of communication devices br br br Extent br In a survey conducted in the US adults were asked whether the US government is using the COVID vaccine to place microchips in the population of the survey takers said that this was definitely true and said that it was probably true Many wrongly believe these microchips will be controlled via G In a survey conducted among the residents of Nordic countries replied that they did not know enough about G or how it affects their lives In of the Nordic consumers expressed that they would eventually switch to G when it became available In this figure dropped to which could be due to misinformation related to G It may also be due to the perceived lack of benefits of G over the existing G in terms of consumer applications br One third of British people said in a survey that they cannot rule out a link between COVID and G Eight percent of the survey takers believed that there is a link between the two while remained unsure br A study that monitored data from Google Trends showed that searches related to coronavirus and G started at different times but peaked in the same week of April in six countries br Misinformation about the origin of the COVID pandemic such as its origin is from G technology has been reported to cause higher anxiety in a study conducted in Jordan br A study analysing Twitter data related to tweets about G and COVID showed that of the tweeters believed in the role of G in the COVID outbreak while denounced or mocked it br br br List of popular misinformation br br br Origin br There have been conspiracy theories suggesting that the spread of the SARS CoV virus from the epicentre of the pandemic in Wuhan China is linked to the large number of G towers in the city However the truth is that G technology is not fully deployed in Wuhan br br br Health impact br br G causes cancer It is very unlikely that exposure to the G radiofrequency will cause cancer G is non ionizing radiation and such radiation does not damage DNA Cancer is generally caused by ionizing radiation that damages DNA br G is the cause for COVID Despite the COVID pandemic having started during the deployment of G technology the two are in no way connected There is undisputable evidence that COVID is a viral disease and has no relationship with G or any other cellular technology br G weakens the immune system There is no evidence to suggest that the low levels of radiation emitted by G technology can have any effect either on the immune system including antigens and antibodies br br br Environmental impact br G kills birds or insects Radio wave emissions above MHz from cell telephone towers are not known to harm birds Mass bee deaths that happened in many parts of the world are not related to G deployment br br br Government and industrial surveillance br COVID is a cover to embed microchips within COVID vaccine for controlling people via G A microchip with tracking capabilities or G functionality would need to be much larger than the bore of a needle so it would not be possible to inject through a syringe Indeed incorporating the size of such a chip would require a syringe with a bore diameter over a dozen times larger than the ones commonly used to deliver the COVID vaccine Furthermore the microchip would not function without a power source capable of transmitting a signal through at least an inch of muscle fat and skin br The G grid is part of a larger surveillance and artificial intelligence agenda The fact is that G is nothing more than a technology which establishes wireless connections between devices and the internet with a higher speed and capacity than older technologies such as G or G It is only up to the application developers whether to use this wireless connection for any purpose including surveillance In that sense any wireless technology including G or G can also be used for surveillance br G is a weapons system that governments and industries disguise as new technology Some people likened the G radiofrequency transmitters to the US military s directed energy weapon called Active Denial System ADS which was used to heat the surface of targets such as the skin of targeted human beings Although both ADS and G use radio waves G transmits over a much lower frequency which is safe for humans Moreover G transmits at a much lower power than ADS br G frequencies are used for crowd dispersal br G maps the insides of bodies and homes br G replicates inside the body and causes re radiation br br br Misconception of G principal concepts br Installing new G base stations over a given area may result in an uncontrollable increase of radiofrequency pollution Dense deployment of G base stations is beneficial to the users living in proximity to them because there is no abrupt decrease of radiofrequency compared to sparse deployment Installing additional base stations over the area may be needed for supporting an increasing number of users with higher data rates As a result the distance between users and the nearest base station shrinks This is called network densification which may be wrongly perceived to increase the health impacts of G However unlike the common perception network densification can reduce the average electromagnetic field exposure Lower network densification means that each base station should cover a larger area leading to higher radiated power for each cell Additionally dense deployment of G base stations leads to reduced radiation from mobile phones since connecting base stations are closer to mobile phones Typically radiation from base stations is lower than the radiations from mobile phones since the radiation power decreases with the square of distance from the source br br br Impact br The unsupported health theories have already led to vandalism and burning of some G equipment particularly in the United Kingdom Unfounded health fears have stalled the network upgrades necessary to reach faster speeds in some cities while the coronavirus pandemic has slowed sales of G compatible phones br br br List of protests br In April arsonists in the U K set G wireless towers in Birmingham Liverpool and Merseyside on fire and then uploaded videos of the vandalism to social media br Australian anti vaxxers protested against G technology large pharmaceutical corporations and COVID vaccines in Melbourne and Sydney Almost attacks against mobile masts were reported during COVID lockdown in the UK Nearly assaults were recorded against telecom engineers in the UK br Seven cell phone towers were burned in Canada by G skeptics in May br In April anti G protestors in the Netherlands sabotaged and set fire to several G towers and sprayed an anti G slogan at the scene of an attack The Dutch government said it reported various incidents around broadcasting masts and considered opposition to the G rollout as a possible cause according to a statement on its website It also warned that attacks targeting G network equipment can have consequences for the coverage of the telecommunications network and reachability of emergency services br Global protest of invisible people on June Yellow chairs were set up in public spaces around the world to portray electro hyper sensitive people that could not be present The International EHS Day was initiated by the French EHS in br br br Efforts to counter misinformation br Many organisations including the World Health Organization have created mythbusters and educational material to counter misinformation related to G especially about its effect on health The Australian Parliament in its inquiry into G technology has noted that community confidence in G has been shaken by extensive misinformation and government agencies as well as industries have stepped up to provide trustworthy information to the public br In April Twitter updated its policy on unverified claims that incite harmful activity which could among other things lead to the damage of G infrastructure In June Twitter started placing fact checking labels on tweets about G and COVID Facebook has removed several posts with false claims of associations between G and COVID br A study recommends that denunciation of the G and COVID theory from a world leader would have helped in mitigating the spread of misinformation The study also recommends that the fight against misinformation should ideally happen in the platform where the misinformation is being shared Appeals from cultural figures with large following on social media can also help reduce misinformation The general public can stop the spread of misinformation by reporting harmful content as well as by not sharing or engaging with them br br br
