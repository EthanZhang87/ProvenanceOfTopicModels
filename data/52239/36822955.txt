In cultural studies media culture refers to the current Western capitalist society that emerged and developed from the th century under the influence of mass media The term alludes to the overall impact and intellectual guidance exerted by the media primarily TV but also the press radio and cinema not only on public opinion but also on tastes and values br The alternative term mass culture conveys the idea that such culture emerges spontaneously from the masses themselves like popular art did before the th century The expression media culture on the other hand conveys the idea that such culture is the product of the mass media Another alternative term for media culture is image culture br Media culture with its declinations of advertising and public relations is often considered as a system centered on the manipulation of the mass of society Corporate media are used primarily to represent and reproduce dominant ideologies Prominent in the development of this perspective has been the work of Theodor Adorno since the s Media culture is associated with consumerism and in this sense called alternatively consumer culture br br br Definitions br br Popular culture and the mass media have a symbiotic relationship each depends on the other in an intimate collaboration br The news media mines the work of scientists and scholars and conveys it to the general public often emphasizing elements that have inherent appeal or the power to amaze For instance giant pandas a species in remote Chinese woodlands have become well known items of popular culture parasitic worms though of greater practical importance have not Both scholarly facts and news stories get modified through popular transmission often to the point of outright falsehoods br br br As Dumbing Down of Society br Hannah Arendt s essay The Crisis in Culture suggested that a media driven by markets would lead to culture being replaced by the commands of entertainment Susan Sontag argues that in our culture the most intelligible persuasive values are increasingly drawn from the entertainment industries As a result tepid the glib and the senselessly cruel topics are becoming the norm br Some critics argue that popular culture is dumbing down newspapers that once ran foreign news now feature celebrity gossip pictures of scantily dressed young ladies television has replaced high quality drama with gardening cookery and other lifestyle programmes and reality TV and asinine soaps to the point that people are constantly immersed in trivia about celebrity culture br Critics have lamented the replacement of high art and authentic folk culture by tasteless industrialized artefacts produced on a mass scale in order to satisfy the lowest common denominator According to them the popular culture which rose after the end of the Second World War led to the concentration of media into a handful of large multinational conglomerates This popular press decreased the amount of actual news or information and replaced it with entertainment or titillation that reinforces fears prejudice scapegoating processes paranoia and aggression br br br As an unfavorable influence on television and cinema br According to Altheide and Snow media culture means that within a culture the media increasingly influences other institutions e g politics religion sports which become constructed alongside a media logic Since the s television has been the main medium for molding public opinion br In Rosenberg and White s book Mass Culture Dwight Macdonald argues that Popular culture is a debased trivial culture that voids both the deep realities sex death failure tragedy and also the simple spontaneous pleasures The masses debauched by several generations of this sort of thing in turn come to demand trivial and comfortable cultural products Van den Haag argues that all mass media in the end alienate people from personal experience and though appearing to offset it intensify their moral isolation from each other from the reality and from themselves br Critics of television and film have argued that the quality of TV output has been diluted as stations pursue ratings by focusing on whatever is attractive and eye catching which ends up being heavily superficial Hollywood films have changed from creating formulaic films which emphasize shock value and superficial thrill s and the use of special effects with themes that focus on the basic instincts of aggression revenge violence and greed The plots are mostly simple easy to comprehend and follow a standardized format which is similar to its predecessors This leads to a decline in creative plotlines or elements leaving the characters poorly made bland repetitive and the dialogues unengaging inaccurately representing the complexities of real life or even unreal br More recently scholars turned to the concept of the mediatization of culture to address the various processes through which culture is influenced by the modus operandi of the media On one hand the media are cultural institutions and artifacts of their own on the other hand other domains have become dependent on the media and their various affordances br br br Through religion br Media culture in its mass marketing has been compared to the role of religions in the past It has been considered as taking the place of the old traditional religions The waves of enthusiasm and fervent exaltation for a given product a characteristic consumerist phenomenon has been compared to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism br Conversely the Catholic Church the dominant religious institution in the Western world has been considered retrospectively as an antecedent and sophisticated form of public relations advertiser and multinational corporation selling its product to a mass of worshipers frequently alternating as consumers br br br Symbolic consumption br Consumers decisions are made based not only on the economic concept of the utility material goods provide but also from their symbolic value in terms of the search for one s self and place within the context of society and group identity In other words the products consumers purchase are part of creating a story about who they are and whom they identify with br Scholars view symbolic consumption as a social construct A product is effective as an expression of identity only if the group shares a perception about the symbolic meaning of a product These meanings are conveyed to consumers through advertising magazines and television br Jean Paul Sartre wrote that under certain conditions things or even people can become part of an extended concept of self Consumers may develop a narrative of their life based on their consumption choices to hold on to or break continuity with their past understand themselves and express changes in their sense of self The creation of a lifestyle association through consumption may mean avoiding past patterns of consumption that symbolize the old self or certain social groups The symbolism of goods is based on socially shared beliefs br br br Feminist approaches to media culture br The feminist approaches related to media culture is something that can stem from feminist theory in relation to media culture With the term feminism in itself having such a broad term the feminist communication theory is something that branches off into many other concepts thus providing us with feminist approaches on media culture These approaches will often highlight how media has impacted women the roles of women in media environments how to dismantle certain perspectives with media culture etc br For example Angela McRobbie s analysis of teenage girls based on a popular magazine at the time called Jackie McRobbie uses a structural feminism approach in order to analyze the ideology of femininity in magazines and other medias as identified through codes of romance personal domestic life fashion beauty pop music and new sexualities Laughey These codes had shown how these different aspects when presented in the form of the popular media of the magazine Jackie significantly impacted these individuals The codes and case study showed how these aspects affected the way the teenage girls at this time acted thought and portrayed themselves Through approaches like McRobbie s it is shown how media culture had significant impact on women at this time McRobbie s more recent research continuous to show how this is a prevalent reoccurrence in media culture and women br Feminist approaches can also be applied when discussing media culture in terms of fashion and how it can relate to other media s like music magazines celebrities etc An example of this is looking at the postfeminism approach and how it is explained by certain researchers that women and many young girls become victim to postfeminist styled fashion Meaning a style of fashion that is promoting the early and or over sexualization of clothing to girls at a young age solely because of how they are marketed with the ideologies that come with a postfeminist approach This particular concept is not to disregard the meaning that postfeminism approach provides for society and women but to see how a specific way of feminist thinking has affected women and media culture br There are many feminist approaches to discuss as well as different ways for researchers and individuals to apply these approaches to media culture It is important to remember that feminist approaches are not the only way to understand media culture or dissect media culture but one of many ways to do so br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br Adorno Culture Industry Reconsidered br Bignell Jonathan Postmodern Media Culture br
