A rotary printing press is a printing press in which the images to be printed are curved around a cylinder Printing can be done on various substrates including paper cardboard and plastic Substrates can be sheet feed or unwound on a continuous roll through the press to be printed and further modified if required e g die cut overprint varnished embossed Printing presses that use continuous rolls are sometimes referred to as web presses br br br Developmental history br William Nicholson filed a patent for a rotary press The rotary press itself is an evolution of the cylinder press also patented by William Nicholson invented by Beaucher of France in the s and by Friedrich Koenig in the early th century Rotary drum printing was invented by Josiah Warren in whose design was later imitated by Richard March Hoe in An patent replaced the reciprocating platforms used in earlier designs with a fixed platform served by rotating drums and through a series of advances a complete rotary printing press was perfected in and patented in It appeared in Edinburgh in and then traveled to London where it was used by the Times newspaper in where it then traveled to France in and Germany in By the time it reached Spain in it had become common use Some sources describe the Parisian Hippolyte Auguste Marinoni as the inventor of the Rotary printing press but this was the subject of a patent dispute that was decided in Hoe s favor A S Abell of the Baltimore Sun was the first American user of the rotary press br br br Types of rotary printing presses br Today there are four main types of rotary presses letterpress offset including web offset rotogravure and flexo short for flexography Although all the types use cylinders to print they vary in their method br br Rotary letterpress printing uses type metal plates molded in the form of a cylinder The plates called stereotypes are coated with ink then pressed against a continuous roll of paper Rotary letterpress printing was used in the mid twentieth century to print most major newspapers br In offset lithography the image is chemically applied to a plate generally through exposure of photosensitive layers on the plate material Lithography is based on the fact that water and oil do not mix which enables the planographic process to work In the context of a printing plate a wettable surface the non image area may also be termed hydrophilic and a non wettable surface the image area hydrophobic br Gravure is a process in which small cells or holes are etched into a copper cylinder which are able to be filled with ink All the colours are etched in different angles thus while printing every colour is placed in proper position to give the appropriate image br Flexography is a relief system in which a raised image is created on a typical polymer based plate br In stamp collecting rotary press printed stamps are sometimes a different size than stamps printed with a flat plate This happens because the stamp images are farther apart on a rotary press which makes the individual stamps larger typically to mm to in br br br See also br Wetting br br br
