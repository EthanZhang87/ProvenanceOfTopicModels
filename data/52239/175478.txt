Spectra A Book of Poetic Experiments was a small volume of poetry published in by American writers Witter Bynner who wrote under the pseudonym Emanuel Morgan and Arthur Davison Ficke who wrote as Anne Knish The book was intended as satire directed at the Imagism poetry movement br Spectra was preceded by a brief manifesto outlining the Spectric method as a school br br In the first place it speaks to the mind of that process of diffraction by which are disarticulated the several colored and other rays of which light is composed br In its second sense the term Spectric relates to the reflex vibrations of physical sight and suggests the luminous appearance which is seen after the exposure of the eye to intense light and by analogy the after colors of the poets initial vision br In its third sense Spectric connotes the overtones adumbrations or spectres which for the poet haunt all objects of both the seen and unseen world br The poems in the collection were identified by opus numbers rather than titles and mostly take on a silly tone br From Opus by Emanuel Morgan br br If I were only dafter br I might be making hymns br To the liquor of your laughter br And the lacquer of your limbs br Anne Knish s Opus br br If bathing were a virtue not a lust br I would be dirtiest br To some housecleaning is a holy rite br For myself houses would be empty br But for the golden motes dancing in sunbeams br Tax assessors frequently overlook valuables br Today they noted my jade br But my memory of you escaped them br Spectra was intended solely as a joke Initially even the publisher was fooled by the book but he was let in on the joke before going to press The authors assumed the ridiculousness of the work would shine through but it was actually accepted as a legitimate poetic movement for two years In Bynner admitted in a public speech that he had co authored the book and explained the hoax br Both Bynner and Ficke were accomplished poets of their time but the Spectra poems are probably the most widely remembered of their work Both authors admitted to the hoax having backfired to a certain extent as it overshadowed their more serious work Nonetheless Ficke stated that he learned a good deal about composition while writing as Knish adding that it actually influenced his later work br br br br br br Further reading br Smith William Jay The Spectra Hoax Wesleyan University Press Middletown CT br br br External links br Spectra complete text
