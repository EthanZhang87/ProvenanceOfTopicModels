In journalism yellow journalism and the yellow press are American newspapers that use eye catching headlines and sensationalized exaggerations for increased sales The English term is chiefly used in the US In the United Kingdom a similar term is tabloid journalism Other languages e g Russian zhyoltaya pressa sometimes have terms derived from the American term Yellow journalism emerged in the intense battle for readers by two newspapers in New York City in s It was not common in other cities br Joseph Pulitzer purchased the New York World in and told his editors to use sensationalism crusades against corruption and lavish use of illustrations to boost circulation William Randolph Hearst then purchased the rival New York Journal in They engaged in an intense circulation war at a time when most men bought one copy every day from rival street vendors shouting their paper s headlines The term yellow journalism originated from the innovative popular Yellow Kid comic strip that was published first in the World and later in the Journal br This type of reporting was characterized by exaggerated headlines unverified claims partisan agendas and a focus on topics like crime scandal sports and violence Historians have debated whether Yellow journalism played a large role in inflaming public opinion about Spain s atrocities in Cuba at the time and perhaps pushing the U S into the Spanish American War of Most historians say it did not do so The two papers reached a working class Democratic audience and the nation s upscale Republican decision makers such as President William McKinley and leaders in Congress seldom read the Yellow press br br br Definitions br Journalism historian W Joseph Campbell described yellow press newspapers as having daily multi column front page headlines covering a variety of topics such as sports and scandal using bold layouts with large illustrations and perhaps color heavy reliance on unnamed sources and unabashed self promotion The term was extensively used to describe two major New York City newspapers around as they battled for circulation br Journalism historian Frank Luther Mott used five characteristics to identify yellow journalism br br scare headlines in huge print often sensationalizing minor news br lavish use of pictures or imaginary drawings br use of faked interviews misleading headlines pseudoscience and a parade of false learning from so called experts br emphasis on full color Sunday supplements usually with superficial articles and comics br dramatic sympathy with the underdog against the system br Another common feature was emphasizing sensationalized crime reporting to boost sales and excite public opinion br br br Origins Pulitzer vs Hearst br br br Coinage and early usage br An English magazine in noted All American journalism is not yellow though all strictly up to date yellow journalism is American br The term was coined in the mid s to characterize the sensational journalism in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer s New York World and William Randolph Hearst s New York Journal The battle peaked from to about and historical usage often refers specifically to this period Both papers were sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation although the newspapers did serious reporting as well Richard F Outcault the author of a popular cartoon strip the Yellow Kid was tempted away from the World by Hearst and the cartoon accounted substantially towards a big increase in sales of the Journal br The term was coined by Erwin Wardman the editor of the New York Press Wardman was the first to publish the term but there is evidence that expressions such as yellow journalism and school of yellow kid journalism were already used by newsmen of that time Wardman never defined the term exactly Possibly it was a mutation from earlier slander where Wardman twisted new journalism into nude journalism Wardman had also used the expression yellow kid journalism referring to the then popular comic strip which was published by both Pulitzer and Hearst during a circulation war br br br Hearst in San Francisco Pulitzer in New York br br Joseph Pulitzer purchased the New York World in after making the St Louis Post Dispatch the dominant daily in that city Pulitzer strove to make the New York World an entertaining read and filled his paper with pictures games and contests that drew in new readers Crime stories filled many of the pages with headlines like Was He a Suicide and Screaming for Mercy In addition Pulitzer charged readers only two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes pages of information the only other two cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages br br While there were many sensational stories in the New York World they were by no means the only pieces or even the dominant ones Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society and he put the World in the service of social reform Pulitzer explained that The American people want something terse forcible picturesque striking something that will arrest their attention enlist their sympathy arouse their indignation stimulate their imagination convince their reason and awaken their conscience br Just two years after Pulitzer took it over the World became the highest circulation newspaper in New York aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party Older publishers envious of Pulitzer s success began criticizing the World harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting trends which influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism Charles Dana editor of the New York Sun attacked The World and said Pulitzer was deficient in judgment and in staying power br Pulitzer s approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst a mining heir who acquired the San Francisco Examiner from his father in Hearst studied the World and resolved to make the San Francisco Examiner as bright as Pulitzer s paper br br Under his leadership the Examiner devoted percent of its space to crime presenting the stories as morality plays and sprinkled adultery and nudity by th century standards on the front page A month after Hearst took over the paper the Examiner ran this headline about a hotel fire HUNGRY FRANTIC FLAMES They Leap Madly Upon the Splendid Pleasure Palace by the Bay of Monterey Encircling Del Monte in Their Ravenous Embrace From Pinnacle to Foundation Leaping Higher Higher Higher With Desperate Desire Running Madly Riotous Through Cornice Archway and Facade Rushing in Upon the Trembling Guests with Savage Fury Appalled and Panic Stricken the Breathless Fugitives Gaze Upon the Scene of Terror The Magnificent Hotel and Its Rich Adornments Now a Smoldering heap of Ashes The Examiner Sends a Special Train to Monterey to Gather Full Details of the Terrible Disaster Arrival of the Unfortunate Victims on the Morning s Train A History of Hotel del Monte The Plans for Rebuilding the Celebrated Hostelry Particulars and Supposed Origin of the Fire br Hearst could be hyperbolic in his crime coverage one of his early pieces regarding a band of murderers attacked the police for forcing Examiner reporters to do their work for them But while indulging in these stunts the Examiner also increased its space for international news and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and inefficiency br br In one well remembered story Examiner reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that poor women were treated with gross cruelty The entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared br br br Competition in New York br br With the success of the Examiner established by the early s Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to purchase and acquired the New York Journal in a penny paper br Metropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the s and discovered the larger the circulation base the better This drove Hearst following Pulitzer s earlier strategy he kept the Journal s price at one cent compared to The World s two cent price while providing as much information as rival newspapers The approach worked and as the Journal s circulation jumped to Pulitzer cut his price to a penny hoping to drive his young competitor into bankruptcy br In a counterattack Hearst raided the staff of the World in While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money Pulitzer who had grown increasingly abusive to his employees had become an difficult man to work for and many World employees were willing to jump for the sake of getting away from him br Although the competition between the World and the Journal was fierce the papers were temperamentally alike Both were Democratic both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants a sharp contrast to upscale papers like the New York Tribune s Whitelaw Reid that blamed poverty on moral defects Both invested enormous resources in their Sunday editions which functioned like weekly magazines going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism br Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages Hogan s Alley a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nightshirt nicknamed The Yellow Kid became exceptionally popular when cartoonist Richard F Outcault began drawing it in the World in early When Hearst hired Outcault away Pulitzer asked artist George Luks to continue the strip with his characters giving the city two Yellow Kids The use of yellow journalism as a synonym for over the top sensationalism thus started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of the Yellow Kid papers br br br Spanish American War br br Pulitzer and Hearst in the s and s were blamed as a cause of entry into the Spanish American War due to sensationalist stories or exaggerations of the terrible conditions in Cuba However the majority of Americans did not live in New York City and the decision makers who did live there relied more on staid newspapers like the Times The Sun or the Post James Creelman wrote an anecdote in his memoir that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and There will be no war Creelman claimed Hearst responded Please remain You furnish the pictures and I ll furnish the war Hearst denied the veracity of the story and no one has found any evidence of the telegrams existing Historian Emily Erickson states br br Serious historians have dismissed the telegram story as unlikely The hubris contained in this supposed telegram however does reflect the spirit of unabashed self promotion that was a hallmark of the yellow press and of Hearst in particular br Hearst became a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in Cuba in Stories of Cuban virtue and Spanish brutality soon dominated his front page While the accounts were of dubious accuracy the newspaper readers of the th century did not expect or necessarily want his stories to be pure nonfiction Historian Michael Robertson has said that Newspaper reporters and readers of the s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact based reporting opinion and literature br Pulitzer though lacking Hearst s resources kept the story on his front page The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough The island was in a terrible economic depression and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler sent to crush the rebellion herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths Having clamored for a fight for two years Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came A week after the United States declared war on Spain he ran How do you like the Journal s war on his front page In fact President William McKinley never read the Journal nor newspapers like the Tribune and the New York Evening Post Moreover journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead The Journal and the World were pitched to Democrats in New York City and were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers they seldom made headlines outside New York City Piero Gleijeses looked at major newspapers and finds br br Eight of the papers in my sample advocated war or measures that would lead to war before the Maine blew up twelve joined the pro war ranks in the wake of the explosion thirteen strongly opposed the war until hostilities began The borders between the groups are fluid For example the Wall Street Journal and Dun s Review opposed the war but their opposition was muted The New York Herald the New York Commercial Advertiser and the Chicago Times Herald came out in favour of war in March but with such extreme reluctance that it is misleading to include them in the pro war ranks br War came because public opinion was sickened by the bloodshed and because leaders like McKinley realized that Spain had lost control of Cuba These factors weighed more on the president s mind than the melodramas in the New York Journal Nick Kapur says that McKinley s actions were based more on his values of arbitrationism pacifism humanitarianism and manly self restraint than on external pressures br When the invasion began Hearst sailed directly to Cuba as a war correspondent providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule arguing no true history of the war can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of yellow journalists many of whom lie in unremembered graves br br br After the war br Hearst was a leading Democrat who promoted William Jennings Bryan for president in and He later ran for mayor and governor and even sought the presidential nomination but lost much of his personal prestige when outrage exploded in after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested the assassination of William McKinley When McKinley was shot on September critics accused Hearst s Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed It was later presumed that Hearst did not know of Bierce s column and he claimed to have pulled Brisbane s after it ran in a first edition but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions br When later asked about Hearst s reaction to the incident Bierce reportedly said I have never mentioned the matter to him and he never mentioned it to me br Pulitzer haunted by his yellow sins returned the World to its crusading roots as the new century dawned By the time of his death in the World was a widely respected publication and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in Its name lived on in the Scripps Howard New York World Telegram and then later the New York World Telegram and Sun in and finally was last used by the New York World Journal Tribune from September to May At that point only one broadsheet newspaper was left in New York City
