Google Books previously known as Google Book Search Google Print and by its code name Project Ocean is a service from Google that searches the full text of books and magazines that Google has scanned converted to text using optical character recognition OCR and stored in its digital database Books are provided either by publishers and authors through the Google Books Partner Program or by Google s library partners through the Library Project Additionally Google has partnered with a number of magazine publishers to digitize their archives br The Publisher Program was first known as Google Print when it was introduced at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October The Google Books Library Project which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory was announced in December br The Google Books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge However it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the OCR process br As of October Google celebrated years of Google Books and provided the number of scanned books as more than million titles br Google estimated in that there were about million distinct titles in the world and stated that it intended to scan all of them However the scanning process in American academic libraries has slowed since the s Google Book s scanning efforts have been subject to litigation including Authors Guild v Google a class action lawsuit in the United States decided in Google s favor see below This was a major case that came close to changing copyright practices for orphan works in the United States A study by scholars from the University of California Berkeley and Northeastern University s business schools found that Google Books s digitization of books has led to increased sales for the physical versions of the books br br br Details br Results from Google Books show up in both the universal Google Search and in the dedicated Google Books search website books google com br In response to search queries Google Books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission If Google believes the book is still under copyright a user sees snippets of text around the queried search terms All instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight br The four access levels used on Google Books are br br Full view Books in the public domain are available for full view and can be downloaded for free In print books acquired through the Partner Program are also available for full view if the publisher has given permission although this is rare br Preview For in print books where permission has been granted the number of viewable pages is limited to a preview set by a variety of access restrictions and security measures some based on user tracking Usually the publisher can set the percentage of the book available for preview Users are restricted from copying downloading or printing book previews A watermark reading Copyrighted material appears at the bottom of pages All books acquired through the Partner Program are available for preview br Snippet view A snippet view two to three lines of text surrounding the queried search term is displayed in cases where Google does not have permission of the copyright owner to display a preview This could be because Google cannot identify the owner or the owner declined permission If a search term appears many times in a book Google displays no more than three snippets thus preventing the user from viewing too much of the book Also Google does not display any snippets for certain reference books such as dictionaries where the display of even snippets can harm the market for the work Google maintains that no permission is required under copyright law to display the snippet view br No preview Google also displays search results for books that have not been digitized As these books have not been scanned their text is not searchable and only the metadata such as the title author publisher number of pages ISBN subject and copyright information and in some cases a table of contents and book summary is available In effect this is similar to an online library card catalog br In response to criticism from groups such as the American Association of Publishers and the Authors Guild Google announced an opt out policy in August through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that they do not want scanned and the request would be respected The company also stated that it would not scan any in copyright books between August and November to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the Project Thus copyright owners have three choices with respect to any work br br It can participate in the Partner Program to make a book available for preview or full view in which case it would share revenue derived from the display of pages from the work in response to user queries br It can let Google scan the book under the Library Project and display snippets in response to user queries br It can opt out of the Library Project in which case Google will not scan the book If the book has already been scanned Google will reset its access level as No preview br Most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available br In addition to procuring books from libraries Google also obtains books from its publisher partners through the Partner Program designed to help publishers and authors promote their books Publishers and authors submit either a digital copy of their book in EPUB or PDF format or a print copy to Google which is made available on Google Books for preview The publisher can control the percentage of the book available for preview with the minimum being They can also choose to make the book fully viewable and even allow users to download a PDF copy Books can also be made available for sale on Google Play Unlike the Library Project this does not raise any copyright concerns as it is conducted pursuant to an agreement with the publisher The publisher can choose to withdraw from the agreement at any time br For many books Google Books displays the original page numbers However Tim Parks writing in The New York Review of Books in noted that Google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications likely the ones acquired through the Partner Program presumably in alliance with the publishers in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions br br br Scanning of books br The project began in under the codename Project Ocean Google co founder Larry Page had always had an interest in digitizing books When he and Marissa Mayer began experimenting with book scanning in it took minutes for them to digitize a page book But soon after the technology had been developed to the extent that scanning operators could scan up to pages an hour br Google established designated scanning centers to which books were transported by trucks The stations could digitize at the rate of pages per hour The books were placed in a custom built mechanical cradle that adjusted the book spine in place while an array of lights and optical instruments scanned the two open pages Each page would have two cameras directed at it capturing the image while a range finder LIDAR overlaid a three dimensional laser grid on the book s surface to capture the curvature of the paper A human operator would turn the pages by hand using a foot pedal to take the photographs With no need to flatten the pages or align them perfectly Google s system not only reached a remarkable efficiency and speed but also helped protect the fragile collections from being over handled Afterwards the crude images went through three levels of processing first de warping algorithms used the LIDAR data fix the pages curvature Then optical character recognition OCR software transformed the raw images into text and lastly another round of algorithms extracted page numbers footnotes illustrations and diagrams br Many of the books are scanned using a customized Elphel camera at a rate of pages per hour A patent awarded to Google in revealed that Google had come up with an innovative system for scanning books that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book By constructing a D model of each page and then de warping it Google is able to present flat looking pages without having to really make the pages flat which requires the use of destructive methods such as unbinding or glass plates to individually flatten each page which is inefficient for large scale scanning br Google decided to omit color information in favour of better spatial resolution as most out of copyright books at the time did not contain colors Each page image was passed through algorithms that distinguished the text and illustration regions Text regions were then processed via OCR to enable full text searching Google expended considerable resources in coming up with optimal compression techniques aiming for high image quality while keeping the file sizes minimal to enable access by internet users with low bandwidth br br br Website functionality br For each work Google Books automatically generates an overview page This page displays information extracted from the book its publishing details a high frequency word map the table of contents as well as secondary material such as summaries reader reviews not readable in the mobile version of the website and links to other relevant texts A visitor to the page for instance might see a list of books that share a similar genre and theme or they might see a list of current scholarship on the book This content moreover offers interactive possibilities for users signed into their Google account They can export the bibliographic data and citations in standard formats write their own reviews add it to their library to be tagged organized and shared with other people Thus Google Books collects these more interpretive elements from a range of sources including the users third party sites like Goodreads and often the book s author and publisher br In fact to encourage authors to upload their own books Google has added several functionalities to the website The authors can allow visitors to download their ebook for free or they can set their own purchase price They can change the price back and forth offering discounts whenever it suits them Also if a book s author chooses to add an ISBN LCCN or OCLC record number the service will update the book s url to include it Then the author can set a specific page as the link s anchor This option makes their book more easily discoverable br br br Ngram Viewer br br The Ngram Viewer is a service connected to Google Books that graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection The service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods This program has fallen under criticism because of errors in the metadata used in the program br br br Content issues and criticism br The project has received criticism that its stated aim of preserving orphaned and out of print works is at risk due to scanned data having errors and such problems not being solved br br br Scanning errors br br The scanning process is subject to errors For example some pages may be unreadable upside down or in the wrong order Scholars have even reported crumpled pages obscuring thumbs and fingers and smeared or blurry images On this issue a declaration from Google at the end of scanned books says br br The digitization at the most basic level is based on page images of the physical books To make this book available as an ePub formatted file we have taken those page images and extracted the text using Optical Character Recognition or OCR for short technology The extraction of text from page images is a difficult engineering task Smudges on the physical books pages fancy fonts old fonts torn pages etc can all lead to errors in the extracted text Imperfect OCR is only the first challenge in the ultimate goal of moving from collections of page images to extracted text based books Our computer algorithms also have to automatically determine the structure of the book what are the headers and footers where images are placed whether text is verse or prose and so forth br Getting this right allows us to render the book in a way that follows the format of the original book Despite our best efforts you may see spelling mistakes garbage characters extraneous images or missing pages in this book Based on our estimates these errors should not prevent you from enjoying the content of the book The technical challenges of automatically constructing a perfect book are daunting but we continue to make enhancements to our OCR and book structure extraction technologies br In Google stated that they would start using reCAPTCHA to help fix the errors found in Google Book scans This method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words br Scanning errors have inspired works of art such as published collections of anomalous pages and a Tumblr blog br br br Errors in metadata br Scholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on Google Books including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication Geoffrey Nunberg a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before and containing the word internet turned up an unlikely results Woody Allen is mentioned in books ostensibly published before he was born Google responded to Nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on outside contractors br Other metadata errors reported include publication dates before the author s birth e g works by Charles Dickens prior to his birth in incorrect subject classifications an edition of Moby Dick found under computers a biography of Mae West classified under religion conflicting classifications editions of Whitman s Leaves of Grass all classified as both fiction and nonfiction incorrectly spelled titles authors and publishers Moby Dick or the White Wall and metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book the metadata for an mathematical work leads to a romance novel br br A review of the author title publisher and publication year metadata elements for randomly selected Google Books records was undertaken The results show of sampled books in the digitization project contained metadata errors This error rate is higher than one would expect to find in a typical library online catalog br The overall error rate of found in this study suggests that Google Books metadata has a high rate of error While major and minor errors are a subjective distinction based on the somewhat indeterminate concept of findability the errors found in the four metadata elements examined in this study should all be considered major br Metadata errors based on incorrect scanned dates makes research using the Google Books Project database difficult Google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors br br br Language issues br Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google s effort on linguistic imperialism grounds They argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world German Russian French and Spanish for instance are popular languages in scholarship The disproportionate online emphasis on English however could shape access to historical scholarship and ultimately the growth and direction of future scholarship Among these critics is Jean No l Jeanneney the former president of the Biblioth que nationale de France br br br Google Books versus Google Scholar br While Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues This has led the makers of Google Scholar to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles in agreement with their publishers br br br Library partners br The Google Books Library Project is aimed at scanning and making searchable the collections of several major research libraries Along with bibliographic information snippets of text from a book are often viewable If a book is out of copyright and in the public domain the book is fully available to read or download br In copyright books scanned through the Library Project are made available on Google Books for snippet view Regarding the quality of scans Google acknowledges that they are not always of sufficiently high quality to be offered for sale on Google Play Also because of supposed technical constraints Google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers br The project is the subject of the Authors Guild v Google lawsuit filed in and ruled in favor of Google in and again on appeal in br Copyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view by transferring it to their Partner Program account or request Google to prevent the book text from being searched br The number of institutions participating in the Library Project has grown since its inception br br br Initial partners br br Harvard University Harvard University Library br The Harvard University Library and Google conducted a pilot throughout The project continued with the aim of increasing online access to the holdings of the Harvard University Library which includes more than million volumes While physical access to Harvard s library materials is generally restricted to current Harvard students faculty and researchers or to scholars who can come to Cambridge the Harvard Google Project has been designed to enable both members of the Harvard community and users everywhere to discover works in the Harvard collection br University of Michigan University of Michigan Library br As of March million volumes were scanned br New York Public Library br In this pilot program NYPL is working with Google to offer a collection of its public domain books which will be scanned in their entirety and made available for free to the public online Users will be able to search and browse the full text of these works When the scanning process is complete the books may be accessed from both The New York Public Library s website and from the Google search engine br University of Oxford Bodleian Library br Stanford University Stanford University Libraries SULAIR br br br Additional partners br Other institutional partners have joined the project since the partnership was first announced br br Austrian National Library br Bavarian State

partnership was for digitizing texts including manuscripts written in palm leaves dating back to th century br University of Texas at Austin University of Texas Libraries br The partnership was for digitizing the library s Latin American collection about half a million volumes br University of Virginia University of Virginia Library br University of Wisconsin Madison University of Wisconsin Libraries br As of March about volumes had been scanned br br br History br A group of team members at Google officially launch the secret books project Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page came up with the idea that later became Google Books while still graduate students at Stanford in The history page on the Google Books website describes their initial vision for this project in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized people would use a web crawler to index the books content and analyze the connections between them determining any given book s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books This team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the Library of Congress s American Memory Project Project Gutenberg and the Universal Library to find out how they work as well as the University of Michigan Page s alma mater and the base for such digitization projects as JSTOR and Making of America In a conversation with the at that time University President Mary Sue Coleman when Page found out that the university s current estimate for scanning all the library s volumes was years Page reportedly told Coleman that he believes Google can help make it happen in six br The team works to develop a high speed scanning process as well as software for resolving issues in odd type sizes unusual fonts and other unexpected peculiarities br December Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project Google announced partnerships with several high profile university and public libraries including the University of Michigan Harvard Harvard University Library Stanford Green Library Oxford Bodleian Library and the New York Public Library According to press releases and university librarians Google planned to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately million volumes within a decade The announcement soon triggered controversy as publisher and author associations challenged Google s plans to digitize not just books in the public domain but also titles still under copyright br September October Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected copyrights and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers One is a class action suit on behalf of authors Authors Guild v Google September and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the Association of American Publishers McGraw Hill v Google October br November Google changed the name of this service from Google Print to Google Book Search Its program enabling publishers and authors to include their books in the service was renamed Google Books Partner Program and the partnership with libraries became Google Books Library Project br Google added a download a pdf button to all its out of copyright public domain books It also added a new browsing interface along with new About this Book pages br August The University of California System announced that it would join the Books digitization project This includes a portion of the million volumes within the approximately libraries managed by the System br September The Complutense University of Madrid became the first Spanish language library to join the Google Books Library Project br October The University of Wisconsin Madison announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project along with the Wisconsin Historical Society Library Combined the libraries have million holdings br November The University of Virginia joined the project Its libraries contain more than five million volumes and more than million manuscripts rare books and archives br January The University of Texas at Austin announced that it would join the Book Search digitization project At least one million volumes would be digitized from the university s library locations br March The Bavarian State Library announced a partnership with Google to scan more than a million public domain and out of print works in German as well as English French Italian Latin and Spanish br May A book digitizing project partnership was announced jointly by Google and the Cantonal and University Library of Lausanne br May The Boekentoren Library of Ghent University announced that it would participate with Google in digitizing and making digitized versions of th century books in the French and Dutch languages available online br May Mysore University announces Google will digitize over books and manuscripts including around manuscripts written in Sanskrit or Kannada on both paper and palm leaves br June The Committee on Institutional Cooperation rebranded as the Big Ten Academic Alliance in announced that its twelve member libraries would participate in scanning million books over the course of the next six years br July Keio University became Google s first library partner in Japan with the announcement that they would digitize at least public domain books br August Google announced that it would digitize up to both copyrighted and public domain items from Cornell University Library Google would also provide a digital copy of all works scanned to be incorporated into the university s own library system br September Google added a feature that allows users to share snippets of books that are in the public domain The snippets may appear exactly as they do in the scan of the book or as plain text br September Google debuted a new feature called My Library which allows users to create personal customized libraries selections of books that they can label review rate or full text search br December Columbia University was added as a partner in digitizing public domain works br May Microsoft tapered off and planned to end its scanning project which had reached books and million journal articles br October A settlement was reached between the publishing industry and Google after two years of negotiation Google agreed to compensate authors and publishers in exchange for the right to make millions of books available to the public br October The HathiTrust Shared Digital Repository later known as the HathiTrust Digital Library is launched jointly by the Committee on Institutional Cooperation and the university libraries in the University of California system all of which were Google partner libraries in order to archive and provide academic access to books from their collections scanned by Google and others br November Google reached the million book mark for items scanned by Google and by their publishing partners million were in full preview mode and million were fully viewable and downloadable public domain works About five million were out of print br December Google announced the inclusion of magazines in Google Books Titles include New York Magazine Ebony and Popular Mechanics br February Google launched a mobile version of Google Book Search allowing iPhone and Android phone users to read over million public domain works in the US and over outside the US using a mobile browser Instead of page images the plain text of the book is displayed br May At the annual BookExpo convention in New York Google signaled its intent to introduce a program that would enable publishers to sell digital versions of their newest books direct to consumers through Google br December A French court shut down the scanning of copyrighted books published in France saying this violated copyright laws It was the first major legal loss for the scanning project br April Visual artists were not included in the previous lawsuit and settlement are the plaintiff groups in another lawsuit and say they intend to bring more than just Google Books under scrutiny The new class action read the statement goes beyond Google s Library Project and includes Google s other systematic and pervasive infringements of the rights of photographers illustrators and other visual artists br May It was reported that Google would launch a digital book store called Google Editions It would compete with Amazon Barnes Noble Apple and other electronic book retailers with its own e book store Unlike others Google Editions would be completely online and would not require a specific device such as kindle Nook or iPad br June Google passed million books scanned br August It was announced that Google intends to scan all known existing books within a decade amounting to over billion digital pages and trillion words in total br December Google eBooks Google Editions was launched in the US br December Google launched the Ngram Viewer which collects and graphs data on word usage across its book collection br March A federal judge rejected the settlement reached between the publishing industry and Google br March Google passed million books scanned br March Google reached a settlement with publishers br January The documentary Google and the World Brain was shown at the Sundance Film Festival br November Ruling in Authors Guild v Google US District Judge Denny Chin sides with Google citing fair use The authors said they would appeal br October The appeals court sided with Google declaring that Google did not violate copyright law According to the New York Times Google has scanned more than million books br April The US Supreme Court declined to hear the Authors Guild s appeal which means the lower court s decision stood and Google would be allowed to scan library books and display snippets in search results without violating the law br br br Status br Google has been quite secretive regarding its plans on the future of the Google Books project Scanning operations had been slowing down since at least as confirmed by the librarians at several of Google s partner institutions At University of Wisconsin the speed had reduced to less than half of what it was in However the librarians have said that the dwindling pace could be a natural result of maturation of the project initially stacks of books were entirely taken up for scanning whereas now only the titles that had not already been scanned needed to be considered The company s own Google Books timeline page did not mention anything after even in and the Google Books blog was merged into the Google Search blog in br Despite winning the decade long litigation in The Atlantic has said that Google has all but shut down its scanning operation In April Wired reported that there were only a few Google employees working on the project and new books were still being scanned but at a significantly lower rate It commented that the decade long legal battle had caused Google to lose its ambition br br br Legal issues br br Through the project library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status which led to a number of lawsuits against Google By the end of Google had reportedly digitized over seven million books of which only about one million were works in the public domain Of the rest one million were in copyright and in print and five million were in copyright but out of print In a group of authors and publishers brought a major class action lawsuit against Google for infringement on the copyrighted works Google argued that it was preserving orphaned works books still under copyright but whose copyright holders could not be located br The Authors Guild and Association of American Publishers separately sued Google in for its book project citing massive copyright infringement Google countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed The lawsuits were consolidated and eventually a settlement was proposed The settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds including antitrust privacy and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers The settlement was eventually rejected and the publishers settled with Google soon after The Authors Guild continued its case and in their proposed class was certified Google appealed that decision with a number of amici asserting the inadequacy of the class and the Second Circuit rejected the class certification in July remanding the case to the District Court for consideration of Google s fair use defense br In Authors Guild filed another appeal against Google to be considered by the nd U S Circuit Court of Appeals in New York Google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets and they are not allowing people to illegally read the book In a report courts stated that they did not infringe on copyright laws as they were protected under the fair use clause br Authors Guild tried again in to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the Supreme Court The case was rejected leaving the Second Circuit s decision on the case intact meaning that Google did not violate copyright laws This case also set a precedent for other similar cases in regards to fair use laws as it further clarified the law and expanded it Such clarification affects other scanning projects similar to Google br Other lawsuits followed the Authors Guild s lead In a German lawsuit previously filed was withdrawn In June Herv de la Martini re a French publisher known as La Martini re and ditions du Seuil announced its intention to sue Google France In the Paris Civil Court awarded EUR approximately USD in damages and interest and ordered Google to pay EUR a day until it removes the publisher s books from its database The court wrote Google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible books that Seuil owns without its permission and that Google committed acts of breach of copyright which are of harm to the publishers Google said it will appeal Syndicat National de l Edition which joined the lawsuit said Google has scanned about French works under copyright br In December Chinese author Mian Mian filed a civil lawsuit for against Google for scanning her novel Acid Lovers This is the first such lawsuit to be filed against Google in China Also in November that year the China Written Works Copyright Society CWWCS accused Google of scanning books by Chinese writers without authorization Google agreed on Nov to provide a list of Chinese books it had scanned but the company refused to admit having infringed copyright laws br In March Thomas Rubin associate general counsel for copyright trademark and trade secrets at Microsoft accused Google of violating copyright law with their book search service Rubin specifically criticized Google s policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop br Google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books Some published works that are in the public domain such as all works created by the U S Federal government are still treated like other works under copyright and therefore locked after br br br Similar projects br Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize and archive cultural works to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks It was founded in by Michael S Hart and is the oldest digital library As of October Project Gutenberg reached items in its collection br Internet Archive is a non profit which digitizes over books a day as well as mirrors books from Google Books and other sources As of May it hosted over million public domain books greater than the approximate million public domain books at Google Books Open Library a sister project of Internet Archive lends scanned and purchased commercial ebooks to the visitors of libraries br HathiTrust maintains HathiTrust Digital Library since October which preserves and provides access to material scanned by Google some of the Internet Archive books and some scanned locally by partner institutions As of May it includes about million volumes over million of which are public domain at least in the US br ACLS Humanities E Book an online collection of over books of high quality in the humanities and related social sciences accessible through institutional subscription br Microsoft funded the scanning of books to create Live Search Books in late It ran until May when the project was abandoned and the books were made freely available on the Internet Archive br The National Digital Library of India NDLI is a project under Ministry of Human Resource Development India The objective is to integrate several national and international digital libraries in one single web portal The NDLI provides free of cost access to many books in English and the Indian languages br Europeana links to roughly million digital objects as of including video photos paintings audio maps manuscripts printed books and newspapers from the past years of European history from over archives in the European Union br Gallica from the French National Library links to about digitized books newspapers manuscripts maps and drawings etc Created in
