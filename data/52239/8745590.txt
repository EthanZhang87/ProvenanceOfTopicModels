Literary forgery also known as literary mystification literary fraud or literary hoax is writing such as a manuscript or a literary work which is either deliberately misattributed to a historical or invented author or is a purported memoir or other presumably nonfictional writing deceptively presented as true when in fact it presents untrue or imaginary information or content br br br History br Literary forgery may involve the work of a famous author whose writings have an established intrinsic as well as monetary value In an attempt to gain the rewards of such a reputation the forger often engages in two distinct activities The forger produces a writing which resembles the style of the known reputable author to whom the fake is to be attributed The forger may also fake the physical alleged original manuscript This is less common as it requires a great deal of technical effort such as imitating the ink and paper The forger then claims that not only is the style of writing the same but also that the ink and paper are of the kind or type used by the famous author Other common types of literary forgery may draw upon the potential historical cachet and novelty of a previously undiscovered author br Literary forgery has a long history Onomacritus c BCE is among the most ancient known literary forgers He invented prophecies which he ascribed to the poet Musaeus br In the rd century CE a certain Septimius produced what appeared to be a Latin translation of an eyewitness account of the Trojan War by Dictys of Crete In the letter of dedication the translator gave additional credence to the document by claiming the Greek original had come to light during Nero s reign when Dictys tomb was opened by an earthquake and his diary was discovered Septimius then claimed the original had been handed to the governor of Crete Rutilius Rufus who gave the diary to Nero during his tour of Greece in CE According to historian Miriam Griffin such bogus and romantic claims to antiquity were not uncommon at the time br One of the longest lasting literary forgeries is by Pseudo Dionysius the Areopagite a th th century Syrian mystical writer who claimed to be a disciple of Paul the Apostle Five hundred years later Abelard expressed doubts about the authorship but it was not until after the Renaissance that there was general agreement that the attribution of the work was false In the intervening years the writings had much theological influence br Thomas Chatterton the English poet and letter writer began his brilliant medieval forgeries when little more than a child While they brought him praise and fame after his death his writing afforded little in the way of financial success and he committed suicide aged penniless alone and half starved br The English Mercurie appeared to be the first English newspaper when it was discovered in This was ostensibly an account of the English battle with the Spanish Armada of but was in fact written in the th century by Philip Yorke nd Earl of Hardwicke as a literary game with his friends br Literary forgery was promoted as a creative method by Charles Nodier and in the th century many writers produced literary forgeries under his influence notably Prosper Merimee and Pierre Louys br The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is an antisemitic forged document first published in Russia in The work purports to be details of a Jewish plan for world domination and describes how Judaism will overthrow Christianity via control of the media financial institutions subverting the social order and so on The document was exposed as a forgery by English journalist Philip Graves in Graves showed the work drew as a source an political satire by Maurice Joly The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu except presenting it as real Similar exposes were published in other languages but it did not matter the Protocols were immensely popular among anti semitic circles who took it as proof of the evilness of the Jews br The Hitler Diaries were an example of a th century forgery for money Konrad Kujau an East German forger created diaries purportedly written by Adolf Hitler His forgeries passed initial scrutiny enough for the magazine Stern to purchase them at great expense but various errors and closer forensic analysis revealed them as fakes Kujau was subsequently sent to prison for fraud theft and forgery br br br Related issues br br br Fake memoirs br br Some pieces authors are uncontested but the writers are untruthful about themselves to such a degree that the books are functionally forgeries rather than forging in the name of an expert or authority the authors falsely claim such authority for themselves This usually takes the form of autobiographical works as fake memoirs Its modern form is most common with misery lit books in which the author claims to have suffered illness parental abuse and or drug addiction during their upbringing yet recovered well enough to write of their struggles The book Go Ask Alice is officially anonymous but claims to be taken from the diary of an actual drug abuser later investigation showed that the work is almost certainly fictitious however A recent example is the book A Million Little Pieces by James Frey wherein Frey claimed to experience fighting drug addiction in rehab the claimed events were fictional yet not presented as such br Other forms considered literary hoaxes are when an author asserts an identity and history for themselves that is not accurate Asa Earl Carter wrote under the pseudonym Forrest Carter Forrest Carter claimed to be a half Cherokee descendent who grew up in native culture but the real Asa Earl Carter was a white man from Alabama Forrest Carter s persona thus possessed a similar false authenticity as a forged work would in both their memoir and their fiction Similarly Nasdijj and Margaret Seltzer also falsely claimed Native American descent to help market their works Danny Santiago claimed to be a young Latino growing up in East Los Angeles yet the author whose real name was Daniel Lewis James was a Midwesterner in his s br br br Transparent literary fiction br Occasionally it is unclear whether a work is fiction or a forgery This generally occurs when a work is written intended as a piece of fiction but through the mouthpiece of a famous historical character the audience at the time understands that the work is actually written by others imagining what the historical persona might have written or thought With later generations this distinction is lost and the work is treated as authoritatively by the real person Later yet the fact that the work was not really by the seeming author resurfaces In the case of true transparent literary fictions no deception is involved and the issue is merely one of misinterpretation However this is fairly rare br Examples of this may include several works of wisdom literature such as the book of Ecclesiastes and the Song of Solomon in the Hebrew Bible Both works do not directly name an author but are written from the perspective of King Solomon and feature poetry and philosophical thoughts from his perspective that can switch between first and third person perspectives The books may not have intended to be taken as actually from the hand of Solomon but this became tangled and many later generations did assume they were directly from Solomon s hand The fact that it is not clear if any deception was involved makes many scholars reluctant to call the work forgeries however even those that take the modern scholarly view that they were unlikely to have been written by Solomon due to the work only being quoted by others many centuries after Solomon s death br For more disputed examples some New Testament scholars believe that pseudepigrapha in the New Testament epistles can be explained as such transparent fictions Richard Bauckham for example writes that for the Second Epistle of Peter Petrine authorship was intended to be an entirely transparent fiction This view is contested Bart Ehrman writes that if a religiously prescriptive document was widely known to be not actually from the authority it claimed it would not be taken seriously Therefore the claim of authorship by Peter only makes sense if the intent was indeed to falsely claim the authority of a respected figure in such epistles br br br See also br Anthony Godby Johnson br B Wongar br Clifford Irving br Dave Pelzer br False document br Ghostwriter br Hitler Diaries br Journalistic scandal br
