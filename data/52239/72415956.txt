The Disinformation Project is a research group br studying the effects of disinformation in the context of the COVID pandemic in New Zealand br br br Background br The Disinformation Project is an independent interdisciplinary and non governmental New Zealand research team that has been collecting and analysing data on the causes and impact of mis and disinformation within the country s society from the early days of the COVID pandemic in through to and beyond the Wellington protest when the grounds of Parliament House and surrounding streets were occupied by anti vaccine and anti mandate groups It is led by social historian Kate Hannah br The project claims its research identifies how the digital world shaped by social media platforms globally has the potential to make elements of a society more vulnerable to disinformation and social exclusion Hannah has acknowledged the importance of showing empathy toward people who are hoodwinked into extremist beliefs br br br Methodology and positions br The Disinformation Project s research makes use of mixed methods combining open and quantitative data from social media platforms social and mainstream media and other forms of information sharing looking for patterns and meaning in super spreader events and qualitative research and discourse analysis to identify shifts over time br Key to the project s approach is to research and assess how scientific uncertainty due to the presentation and distribution of unreliable information within the context of an infodemic can manifest as narratives that link to conspiracy theories The project holds that while some people might have genuine reasons to be wary of the state and mainstream media they can be influenced by those holding conspiracy theories or extremist beliefs in social media spaces that appear to offer support but are often driven by groups with different agendas The position is therefore taken that those most marginalised by or disaffected within contemporary society are more likely to have lived experiences that might make them more susceptible to unreliable sources and untrustworthy stories br Exploring what Hannah has described as a shared information landscape underpins the research of the project into how New Zealand society understands and manages the infodemic that has come to the fore as a result of COVID The project s work emphasizes the impact of colonisation on the health and wellbeing of individuals and communities increasing their vulnerability to mis and disinformation br The researchers take the position that the lack of a shared narrative can shape how a country understands and builds its historical memory with the storming of the Capitol in the United States in January as an example of how contemporary myths such as conspiracy theories can cause different groups to interpret events in different ways As events such as these begin to influence the international information landscape the researchers contend that their work is to support New Zealand to develop values that are democratic inclusive and progressive to consolidate social cohesion built on trust and cooperation The potential of the Treaty of Waitangi to enable a partnership is cited as a necessary starting point for any discussion or development of a strategy which seeks to address and make redress for the impacts of online harm hateful and violent extremism and disinformation for New Zealand and it is from a position of the partnership that Te Tiriti provides that Aotearoa can make a global contribution to these pressing and immediate issues br Hannah warns against increasing censorship as a way to manage disinformation expressing the importance of people being self regulating talking to each other at an interpersonal community based level br In September political activist Julian Batchelor indicated he filed a defamation suit against Research Director Sanjana Hattotuwa for asserting that Batchelor was inciting racism against M ori people in an interview with TVNZ br br br Distrust in authority and disinformation br During the first six months of the project researchers observed disinformation fueled a growing distrust in government and health officials in New Zealand Disconnected from their local communities some people relied more often on online spaces where they might feel informed and respected but were also more exposed to disinformation and extremist views br Starting in August the group took a wider approach of studying mis and disinformation ecosystems in New Zealand focusing on dangerous speech hateful expression and criminal behaviour and how these aligned with global trends themes narratives and actors who influence online harms in Aotearoa p They observed a shift from vaccine hesitancy to vaccine resistance as well as the normalisation of online and offline harassment p br Reports published by the project in and observe an acceleration of the trend toward normalization of hate the criminal behaviour on a variety of social media platforms especially against minority groups notably M ori other ethnic minorities women and gender minorities LGBTQ people and those with disabilities Common far right disinformation about COVID and public health was becoming more popular opening the way for to influence public opinion on issues such as gun control M ori sovereignty land rights free speech abortion euthanasia and cannabis law reform p Hannah suggested that minimization of Covid has been like a Trojan horse it has become a really significant recruitment tool and then has created an ability to coalesce around a set of ideas that are against the state br br br Occupation of the New Zealand parliament grounds br br After the initial occupation in February the Disinformation Project monitored social media and identified a small group of people responsible for the spreading of the majority of false information during and after the event The researchers claimed that during the occupation a great number of New Zealanders were exposed through social media to a splintered reality and pushed toward racist and violent ideologies After a clash between police and protestors on March the data showed a strong increase of engagement with disinformation content with percent of Facebook interactions over misinformation and disinformation originating with twelve accounts br Hannah concluded that for a large number of New Zealanders their vision of key events was constructed from disinformation including extreme misogyny and racism anti M ori Islamophobic and antisemitic sentiment In May the project s Kayli Taylor expressed concerns based on data that the Parliament Protest had entrenched violent expression toxic masculinities and other hallmarks of dangerous speech as the norm within anti mandate and anti vaccine social media ecologies effectively undermining civic life political culture and inclusion pillars of social cohesion Journalist Toby Manhire in a comprehensive coverage of the project s research insisted super spreaders of misinformation and conspiracy theory outstripped mainstream outlets in reaching online audiences br The Project s work showed propagation of foreign propaganda using anti vaccine activist networks As Russian linked propaganda and disinformation was being reported at the occupation site Disinformation Project Research Fellow Sanjana Hattotuwa used monitoring of more than Telegram channels and dozens of Facebook YouTube Instagram and Twitter accounts to show that the Russian invasion of Ukraine was one of the two dominant topics in New Zealand anti vaccination forums and the discussion was pro Putin Anti government rhetoric from protest leaders was also strongly present br A two day event where project researchers and independent academics were scheduled to present information sessions on political disinformation in November was initially canceled when protestors were seen organizing online to disrupt it Hannah had already received death threats and believed she with other experts was on a list of people to be executed for supporting public health measures br br br Threat to local democracy br In August Disinformation Project researcher Sanjana Hattotuwa said peddlers of disinformation were organizing to hide their affiliations and stand for councils and school Boards of Trustees The number of candidates running for public office discouraged by the racism and other forms of harassment experienced by elected council members appeared to present an opportunity for fringe candidates who could hide their affiliations Hattotuwa worried that new foundations for disinformation had now been laid in New Zealand and would change how the country engaged with elections in the future br While only two candidates with connections to conspiracy theories or misinformation were elected in the Southern region of the country Hattotuwa warned that this new possible threat should not be underestimated br br br br br br See also br Christchurch Call to Action Summit br He Whenua Taurikura br br br External links br Official site of The
