A factoid is either an invented or assumed statement presented as a fact or a true but brief or trivial item of news or information br The term was coined in by American writer Norman Mailer to mean a piece of information that becomes accepted as a fact even though it is not actually true or an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print Since the term s invention in it has become used to describe a brief or trivial item of news or information br br br Usage br The term was coined by American writer Norman Mailer in his biography of Marilyn Monroe Mailer described factoids as facts which have no existence before appearing in a magazine or newspaper and formed the word by combining the word fact and the ending oid to mean similar but not the same The Washington Times described Mailer s new word as referring to something that looks like a fact could be a fact but in fact is not a fact br Accordingly factoids may give rise to or arise from common misconceptions and urban legends Several decades after the term was coined by Mailer it came to have several meanings some of which are quite distinct from each other In William Safire identified several contrasting senses of factoid br br factoid accusatory misinformation purporting to be factual or a phony statistic br factoid neutral seemingly though not necessarily factual br factoid the CNN version a little known bit of information trivial but interesting data br This new sense of a factoid as a trivial but interesting fact was popularized by the CNN Headline News TV channel which during the s and s often included such a fact under the heading factoid during newscasts BBC Radio presenter Steve Wright used factoids extensively on his show br br br Versus factlet br As a result of confusion over the meaning of factoid some English language style and usage guides discourage its use William Safire in his On Language column advocated the use of the word factlet instead of factoid to express a brief interesting fact as well as a little bit of arcana but did not explain how adopting this new term would alleviate the ongoing confusion over the existing contradictory common use meanings of factoid br Safire suggested that factlet be used to designate a small or trivial bit of information that is nonetheless true or accurate A report in The Guardian identified Safire as the writer who coined the term factlet although Safire s column suggested factlet was already in use at that time The Atlantic magazine agreed with Safire and recommended factlet to signify a small probably unimportant but interesting fact as factoid still connoted a spurious fact The term factlet has been used in publications such as Mother Jones the San Jose Mercury News and in the Reno Gazette Journal br br br See also br br br
