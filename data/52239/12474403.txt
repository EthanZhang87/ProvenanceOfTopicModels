id: 12474403
Climate change denial also global warming denial is a form of science denial characterized by rejecting refusing to acknowledge disputing or fighting the scientific consensus on climate change Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none Climate change denial includes unreasonable doubts about the extent to which climate change is caused by humans its effects on nature and human society and the potential of adaptation to global warming by human actions To a lesser extent climate change denial can also be implicit when people accept the science but fail to reconcile it with their belief or action Several studies have analyzed these positions as forms of denialism pseudoscience or propaganda br Many issues that are settled in the scientific community such as human responsibility for global warming remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay dismiss or deny them an ideological phenomenon academics and scientists call climate change denial Climate scientists especially in the United States have reported government and oil industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data with directives not to discuss the subject publicly The fossil fuels lobby has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming br Industrial political and ideological interests organize activity to undermine public trust in climate science Climate change denial has been associated with the fossil fuels lobby the Koch brothers industry advocates ultraconservative think tanks and ultraconservative alternative media often in the U S More than of papers that are skeptical of climate change originate from right wing think tanks Climate change denial is undermining efforts to act on or adapt to climate change and exerts a powerful influence on the politics of global warming br In the s oil companies published research that broadly concurred with the scientific community s view on global warming Since then for several decades oil companies have been organizing a widespread and systematic climate change denial campaign to seed public disinformation a strategy that has been compared to the tobacco industry s organized denial of the hazards of tobacco smoking Some of the campaigns are even carried out by the same people who previously spread the tobacco industry s denialist propaganda br br br Terminology br Climate change denial refers to denial dismissal or doubt of the scientific consensus on the rate and extent of global warming its significance or its connection to human behavior in whole or in part Climate denial is a form of science denial It can also take pseudoscientific forms The terms climate skeptics or contrarians are nowadays used with the same meaning as climate change deniers even though deniers usually prefer not to in order to sow confusion as to their intentions br The terminology is debated most of those actively rejecting the scientific consensus use the terms skeptic and climate change skepticism and only a few have expressed preference for being described as deniers But the word skepticism is incorrectly used as scientific skepticism is an intrinsic part of scientific methodology In fact all scientists adhere to scientific skepticism as part of the scientific process that demands continuing questioning Both options are problematic but climate change denial has become more widely used than skepticism br The term contrarian is more specific but less frequently used In academic literature and journalism the terms climate change denial and climate change deniers have well established usage as descriptive terms without any pejorative connotation br The terminology evolved and emerged in the s By the word skeptic was being used specifically for the minority who publicized views contrary to the scientific consensus This small group of scientists presented their views in public statements and the media rather than to the scientific community Journalist Ross Gelbspan said in that industry had engaged a small band of skeptics to confuse public opinion in a persistent and well funded campaign of denial His book The Heat is On may have been the first to concentrate specifically on the topic In it Gelbspan discusses a pervasive denial of global warming in a persistent campaign of denial and suppression involving undisclosed funding of these greenhouse skeptics with the climate skeptics confusing the public and influencing decision makers br In December an open letter from the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry called on the media to stop using the term skepticism when referring to climate change denial It contrasted scientific skepticism which is foundational to the scientific method with denial the a priori rejection of ideas without objective consideration and the behavior of those involved in political attempts to undermine climate science It said Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics By perpetrating this misnomer journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry br In The New York Times s public editor said that the Times was increasingly using denier when someone is challenging established science but assessing this on an individual basis with no fixed policy and would not use the term when someone was kind of wishy washy on the subject or in the middle The executive director of the Society of Environmental Journalists said that while there was reasonable skepticism about specific issues she felt that denier was the most accurate term when someone claims there is no such thing as global warming or agrees that it exists but denies that it has any cause we could understand or any impact that could be measured br A petition by climatetruth org asked signers to Tell the Associated Press Establish a rule in the AP Stylebook ruling out the use of skeptic to describe those who deny scientific facts In September the Associated Press announced an addition to AP Stylebook entry on global warming that advised to describe those who don t accept climate science or dispute the world is warming from human made forces use climate change doubters or those who reject mainstream climate science Avoid use of skeptics or deniers In May The Guardian also rejected use of the term climate skeptic in favor of climate science denier br In addition to explicit denial people have also shown implicit denial by accepting the scientific consensus but failing to translate their acceptance into action This type of denial is also called soft climate change denial br br br Categories and tactics br br In German climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf described how the media give the misleading impression that climate change is still disputed within the scientific community attributing this impression to climate change skeptics PR efforts He identified different positions that climate skeptics argue which he used as a taxonomy of climate change skepticism Later the model was also applied to denial br br Trend skeptics or deniers who claim that no significant warming is taking place Given that the warming is now evident even to laypeople the trend skeptics are a gradually vanishing breed They claim that the warming trend measured by weather stations is an artefact due to urbanisation around those stations urban heat island effect br Attribution skeptics or deniers who accept the global warming trend but claim there are natural causes for this not human made ones A few of them even deny that the rise in the atmospheric CO content is anthropogenic they claim that the atmospheric CO is released from the ocean by natural processes br Impact skeptics or deniers who think global warming is harmless or even beneficial for example the potential extension of agriculture into higher latitudes br Sometimes consensus denial is added for people who question the existence of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming br The National Center for Science Education describes climate change denial as disputing differing points in the scientific consensus a sequential range of arguments from denying the occurrence of climate change accepting that but denying any significant human contribution accepting these but denying scientific findings on how this would affect nature and human society to accepting all these but denying that humans can mitigate or reduce the problems James L Powell provides a more extended list as does climatologist Michael E Mann in six stages of denial a ladder model whereby deniers have over time conceded acceptance of points while retreating to a position that still rejects the mainstream consensus br br CO is not actually increasing br Even if it is the increase has no impact on the climate since there is no convincing evidence of warming br Even if there is warming it is due to natural causes br Even if the warming cannot be explained by natural causes the human impact is small and the impact of continued greenhouse gas emissions will be minor br Even if the current and future projected human effects on Earth s climate are not negligible the changes are generally going to be good for us br Whether or not the changes are going to be good for us humans are very adept at adapting to changes besides it s too late to do anything about it and or a technological fix is bound to come along when we really need it br br Climate change denial is a form of denialism Chris and Mark Hoofnagle have defined denialism in this context as the use of rhetorical devices to give the appearance of legitimate debate where there is none an approach that has the ultimate goal of rejecting a proposition on which a scientific consensus exists This process characteristically uses one or more of the following tactics br br Allegations that scientific consensus involves conspiring to fake data or suppress the truth a global warming conspiracy theory br Fake experts or individuals with views at odds with established knowledge at the same time marginalizing or denigrating published topic experts Like the manufactured doubt over smoking and health a few contrarian scientists oppose the climate consensus some of them the same people br Selectivity such as cherry picking atypical or even obsolete papers in the same way that the MMR vaccine controversy was based on one paper examples include discredited ideas of the medieval warm period br Unworkable demands of research claiming that any uncertainty invalidates the field or exaggerating uncertainty while rejecting probabilities and mathematical models br Logical fallacies br br br Discussing specific aspects of climate change science br br Some politicians and climate change denial groups say that because CO is only a trace gas in the atmosphere it cannot cause climate change But scientists have known for over a century that even this small proportion has a significant warming effect and doubling the proportion leads to a large temperature increase Some groups allege that water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas and is left out of many climate models But while water vapor is a greenhouse gas its very short atmospheric lifetime about days compared to that of CO hundreds of years means that CO is the primary driver of increasing temperatures water vapor acts as a feedback not a forcing mechanism br Climate denial groups may also argue that global warming stopped recently that a global warming hiatus is in effect or that global temperatures are actually decreasing leading to global cooling These arguments are based on short term fluctuations and ignore the long term pattern br Some groups and prominent deniers such as William Happer argue that there is a greenhouse gas saturation effect that significantly decreases the warming potential of further gases released into the atmosphere Such an effect does exist in some form as Happer s research demonstrates but is likely negligible with respect to net global warming br Climate change denial literature often features the suggestion that we should wait for better technologies before addressing climate change when they will be more affordable and effective br br br Playing up the potential non human causes br br Climate denial groups often point to natural variability such as sunspots and cosmic rays to explain the warming trend According to these groups there is natural variability that will abate over time and human influence has little to do with it But climate models already take these factors into account The scientific consensus is that they cannot explain the observed warming trend br br br Playing up flawed studies br In the Heartland Institute published an article titled Scientists Whose Research Contradicts Man Made Global Warming Scares by Dennis T Avery a food policy analyst at the Hudson Institute Avery s list was immediately called into question for misunderstanding and distorting the conclusions of many of the named studies and citing outdated flawed studies that had long been abandoned Many of the scientists on the list demanded their names be removed At least of them had no idea they were included as co authors and disagreed with the article s conclusions The Heartland Institute refused these requests saying that the scientists have no right legally or ethically to demand that their names be removed from a bibliography composed by researchers with whom they disagree br br br Disputing IPCC reports and processes br Deniers have generally attacked either the IPCC s processes scientist or the synthesis and executive summaries the full reports attract less attention br In climate change denier Frederick Seitz criticized the IPCC Second Assessment Report alleging corruption in the peer review process Scientists rejected his assertions the presidents of the American Meteorological Society and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research described his claims as part of a systematic effort by some individuals to undermine and discredit the scientific process br In the House of Lords Economics Committee wrote We have some concerns about the objectivity of the IPCC process with some of its emissions scenarios and summary documentation apparently influenced by political considerations It doubted the high emission scenarios and said that the IPCC had played down what the committee called some positive aspects of global warming The main statements of the House of Lords Economics Committee were rejected in the response made by the United Kingdom government br On December the U S Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works minority members released a report under the leadership of the Senate s most vocal global warming denier Jim Inhofe It says it summarizes scientific dissent from the IPCC Many of its statements about the numbers of people listed in the report whether they are actually scientists and whether they support the positions attributed to them have been disputed Inhofe also said that some parts of the IPCC process resembled a Soviet style trial in which the facts are predetermined and ideological purity trumps technical and scientific rigor br br br Creating doubts about scientific publishing processes br Some climate change deniers promote conspiracy theories alleging that the scientific consensus is illusory or that climatologists are acting out of their own financial interests by causing undue alarm about a changing climate Some climate change deniers claim that there is no scientific consensus on climate change that any evidence for a scientific consensus is faked or that the peer review process for climate science papers has become corrupted by scientists seeking to suppress dissent No evidence of such conspiracies has been presented In fact much of the data used in climate science is publicly available contradicting allegations that scientists are hiding data or stonewalling requests br Some climate change deniers assert that the scientific consensus on global warming is based on conspiracies to produce manipulated data or suppress dissent It is one of a number of tactics used in climate change denial to attempt to manufacture political and public controversy disputing this consensus These people typically allege that through worldwide acts of professional and criminal misconduct the science behind global warming and climate change has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons They promote harmful conspiracy theories alleging that scientists and institutions involved in global warming research are part of a global scientific conspiracy or engaged in a manipulative hoax br The Great Global Warming Swindle is a British polemical documentary film directed by Martin Durkin that denies the scientific consensus about the reality and causes of climate change justifying this by suggesting that climatology is influenced by funding and political factors The film strongly opposes the scientific consensus on climate change It argues that the consensus on climate change is the product of a multibillion dollar worldwide industry created by fanatically anti industrial environmentalists supported by scientists peddling scare stories to chase funding and propped up by complicit politicians and the media The programme s publicity materials claim that man made global warming is a lie and the biggest scam of modern times The film received strong criticism from many scientists and others Journalist George Monbiot called it the same old conspiracy theory that we ve been hearing from the denial industry for the past ten years br The climate deniers involved in the Climatic Research Unit email controversy Climategate in claimed that researchers faked the data in their research publications and suppressed their critics in order to receive more funding i e taxpayer money Eight committees investigated these allegations and published reports each finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct According to the Muir Russell report the scientists rigor and honesty as scientists are not in doubt the investigators did not find any evidence of behavior that might undermine the conclusions of the IPCC assessments but there had been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged at the end of the investigations br br br Being lukewarm or skeptical br In Clive Hamilton published the essay Climate change and the soothing message of luke warmism He defined luke warmists as those who appear to accept the body of climate science but interpret it in a way that is least threatening emphasising uncertainties playing down dangers and advocating a slow and cautious response They are politically conservative and anxious about the threat to the social structure posed by the implications of climate science Their pragmatic approach is therefore alluring to political leaders looking for a justification for policy minimalism He cited Ted Nordhaus and Michael Shellenberger of the Breakthrough Institute and also Roger A Pielke Jr Daniel Sarewitz Steve Rayner Mike Hulme and the pre eminent luke warmist Danish economist Bj rn Lomborg br Climate change skepticism while in some cases professing to do research on climate change has focused instead on influencing the opinion of the public legislators and the media in contrast to legitimate science br Pope Francis groups together four types of respondents rejecting climate change those who deny conceal gloss over or relativize the issue br br br Pushing for adaptation only br The conservative National Center for Policy Analysis whose Environmental Task Force contains a number of climate change deniers including Sherwood Idso and S Fred Singer has said The growing consensus on climate change policies is that adaptation will protect present and future generations from climate sensitive risks far more than efforts to restrict CO emissions br The adaptation only plan is also endorsed by oil companies like ExxonMobil According to a Ceres report ExxonMobil s plan appears to be to stay the course and try to adjust when changes occur The company s plan is one that involves adaptation as opposed to leadership br The George W Bush administration also voiced support for an adaptation only policy in In a stark shift for the Bush administration the United States has sent a climate report U S Climate Action Report to the United Nations detailing specific and far reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment In the report the administration also for the first time places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere The report does not propose any major shift in the administration s policy on greenhouse gases Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming This position apparently precipitated a similar shift in emphasis at the COP climate talks in New Delhi several months later The shift satisfies the Bush administration which has fought to avoid mandatory cuts in emissions for fear it would harm the economy We re welcoming a focus on more of a balance on adaptation versus mitigation said a senior American negotiator in New Delhi You don t have enough money to do everything br Some find this shift and attitude disingenuous and indicative of a bias against prevention i e reducing emissions consumption and toward prolonging the oil industry s profits at the environment s expense In an article addressing the supposed economic hazards of addressing climate change writer and environmental activist George Monbiot wrote Now that the dismissal of climate change is no longer fashionable the professional deniers are trying another means of stopping us from taking action It would be cheaper they say to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them br br br Delaying climate change mitigation measures br br Climate change deniers often debate whether action such as the restrictions on the use of fossil fuels to reduce carbon dioxide emissions should be taken now or in the near future They fear the economic ramifications of such restrictions For example in a speech a staff member of the Cato Institute a libertarian think tank argued that emission controls negative economic effects outweighed their environmental benefits Climate change deniers tend to argue that even if global warming is caused solely by the burning of fossil fuels restricting their use would damage the world economy than the increases in global temperature br Conversely the general consensus is that early action to reduce emissions would help avoid much greater economic costs later and reduce the risk of catastrophic irreversible change br Earlier climate change deniers online YouTube content focused on denying global warming or saying such warming is not caused by humans burning fossil fuel As such denials became untenable content shifted to asserting that climate solutions are unworkable that global warming is harmless or even beneficial and that the environmental movement is unreliable br A article in Science made the case that opposition to climate policy was beginning to take a rhetorical shift away from outright skepticism and called this neoskepticism Rather than denying the existence of global warming neoskeptics instead question the magnitude of the risks and assert that reducing them has more costs than benefits According to the authors the emergence of neoskepticism heightens the need for science to inform decision making under uncertainty and to improve communication and education br There is a range of possible mitigation policies Disagreement over the sufficiency viability or desirability of a given policy is not necessarily neoskepticism But neoskepticism is marked by failure to appreciate the increased risks associated with delayed action Gavin Schmidt has called neoskepticism a form of confirmation bias and the tendency to always take as gospel the lowest estimate of a plausible range Neoskeptics err on the side of the least disruptive projections and least active policies and as such neglect or misapprehend the full spectrum of risks associated with global warming br In political terms soft climate denial can stem from concerns about the economics and economic impacts of climate change particularly the concern that strong measures to combat global warming or mitigate its impacts will seriously inhibit economic growth br br br Promoting conspiracy theories br br Climate change denial is commonly rooted in a phenomenon known as conspiracy theory in which people misattribute events to a powerful group s secret plot or plan People with certain cognitive tendencies are also more drawn than others to conspiracy theories about climate change Conspiratorial beliefs are more predominantly found in narcissistic people and those who consistently look for meanings or patterns in their world including believers in paranormal activity Climate change conspiracy disbelief is also linked to lower levels of education and analytic thinking br Scientists are investigating which factors associated with conspiracy belief can be influenced and changed They have identified uncertainty feelings of powerlessness political cynicism magical thinking and errors in logical and probabilistic reasoning br In researchers found that belief in other conspiracy theories was associated with being more likely to endorse climate change denial Examples of science related conspiracy theories that some people believe include that aliens exist childhood vaccines are linked to autism Bigfoot is real the government adds fluoride to drinking water for sinister purposes and the moon landing was faked br Examples of alleged climate change conspiracies include br br Aiming at New World Order Senator James Inhofe a Republican from Oklahoma suggested in that supporters of the Kyoto Protocol such as Jacques Chirac are aiming at global governance In his speech Inhofe said So I wonder are the French going to be dictating U S policy William M Gray also claimed in that scientists support the scientific consensus on climate change because they were promoted by government leaders and environmentalists seeking world government He added that its purpose was to exercise political influence to try to introduce world government and to control people br To promote other types of energy sources Some have claimed that the threat of global warming is an attempt to promote nuclear power Another claim is that because many people have invested in renewable energy companies they stand to lose a lot of money if global warming is shown to be a myth According to this theory environmental groups therefore bribe climate scientists to doctor their data so that they are able to secure their financial investment in green energy br br br Psychology br br br Connections to other debates br br br Links with other environmental issues br Many of the climate change deniers have disagreed in whole or part with the scientific consensus regarding other issues particularly those relating to environmental risks such as ozone depletion DDT and passive smoking br In the s the Marshall Institute began campaigning against increased regulations on environmental issues such as acid rain ozone depletion second hand smoke and the dangers of DDT In each case their argument was that the science was too uncertain to justify any government intervention a strategy it borrowed from earlier efforts to downplay the health effects of tobacco in the s This campaign would continue for the next two decades br br br Links with nationalism and right wing groups br br In an increase in climate change denial was noted particularly among supporters of the far right br It has been suggested that climate change can conflict with a nationalistic view because it is unsolvable at the national level and requires collective action between nations or between local communities and that therefore populist nationalism tends to reject the science of climate change br The UK Independence Party s policy on climate change has been influenced by climate change denier Christopher Monckton and by its energy spokesman Roger Helmer who has said It is not clear that the rise in atmospheric CO is anthropogenic br Jerry Taylor of the Niskanen Center posits that climate change denial is an important component of Trumpian historical consciousness and plays a significant role in the architecture of Trumpism as a developing philosophical system br Though climate change denial was apparently waning circa some right wing nationalist organizations have adopted a theory of environmental populism advocating that natural resources be preserved for a nation s existing residents to the exclusion of immigrants Other such right wing organizations have contrived new green wings that falsely assert that refugees from poor nations cause environmental pollution and climate change and should therefore be excluded br A study published in PLOS Climate studied two forms of national identity defensive or national narcissism and secure national identification for their correlation to support for policies to mitigate climate change and transition to renewable energy The authors defined national narcissism as a belief that one s national group is exceptional and deserves external recognition underlain by unsatisfied psychological needs They defined secure national identification as reflect ing feelings of strong bonds and solidarity with one s ingroup members and sense of satisfaction in group membership The researchers concluded that secure national identification tends to support policies promoting renewable energy while national narcissism is inversely correlated with support for such policies except to the extent that such policies as well as greenwashing enhance the national image Right wing political orientation which may indicate susceptibility to climate conspiracy beliefs was also found to be negatively correlated with support for genuine climate mitigation policies br br br Conservative views br br One worldview that often leads to climate change denial is belief in free enterprise capitalism The freedom of the commons tragedy of the commons or the freedom to use natural resources as a public good as it is practiced in free enterprise capitalism destroys important ecosystems and their functions and so having a stake in this worldview does not correlate with climate change mitigation behavior Political worldview plays an important role in environmental policy and action Liberals tend to focus on environmental risks while conservatives focus on the benefits of economic development Because of this difference conflicting opinions on the acceptance of climate change arise br A study of climate change denial indicators in public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from to shows that conservative white men in the U S are significantly more likely to deny climate change than other Americans Conservative white men who report understanding climate change very well are even more likely to deny climate change br Another reason for the discrepancy in climate change denial between liberals and conservatives is that contemporary environmental discourse is based largely on moral concerns related to harm and care which are more deeply held by liberals than by conservatives if the discourse is instead framed using moral concerns related to purity that are more deeply held by conservatives the discrepancy is resolved br In the U S climate change denial largely correlates with political affiliation This is partially because Democrats focus more on tighter government regulations and taxation which are the basis for most environmental policy Political affiliation also affects how different people interpret the same facts More highly educated people are less likely to rely on their own interpretation and political ideology rather than on scientists opinions Therefore political worldviews override expert opinion on the interpretation of climate facts and evidence of anthropogenic climate change br Affiliation with a political group especially in the U S is an important personal and social identity for many Because of this many people hold the popular values of their political affiliation regardless of their personal beliefs so as not to be ostracized by the group br br br History br br U S fossil fuel companies have known about global warming since at least the s In a coal industry research organization Bituminous Coal Research Inc published its finding that if then prevailing trends of coal consumption continued the temperature of the earth s atmosphere will increase and vast changes in the climates of the earth will result Such changes in temperature will cause melting of the polar icecaps which in turn would result in the inundation of many coastal cities including New York and London In a discussion following this paper in the same publication a combustion engineer for Peabody Coal now Peabody Energy the world s largest coal supplier added that the coal industry was merely buying time before additional government air pollution regulations would be promulgated to clean the air Nevertheless the coal industry publicly advocated for decades thereafter the position that increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is beneficial for the planet br In response to increasing public awareness of the greenhouse effect in the s conservative reaction built up denying environmental concerns that could lead to government regulation In the first Secretary of Energy James Schlesinger suggested President Jimmy Carter take no action regarding a climate change memo citing uncertainty During the presidency of Ronald Reagan global warming became a political issue with immediate plans to cut spending on environmental research particularly climate related and stop funding for CO monitoring Congressman Al Gore was aware of the developing science he joined others in arranging congressional hearings from onward with testimony from scientists including Revelle Stephen Schneider and Wallace Smith Broecker br An Environmental Protection Agency EPA report in said global warming was not a theoretical problem but a threat whose effects will be felt within a few years with potentially catastrophic consequences The Reagan administration called the report alarmist and the dispute was widely covered Public attention turned to other issues then the finding of a polar ozone hole brought a swift international response To the public this was related to climate change and the possibility of effective action but news interest faded br Public attention was renewed amid summer droughts and heat waves when James Hansen testified to a Congressional hearing on June saying with high confidence that long term warming was underway with severe warming likely within the next years and warning of likely storms and floods There was increasing media attention the scientific community had reached a broad consensus that the climate was warming human activity was very likely the primary cause and there would be significant consequences if the trend was not curbed These facts encouraged discussion about new environmental regulations which the fossil fuel industry opposed br From onward industry funded organizations including the Global Climate Coalition and the George C Marshall Institute sought to spread doubt in a strategy already developed by the tobacco industry A small group of scientists opposed to the consensus on global warming became politically involved and with support from conservative political interests began publishing in books and the press rather than in scientific journals Historian Spencer Weart identifies this period as the point where skepticism about basic aspects of climate science was no longer justified and those spreading mistrust about these issues became deniers As the scientific community and new data increasingly refuted their arguments deniers turned to political arguments making personal attacks on scientists reputations and promoting ideas of global warming conspiracies br With the fall of communism the attention of U S conservative think tanks which had been organized in the s as an intellectual counter movement to socialism turned from the red scare to the green scare tactic which they saw as a threat to their aims of private property free trade market economies and global capitalism They used environmental skepticism to promote denial of environmental problems such as loss of biodiversity and climate change br The campaign to spread doubt continued into the s including an advertising campaign funded by coal industry advocates intended to reposition global warming as theory rather than fact There was also a proposal by the American Petroleum Institute to recruit scientists to convince politicians the media and the public that climate science was too uncertain to warrant environmental regulation br In journalists Ross Gelbspan noted that his fellow journalists accepted that global warming was occurring but were in stage two denial of the climate crisis unable to accept the feasibility of solutions to the problem His book Boiling Point published in detailed the fossil fuel industry s campaign to deny climate change and undermine public confidence in climate science br In Newsweek s August cover story The Truth About Denial Sharon Begley reported that the denial machine is running at full throttle and that this well coordinated well funded campaign by contrarian scientists free market think tanks and industry had created a paralyzing fog of doubt around climate change br br br Similarities with tobacco industry tactics br br In George Monbiot published an article about similarities between the methods of groups funded by Exxon and those of the tobacco giant Philip Morris including direct attacks on peer reviewed science and attempts to create public controversy and doubt br The approach to downplay climate change s significance was copied from tobacco lobbyists who attempted to prevent or delay the introduction of regulation in the face of scientific evidence linking tobacco to lung cancer They attempted to discredit the research by creating doubt manipulating debate discrediting the scientists involved disputing their findings and creating and maintaining an apparent controversy by promoting claims that contradicted scientific research Doubt shielded the tobacco industry from litigation and regulation for decades br For example in an EPA report linked secondhand smoke with lung cancer In response the tobacco industry engaged the APCO Worldwide public relations company which set out a strategy of astroturfing campaigns to cast doubt on the science by linking smoking anxieties with other issues including global warming in order to turn public opinion against calls for government intervention The campaign depicted public concerns as unfounded fears supposedly based only on junk science in contrast to their sound science and operated through front groups primarily the Advancement of Sound Science Center TASSC and its Junk Science website run by Steven Milloy A tobacco company memo read Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public It is also the means of establishing a controversy br During the s the tobacco campaign died away and TASSC began taking funding from oil companies including Exxon Its website became central in distributing almost every kind of climate change denial that has found its way into the popular press Monbiot wrote that TASSC has done more damage to the campaign to halt climate change than any other body by trying to manufacture the appearance of a grassroots movement against unfounded fear and over regulation br br br Republican Party in the United States br br The Republican Party in the United States is unique in denying anthropogenic climate change among conservative political parties in the Western world In according to a leaked memo the Republican strategist Frank Luntz advised members of the Republican Party with regard to climate change that you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue and challenge the science by recruiting experts who are sympathetic to your view In Luntz said he still believes back in the science was uncertain but now agreed with the scientific consensus From to the Republican Party went from debating how to combat human caused climate change to arguing that it does not exist In more than half of the Republicans in the House and three quarters of Republican senators said that the threat of global warming as a human made and highly threatening phenomenon is at best an exaggeration and at worst an utter hoax br In more than of congressional Republicans were reported to be climate change deniers According to PolitiFact in May Jerry Brown s statement that virtually no Republican in Washington accepts climate change science was mostly true PolitiFact counted eight out of or about percent of Republican members of Congress who accept the prevailing scientific conclusion that global warming is both real and man made br In The New York Times reported that Philip Cooney a former fossil fuel lobbyist and climate team leader at the American Petroleum Institute and President George W Bush s chief of staff of the Council on Environmental Quality had repeatedly edited government climate reports in ways that play down links between such emissions and global warming according to internal documents Sharon Begley reported in Newsweek that Cooney edited a report on climate science by sprinkling it with phrases such as lack of understanding and considerable uncertainty Cooney reportedly removed an entire section on climate in one report whereupon another lobbyist sent him a fax saying You are doing a great job br br In the U S election cycle every Republican presidential candidate and the Republican leader in the U S Senate questioned or denied climate change and opposed U S government steps to address it br In Aaron McCright argued that anti environmentalism and climate change denial specifically had expanded in the U S to become a central tenet of the current conservative and Republican identity br In a interview United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry acknowledged the existence of climate change and impact from humans but said that he did not agree that carbon dioxide was its primary driver pointing instead to the ocean waters and this environment that we live in The American Meteorological Society responded in a letter to Perry that it is critically important that you understand that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary cause pointing to conclusions of scientists worldwide br Climate denial has started to decrease among the Republican Party leadership toward acknowledgment that the climate is changing a study by several major think tanks called the climate right fragmented and underfunded br Florida Republican Tom Lee described people s emotional impact and reactions to climate change saying I mean you have to be the Grim Reaper of reality in a world that isn t real fond of the Grim Reaper That s why I use the term emotionally shut down because I think I think you lose people at hello a lot times in the Republican conversation over this br When a moderator at the August Republican presidential debate asked the candidates to raise their hands if they believed human behavior is causing climate change none did Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy said the climate change agenda is a hoax and that more people are dying of climate change policies than they actually are of climate change none of his competitors challenged him directly on climate After investigating Ramaswamy s latter claim a Washington Post fact check found no supporting evidence br br br Denial networks br br br Conservative and libertarian think tanks br A article explored the connection between conservative think tanks and climate change denial Research found that specific groups were marshaling skepticism against climate change a University of Central Florida study found that of environmentally skeptical literature published in the U S was partly or wholly affiliated with self proclaimed conservative think tanks br In the Center for Media and Democracy reported that the State Policy Network SPN an umbrella group of U S think tanks had been lobbying on behalf of major corporations and conservative donors to oppose climate change regulation br Conservative and libertarian think tanks in the U S such as The Heritage Foundation Marshall Institute Cato Institute and the American Enterprise Institute were significant participants in lobbying attempts seeking to halt or eliminate environmental regulations br Between and the combined annual income of climate change counter movement organizations think tanks advocacy groups and industry associations was roughly million During the same period billionaires secretively donated nearly million million via the Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund to more than organizations seeking to undermine the public perception of the science on climate change br br br Publishers websites and networks br In November a study by the Center for Countering Digital Hate identified ten fringe publishers that together were responsible for nearly percent of Facebook user interactions with content that denied climate change Facebook said the percentage was overstated and called the study misleading br The toxic ten publishers Breitbart News The Western Journal Newsmax Townhall Media Research Center The Washington Times The Federalist The Daily Wire RT TV network and The Patriot Post br The Rebel Media and its director Ezra Levant have promoted climate change denial and oil sands extraction in Alberta br Willard Anthony Watts is an American blogger who runs Watts Up With That a climate change denial blog br A piece of research from identified people with overlapping network ties to organizations that were responsible for most efforts to downplay the threat of climate change in the U S br br br Publications for school children br According to documents leaked in February The Heartland Institute is developing a curriculum for use in schools that frames climate change as a scientific controversy In deputy director of the National Center for Science Education NCSE Glenn Branch wrote the Heartland Institute is continuing to inflict its climate change denial literature on science teachers across the country Each significant claim was rated for accuracy by scientists who were experts on that topic It was found that the Key Findings section are incorrect misleading based on flawed logic or simply factually inaccurate The NCSE has prepared Classroom Resources in response to Heartland and other anti science threats br In Republican politician and Baptist minister Mike Huckabee published Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change which acknowledges global warming but minimizes the influence of human emissions Marketed as an alternative to mainstream education the publication does not attribute authorship or cite scientific credentials The NCSE s deputy director called the publication propaganda and very unreliable as a guide to climate change for kids saying it represented present day atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide as parts per million ppm which was true in BC but short of s actual concentration of ppm br In the state of Florida approved a public school curriculum including videos produced by conservative advocacy group PragerU that liken climate change skeptics to those who fought Communism and Nazism imply renewable energy harms the environment and say current global warming occurs naturally br Texas which has a large influence on school textbooks published nationwide proposed textbooks in that included more information about the climate crisis than editions a decade earlier But some books clouded the human causes of climate change and downplayed the role of fossil fuels with Texas U S Representative August Pfluger emphasizing the importance of secure reliable energy oil and natural gas produced in the Permian Basin In September Pfluger s Congressional website said we cannot allow the radical climate lobby to infiltrate Texas middle schools and brainwash our children claiming that liquefied natural gas is not only good for our economy but it s good for the environment br br br Notable people who deny climate change br br br Politicians br br Acknowledgment of climate change by politicians while expressing uncertainty as to how much of it is due to human activity has been described as a new form of climate denial and a reliable tool to manipulate public perception of climate change and stall political action br Former U S Senator Tom Coburn in discussed the Paris agreement and denied the scientific consensus on human caused global warming Coburn claimed that sea level rise had been no more than mm in years and asserted there was now global cooling In he said I am a global warming denier I don t deny that br In Donald Trump who later became president of the United States from to said With the coldest winter ever recorded with snow setting record levels up and down the coast the Nobel committee should take the Nobel Prize back from Al Gore Gore wants us to clean up our factories and plants in order to protect us from global warming when China and other countries couldn t care less It would make us totally noncompetitive in the manufacturing world and China Japan and India are laughing at America s stupidity In Trump tweeted The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U S manufacturing non competitive br Republican Jim Bridenstine the first elected politician to serve as NASA administrator had previously said that global temperatures were not rising But a month after the Senate confirmed his NASA position in April he acknowledged that human emissions of greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures br During a May meeting of the United States House Committee on Science Space and Technology Representative Mo Brooks claimed that sea level rise is caused not by melting glaciers but rather by coastal erosion and silt that flows from rivers into the ocean br In Ernesto Ara jo the minister of foreign affairs appointed by Brazil s newly elected president Jair Bolsonaro called global warming a plot by cultural Marxists and eliminated the ministry s climate change division br br An April tweet by Republican U S Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene said climate change was a scam that fossil fuels are natural and amazing and that there are some very powerful people that are getting rich beyond their wildest dreams convincing many that carbon is the enemy Her tweet included a chart that omitted carbon dioxide and methane the two most dominant greenhouse gas emissions br br br Scientists br American and New Zealand climate scientist Kevin Trenberth has published widely on climate change science and fought back against climate change misinformation for decades He describes in his memoirs his close encounters with deniers and skeptics with fellow meteorologists or climate change scientists These included Richard Lindzen he is quite beguiling but is criticized as intellectually dishonest by his peers Lindzen was a professor of meteorology at MIT and has been called a contrarian in relation to climate change and other issues Roy Spencer who has repeatedly made errors that always resulted in lower temperature trends than were really present John Christy his decisions on climate work and statements appear to be heavily colored by his religion Roger Pielke Jr Christopher Landsea Pat Michaels long associated with the Cato Institute he changed his bombastic tune gradually over time as climate change became more evident br Sherwood B Idso is a natural scientist and is the president of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change which rejects the scientific consensus on climate change In he published his book Carbon Dioxide Friend or Foe which said increases in CO would not warm the planet but would fertilize crops and were something to be encouraged and not suppressed br William M Gray was a climate scientist emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University who supported climate change denial he agreed that global warming was taking place but argued that humans were responsible for only a tiny portion of it and it was largely part of the Earth s natural cycle br In Frederick Seitz an American physicist and former National Academy of Sciences president wrote the Oregon Petition a controversial document in opposition to the Kyoto Protocol The petition and accompanying Research Review of Global Warming Evidence claimed that We are living in an increasingly lush environment of plants and animals as a result of the carbon dioxide increase This is a wonderful and unexpected gift from the Industrial Revolution In their book Merchants of Doubt the authors write that Seitz and a group of other scientists fought the scientific evidence and spread confusion on many of the most important issues of our time like the harmfulness of tobacco smoke acid rains CFCs pesticides and global warming br br br Lobbying and related activities br br Efforts to lobby against environmental regulation have included campaigns to manufacture doubt about the science behind climate change and to obscure the scientific consensus and data These have undermined public confidence in climate science br As of the climate change denial industry is most powerful in the U S Efforts by climate change denial groups played a significant role in the United States rejection of the Kyoto Protocol in br br br Fossil fuel companies and other private sector actors br Research conducted at an Exxon archival collection at the University of Texas and interviews with former Exxon employees indicate that the company s scientific opinion and its public posture toward climate change were contradictory A systematic review of Exxon s climate modeling projections concluded that in private and academic circles since the late s and early s ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a carbon dioxide induced super interglacial and reasonably estimated how much CO would lead to dangerous warming br Between and the Global Climate Coalition a group of mainly U S businesses used aggressive lobbying and public relations tactics to oppose action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fight the Kyoto Protocol Large corporations and trade groups from the oil coal and auto industries financed the coalition The New York Times reported even as the coalition worked to sway opinion toward skepticism its own scientific and technical experts were advising that the science backing the role of greenhouse gases in global warming could not be refuted In the Ford Motor Company was the first company to leave the coalition as a result of pressure from environmentalists Daimler Chrysler Texaco the Southern Company and General Motors subsequently left the GCC It closed in br From January through June the oil coal and utility industries spent million in lobby expenditures in opposition to legislation to address climate change br A study in traced the history of an influential group of economic consultants hired by the petroleum industry from the s to the s to estimate the costs of various proposed climate policies The economists used models that inflated predicted costs while ignoring policy benefits and their results were often portrayed to the public as independent rather than industry sponsored Their work played a key role in undermining numerous major climate policy initiatives in the US over a span of decades This study illustrates how the fossil fuel industry has funded biased economic analyses to oppose climate policy br br br ExxonMobil br br br Attacks and threats towards scientists br Climate change deniers attacked the work of climate scientist Michael E Mann for years On February Mann won a million judgment for punitive damages in a defamation lawsuit filed in against bloggers who attacked his hockey stick graph of the Northern Hemisphere temperature rise One of the bloggers had called Mann s work fraudulent contrary to numerous investigations that had already cleared Mann of any misconduct and supported the validity of his research br After Elon Musk s takeover of Twitter now X key figures at the company who ensured trusted content was prioritized were removed and climate scientists received a large increase in hostile threatening harassing and personally abusive tweets from deniers br In increases in climate change denial were reported particularly on the far right Climate change deniers threatened meteorologists accusing them of causing a drought falsifying thermometer readings and cherry picking warmer weather stations to misrepresent global warming Also in CNN reported that meteorologists and climate communicators worldwide were receiving increased harassment and false accusations that they were lying about or controlling the weather inflating temperature records to make climate change seem worse and changing color palettes of weather maps to make them look more dramatic The German television news service Tagesschau called this a global phenomenon br br br Funding for deniers br Journalists reported in that oil companies had known since the s that burning oil and gas could cause climate change but nonetheless funded deniers for years br Several large fossil fuel corporations provide significant funding for attempts to mislead the public about climate science s trustworthiness ExxonMobil and the Koch family foundations have been identified as especially influential funders of climate change contrarianism The bankruptcy of the coal company Cloud Peak Energy revealed it funded the Institute for Energy Research a climate denial think tank as well as several other policy influencers br After the IPCC released its Fourth Assessment Report in the American Enterprise Institute AEI offered British American and other scientists plus travel expenses to publish articles critical of the assessment The institute had received more than million from Exxon and its vice chairman of trustees was former Exxon head Lee Raymond Raymond sent letters that alleged the IPCC report was not supported by the analytical work More than AEI employees worked as consultants to the George W Bush administration br The authors of the book Merchants of Doubt provide documentation for the assertion that professional deniers have tried to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political action to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions That only half of the American population believes global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these deniers One of the authors main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have opposed the near universal consensus are funded by industries such as automotive and oil that stand to lose money by government actions to regulate greenhouse gases br The Global Climate Coalition was an industry coalition that funded several scientists who expressed skepticism about global warming In several members left the coalition when they became the target of a national divestiture campaign run by John Passacantando and Phil Radford at Ozone Action When Ford Motor Company left the coalition it was regarded as the latest sign of divisions within heavy industry over how to respond to global warming After that between December and early March the GCC was deserted by Daimler Chrysler Texaco energy firm the Southern Company and General Motors The Global Climate Coalition closed in br In early several media reports emerged saying that Willie Soon a popular scientist among climate change deniers had failed to disclose conflicts of interest in at least scientific papers published since They reported that he received a total of million from ExxonMobil Southern Company the American Petroleum Institute and a foundation run by the Koch brothers Documents obtained by Greenpeace under the Freedom of Information Act show that the Charles G Koch Foundation gave Soon two grants totaling in and again in Grants to Soon between and from the American Petroleum Institute totaled and between and from ExxonMobil totaled The Mobil Foundation the Texaco Foundation and the Electric Power Research Institute also funded Soon Acknowledging that he received this money Soon said that he had never been motivated by financial reward in any of my scientific research In Greenpeace disclosed papers documenting that Soon failed to disclose to academic journals funding including more than million from fossil fuel industry related interests including ExxonMobil the American Petroleum Institute the Charles G Koch Charitable Foundation and the Southern Company br Science editor in chief Donald Kennedy has said that deniers such as Michaels are lobbyists more than researchers and I don t think it s unethical any more than most lobbying is unethical He said donations to deniers amount to trying to get a political message across br Robert Brulle analyzed the funding of organizations opposed to restrictions on carbon emissions which he called the climate change counter movement Between and the donor advised funds Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund combined were the largest funders accounting for about a quarter of the funds and the American Enterprise Institute was the largest recipient with of the total funds The study also found that the amount of money donated to these organizations by means of foundations whose funding sources cannot be traced had risen br br br Effects on public opinion br br Public opinion on climate change is significantly affected by media coverage of climate change and the effects of climate change denial campaigns Campaigns to undermine public confidence in climate science have decreased public belief in climate change which in turn has affected legislative efforts to curb CO emissions br Climate change conspiracy theories and denial have resulted in poor action or no action at all to effectively mitigate the damage done by global warming of Americans believed ca that climate change is a hoax even though of climate scientists as of believe it is real br A study in stated Exposure to conspiracy theories reduced people s intentions to reduce their carbon footprint relative to people who were given refuting information br Manufactured uncertainty over climate change the fundamental strategy of climate change denial has been very effective particularly in the U S It has contributed to low levels of public concern and to government inaction worldwide A Angus Reid poll found that global warming skepticism in the U S Canada and the United Kingdom has been rising There may be multiple causes of this trend including a focus on economic rather than environmental issues and a negative perception of the United Nations and its role in discussing climate change br According to Tim Wirth They patterned what they did after the tobacco industry Both figured sow enough doubt call the science uncertain and in dispute That s had a huge impact on both the public and Congress American media has propagated this approach presenting a false balance between climate science and climate skeptics In Newsweek reported that most Europeans and Japanese accepted the consensus on scientific climate change but only one third of Americans thought human activity plays a major role in climate change believed that scientists disagreed about it a lot br Deliberate attempts by the Western Fuels Association to confuse the public have succeeded This has been exacerbated by media treatment of the climate issue According to a Pew poll of Americans are unaware of or outright reject the scientific consensus on climate change Some organizations promoting climate change denial have asserted that scientists are increasingly rejecting climate change but this is contradicted by research showing that of published papers endorse the scientific consensus and that percentage is increasing with time br On the other hand global oil companies have begun to acknowledge the existence of climate change and its risks Still top oil firms are spending millions lobbying to delay weaken or block policies to tackle climate change br Manufactured climate change denial is also influencing how scientific knowledge is communicated to the public According to climate scientist Michael E Mann universities and scientific societies and organizations publishers etc are too often risk averse when it comes to defending and communicating science that is perceived as threatening by powerful interests br br br United States br br A study found that public climate change policy support and behavior are significantly influenced by public beliefs attitudes and risk perceptions As of March the rate of acceptance among U S TV forecasters that the climate is changing has increased to percent The number of local TV stories about global warming has also increased by a factor of Climate Central has received some credit for this because it provides classes for meteorologists and graphics for TV stations br Popular media in the U S gives greater attention to climate change skeptics than the scientific community as a whole and the level of agreement within the scientific community has not been accurately communicated In some cases news outlets have let climate change skeptics instead of experts in climatology explain the science of climate change US and UK media coverage differ from that in other countries where reporting is more consistent with the scientific literature Some journalists attribute the difference to climate change denial being propagated mainly in the U S by business centered organizations employing tactics worked out previously by the U S tobacco lobby br Denial of climate change is most prevalent among white politically conservative men in the U S In France the U S and the U K climate change skeptics opinions appear much more frequently in conservative news outlets than others and in many cases those opinions are left uncontested br In the National Science Teachers Association urged teachers to emphasize to students that no scientific controversy exists regarding the basic facts of climate change br br br Europe br br Climate change denial has been promoted by several far right European parties including Spain s Vox Finland s far right Finns Party Austria s far right Freedom Party and Germany s anti immigration Alternative for Deutschland AfD br In April French political scientist Jean Yves Dormagen said that the modest and conservative classes were the most skeptical about climate change In a study by the Jean Jaur s Foundation published the same month climate skepticism was compared to a new populism whose representative and spokesman is Steven E Koonin br br br Responses to denialism br br br The role of emotions and persuasive argument br br Climate denial is not simply overcome by reasoned argument because it is not a rational response Attempting to overcome denial using techniques of persuasive argument such as supplying a missing piece of information or providing general scientific education may be ineffective A person who is in denial about climate is most likely taking a position based on their feelings especially their feelings about things they fear br Academics have stated that It is pretty clear that fear of the solutions drives much opposition to the science br It can be useful to respond to emotions including with the statement It can be painful to realise that our own lifestyles are responsible in order to help move from denial to acceptance to constructive action br br br Following people who have changed their position br Some climate change skeptics have changed their positions regarding global warming Ronald Bailey author of Global Warming and Other Eco Myths published in stated in Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up By he wrote Details like sea level rise will continue to be debated by researchers but if the debate over whether or not humanity is contributing to global warming wasn t over before it is now as the new IPCC Summary makes clear climate change Pollyannaism is no longer looking very tenable br Jerry Taylor promoted climate denialism for years as former staff director for the energy and environment task force at the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC and former vice president of the Cato Institute Taylor began to change his mind after climate scientist James Hansen challenged him to reread some Senate testimony He became President of the Niskanen Center in where he is involved in turning climate skeptics into climate activists and making the business case for climate action br Michael Shermer the publisher of Skeptic magazine reached a tipping point in as a result of his increasing familiarity with scientific evidence and decided there was overwhelming evidence for anthropogenic global warming Journalist Gregg Easterbrook an early skeptic of climate change who authored the influential book A Moment on the Earth also changed his mind in and wrote an essay titled Case Closed The Debate About Global Warming is Over In he stated based on the data I m now switching sides regarding global warming from skeptic to convert br In Russian president Dmitri Medvedev expressed his opinion that climate change was some kind of tricky campaign made up by some commercial structures to promote their business projects After the devastating Russian wildfires damaged agriculture and left Moscow choking in smoke Medvedev commented Unfortunately what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change br Bob Inglis a former US representative for South Carolina changed his mind in around after appeals from his son on his environmental positions and after spending time with climate scientist Scott Heron studying coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef br Richard A Muller professor of physics at the University of California Berkeley and the co founder of the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project funded by Charles Koch Charitable Foundation had been a prominent critic of prevailing climate science In he stated that following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct I m now going a step further Humans are almost entirely the cause br I used to be a climate change skeptic conservative columnist Max Boot admitted in one who believed that the science was inconclusive and that worry was overblown Now he says referencing the Fourth National Climate Assessment the scientific consensus is so clear and convincing br br br Effective approaches to dialogue br Explaining the techniques of science denial and misinformation by presenting examples of people using cherrypicking or fake experts or false balance to mislead the public has been shown to inoculate people somewhat against misinformation br Dialogue focused on the question of how belief differs from scientific theory may provide useful insights into how the scientific method works and how beliefs may have strong or minimal supporting evidence Wong Parodi s survey of the literature shows four effective approaches to dialogue including encouraging people to openly share their values and stance on climate change before introducing actual scientific climate information into the discussion br br br Approaches with farmers br One study of climate change denial among farmers in Australia found that farmers were less likely to take a position of climate denial if they had experienced improved production from climate friendly practices or identified a younger person as a successor for their farm Therefore seeing positive economic results from efforts at climate friendly agricultural practices or becoming involved in intergenerational stewardship of a farm may play a role in turning farmers away from denial br In the United States rural climate dialogues sponsored by the Sierra Club have helped neighbors overcome their fears of political polarization and exclusion and come together to address shared concerns about climate impacts in their communities Some participants who start out with attitudes of anthropogenic climate change denial have shifted to identifying concerns which they would like to see addressed by local officials br br br Statements of well known people calling for climate action br br In May Charles Prince of Wales took a strong stance criticising both climate change deniers and corporate lobbyists by likening the Earth to a dying patient A scientific hypothesis is tested to absolute destruction but medicine can t wait If a doctor sees a child with a fever he can
