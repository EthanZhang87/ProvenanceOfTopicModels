Reptilians also called reptoids archons reptiloids saurians draconians or lizard people are supposed reptilian humanoids which play a prominent role in fantasy science fiction ufology and conspiracy theories The idea of reptilians was popularised by David Icke an anti semitic conspiracy theorist who claims shapeshifting reptilian aliens control Earth by taking on human form and gaining political power to manipulate human societies Icke has stated on multiple occasions that many world leaders are or are possessed by so called reptilians br Some conspiracy theorists espousing the extraterrestrial hypothesis claim they either come from the Draco constellation or the Orion constellation or are allies with nefarious extraterrestrials from the Orion constellation br Others claim they are interdimensional coming from another universe or dimension br br Michael Barkun professor of political science at Syracuse University posits that the idea of a reptilian conspiracy originated in the fiction of Conan the Barbarian creator Robert E Howard in his story The Shadow Kingdom published in Weird Tales in August This story drew on theosophical ideas of the lost worlds of Atlantis and Lemuria particularly Helena Blavatsky s The Secret Doctrine written in with its reference to dragon men who once had a mighty civilization on a Lemurian continent br Howard s serpent men were described as humanoids with human bodies and snake heads who were able to imitate humans at will and who lived in underground passages and used their shapechanging and mind control abilities to infiltrate humanity Clark Ashton Smith used Howard s serpent men in his stories as well as themes from H P Lovecraft and he Howard and Lovecraft together laid the basis for the Cthulhu Mythos br In the s American occultist Maurice Doreal also known as Claude Doggins wrote a pamphlet entitled Mysteries of the Gobi that described a serpent race with bodies like man but heads like a great snake and an ability to take human form These creatures also appeared in Doreal s poem The Emerald Tablets in which he referred to Emerald Tablets written by Thoth an Atlantean Priest king Barkun asserts that in all likelihood Doreal s ideas came from The Shadow Kingdom and that in turn The Emerald Tablets formed the basis for David Icke s book Children of the Matrix br Historian Edward Guimont has argued that the reptilian conspiracy theory particularly as expounded by Icke drew from earlier pseudohistorical legends developed during the colonisation of Africa particularly surrounding Great Zimbabwe and the mokele mbembe br br Alien abduction narratives sometimes allege contact with reptilian creatures One of the earliest reports was that of Ashland Nebraska police officer Herbert Schirmer who under hypnosis recalled being taken aboard a UFO in by humanoid beings with a slightly reptilian appearance who wore a winged serpent emblem on the left side of their chests Skeptics consider his claims to be a hoax br br According to British conspiracy theorist David Icke who first published on this theme in his work The Biggest Secret tall blood drinking shape shifting reptilian humanoids from the Alpha Draconis star system now hiding in underground bases are the force behind a worldwide conspiracy against humanity He contends that most of the world s ancient and modern leaders are related to these reptilians including the Merovingian dynasty the Rothschilds the Bush family and the British Royal family Icke s conspiracy theories now have supporters in up to countries and he has given lectures to crowds of up to people br American writer Vicki Santillano included Icke s conspiracy theory in her list of the most popular conspiracy theories A poll of Americans in by Public Policy Polling indicated that of registered voters believed in David Icke s ideas br br On September during the provincial election campaign in Ontario Canada the Ernie Eves campaign issued a news release that called opponent Dalton McGuinty an evil reptilian kitten eater from another planet The words appeared at the end of the news release Eves said the epithet was meant as a joke and acknowledged the words were over the top but refused to apologize br In the closely fought U S Senate election in Minnesota between comedian and commentator Al Franken and incumbent Senator Norm Coleman one of the ballots challenged by Coleman included a vote for Franken with Lizard People written in the space provided for write in candidates Lucas Davenport who later claimed to have written the gag ballot said I don t know if you ve heard the conspiracy theory about the Lizard Men a friend of mine we didn t like the candidates so we were at first going to write in revolution because we thought that was good and to the point And then we thought the Lizard People would be even funnier Franken won the election after recount br In February on the Opie and Anthony radio show the comedian Louis C K jokingly asked former U S Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a number of times if he and Dick Cheney were lizard people who enjoyed the taste of human flesh Amused by Rumsfeld s refusal to directly answer the question C K suggested it was a possible admission of guilt He went on to further muse that perhaps those who are lizard people cannot lie about it when asked if they are lizards they either have to avoid answering the question or say yes br On March a video depicting a security agent with unusual features guarding a speech by U S President Barack Obama was spotlighted in a Wired report about shapeshifting reptilian humanoids This led to a tongue in cheek response from chief National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden who said any alleged program to guard the president with aliens or robots would likely have to be scaled back or eliminated in the sequester br In October Dutch MP Thierry Baudet head of the far right Forum for Democracy said in an interview with the Geopolitics and Empire podcast that he believes that the world is being governed by evil reptiles br Some adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory have also borrowed from the reptilian conspiracy theory including elements shared in anti Semitism conspiracy theories br br Dunning Brian May Skeptoid Support Your Local Reptoid Skeptoid
