Black propaganda is a form of propaganda intended to create the impression that it was created by those it is supposed to discredit Black propaganda contrasts with gray propaganda which does not identify its source as well as white propaganda which does not disguise its origins at all It is typically used to vilify or embarrass the enemy through misrepresentation br The major characteristic of black propaganda is that the audience are not aware that someone is influencing them and do not feel that they are being pushed in a certain direction Black propaganda purports to emanate from a source other than the true source This type of propaganda is associated with covert psychological operations Sometimes the source is concealed or credited to a false authority and spreads lies fabrications and deceptions Black propaganda is the big lie including all types of creative deceit Black propaganda relies on the willingness of the receiver to accept the credibility of the source If the creators or senders of the black propaganda message do not adequately understand their intended audience the message may be misunderstood seem suspect or fail altogether br Governments conduct black propaganda for a few reasons By disguising their direct involvement a government may be more likely to succeed in convincing an otherwise unbelieving target audience There are also diplomatic reasons behind the use of black propaganda Black propaganda is necessary to obfuscate a government s involvement in activities that may be detrimental to its foreign policies br br br In the American Revolution br Benjamin Franklin created and circulated a fake supplement to a Boston newspaper that included letters on Indian atrocities and the treatment of American prisoners br br br In World War II br br br British br br In the United Kingdom the Political Warfare Executive operated a number of black propaganda radio stations Gustav Siegfried Eins GS was one of the first such stations purporting to be a clandestine German station The speaker Der Chef purported to be a Nazi extremist accusing Adolf Hitler and his henchmen of going soft The station focused on alleged corruption and sexual improprieties of Nazi Party members br Another example was the British radio station Soldatensender Calais which purported to be a radio station for the Wehrmacht Under the direction of Sefton Delmer a British journalist who spoke perfect Berliner German Soldatensender Calais and its associated shortwave station Kurzwellensender Atlantik broadcast music up to date sports scores speeches of Adolf Hitler for cover and subtle propaganda br Radio Deutschland was another radio station employed by the British during the war aimed and designed to undermine German morale and create tensions that would ultimately disrupt the German war effort The station was broadcast on a frequency close on the radio dial to an actual German station During the war most Germans actually believed that this station was in fact a German radio station and it even gained the recognition of Germany s propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels br br There were British black propaganda radio stations in most of the languages of occupied Europe as well as German and Italian Most of these were based in the area around Bletchley Park and Woburn Abbey in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire respectively br Another possible example was a rumour that there had been a German attempt to land on British shores at Shingle Street but it had been repelled with high German casualties This was reported in the American press and in William L Shirer s Berlin Diary but was officially denied British papers declassified in have suggested this was a successful example of British black propaganda to bolster morale in the UK US and occupied Europe br Author James Hayward has proposed that the rumours which were widely reported in the American press were a successfully engineered example of black propaganda with an aim of ensuring American co operation and securing lend lease resources by showing that the United Kingdom was capable of successfully resisting the might of the German Army br David Hare s play Licking Hitler provides a fictionalised account based on the British black propaganda efforts in World War II br br br German br German black propaganda usually took advantage of European racism and anti Communism For example on the night of April German aircraft under cover of darkness and possibly carrying fake Royal Air Force markings dropped propaganda leaflets on occupied Denmark These leaflets used the title of Frihedsposten a genuine Danish underground newspaper and claimed that the hour of liberation was approaching They instructed Danes to accept occupation by Russian or specially trained American Negro soldiers until the first disorders resulting from military operations were over br The German B ro Concordia organisation operated several black propaganda radio stations many of which pretended to broadcast illegally from within the countries they targeted One of these stations was Workers Challenge which purported to be a British communist radio station and encouraged British workers to go on strike against their capitalist bosses br br br Pacific Theatre br The Tanaka Memorial was a document that described a Japanese plan for world conquest beginning with the conquest of China It was widely referenced in official American anti Japanese propaganda such as The Battle of China and Know Your Enemy Japan but most historians now believe it was a forgery br The following message was distributed in black propaganda leaflets dropped by the Japanese over the Philippines in World War II It was designed to turn Filipinos against the United States br br GUARD AGAINST VENEREAL DISEASES br Lately there has been a great increase in the number of venereal diseases among our officers and men owing to prolific contacts with Filipino women of dubious character br Due to hard times and stricken conditions brought about by the Japanese occupation of the islands Filipino women are willing to offer themselves for a small amount of foodstuffs It is advisable in such cases to take full protective measures by use of condoms protective medicines etc better still to hold intercourse only with wives virgins or women of respective sic character br br Furthermore in view of the increase in pro American leanings many Filipino women are more than willing to offer themselves to American soldiers and due to the fact that Filipinos have no knowledge of hygiene disease carriers are rampant and due care must be taken br br br Cold War black propaganda br br br Soviet Union br Prior to and during the Cold War the Soviet Union used disinformation on multiple occasions employing the KGB s Service A of the First Chief Directorate in order to conduct its covert or black active measures It was Service A that was responsible for clandestine campaigns that were targeted at foreign governments public populations as well as to influence individuals and specific groups that were hostile towards the Soviet government and its policies The majority of their operations was actually conducted by other elements and directorates of the KGB br br br United Kingdom br Declassified documents have revealed that the British government ran a secret black propaganda campaign for decades targeting Africa the Middle East and parts of Asia with leaflets and reports from fake sources aimed at destabilising cold war enemies by encouraging racial tensions sowing chaos inciting violence and reinforcing anti communist ideas br br br Indonesia br One of the British campaigns played a part in the Indonesian mass killings of one of the worst mass murders of the th century This tragedy was fuelled by black information written by British operatives based in Singapore Exploiting a failed coup attempt by a palace guard these operatives falsely blamed the Indonesian Communist Party PKI and the ethnic Chinese Despite no evidence linking the PKI to the coup they posed as exiled Indonesian patriots and incited violence by accusing them of involvement and called for their elimination Subsequently mass killings targeting Indonesian people PKI members and followers of Sukarno ensued resulting in an estimated death toll of at least br br br United States br Following the September attacks against the United States the U S Department of Defense organized and implemented the Office of Strategic Influence in an effort to improve public support abroad mainly in Muslim countries The head of OSI was USAF General Pete Worden who maintained a mission described by The New York Times as circulating classified proposals calling for aggressive campaigns that use d not only the foreign media and the Internet but also covert operations Worden and then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld planned for what Pentagon officials said was a broad mission ranging from black campaigns that use d disinformation and other covert activities to white public affairs that rely on truthful news releases The OSI s operations were more than public relations work in that they included contacting and emailing media journalists and foreign community leaders with information which would counter foreign governments and organizations hostile to the United States In doing so the emails would be masked by using addresses ending with com as opposed to using the standard Pentagon address of mil and hide any involvement of the US government and the Pentagon The thought of conducting black propaganda operations and utilizing disinformation resulted in harsh criticism for the program that resulted in its closure in br br br In domestic politics br br br Australian media br In the run up to the federal election in Australia flyers were circulated around Sydney under the name of a fake organisation called the Islamic Australia Federation The flyers thanked the Australian Labor Party for supporting terrorism Islamic fundamentalists and the Bali bombing suspects A group of Sydney based Liberal Party members were implicated in the incident br br br British media br In November a Sunday Telegraph newspaper article alleged Libya s Saif al Islam Gaddafi Muammar Gaddafi s son was connected to currency counterfeiting The story s author Con Coughlin falsely attributed the claim to a British banking official but his information actually came from MI agents This fact and the fact that Coughlin had no other sources for the story only came to light when Saif Gaddafi later sued the newspaper for libel br The Zinoviev letter was a fake letter published in in the British newspaper the Daily Mail It claimed to be a letter from the Comintern president Grigory Zinoviev to the Communist Party of Great Britain It called on Communists to mobilise sympathetic forces in the Labour Party and talked of creating dissent in the British Armed Forces The Zinoviev letter was instrumental in the Conservative victory in the general election The letter seemed authentic at the time but historians now believe it was a forgery Historians now agree that the letter had little impact on the Labour vote which held up in However it aided the Conservative Party in hastening the collapse of the Liberal Party that led to the Conservative landslide br br br United States media br In the Roorback forgery of the Chronicle of Ithaca New York ran a story supposedly by a German tourist called Baron von Roorback that James K Polk standing for re election as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives branded his slaves before selling them at auction to distinguish them from the others on sale Polk actually benefited from the ploy as it reflected badly on his opponents when the lie was found out Afterwards the term Roorback was coined for political dirty tricks br During the U S presidential election Donald H Segretti a political operative for President Richard Nixon s reelection campaign released a faked letter on Senator Edmund Muskie s letterhead falsely alleging that Senator Henry Scoop Jackson against whom Muskie was running for the Democratic Party s nomination had had an illegitimate child with a seventeen year old Muskie who had been considered the frontrunner lost the nomination to George McGovern and Nixon was reelected The letter was part of a campaign of so called dirty tricks directed by Segretti and uncovered as part of the Watergate Scandal Segretti went to prison in after pleading guilty to three misdemeanor counts of distributing illegal campaign literature Another of his dirty tricks was the Canuck letter although this was libel of Muskie and not a black propaganda piece br br br United States Government br
