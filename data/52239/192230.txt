An almanac also spelled almanack and almanach is a regularly published listing of a set of current information about one or multiple subjects It includes information like weather forecasts farmers planting dates tide tables and other tabular data often arranged according to the calendar Celestial figures and various statistics are found in almanacs such as the rising and setting times of the Sun and Moon dates of eclipses hours of high and low tides and religious festivals The set of events noted in an almanac may be tailored for a specific group of readers such as farmers sailors or astronomers br br br Name br The etymology of the word is unclear The earliest documented use of the word in something like its current sense is in Latin in Roger Bacon used it to mean a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the Moon br It has been suggested that the word almanac derives from a Greek word meaning calendar However that word appears only once in antiquity by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts almenichiak The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural astronomical or meteorological data But it is highly unlikely Roger Bacon received the word from this etymology Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word of which however the real form is very uncertain the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the Spanish Arabic man kh or with Medieval Latin almanach without Arabic intermediation seem insurmountable br One etymology report says The ultimate source of the word is obscure Its first syllable al and its general relevance to medieval science and technology strongly suggest an Arabic origin but no convincing candidate has been found Ernest Weekley similarly states of almanac First seen in Roger Bacon Apparently from Spanish Arabic al manakh but this is not an Arabic word The word remains a puzzle Walter William Skeat concludes that the construction of an Arabic origin is not satisfactory The Oxford English Dictionary similarly says the word has no etymon in Arabic but indirect circumstantial evidence points to a Spanish Arabic al man kh br The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled al man kh is that the spelling occurred as almanach as well as almanac and Roger Bacon used both spellings The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars The Arabic word al mun kh has different meanings in contemporary Arabic than in classical Arabic usage The word originally meant the place where camels kneel so riders and baggage can disembark In contemporary Arabic the word means climate br The prestige of the Tables of Toledo and other medieval Arabic astronomy works at the time of the word s emergence in the West together with the absence of the word in Arabic suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo Arabic At that time in the West it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables Also around that time prompted by that motive the Latin writer Pseudo Geber wrote under an Arabic pseudonym The later alchemical word alkahest is known to be pseudo Arabic br br br History br br br Hemerologies and parapegmata br br The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the Near East dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC They have been called generally hemerologies from the Greek h mer meaning day Among them is the so called Babylonian Almanac which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found Egyptian lists of good and bad moments three times each day have also been found Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events The flooding of the Nile valley a most important event in ancient Egypt was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly days over the centuries the date was drifting in the calendar The first heliacal rising of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread br The Greek almanac known as parapegma has existed in the form of an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes hence the name There were also written texts and according to Diogenes La rtius Parapegma was the title of a book by Democritus Ptolemy the Alexandrian astronomer nd century wrote a treatise Phaseis phases of fixed stars and collection of weather changes is the translation of its full title the core of which is a parapegma a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes first appearances and last appearances of stars or constellations at sunrise or sunset and solar events such as solstices all organized according to the solar year With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past Parapegmata had been composed for centuries Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play Hence for him weather prediction was a special division of astrology br Surviving Roman menologia rustica combined schedules of solar information and agricultural activities throughout the year with the months tutelary deities and major festivals By the imperial period each month was headed with illustrations of its chief astrological signs matching Roman geoponical tracts that often combined guidance for the proper conditions for different activities with the stars present during that period rather than using the civil calendar br br br Ephemerides zijs and tables br The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient Babylonian astronomy when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena Similar treatises called Zij were later composed in medieval Islamic astronomy br The modern almanac differs from Babylonian Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation in contrast to the more common auxiliary astronomical tables based on Ptolemy s Almagest The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the Almanac of Azarqueil written in by Ab Ish q Ibr h m al Zarq l Latinized as Arzachel in Toledo al Andalus The work provided the true daily positions of the sun moon and planets for four years from to as well as many other related tables A Latin translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the Tables of Toledo in the th century and the Alfonsine tables in the th century br br br Medieval examples br br After almanacs were devised people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides and predicting the future in the divination sense Early almanacs therefore contained general horoscopes as well as natural information An example is the folded almanac Western MS Wellcome Collection London produced in England between and is a calendar with astrological tables and diagrams used by medical practitioners to harness astrological information relating to health In Solomon Jarchus created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern examples

OFM produced his own In Walter de Elvendene created an almanac and later on John Somers of Oxford in In Nicholas de Lynne Oxford produced an almanac In the first printed almanac was published at Mainz by Gutenberg eight years before the famous Bible Regio Montanus produced an almanac in Nuremberg which continued in print for several centuries In the Sheapheard s Kalendar translated from French Richard Pynson became the first almanac to be printed in English br br br Early modern era br br br England br By the second half of the th century yearly almanacs were being produced in England by

in England Richard Allestree not to be confused with Richard Allestree provost of Eton College wrote one of the more popular English almanacs producing yearly volumes from to but his is by no means the earliest or the longest running almanac br Works that satirized this type of publication appeared in the late s During the next century a writer using the pseudonym of Poor Richard Knight of the
