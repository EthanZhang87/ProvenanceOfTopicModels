title: Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine
id: 70144390
As part of the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Russian state and state controlled media have spread disinformation in their information war against Ukraine Ukrainian media and politicians have also been accused of using propaganda and deception although such efforts have been described as more limited than the Russian disinformation campaign br Russian propaganda and fake news stories have attacked Ukraine s right to exist and accused it of being a neo Nazi state committing genocide against Russian speakers developing nuclear and biological weapons and being influenced by Satanism Russian propaganda also accuses NATO of controlling Ukraine and building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia Some of this disinformation has been spread by Russian web brigades It has been widely rejected as untrue and crafted to justify the invasion and even to justify genocidal acts against Ukrainians The Russian state has denied carrying out war crimes in Ukraine and Russian media has falsely blamed some of them on Ukrainian forces instead Some of the disinformation seeks to undermine international support for Ukraine and to provoke hostility against Ukrainian refugees br Russian disinformation has been pervasive and successful in Russia itself due to censorship of war news and state control of most media Because of the amount of disinformation Russian media has been restricted and its reputation has been tarnished in many Western and developed countries However the Russian state has had more success spreading its views in many developing countries In particular Chinese state media has been largely sympathetic to the Russian side and has repeatedly censored war news or reproduced Russian fake news and disinformation br Descriptions of Ukraine sponsored propaganda and misinformation have focused on over optimistic reports about the war and promotion of patriotic stories br br br Russian themes br br Disinformation a lie or exaggeration meant to sway opinion has been spread by the Russian state state controlled media propagandists and Russian web brigades as part of Russia s invasion of Ukraine Its purpose is to build support for Russia s invasion and to weaken opposition to the invasion It also seeks to sow disunity among Western countries who support Ukraine to counter NATO and to cover up or create plausible deniability for Russian war crimes br The following are common themes in Russian propaganda and disinformation along with some of the common rebuttals br br br Denying Ukrainian nationhood and statehood br br Russian propaganda has targeted Ukrainian nationhood and national identity portraying Ukrainians as Little Russians or part of an all Russian nation This has been a theme in Russian imperialist and nationalist rhetoric since the seventeenth century For years Russian President Vladimir Putin has questioned the Ukrainian people s identity and the country s legitimacy In his essay On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians Putin claimed there is no historical basis for the idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians Since then Russia s official and media narrative is that Ukraine has always been Russian Bj rn Alexander D ben professor of international affairs writes that Putin s historical claims do not hold up to serious academic scrutiny and that he is embracing a neo imperialist account that exalts Russia s centuries long repressive rule over Ukraine while simultaneously presenting Russia as a victim of US imperialism br Dmitry Medvedev deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia and former Russian president wrote that Ukraine is NOT a country but artificially collected territories and that Ukrainian is NOT a language but a mongrel dialect of Russian He has said that Ukraine should not exist in any form and that Russia will continue to wage war against any independent Ukrainian state br Such denial of nationhood is said to be part of a campaign of incitement to genocide by Russian authorities United Nations special rapporteurs have condemned the Russian occupation authorities for attempting to erase local Ukrainian culture history and language and to forcibly replace them with Russian language and culture br After the Ukrainian Revolution Russian rhetoric portrayed Ukrainian governments as illegitimate calling them the Kyiv regime or a Nazi fascist junta Putin said they were led by a band of drug addicts and neo Nazis and claimed Ukraine is under external control by the West or the United States br In February Putin claimed that the Russo Ukrainian War has the elements of a civil war and that the Russian people will be reunited while the Ukrainian Orthodox Church a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church which mostly supports the Russian invasion of Ukraine and mandatory publicly pray for military victory over Ukraine brings together our souls Nevertheless in the official governmental website of Ukraine it is stated that the Ukrainians and Russians are not one nation and that the Ukrainians identify themselves as an independent nation A poll conducted in April by Rating found that the vast majority of Ukrainians excluding the Russian occupied territories of Ukraine do not support the thesis that Russians and Ukrainians are one people br br br Allegations of Nazism br br Putin falsely claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo Nazis and announced that one of his goals was the de Nazification of Ukraine Putin s claims were repeated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in a speech to the UN Human Rights Council many diplomats walked out in protest These claims were repeated in Russian media to justify the war In April Russian state owned news agency RIA Novosti published an article by Timofey Sergeytsev What Russia should do with Ukraine where he argued that Ukraine and Ukrainian national identity must be wiped out because he claimed most Ukrainians are at least passive Nazis By May references to de Nazifying Ukraine in Russian media began to wane reportedly because it had not gained traction with the Russian public br br These allegations of Nazism are widely rejected as untrue and part of a Russian disinformation campaign to justify the invasion with many pointing out that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and had relatives who were victims of the Holocaust Some of the world s leading historians of Nazism and the Holocaust put out a statement rejecting Putin s claims which was signed by hundreds of other historians and scholars of the subject It says We strongly reject the Russian government s equation of the Ukrainian state with the Nazi regime to justify its unprovoked aggression This rhetoric is factually wrong morally repugnant and deeply offensive to the memory of millions of victims of Nazism and those who courageously fought against it br The authors say that Ukraine has right wing extremists and violent xenophobic groups like any country but none of this justifies the Russian aggression and the gross mischaracterization of Ukraine The Auschwitz Birkenau State Museum denounced Putin s claims saying once again innocent people are being killed purely because of insane pseudo imperial megalomania The US Holocaust Memorial Museum and Yad Vashem condemned Putin s abuse of Holocaust history Ukrainian Jews likewise rejected claims of Ukraine being a neo Nazi state br Kremlin claims of Nazism against Ukraine are partly an attempt to drum up support for the war among its citizens Russian propaganda has framed it as a continuation of the Soviet Union s Great Patriotic War against Nazi Germany even though Russia supports far right groups across Europe In the words of Miriam Berger for The Washington Post the rhetoric of the fight against fascism resonates deeply in Russia which suffered huge losses in the fight against Nazi Germany Some Soviet imagery was used as part of this propaganda drive and Ukrainian flags were replaced with Victory Banners in some occupied towns br Experts on disinformation say that Russia s portrayal of Ukrainians as Nazis helps them justify Russian war crimes Russia s UN representative justified the Hroza missile attack in this way Historian Timothy Snyder said the Russian regime calls Ukrainians Nazis to justify genocidal acts against them He said pro war Russians use Nazi to mean a Ukrainian who refuses to be Russian Russian neo fascist Aleksandr Dugin proposed to simply identify Ukrainian Nazism with Russophobia Dugin argued that Russia should be the only country allowed to define Ukrainian Nazism and Russophobia in the same way that Jews have what he calls a monopoly on the definition of antisemitism Ukrainian officials respond that Russia s own actions in Ukraine are like those of Nazi Germany and some commentators including Snyder have likened Putin s Russia to a fascist state see Ruscism Some Russian units who took part in the invasion are themselves linked to neo Nazism such as the Rusich Group and Wagner Group Russian far right groups also played a major role among the Russian proxy forces in Donbas br Like many countries Ukraine has a far right fringe such as Right Sector and Svoboda Analysts generally agree that the Russian government greatly exaggerates far right influence in Ukraine as there is no widespread support for far right ideology in the government military or electorate In the Ukrainian parliamentary election a coalition of far right parties including Right Sector received only of votes and did not win any seats Ukraine s Azov Brigade which had far right origins and included neo Nazis was a focus of Kremlin propaganda By the time of the invasion the brigade had been largely de politicized A Counter Extremism Project report concluded that the Azov Brigade can no longer be defined as neo Nazi br br br Donbas genocide allegations br br In his announcement of the invasion Putin baselessly claimed that Ukraine was carrying out genocide in the mainly Russian speaking Donbas region He said the purpose of Russia s military operation was to protect the people of the Russian controlled breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk Putin claimed they had been facing genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime for eight years There is no evidence for Putin s claims of genocide and they have been widely rejected as an excuse to justify invasion The European Commission called the allegations Russian disinformation Over scholars on genocide issued a statement rejecting Russia s abuse of the term genocide to justify its own violence Ukraine brought a case before the International Court of Justice ICJ to challenge Russia s claim The ICJ said it had not seen any evidence of genocide by Ukraine br Altogether about people were killed in the Donbas War both soldiers and civilians According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights were Russian proxy forces were Ukrainian forces and were civilians on both sides of the frontline The vast majority of civilian deaths were in the first year and the death rate in the Donbas War was actually falling before the Russian invasion in there were conflict related civilian deaths in there were deaths and in there were deaths over half of them from mines and unexploded ordnance By comparison after Russian full scale invasion civilians were killed in March meaning that more civilians died in that one month alone than in the entire eight years of the Donbas War Since the invasion Russian state controlled media and pro Kremlin Telegram channels falsely accused Ukrainian troops of attacking civilian targets in Mariupol and bombing Ukrainian cities br br br Allegations of NATO provocation and aggression br br Russian propaganda often claims that NATO provoked the invasion and that Russia had to invade Ukraine to defend itself In his two speeches just before the invasion Putin said that Ukraine joining NATO would be a threat and warned that NATO might use Ukraine to launch a surprise attack on Russia He falsely claimed that NATO was building up its forces and military infrastructure in Ukraine and that the Ukrainian military was under NATO control After the invasion began Russian state media falsely claimed that some Ukrainian military units were under NATO command and that thousands of NATO soldiers had been killed br NATO is a collective security alliance of member states similar to the CSTO of which Russia is a member Outside its member states NATO only has a military presence in Kosovo and Iraq at the request of their governments In Russia signed the Charter for European Security affirming the right of each state to choose its security arrangements and join alliances if they wish In Putin said Ukraine s relationship with NATO was not Russia s concern and NATO and Russia co operated until Russia attacked Ukraine in At the time Ukraine was a neutral country and was not seeking NATO membership Ukraine s parliament voted to end its neutral status in response to Russia s aggression and Ukraine applied to join NATO after the invasion According to Politico members of the alliance have been wary of discussing its potential membership due to Putin s hyper sensitivity br Putin said that NATO s eastward expansion had provoked Russia and claimed that NATO broke a promise not to let any Eastern European countries join This unwritten promise was allegedly made by American and German diplomats to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in but the diplomats and NATO denied ever making any formal proposal Such a promise was never included in any treaty Between the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Russian invasion Eastern European countries willingly joined NATO and the last time a country bordering Russia had joined NATO was in Russia s invasion led Finland to join NATO doubling the length of Russia s border with NATO Putin said that Finland s membership was not a threat unlike Ukraine s but the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke our response br The Russian government accused NATO of waging a proxy war against Russia because its members sent military aid to Ukraine after the invasion NATO says it is not at war with Russia but supports Ukraine s right to self defense as enshrined in the UN Charter Lawrence Freedman wrote that calling Ukraine a NATO proxy wrongly implied that Ukrainians are only fighting because NATO put them up to it rather than because of the more obvious reason that they have been subjected to a vicious invasion He said that defeating the invasion might prevent further Russian expansionism which would be a bonus for NATO but any weakening of Russia would result from Moscow s folly not NATO s intent Geraint Hughes said that calling Ukraine NATO s proxy insults and belittles Ukrainians denies their autonomy and implies they do not really have the will to defend their country br br Peter Dickinson of the Atlantic Council suggested the real reason Putin opposes NATO is not because he believes it is a threat but because it prevents him from bullying Russia s neighbors Tom Casier writes that Russia s annexation of southeastern Ukraine reveals that the real motive for the invasion is to create a Greater Russia br Shortly before his death in a plane crash Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin accused the Russian military leadership of lying about NATO aggression to justify the invasion Prigozhin was a close ally of Putin and his Wagner Group played an important role in the Russian invasion br br An article published by the Institute for the Study of War concluded Putin didn t invade Ukraine in because he feared NATO He invaded because he believed that NATO was weak that his efforts to regain control of Ukraine by other means had failed and that installing a pro Russian government in Kyiv would be safe and easy His aim was not to defend Russia against some non existent threat but rather to expand Russia s power eradicate Ukraine s statehood and destroy NATO goals he still pursues br br br Alleged assassination and sabotage attempts br On February the Luhansk People s Republic showed a video purportedly showing removal of a car full of explosives prepared to blow up a train full of women and children evacuating to Russia The video s metadata showed that it had been recorded on June br The breakaway Donetsk People s Republic also released a video on February that claimed to show Poles trying to blow up a chlorine tank The video was further distributed by Russian media The video s metadata showed that it was created on February and included different pieces of audio or video including a YouTube video from a military firing range in Finland Ukrainian intelligence attributed responsibility for the video to the Russian intelligence service GRU br According to Bellingcat a supposed bombing of a separatist police chief by a Ukrainian spy broadcast on Russian state television showed visual evidence of the bombing of an old green army vehicle The old car s registration plate was that of the separatist police chief but the same licence plate was also seen on a different new SUV br On February the Russian people s militias in Ukraine accused Ukraine of a terrorist attack that killed three civilians in a car on the Donetsk Gorlovka highway France described the incident as a false flag attempt with corpses likely coming from a morgue to set up the scene br br br Russia s alleged attempt to end the Donbas War br On September at the Eastern Economic Forum Putin claimed that Russia did not start any military operations but was only trying to end those that started in after a coup d tat in Ukraine Conversely Russia s annexation of Crimea in February is regarded as the start of the Russo Ukrainian War br Before Russia began its full scale invasion of Ukraine in the intensity of the hostilities in the Donbas had been steadily declining since the signing of the Minsk agreements in February br br br Ukrainian biological and radiological weapons br br br Biological weapons labs br br In March Russia alleged that Ukraine was developing biological weapons in a network of labs linked to the US The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People s Republic of China and Chinese state media amplified Russian claims QAnon promoters also echo disinformation BBC Reality Check found no evidence supporting the claims The United Nations also refuted this Russian biologists in and outside of Russia have debunked the claims calling the allegations transparently false br According to researcher Adam Rawnsley the Kremlin has a history of discrediting ordinary biology labs in former Soviet republics and previously spread conspiracy theories about Georgia and Kazakhstan similar to those deployed against Ukraine br br br Birds as bio weapons br Prior to March the Russian Ministry of Defence made unsubstantiated accusations that the United States was manufacturing bio weapons in Ukraine In March the Ministry followed up with another conspiracy theory the US was training birds to spread disease in Ukraine among Russian citizens according to Major General Igor Konashenkov spokesman for the Ministry of Russian state controlled media He mentioned specific details including a strain of influenza with mortality and Newcastle disease Media reports included maps documents and photos of birds with American military insignia and claimed that infected birds had been captured alive in eastern Ukraine br A U S State Department spokesman laughed these claims off and called them outright lies total nonsense absurd laughable and propaganda CIA Director William Burns told the U S Senate that Russia made these claims to prepare the terrain for a biological or chemical attack against Ukraine which they would then blame on the United States and Ukraine br br br Combat mosquitoes br On October Vasily Nebenzya Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations accused Ukraine of using drones with combat mosquitoes which spread dangerous viruses br br br Ukrainian plans to use a dirty bomb br br In March Russian state controlled news agencies claimed without evidence that Ukraine was developing a plutonium based dirty bomb nuclear weapon at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant br In a series of calls to foreign defence officials made in October Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu similarly claimed that Ukraine was preparing a provocation involving the use of a dirty bomb The Institute for the Study of War suggested a desire to slow or suspend foreign aid to Ukraine as a possible motive for the allegations The foreign ministries of France the United Kingdom and the United States rejected Russia s transparently false allegations In a briefing the Russian Ministry of Defence used photos of the Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station the Novosibirsk Chemical Concentrates Plant the aftermath of the September attacks and a photo from a presentation by the Slovenian Radioactive Waste Management Agency as evidence for its claims br br br Denial of Russian war crimes br br During the Russian invasion of Ukraine numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity were recorded and extensively documented including attacks on civilians and energy related infrastructure wilful killings unlawful confinement torture rape and unlawful deportations of children Russian officials denied the war crimes perpetrated by Russian forces Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Bucha massacre a fake attack against Russia claiming it was staged He said that Russian forces had left Bucha on March while evidence of killings had emerged according to him four days later br On April at the United Nations Russian representative Vasily Nebenzya said that the bodies in the videos were not there when Russian forces withdrew from Bucha This was contradicted by satellite images showing that the bodies were there as early as March the position of the corpses in the satellite images matches the smartphone photos taken in early April br The Russian Defence Ministry s Telegram channel said Russian forces did not target civilians during the battle According to them a massacre could not have been covered up by the Russian military and the mass grave in the city was filled with victims of Ukrainian airstrikes The Ministry said it had analyzed a video purporting to show the bodies of dead civilians in Bucha and the corpses were moving The BBC s Moscow office investigated this claim and concluded there was no evidence the video had been staged Russian officials also blamed Ukrainian forces for the Mariupol theatre airstrike though independent sources confirmed that Russia was responsible br br In November Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied that the Russian military was attacking civilian infrastructure in Ukraine According to Peskov the Russian army only attacked targets directly or indirectly connected to military potential In January the Russian Ministry of Defence confirmed their responsibility for the Dnipro residential building airstrike which killed over civilians But Peskov said that Russian forces never attack residential buildings and the residential building probably collapsed because of a Ukrainian air defence counterattack br In December Russian opposition politician Ilya Yashin was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for his statements about the killings in Bucha on charges of spreading false information about the armed forces Yashin was tried over a YouTube video released in April in which he discussed the discovery of murdered Ukrainian civilians in the suburban town of Bucha near Kyiv In February Russian journalist Maria Ponomarenko was sentenced to six years in prison for publishing information about the Mariupol theatre airstrike br br br Other Russian claims br br br Ukrainian Satanism and black magic br In May Russian state media claimed that Ukraine was using black magic to fend off the Russian military RIA Novosti said that evidence of black magic had been found in an eastern Ukrainian village according to their report Ukrainian soldiers had allegedly consecrated their weapons with blood magick at a location with a satanic seal br Dmitry Medvedev deputy chairman of Russia s Security Council and also a former Russian president and prime minister described the invasion as a sacred war against Satan Vladimir Solovyov a presenter on state owned channel Russia also called the invasion a holy war against Satanists and said Russia is up against fifty countries united by Satanism br Assistant secretary of Russia s Security Council Aleksey Pavlov called for the de Satanisation of Ukraine in October claiming that the country had turned into a totalitarian hypersect In an article for the Russian state owned Argumenty i Fakty newspaper he identified the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidic Jewish movement as one of the hundreds of neo pagan cults operating in Ukraine Russia s chief rabbi Berel Lazar wrote a letter to Russian authorities asking them to condemn Pavlov s comments which he described as a new variety of old blood libels About of Ukrainians are religious and half of those attend religious services br br br False flag fakes br In March videos were discovered purporting to show Ukrainian produced disinformation about missile strikes inside Ukraine which were then debunked as some other event outside Ukraine However this may be the first case of a disinformation false flag operation as the original supposedly Ukraine produced disinformation was never disseminated by anyone and was in fact preventive disinformation created specifically to be debunked and cause confusion and mitigate the impact on the Russian public of real footage of Russian strikes within Ukraine that may get past Russian controlled media According to Patrick Warren head of Clemson s Media Forensics Hub It s like Russians actually pretending to be Ukrainians spreading disinformation The reason that it s so effective is because you don t actually have to convince someone that it s true It s sufficient to make people uncertain as to what they should trust br The Olenivka prison massacre described by most independent experts as a Russian orchestrated sabotage has been reported by Russian media as a missile attack by Ukraine While the exact cause of the incident has still not been conclusively confirmed most experts conclude the Russian version highly improbable br br br Flight and surrender of Ukrainian President br The Russian state media agency TASS claimed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fled Kyiv following the invasion and also that he had surrendered Zelenskyy used social media to post statements videos and photos to counter the Russian disinformation br Russian state owned television channel Russia spread false claims that Zelenskyy fled Ukraine following the October missile strikes br br br Anti refugee sentiments br Russian disinformation has also attempted to promote anti refugee sentiments in Poland and other countries with an influx of mostly Ukrainian refugees from the war Social media accounts with ties to Russia have promoted stories of refugees committing crimes or being unfairly privileged or about locals discriminating against refugees in particular against black and non Ukrainian refugees Such disinformation is intended to weaken international support for Ukraine br br br News masquerading as Western coverage br A number of fabricated CNN headlines and stories went viral on social media including of a faked image of CNN reporting that Steven Seagal had been seen alongside the Russian military false tweets claiming that a CNN journalist had been killed in Ukraine a CNN lower third that was digitally altered to include a claim that Putin had issued a statement warning India not to interfere in the conflict and another that was altered to claim that Putin planned to delay the Russian invasion of Ukraine until Biden delivers weapons to Ukraine for Russia to capture as well as a fabricated CNN tweet supposedly reporting on a figure referred to as the Kharkiv Kid finder alongside an image that actually portrayed the YouTuber Vaush who lives in the US and was not in Kharkiv at the time br Other Western stations including the BBC DW and Euronews have seen similar fakes distributed br br br Grandmother with red flag br br A video showing an elderly woman holding the Soviet national flag to greet the Ukrainian military has been widely spread in Runet since March The grandmother with a red flag was turned into an iconic image by Russian propaganda Allegedly it represents the desire of ordinary Ukrainians to reunite with their Russian brothers br Anna Ivanivna the subject of the grandmother with red flag video explained that she mistook the Ukrainian military for Russian invaders and she wanted to placate them with a Soviet flag so they would not destroy the village She now regrets it and feels like a traitor Her house near Kharkiv was destroyed by the Russian army and she and her husband have been evacuated She cursed the Russian army which she deemed was responsible for shelling her house The Ukrainian military appealed to the public to not chastise Anna Ivanivna who was a victim herself br br br French mercenaries killed in Kharkiv br On January Russia carried out a missile strike on a multi storey building in Kharkiv claiming it had killed a dozen French mercenaries Local authorities said that civilians were injured and that there was no military target in the building Russian media even published a list of French men ostensibly killed in the attack French network Radio France Internationale RFI contacted two people on the list Alexis Drion and B ranger Minaud volunteers of the International Legion of Ukraine who were both in France during this attack on Kharkiv and made an interview with them confirming they never died and that the story is a Russian propaganda RFI assumes this was tied to the French announcement of a delivery of SCALP missiles to the Ukrainian Army br br br Russian claims about Ukrainian civilians br Russian soldiers will be welcomed as heroes by civilians for liberating them in Ukraine br Ukrainians confront Russian tanks with bare hands br Ukrainians jubilant as Ukraine retakes Kherson br No strikes are being made on civilian infrastructure In February Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian armed forces do not attack civilian objects on the territory of Ukraine June Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov br Russia s full scale aggression has caused billion damage to Ukraine s infrastructure in a year br Civilians are not being targeted br The United Nations estimated that as of July the war had killed or injured more than civilians br Civilians are tortured and killed br Civilians suffer wilful killings attacks unlawful confinement torture rape and sexual violence as well as forcible transfer and deportation of children Chair of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine to the General Assembly br At least killed civilians confirmed by the UN since the beginning of the full scale Russian invasion November br The Kremlin claimed they do not intend to impose anything by force br Civilians who refuse Russian passports denied medical facilities br Civilians without passports threatened with deportation br Ukrainian citizens can decide on their future President Putin June br br br Claims of Wikipedia publishing false information br br Amongst Russia s attempts to control the free press and present their own views are attacks on Wikipedia which has been on a government registry of prohibited websites for over years br In May the Wikimedia Foundation was fined million rubles for articles about the Russian invasion of Ukraine Russia claimed to have uncovered million messages spreading fakes about the invasion on platforms including Wikipedia The Wikimedia Foundation appealed the ruling in June stating the information at issue is fact based and verified by volunteers who continuously edit and improve articles on the site its removal would therefore constitute a violation of people s rights to free expression and access to knowledge br In November a Russian court fined the Wikimedia Foundation million rubles for not deleting false information in seven articles about the special military operation including the Bucha massacre and the Mariupol theatre airstrike br In February a Russian court imposed a fine of million rubles on the Wikimedia Foundation for failing to remove misinformation about the Russian military In April another fine of rubles was imposed on the Wikimedia Foundation for not removing materials about Russian rock band Psiheya with another fine of million rubles being imposed in relation to other articles such as the Russian language version of Russian occupation of Zaporizhzhia Oblast br br br Support for Hamas br br On October a video supposedly of Hamas thanking Ukraine for supplying them was shared by an X account linked to the Wagner Group It was viewed over times and shared by American far right accounts The next day former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev tweeted Well Nato buddies you ve really got it haven t you The weapons handed to the Nazi regime in Ukraine are now being actively used against Israel br br br Claims of organ harvesting br In April Canada s Communications Security Establishment said there was a coordinated effort by Russia to promote false reports about Ukraine harvesting organs from dead soldiers women and children br In May RT aired a documentary titled Tanks for Kidneys which promotes false claims that Ukraine has been selling organs since including from children in orphanages and Ukrainian soldiers br br br Involvement in the Crocus City Hall attack br br Ukrainian officials described Russian claims that the perpetrators of the Crocus City Hall attack tried to escape to Ukraine as very doubtful and primitive disinformation recalling that the border is heavily guarded by soldiers and drones mined in many areas and constantly shelled from both sides Latvia based Russian news outlet Meduza has reported that pro government and state funded media in Russia have been instructed by the Russian government to highlight possible traces of Ukrainian involvement in the attack br On the evening of the attack Russian television channel NTV broadcast a doctored video using audio deepfaking purporting to show Oleksiy Danilov the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine confirming Ukrainian involvement in the attack supposedly saying It s fun in Moscow today I think it s very fun I would like to believe that we will arrange such fun for them more often The deepfake was created by patching together previous news streams of the Ukrainian channel br br br Ukrainian themes br br br The Ghost of Kyiv br br On the second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine videos and picture went viral on social media with claims that a Ukrainian pilot nicknamed the Ghost of Kyiv had shot down Russian fighter jets in the first hours of the war There is no credible evidence that he existed A video of the alleged pilot was shared on Facebook and the official Twitter account of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence was later found to be from the video game Digital Combat Simulator World An altered photo was also shared by the former president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko On April Ukrainian Air Force asked the Ukrainian community not to neglect the basic rules of information hygiene and to check the sources of information before spreading it stating that the Ghost of Kyiv embodies the collective spirit of the highly qualified pilots of the Tactical Aviation Brigade who are successfully defending Kyiv and the region br The Ukrainian Air Force later admitted that the Ghost of Kyiv was a fabrication Despite this The Times and several other outlets published stories without evidence asserting that the pilot was real and had died br br br Snake Island campaign br br On February the Ukrainian newspaper Ukrainska Pravda published a viral audio recording in which the crew of a Russian warship offered Ukrainian border guards on Serpent Island to surrender to the Russian forces One of the border guards responded by saying Russian warship go fuck yourself br Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the death of the border guards A few days later Ukrainian officials reported that the border guards were alive and had been captured by Russian troops The New York Times stated that The Ghost of Kyiv story was likely to be false and that the claim that the Snake Island border guards had all been killed was false and that both cases were either propaganda or a campaigns to raise morale br br br Ukrainian southern counteroffensive br br In the summer of a number of Ukrainian officials spread misleading information about the impending Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south of the country in the Kherson Oblast in order to regain control of Kherson Ukrainian special forces have said that the highly publicized Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kherson Oblast was a military disinformation campaign aimed at distracting Russian forces from the real offensive that was being prepared in the Kharkiv Oblast Taras Berezovets a spokesman for the Ukrainian special forces brigade said It was a big special disinformation operation Russia thought it would be in the south and moved their equipment Then instead of the south the offensive happened where they least expected and this caused them to panic and flee br br br Rumors about Russian mobilisation br Alexander Titov from Queen s University Belfast notes that the rumours about new Russian mobilisation are partly a misinformation campaign launched by Kyiv to sow dissent in Russia and that the spreading rumours of imminent mobilisation in Russian is clearly part of Ukraine s psychological warfare but the more they do it without anything happening the less credible it becomes br On September the conscript base of the Russian mobilisation from the hacker group Anonymous began to spread in Ukrainian Telegram channels As it was claimed the distributed file allegedly contained the passport data of more than thousand Russians subject to mobilisation first of all It was also noted that Anonymous hackers obtained the data by hacking the website of the Russian defence ministry but the group itself didn t report this leak The ministry didn t comment on the alleged leak but reposted War on Fakes a Telegram channel The report says that the published database is compiled from several open databases and has nothing to do with the Ministry of Defense Ruslan Leviev the founder of Conflict Intelligence Team and Andrei Zakharov a correspondent of the BBC News Russian are of the opinion that the conscript base is a fake br br In December Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov and head of military intelligence Kyrylo Budanov claimed that a new wave of mobilisation would begin on January but this didn t happen Then in January of the same year Ukrainian officials continued to claim that people would be mobilized that same month br On January information spread on social networks that the Federal Security Service sent all border services an order to restrict the departure of Russian citizens subject to conscription for military service On January this statement was published among other things by the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov called that as information sabotage The head of the human rights group Agora Pavel Chikov called the orders a fake because the orders were executed inappropriately although they are similar to the original ones Factcheck kg noted that according to the Russian GOST for official documents the date must be indicated in a verbal digital way and that when writing an order it is also necessary to refer to the law Paragraph contains an extra character which is also unacceptable Also the document is not certified by the seal or signature of the relevant officials or organizations and thus is a fake br On September a document allegedly signed by Sergei Shoigu on a new wave of Russian mobilization appeared in the Ukrainian media and Telegram channels including UNIAN Regional and federal representatives of the Russian authorities called the order a fake Russian independent media SOTA concluded that it was a fake and provided a number of arguments to support this opinion for example in Russian legislation there are not representatives of military commissariats but military commissars A few days later on September the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces published an unsubstantiated statement that Russia could soon launch a major mobilization campaign of to people br br br Other disinformation br The media focused much less on how other countries propaganda during Russia s invasion of Ukraine worked to promote certain narratives br br br Russosphere br Russosphere is a French language social network that promotes pro Russian propaganda in Africa It was created in but fully launched in February prior to the invasion of Ukraine It amassed over followers on social media platforms such as Facebook YouTube and Twitter as well as Telegram and VK The network s posts typically accuse France of modern day colonialism describe the Ukrainian Army as Nazis and Satanists and praise the Wagner Group a Russian private military company In early the BBC and Logically reported that Russosphere was created by Luc Michel a Belgian far right activist br br br Fakes involving celebrities br In December Microsoft revealed that messages recorded by US actors on the website Cameo have been repurposed to spread misinformation about Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy being a drug addict on social media and Russian state media Wired reported that images of Western celebrities edited to contain pro Russian and anti Ukrainian quotes were spread on Facebook with the operation being linked to Doppelganger a Russian disinformation campaign br br br Censorship br br br In Russia br br On March Putin signed into law a bill introducing prison sentences of up to years for those who publish knowingly false information about the Russian military and its operations with the Russian government deciding what is the truth leading to some media outlets in Russia to stop reporting on Ukraine or shutting their media outlet Although the Russian Constitution has an article expressly prohibiting censorship the Russian censorship apparatus Roskomnadzor ordered the country s media to only use information from Russian state sources or face fines and blocks and accused a number of independent media outlets of spreading unreliable socially significant untrue information about the shelling of Ukrainian cities by the Russian army and civilian deaths br Roskomnadzor launched an investigation against the Novaya Gazeta Echo of Moscow inoSMI MediaZona New Times TV Rain and other independent Russian media outlets for publishing inaccurate information about the shelling of Ukrainian cities and civilian casualties in Ukraine as a result of the actions of the Russian Army On March the Russian government blocked access to TV Rain as well as Echo of Moscow in response to their coverage of the invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces The channel closed with its general director announcing they would be temporarily halting its operations on March its frequencies were later reassigned to the Russian state propaganda outlet Sputnik Radio Novaya Gazeta ceased publications on March and its publishing license was revoked on September but it was quickly revived in Latvia as Novaya Gazeta Europe The websites of Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty The Moscow Times Radio France Internationale The New Times and BBC News Russian were blocked br As of December more than people were prosecuted under fake news laws in connection with the war in Ukraine Hugh Williamson Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said that These new laws are part of Russia s ruthless effort to suppress all dissent and make sure the Russian population does not have access to any information that contradicts the Kremlin s narrative about the invasion of Ukraine br Due to Russian fake news laws Russian authorities blocked Facebook and Twitter while TikTok in Russia banned new uploads However a study by Tracking Exposed found out that TikTok had blocked all non Russian content but has continued to host old videos uploaded by Russia based accounts and permitted Russian state media to continue posting described as establishing a splinternet within a global social media platform TikTok s vague censorship has permitted pro Kremlin news but blocked foreign accounts and critics of the war as a result Russians are
