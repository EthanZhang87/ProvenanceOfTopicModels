id: 52881503
Fake news or information disorder is false or misleading information misinformation including disinformation propaganda and hoaxes presented as news Fake news often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity or making money through advertising revenue Although false news has always been spread throughout history the term fake news was first used in the s when sensational reports in newspapers were common Nevertheless the term does not have a fixed definition and has been applied broadly to any type of false information presented as news It has also been used by high profile people to apply to any news unfavorable to them Further disinformation involves spreading false information with harmful intent and is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors particularly during elections In some definitions fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text Because of this diversity of types of false news researchers are beginning to favour information disorder as a more neutral and informative term br The prevalence of fake news has increased with the recent rise of social media especially the Facebook News Feed and this misinformation is gradually seeping into the mainstream media Several factors have been implicated in the spread of fake news such as political polarization post truth politics motivated reasoning confirmation bias and social media algorithms br Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it For example a BuzzFeed News analysis found that the top fake news stories about the U S presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than top stories from major media outlets It also particularly has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage The term has at times been used to cast doubt upon credible news and former U S president Donald Trump has been credited with popularizing the term by using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself It has been increasingly criticized due in part to Trump s misuse with the British government deciding to avoid the term as it is poorly defined and conflates a variety of false information from genuine error through to foreign interference br Multiple strategies for fighting fake news are actively researched for various types of fake news Politicians in certain autocratic and democratic countries have demanded effective self regulation and legally enforced regulation in varying forms of social media and web search engines br On an individual scale the ability to actively confront false narratives as well as taking care when sharing information can reduce the prevalence of falsified information However it has been noted that this is vulnerable to the effects of confirmation bias motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases that can seriously distort reasoning particularly in dysfunctional and polarised societies Inoculation theory has been proposed as a method to render individuals resistant to undesirable narratives Because new misinformation emerges frequently researchers have stated that one solution to address this is to inoculate the population against accepting fake news in general a process termed prebunking instead of continually debunking the same repeated lies br br br Defining fake news br Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news The term as it developed in is a neologism a new or re purposed expression that is entering the language driven by culture or technology changes Fake news is now used by many people as a catch all referring to any lies and misrepresentations from a news distributor or not further a few people use the term to condemn creditable news sources they do not like without otherwise arguing details br Fake news stories in the old sense plus misleading headlines are presented among other stories by news aggregators or political sites for financial or political gain There are also fake news websites which run only stories that have no basis in fact but are presented as being factually accurate Some satirical sites openly label themselves as fake news or satire or they may reveal that they are fake only on closer inspection for clues br Overlapping terms are bullshit hoax news pseudo news alternative facts false news and junk news br The National Endowment for Democracy defines fake news as M isleading content found on the internet especially on social media Much of this content is produced by for profit websites and Facebook pages gaming the platform for advertising revenue and distinguishes it from disinformation F ake news does not meet the definition of disinformation or propaganda Its motives are usually financial not political and it is usually not tied to a larger agenda br Media scholar Nolan Higdon has defined fake news as false or misleading content presented as news and communicated in formats spanning spoken written printed electronic and digital communication Higdon has also argued that the definition of fake news has been applied too narrowly to select mediums and political ideologies br While most definitions focus strictly on content accuracy and format current research indicates that the rhetorical structure of the content might play a significant role in the perception of fake news br Michael Radutzky a producer of CBS Minutes said his show considers fake news to be stories that are probably false have enormous traction popular appeal in the culture and are consumed by millions of people These stories are not only found in politics but also in areas like vaccination stock values and nutrition He did not include news that is invoked by politicians against the media for stories that they don t like or for comments that they don t like as fake news Guy Campanile also a Minutes producer said What we are talking about are stories that are fabricated out of thin air By most measures deliberately and by any definition that s a lie br The intent and purpose of fake news is important In some cases fake news may be news satire which uses exaggeration and introduces non factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point rather than to deceive Propaganda can also be fake news br In the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the s fake news generated considerable controversy and argument with some commentators defining concern over it as moral panic or mass hysteria and others worried about damage done to public trust It particularly has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage generally The term has also been used to cast doubt upon credible mainstream media br In January the United Kingdom House of Commons commenced a parliamentary inquiry into the growing phenomenon of fake news br In PolitiFact selected fake news as their Lie of the Year No single lie stood out so the generic term was chosen Also in Oxford Dictionaries selected post truth as its word of the year and defined it as the state of affairs when objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief br br br Roots br br The term fake news gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America It is determined by fraudulent content in news format and its velocity According to Bounegru Gray Venturini and Mauri a lie becomes fake news when it is picked up by dozens of other blogs retransmitted by hundreds of websites cross posted over thousands of social media accounts and read by hundreds of thousands br The evolving nature of online business models encourages the production of information that is click worthy and independent of its accuracy br The nature of trust depends on the assumptions that non institutional forms of communication are freer from power and more able to report information that mainstream media are perceived as unable or unwilling to reveal Declines in confidence in much traditional media and expert knowledge have created fertile grounds for alternative and often obscure sources of information to appear as authoritative and credible This ultimately leaves users confused about basic facts br br br Popularity and viral spread br Fake news has become popular with various media outlets and platforms Researchers at Pew Research Center discovered that over of Americans access news through social media compared to traditional newspaper and magazines With the popularity of social media individuals can easily access fake news and disinformation The rapid spread of false stories on social media during the elections in Italy has been documented as has diffusion of false stories on Facebook during the US election campaign br Fake news has the tendency to become viral among the public With the presence of social media platforms like Twitter it becomes easier for false information to diffuse quickly Research has found that false political information tends to spread three times faster than other false news On Twitter false tweets have a much higher chance of being retweeted than truthful tweets More so it is humans who are responsible for disseminating false news and information as opposed to bots and click farms The tendency for humans to spread false information has to do with human behavior according to research humans are attracted to events and information that are surprising and new and as a result cause high arousal in the brain Besides motivated reasoning was found to play a role in the spread of fake news This ultimately leads humans to retweet or share false information which are usually characterized with clickbait and eye catching titles This prevents people from stopping to verify the information As a result massive online communities form around a piece of false news without any prior fact checking or verification of the veracity of the information br Of particular concern regarding viral spread of fake news is the role of super spreaders Brian Stelter the anchor of Reliable Sources at CNN has documented the systematic long term two way feedback that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News presenters The resultant conditioning of outrage in their large audience against government and the mainstream media has proved a highly successful money spinner for the TV network br br br Its damaging effects br In the inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners Lee claimed that fake news was one of the three most significant new disturbing Internet trends that must first be resolved if the Internet is to be capable of truly serving humanity The other two new disturbing trends were the recent surge in the use of the Internet by governments for citizen surveillance purposes and for cyberwarfare purposes br Author Terry Pratchett previously a journalist and press officer was among the first to be concerned about the spread of fake news on the Internet In a interview with Bill Gates founder of Microsoft he said Let s say I call myself the Institute for Something or other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the Second World War and the Holocaust didn t happen and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone peer review and so on There s a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net It s all there there s no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up Gates was optimistic and disagreed saying that authorities on the Internet would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print But it was Pratchett who more accurately predicted how the Internet would propagate and legitimize fake news br When the Internet first became accessible for public use in the s its main purpose was for the seeking and accessing of information As fake news was introduced to the Internet this made it difficult for some people to find truthful information The impact of fake news has become a worldwide phenomenon Fake news is often spread through the use of fake news websites which in order to gain credibility specialize in creating attention grabbing news which often impersonate well known news sources Jestin Coler who said he does it for fun has indicated that he earned US per month from advertising on his fake news websites br Research has shown that fake news hurts social media and online based outlets far worse than traditional print and TV outlets After a survey was conducted it was found that of people had less trust in social media news stories as opposed to of people in mainstream media after learning about fake news In Christine Michel Carter a writer who has reported on Generation Alpha for Forbes stated that one third of the generation can decipher false or misleading information in the media br br br Types of fake news br Claire Wardle of First Draft News has identified seven types of fake news br br satire or parody no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool br false connection when headlines visuals or captions don t support the content br misleading content misleading use of information to frame an issue or an individual br false context when genuine content is shared with false contextual information br impostor content when genuine sources are impersonated with false made up sources br manipulated content when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive as with a doctored photo br fabricated content new content is false designed to deceive and do harm br Scientific denialism is another potential explanatory type of fake news defined as the act of producing false or misleading facts to unconsciously support strong pre existing beliefs br br br Criticism of the term br In Wardle announced she has now rejected the phrase fake news and censors it in conversation finding it woefully inadequate to describe the issues She now speaks of information disorder and information pollution and distinguishes between three overarching types of information content problems br br Mis information misinformation false information disseminated without harmful intent br Dis information disinformation false information created and shared by people with harmful intent br Mal information malinformation the sharing of genuine information with the intent to cause harm br Disinformation attacks are the most insidious type because of the harmful intent For example it is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors particularly during elections br Because of the manner in which former president Donald Trump has co opted the term The Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan has warned fellow journalists that It s time to retire the tainted term fake news Though the term hasn t been around long its meaning already is lost By late the term fake news had become verboten and U S journalists including the Poynter Institute were asking for apologies and for product retirements from companies using the term br In October the British government decided that the term fake news will no longer be used in official documents because it is a poorly defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes This followed a recommendation by the House of Commons Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee to avoid the term br However recent reviews of fake news still regard it as a useful broad construct equivalent in meaning to fabricated news as separate from related types of problematic news content such as hyperpartisan news the latter being a particular source of political polarization Therefore researchers are beginning to favour information disorder as a more neutral and informative term For example the Commission of Inquiry by the Aspen Institute has adopted the term Information Disorder in its investigative report br br br Identification br br According to an academic library guide a number of specific aspects of fake news may help to identify it and thus avoid being unduly influenced These include clickbait propaganda satire parody sloppy journalism misleading headings manipulation rumor mill misinformation media bias audience bias and content farms br The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions IFLA published a summary in diagram form pictured at right to assist people in recognizing fake news Its main points are br br Consider the source to understand its mission and purpose br Read beyond the headline to understand the whole story br Check the authors to see if they are real and credible br Assess the supporting sources to ensure they support the claims br Check the date of publication to see if the story is relevant and up to date br Ask if it is a joke to determine if it is meant to be satire br Review your own biases to see if they are affecting your judgment br Ask experts to get confirmation from independent people with knowledge br The International Fact Checking Network IFCN launched by the Poynter Institute in supports international collaborative efforts in fact checking provides training and has published a code of principles In it introduced an application and vetting process for journalistic organisations One of IFCN s verified signatories the independent not for profit media journal The Conversation created a short animation explaining its fact checking process which involves extra checks and balances including blind peer review by a second academic expert additional scrutiny and editorial oversight br Beginning in the school year children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources Called media literacy the course provides training in journalism in the new information society br br br Online identification br Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years with over misleading articles and rumors spread regarding the United States presidential election alone These fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information either as clickbait or to serve a purpose Since they typically hope to intentionally promote incorrect information such articles are quite difficult to detect br When identifying a source of information one must look at many attributes including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements Specifically the language is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks br Furthermore modeling techniques such as n gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news source On top of that researchers have determined that visual based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate and provides more clarity on the news There is also many social context features that can play a role as well as the model of spreading the news Websites such as Snopes try to detect this information manually while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves br br br Tackling and suppression strategies br Considerable research is underway regarding strategies for confronting and suppressing fake news of all types in particular disinformation which is the deliberate spreading of false narratives for political purposes or for destabilising social cohesion in targeted communities Multiple strategies need to be tailored to individual types of fake news depending for example on whether the fake news is deliberately produced or rather unintentionally or unconsciously produced br Considerable resources are available to combat fake news Regular summaries of current events and research are available on the websites and email newsletters of a number of support organisations Particularly notable are the First Draft Archive the Information Futures Lab School of Public Health Brown University and the Nieman Foundation for Journalism Harvard University br Journalist Bernard Keane in his book on misinformation in Australia classifies strategies for dealing with fake news into three categories the liar the perpetrator of fake news the conduit the method of carriage of the fake news and the lied to the recipient of the fake news br br br Strategies regarding the perpetrator br br br Promotion of facts over emotions br American philosopher of science Lee McIntyre who has researched the scientific attitude and post truth has explained the importance of factual basis of society in preference to one in which emotions replace facts One modern example is the symbiotic relationship that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News in which the conspiracy beliefs of Fox hosts were repeated shortly after by Trump and vice versa in a continuous feedback loop This served to promote outrage and thus to condition and radicalise conservative Republican Fox listeners into cult like Trump supporters and to demonise and gaslight Democratic opponents the mainstream media and elites generally br A key strategy to counter fake news based on emotions rather than facts is to flood the information space particularly social media and web browser search results with factual news thus drowning out misinformation A key factor in establishing facts is the role of critical thinking the principles of which should be imbedded more comprehensively within all school and university education courses Critical thinking is a style of thinking in which citizens prior to subsequent problem solving and decision making have learned to pay attention to the content of written words and to judge their accuracy and fairness among other worthy attributes br br br Technique rebuttal br Because content rebuttal presenting true facts to refute false information does not always work Lee McIntyre suggests the better method of technique rebuttal in which faulty reasoning by deniers is exposed such as cherry picking data and relying too much on fake experts Deniers have a lot of information but a deficit of trust in mainstream sources McIntyre first builds trust by respectful exchange listening carefully to their explanation without interrupting Then he asks questions such as What evidence would make you change your mind and Why do you trust that source McIntyre has used his technique to talk to flat earthers though he admits it may not work with hard core deniers br br br Individual counteraction br Individuals should confront misinformation when spotted in online blogs even if briefly otherwise they fester and proliferate The person being responded to is probably resistant to change but many other bloggers may read and learn from an evidence based reply A brutal example was learned by John Kerry during the US Presidential election campaign against George W Bush The right wing Swift Boat Veterans for Truth falsely claimed that Kerry showed cowardice during the Vietnam War Kerry refused to dignify the claims with a response for two weeks despite being pummeled in the media and this action contributed to his marginal loss to Bush We should never assume any claim is too outrageous to be believed br However caution applies regarding over zealous debunking of fake news It is often unwise to draw attention to fake news published on a low impact website or blog one that has few followers If this fake news is debunked by a journalist in a high profile place such as The New York Times knowledge of the false claim spreads widely and more people overall will end up believing it ignoring or denying the debunk br br br Backfire effect br A widely reported paper by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Riefler in found that when persons with a firm belief are presented with corrective information their mistaken political beliefs were reinforced rather than reduced in two of their five studies The researchers called this a backfire effect However this finding was widely misreported as that corrective information was the sole cause of reinforced misinformation Later studies including by Nyhan and colleagues failed to support a backfire effect Instead Nyhan now accepts that the reinforced beliefs are largely controlled by cues from high profile elites and media that spread misinformation br br br Strategies regarding carriers br br br Regulation of social media br Internet companies with threatened credibility have developed new responses to limit fake news and reduce financial incentives for its proliferation br A valid criticism of social media companies is that users are presented with content that they will like based on previous viewing preferences An undesirable side effect is that confirmation bias is enhanced in users which in turn enhances the acceptance of fake news To reduce this bias effective self regulation and legally enforced regulation of social media notably Facebook and Twitter and web search engines notably Google need to become more effective and innovative br Financial disincentives to tackle fake news also apply to some mainstream media Brian Stelter the anchor of Reliable Sources at CNN has provided a substantial critique of the symbiotic but damaging relationship that developed between President Donald Trump and Fox News which has proved an extraordinarily successful money spinner for the Murdoch owned TV network despite it being a super spreader of fake news br br br General strategy br The general approach by these tech companies is the detection of problematic news via human fact checking and automated artificial intelligence machine learning natural language processing and network analysis Tech companies have utilized two basic counter strategies down ranking fake news and warning messages br In the first approach problematic content is down ranked by the search algorithm for example to the second or later pages on a Google search so that users are less likely to see it most users just scan the first page of search results However two problems arise One is that truth is not black and white and fact checkers often disagree on how to classify the content included in computer training sets running the risk of false positives and unjustified censorship Also fake news often evolves rapidly and therefore identifiers of misinformation may be ineffective in the future br The second approach involves attaching warnings to content that professional fact checkers have found to be false Much evidence indicates that corrections and warnings do produce reduced misperceptions and sharing Despite some early evidence that fact checking could backfire recent research has shown that these backfire effects are extremely uncommon But an important problem is that professional fact checking is not scalable it can take substantial time and effort to investigate each particular claim Thus many if not most false claims never get fact checked Also the process is slow and a warning may miss the period of peak viral spreading Further warnings are typically only attached to blatantly false news rather than to biased coverage of events that actually occurred br A third approach is to place more emphasis on reliable sources such as Wikipedia as well as mainstream media for example The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and science communication publications for example Scientific American and The Conversation However this approach has led to mixed results as hyperpartisan commentary and confirmation bias is found even in these sources the media has both news and opinion pages In addition some sections of the community completely reject scientific commentary br A fourth approach is to ban or specifically target so called super spreaders of fake news from social media br br br Fact checking br During the United States presidential election the creation and coverage of fake news increased substantially This resulted in a widespread response to combat the spread of fake news The volume and reluctance of fake news websites to respond to fact checking organizations has posed a problem to inhibiting the spread of fake news through fact checking alone In an effort to reduce the effects of fake news fact checking websites including Snopes com and FactCheck org have posted guides to spotting and avoiding fake news websites Social media sites and search engines such as Facebook and Google received criticism for facilitating the spread of fake news Both of these corporations have taken measures to explicitly prevent the spread of fake news critics however believe more action is needed br br br Facebook br After the American election and the run up to the German election Facebook began labeling and warning of inaccurate news and partnered with independent fact checkers to label inaccurate news warning readers before sharing it After a story is flagged as disputed it will be reviewed by the third party fact checkers Then if it has been proven to be a fake news story the post cannot be turned into an ad or promoted Artificial intelligence is one of the more recent technologies being developed in the United States and Europe to recognize and eliminate fake news through algorithms In Facebook targeted accounts related to the spread of misinformation regarding the French presidential election br In during the COVID pandemic Facebook found that troll farms from North Macedonia and the Philippines pushed coronavirus disinformation The publishers that used contents from these farms were banned from the platform br br br Google br In March Google launched Google News Initiative GNI to fight the spread of fake news It launched GNI under the belief that quality journalism and identifying truth online is crucial GNI has three goals to elevate and strengthen quality journalism evolve business models to drive sustainable growth and empower news organizations through technological innovation To achieve the first goal Google created the Disinfo Lab which combats the spread of fake news during crucial times such as elections or breaking news The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers Google created Subscribe with Google Additionally they have created a dashboard News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics Google will spend million through on these efforts among others to combat fake news br In November YouTube owned by Google suspended news outlet One America News Network OANN for a week for spreading misinformation on coronavirus The outlet has violated YouTube s policy multiple times A video that falsely promoted a guaranteed cure to the virus has been deleted from the channel br br br Legal and criminal sanctions in general br The use of anonymously hosted fake news websites has made it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel br Numerous countries have created laws in an attempt to regulate or prosecute harmful misinformation more generally than just with a focus on tech companies In numerous countries people have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID pandemic br Algerian lawmakers passed a law criminalising fake news deemed harmful to public order and state security The Turkish Interior Ministry has been arresting social media users whose posts were targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting the virus had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures Iran s military said people have been arrested for spreading rumors about COVID in the country In Cambodia some individuals who expressed concerns about the spread of COVID have been arrested on fake news charges The United Arab Emirates have introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the outbreak br br br Strategies regarding the recipient br br br Cognitive biases of recipient br The vast proliferation of online information such as in blogs and tweets has inundated the online marketplace Because of the resulting information overload humans cannot process all these information units called memes so confirmation bias and other cognitive biases decide which ones to pay attention to thus enhancing the spread of fake news Moreover these cognitive vulnerabilities are easily exploited by both computer algorithms that present information one may like based on previous social media use and by individual manipulators who create social media bots to deliberately spread disinformation br A recent study by Randy Stein and colleagues shows that conservatives value personal stories non scientific intuitive or experiential evidence more than do liberals progressives and therefore perhaps may be less swayed by scientific evidence This study however only tested responses to apolitical messages br br br Nudges as reflection prompts br People tend to react hastily and share fake news without thinking carefully about what they have read or heard and without checking or verifying the information Nudging people to consider the accuracy of incoming information has been shown to prompt people to think about it to improve the accuracy of their judgement and to reduce the likelihood that incorrect information is unreflectively shared An example of a technology based nudge is Twitter s read before you retweet prompt which prompts readers to read an article and consider its contents before retweeting it br br br Media critical thinking skills br Critical media literacy skills for both printed and digital media are essential for recipients to self evaluate the accuracy of the media content Media scholar Nolan Higdon argues that a critical media literacy education focused on teaching critical thinking about how to detect fake news is the most effective way for mitigating the pernicious influence of propaganda Higdon offers a ten step guide for detecting fake news br br br Mental immune health inoculation and prebunking br American philosopher Andy Norman in his book Mental Immunity argues for a new science of cognitive immunology as a practical guide to resisting bad ideas such as conspiracy theories as well as transcending petty tribalism He argues that reasoned argument the scientific method fact checking and critical thinking skills alone are insufficient to counter the broad scope of false information Overlooked is the power of confirmation bias motivated reasoning and other cognitive biases that can seriously distort the many facets of mental immunity public resilience to fake news particularly in dysfunctional societies br One problem identified by Susan A Nolan Ph D and Michael Kimball writing for Psychology today is that new misinformation including intentional disinformation is constantly emerging The pair cited research suggesting that this could be addressed by incoulating the population against misinformation rather than to continually having to debunk each new claim at a later tim explaining that this inoculation builds public resilience and creates the conditions for psychological herd immunity The general term for this process is prebunking defined as the process of debunking lies tactics or sources before they strike The research tey cited included studies of free online games shown to provide tools to fight fake news leading to healthy skepticism when consuming news As of Google implemented novel prebunking video adverts which have been shown to be effective in countering misinformation during trials in Eastern Europe br Most current research is based on inoculation theory a social psychological and communication theory that explains how an attitude or belief can be protected against persuasion or influence in much the same way a body can be protected against disease for example through pre exposure to weakened versions of a stronger future threat The theory uses inoculation as its explanatory analogy applied to attitudes or beliefs much like a vaccine is applied to an infectious disease It has great potential for building public resilience immunity against misinformation and fake news for example in tackling science denialism risky health behaviours and emotionally manipulative marketing and political messaging br For example John Cook and colleagues have shown that inoculation theory shows promise in countering climate change denialism This involves a two step process Firstly the or so most common myths about climate change are listed and deconstructed by identifying the reasoning errors and logical fallacies of each one Secondly the concept of parallel argumentation is used to explain the flaw in the argument by transplanting the same logic into a parallel situation often an extreme or absurd one Adding appropriate humour can be particularly effective br br br History br br br Ancient br br In the th century BC Rameses the Great spread lies and propaganda portraying the Battle of Kadesh as a stunning victory for the Egyptians he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples The treaty between the Egyptians and the Hittites however reveals that the battle was actually a stalemate br During the first century BC Octavian ran a campaign of misinformation against his rival Mark Antony portraying him as a drunkard a womanizer and a mere puppet of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII He published a document purporting to be Mark Antony s will which claimed that Mark Antony upon his death wished to be entombed in the mausoleum of the Ptolemaic pharaohs Although the document may have been forged it invoked outrage from the Roman populace Mark Antony ultimately killed himself after his defeat in the Battle of Actium upon hearing false rumors propagated by Cleopatra herself claiming that she had committed suicide br During the second and third centuries AD false rumors were spread about Christians claiming that they engaged in ritual cannibalism and incest In the late third century AD the Christian apologist Lactantius invented and exaggerated stories about pagans engaging in acts of immorality and cruelty while the anti Christian writer Porphyry invented similar stories about Christians br br br Medieval br In a fake news story in Trent claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two and a half year old Christian infant named Simonino The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured of them were burned at the stake Pope Sixtus IV himself attempted to stamp out the story however by that point it had already spread beyond anyone s control Stories of this kind were known as blood libel they claimed that Jews purposely killed Christians especially Christian children and used their blood for religious or ritual purposes br br br Early modern br After the invention of the printing press in publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow By the th century historians began the practice of citing their sources in footnotes In when Galileo went on trial the demand for verifiable news increased br During the th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands one man Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht was banned four times by Dutch authorities and four times he moved and restarted his press In the American colonies Benjamin Franklin wrote fake news about murderous scalping Indians working with King George III in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution br Canards the successors of the th century pasquinade were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries starting in the th century In Marie Antoinette was executed in part because of popular hatred engendered by a canard on which her face had been printed br During the era of slave owning in the United States supporters of slavery propagated fake news stories about African Americans whom white people considered to have lower status Violence occurred in reaction to the spread of some fake news events In one instance stories of African Americans spontaneously turning white spread through the south and struck fear into the hearts of many people br Rumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period despite the only major uprising occurring in the th century One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in The serving governor of Virginia at the time Governor William Gooch reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down although this never happened After Gooch discovered the falsehood he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished tortured and made prisoners br br br th century br br From to James Cheetham made use of fictional stories to advocate politically against Aaron Burr His stories were often defamatory and he was frequently sued for libel br One instance of fake news was the Great Moon Hoax of The Sun newspaper of New York published articles about a real life astronomer and a made up colleague who according to the hoax had observed bizarre life on the Moon The fictionalized articles successfully attracted new subscribers and the penny paper suffered very little backlash after it admitted the next month that the series had been a hoax Such stories were intended to entertain readers and not to mislead them br Yellow journalism peaked in the mid s characterizing the sensationalist journalism that arose in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer s New York World and William Randolph Hearst s New York Journal Pulitzer and other yellow journalism publishers goaded the United States into the Spanish American War which was precipitated when the USS Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana Cuba The term fake news itself was apparently first used in the s during this era of sensationalist news reporting br br br th century br Fake news became popular and spread quickly in the s Media like newspapers articles and magazines were in high demand because of technology Author Sarah Churchwell shows that when The New York Times reprinted the speech by Woodrow Wilson that popularized the phrase America First they also used the subheading Fake News Condemned to describe a section of his speech warning against propaganda and misinformation although Wilson himself had not used the phrase fake news In his speech Wilson warned of a growing problem with news that turn s out to be falsehood warning the country it could not afford to let the rumors of irresponsible persons and origins get into the United States as that would undermine democracy and the principle of a free and accurate press Following a claim by CNN that Trump was the first US President to deploy the term fake news against his opponents Sarah Churchwell s work was cited to claim that it was Woodrow Wilson who popularized the phrase fake news in without reference forcing her to counter this claim saying that the phrase fake news was very much NOT popularized or even used by Wilson The NY Times used it in passing but it didn t catch on Trump was the first to popularize it br br During the First World War an example of fake news was the anti German atrocity propaganda regarding an alleged German Corpse Factory in which the German battlefield dead were supposedly rendered down for fats used to make nitroglycerine candles lubricants human soap and boot dubbing Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the Allied press starting in and by the English language publication North China Daily News presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort this was based on new allegedly true stories from The Times and the Daily Mail that turned out to be forgeries These false allegations became known as such after the war and in the Second World War Joseph Goebbels used the story in order to deny the ongoing massacre of Jews as British propaganda According to Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin the story also encouraged later disbelief when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps br After Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in they established the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under the control of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels The Nazis used both print and broadcast journalism to promote their agendas either by obtaining ownership of those media or exerting political influence The expression big lie German gro e L ge was coined by Adolf Hitler when he dictated his book Mein Kampf Throughout World War II both the Axis and the Allies employed fake news in the form of propaganda to persuade the public at home and in enemy countries The British Political Warfare Executive used radio broadcasts and distributed leaflets to discourage German troops br The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace claimed that The New York Times printed fake news depicting Russia as a socialist paradise During The New York Times published numerous articles by its Moscow bureau chief Walter Duranty who won a Pulitzer prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union br br br st century br br In the st century both the impact of fake news and the use of the term became widespread br The increasing openness access and prevalence of the Internet resulted in its growth New

University found that Trump s supporters consumed the largest volume of junk news on Facebook and Twitter br br On Twitter a network of Trump supporters consumes the largest volume of junk news and junk news is the largest proportion of news links they share the researchers concluded On Facebook the skew was even greater There extreme hard right pages distinct from Republican pages share more junk news than all the other audiences put together br In researchers from Princeton University Dartmouth College and the University of Exeter examined the consumption of fake news during the U S presidential campaign Their findings showed that Trump supporters and older Americans over were far more likely to consume fake news than Clinton supporters Those most likely to visit fake news websites were the of Americans who consumed the most conservative information There was a very large difference in the consumption of fake news stories as related to total news consumption between Trump supporters and Clinton supporters br The study also showed that fake pro Trump and fake pro Clinton news stories were read by their supporters but with a significant difference Trump supporters consumed far more than Clinton supporters Facebook was by far the key gateway website where these fake stories were spread and which led people to then go to the fake news websites Fact checks of fake

News People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites full stop br br NBC NEWS It feels like there s a connection between having an active portion of a party that s prone to seeking false stories and conspiracies and a president who has famously spread conspiracies and false claims In many ways demographically and ideologically the president fits the profile of the fake news users that you re describing NYHAN It s worrisome if fake news websites further weaken the norm against false and misleading information in our politics which unfortunately has eroded But it s also important to put the content provided by fake news websites in perspective People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites full

someone else s likeness br Because a picture often has a greater impact than the corresponding words deepfakes which leverage powerful techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence to manipulate or generate visual and audio content have a particularly high potential to deceive The main machine learning methods used to create deepfakes are based on deep learning and involve training generative neural network architectures such as autoencoders or generative adversarial networks GANs br Deepfakes have garnered widespread attention for their uses in creating fake news notably political but also child sexual abuse material celebrity pornographic videos revenge porn hoaxes bullying and financial fraud This has elicited responses from both industry and government to detect and limit their use br Deepfakes generally require specialist software or knowledge but much the same effect can be achieved quickly by anyone using standard video editing software on most modern

through technology become progressively personalized In his book Being Digital he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences This prediction has since been reflected in modern day news and social media feeds br Bots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like without taking into account the authenticity of an article Bots mass produce and spread articles regardless of the credibility of the sources allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers recognition and authority Additionally almost of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots br In the st century the capacity to mislead was enhanced by the widespread use of social media For example one st century website that enabled fake news proliferation was the Facebook newsfeed In late fake news gained notoriety following the uptick in news content by this means and its prevalence on the micro blogging site Twitter In the United States of Americans use social media to receive news Many people use their Facebook News Feed to get news despite Facebook not being considered a news site According to Craig McClain over of Facebook users obtain news from the site This in combination with increased political polarization and filter bubbles led to a tendency for readers to mainly read headlines br Numerous individuals and news outlets have stated that fake news may have influenced the outcome of the American Presidential Election Fake news saw higher sharing on Facebook than legitimate news stories which analysts explained was because fake news often panders to expectations or is otherwise more exciting than legitimate news Facebook itself initially

stories they did not actually read but that were produced by the authors of the study In comparison over of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories br By August Facebook stopped using the term fake news and used false news in its place instead Will Oremus of Slate wrote that because supporters of U S President Donald Trump had redefined the word fake news to refer to mainstream media opposed to them it makes sense for Facebook and others to cede the term to the right wing trolls who have claimed it as their own br Research from Northwestern University concluded that of all fake news traffic as opposed to only of real news traffic could be linked back to Facebook The research concluded fake news consumers do not exist in a filter bubble many of them also consume real news from established news sources The fake news audience is only percent of the real news audience and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news

in the s though its meaning shifted in Whereas it once denoted provocation it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet Trolling comes in various forms and can be dissected into abuse trolling entertainment trolling classical trolling flame trolling anonymous trolling and kudos trolling It is closely linked to fake news as Internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike br When interacting with each other trolls often share misleading information that contributes to the fake news circulated on sites like Twitter and Facebook In the American election Russia paid over Internet trolls to circulate fake news and disinformation about Hillary Clinton they also created social media accounts that resembled voters in important swing states spreading influential political standpoints In February Glenn Greenwald

News Channel Horner later claimed that the intention was to make Trump s supporters look like idiots for sharing my stories br br In a November interview with The Washington Post Horner expressed regret for the role his fake news stories played in the election and surprise at how gullible people were in treating his stories as news In February Horner said I truly regret my comment that I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me I know all I did was attack him and his supporters and got people not to vote for him When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil man got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign maybe I had helped it My intention was to get his supporters NOT to vote for him and I know for a fact that I accomplished that goal The far right a lot of the Bible thumpers and alt right were going to vote him regardless but I know I swayed so many that were on the fence br In Horner stated that a fake story of his about a rape festival in India helped generate over in donations to GiveIndia a site that helps rape victims in India Horner said he dislikes being grouped with people who write fake news

at times been used to cast doubt upon credible news Throughout his campaign and presidency former U S president Donald Trump has misused the term numerous times using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself he personally dislikes rather than actual false news Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media which he calls the lying press regularly reports fake news or hoax news despite the fact that he generated considerable false and inaccurate or misleading statements himself According to The Washington Post s Fact Checker s database Trump made false or misleading claims during his four years in office though the number of unique false claims is much lower because many of his major false claims were repeated hundreds of times each A searchable online database is available for each documented false claim and a datafile is available for download for use in academic studies of misinformation and lying An analysis of the first false claims is available as a book br Trump has often attacked mainstream news reporting publications deeming them fake news and the enemy of the people Every few days Trump would issue a threat against the press due to his claims of fake news There have been many instances in which norms that protect press freedom have been pushed or even upended during the Trump era br According to Jeff Hemsley a Syracuse University professor who studies social media Trump uses this term for any news that is not favorable to him or which he simply dislikes Trump provided a widely cited example of this interpretation in a tweet on May br br Chris Cillizza described the tweet on CNN as an accidental revelation about Trump s fake news attacks and wrote The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump negative Fake To Trump those words mean the same thing Negative news coverage is fake news Fake news is negative news coverage Other writers made similar comments about the tweet Dara Lind wrote in Vox It s nice of Trump to admit explicitly what many skeptics have suspected all along When he complains about fake news he doesn t actually mean news that is untrue he means news that is personally inconvenient to Donald Trump Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine Trump admits he calls all negative news fake In a tweet this morning Trump casually opened a window into the source code for his method of identifying liberal media bias Anything that s negative is by definition fake Philip Bump wrote in The Washington Post The important thing in that tweet is that he makes explicit his view of what constitutes fake news It s negative news Negative Fake In an interview with Lesley Stahl before the cameras were turned on Trump explained why he attacks the press You know why I do it I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you br Author and literary critic Michiko Kakutani has described developments in the right wing media and websites br br In
