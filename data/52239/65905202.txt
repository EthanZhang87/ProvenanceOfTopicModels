id: 65905202
After Democratic nominee Joe Biden won the United States presidential election Republican nominee and then incumbent president Donald Trump pursued an unprecedented effort to overturn the election with support and assistance from his campaign proxies political allies and many of his supporters These efforts culminated in the January Capitol attack by Trump supporters which was widely described as an attempted coup d tat One week later Trump was impeached for incitement of insurrection but was acquitted by the Senate by a vote of votes short of the votes two thirds of the Senate required to convict him br Trump and his allies used the big lie propaganda technique to promote numerous false claims and conspiracy theories asserting that the election was stolen by means of rigged voting machines electoral fraud and an international communist conspiracy Trump pressed Department of Justice leaders to challenge the election results and publicly state the election was corrupt However the attorney general the director of National Intelligence and the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as some Trump campaign staff dismissed these claims State and federal judges election officials and state governors also determined that the claims were baseless br Trump loyalists including Trump s chief of staff Mark Meadows his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and several Republican lawmakers from the House Freedom Caucus attempted to keep Trump in power At the state level their tactics targeted state legislatures with the intent of changing the results or delaying the electoral vote certification at the Capitol At the national level they promoted the idea that Vice President Mike Pence could refuse to certify the election results on January Consequently hundreds of elected Republicans including members of Congress and governors have refused to acknowledge Biden s victory a few have since decided to acknowledge it br Trump s legal team sought a path to bring a case before the Supreme Court but none of the lawsuits they filed were successful They especially pinned their hopes on Texas v Pennsylvania but on December the Supreme Court declined to hear that case After that Trump reportedly considered multiple ways to remain in power including military intervention seizing voting machines and another appeal to the Supreme Court br In June the House Select Committee on the January Attack said it had enough evidence to recommend that the Department of Justice indict Trump and on December the committee formally made the criminal referral to the Justice Department On August Trump was indicted by a D C grand jury for conspiracy to defraud the United States obstructing an official proceeding conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and conspiracy against rights he pleaded not guilty to all four charges On August Trump and co defendants including lawyers Rudy Giuliani John Eastman Sidney Powell Jenna Ellis Jeffrey Clark and Kenneth Chesebro and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows were indicted in Fulton County Georgia for their efforts to overturn the election results in that state Ten leaders of the far right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups have been convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the Capitol attack br Trump continues to insist that the election was stolen telling a group of historians in mid that the election was rigged and lost and publicly stating in August that he should be declared the president or a new election should be held immediately As late as Trump supporters continued their attempts to overturn the election results pushing for state legislature resolutions and new lawsuits raising concerns among legal experts that public confidence in democracy is being undermined to lay the groundwork for baselessly challenging future elections br br br Background br br br Trump s accusations of electoral fraud br In the aftermath of the presidential election in which incumbent president Barack Obama won re election against Mitt Romney Trump tweeted that The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy that the election was a total sham and that the United States was not a democracy br br br Uncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in br br Trump repeatedly suggested that the election is rigged against him and in the final debate he cast doubt on whether he would accept the results of the election should he lose saying I ll keep you in suspense His comment touched off a media and political uproar in which he was accused of threatening to upend a fundamental pillar of American democracy and rais ing the prospect that millions of his supporters may not accept the results on Nov if he loses Rick Hasen of University of California Irvine School of Law an election law expert described Trump s comments as appalling and unprecedented and feared there could be violence in the streets from his supporters if Trump loses The next day Trump said Of course I would accept a clear election result but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result He also stated that he would totally accept the election results if I win br br br Uncertainty over Trump accepting an electoral loss in br br During the campaign Trump indicated in Twitter posts interviews and speeches that he might refuse to recognize the outcome of the election if he were defeated Trump falsely suggested that the election would be rigged against him In July Trump declined to state whether he would accept the results telling Fox News anchor Chris Wallace that I have to see No I m not going to just say yes I m not going to say no Trump also proposed delaying the presidential election due to COVID until Americans could vote properly securely and safely br Trump repeatedly claimed that the only way he could lose would be if the election was rigged and repeatedly refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power after the election Trump also criticized mail in voting throughout the campaign falsely claiming that the practice contained high rates of fraud At one point Trump said We ll see what happens Get rid of the ballots and you ll have a very peaceful there won t be a transfer frankly There will be a continuation Trump s statements have been described as a threat to upend the constitutional order In September Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI Director Christopher A Wray a Trump appointee testified under oath that the FBI has not seen historically any kind of coordinated national voter fraud effort in a major election whether it s by mail or otherwise br A number of congressional Republicans insisted that they were committed to an orderly and peaceful transition of power but they declined to criticize Trump for his comments On September the Senate unanimously passed a resolution affirming the Senate s commitment to a peaceful transfer of power however on October Republican senator Mike Lee tweeted We re not a democracy and Democracy isn t the objective liberty peace and prospefity sic are We want the human condition to flourish Rank democracy can thwart that Trump also stated that he expected the U S Supreme Court to decide the election and that he wanted a conservative majority in the event of an election dispute reiterating his commitment to quickly install a ninth justice following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg br br br Refusal to accept electoral loss br br In the months between the election and Inauguration Day January Trump engaged in multiple efforts to overturn the results He filed numerous lawsuits urged local and state authorities to overturn the results in their jurisdiction pressed the Justice Department to verify unsupported claims of election fraud and worked with congressional allies to get the results overturned in Congress on January br At am on Wednesday November with the election result still in doubt Trump held a press conference at the White House in which he stated This is a fraud on the American public This is an embarrassment to our country We were getting ready to win this election Frankly we did win this election After all major news organizations declared Biden the President elect on November Trump refused to accept his loss declaring this election is far from over and alleging election fraud without providing evidence Privately according to reporting by Maggie Haberman he told one aide I m just not going to leave and he told another aide We re never leaving How can you leave when you won an election br He indicated that he would continue legal challenges in key states but all of the challenges were dismissed by the courts His legal team led by Rudy Giuliani made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international communist conspiracy rigged voting machines and polling place fraud to claim that the election had been stolen from Trump Trump blocked government officials from cooperating in the presidential transition to Joe Biden Attorney General William Barr authorized the Justice Department to initiate investigations if there are clear and apparently credible allegations of irregularities that if true could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election in an individual state br Trump and his allies encouraged state officials to throw out legally cast ballots challenge vote certification processes and overturn certified election results In an early January phone call he pressed the Georgia secretary of state to find the votes needed to secure his victory in the state He repeatedly urged Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to convene a special session of the legislature to overturn Biden s certified victory in the state and he made a similar plea to the Pennsylvania Speaker of the House On a conference call he asked Republican state legislators to seek ways to reverse certified election results in their states Republican officials in seven states directed by Trump s personal attorney created fraudulent electoral certificates of ascertainment to falsely assert Trump had been reelected br By December multiple Republican members of the House and Senate indicated they would try to force both chambers to debate whether to certify the Electoral College results Mike Pence who as vice president would preside over the proceedings signaled his endorsement of the effort stating on January I promise you come this Wednesday we will have our day in Congress Additionally Trump and some supporters promoted a false Pence card theory that even if Congress were to certify the results the vice president had the authority to reject them br Since leaving office Trump has continued to insist that he really won the election He reportedly dislikes the term former president and his official statements refer to him as the th President or simply as as on his new website www office com During his public speeches he insists that massive election fraud caused his loss saying This was the scam of the century and this was the crime of the century and We won the election twice and and it s possible we ll have to win it a third time br In a September interview with Kristen Welker for NBC s Meet the Press Trump said regarding the attorneys who told him he lost the election that he didn t respect them as lawyers but did respect others who told him he won He said that ultimately his effort to overturn the election results was my decision He maintained I say I won the election br br br Stop the Steal br br Stop the Steal is a far right and conservative campaign and protest movement in the United States promoting the conspiracy theory that falsely posits that widespread electoral fraud occurred during the presidential election to deny incumbent president Donald Trump victory over former vice president Joe Biden Trump and his supporters have asserted without evidence that he is the winner of the election and that large scale voter and vote counting fraud took place in several swing states The Associated Press ABC News CBS News CNN Decision Desk HQ NBC News The New York Times and Fox News projected Biden as the president elect having surpassed the Electoral College votes needed to claim victory A New York Times survey of state election officials found no evidence of significant voting fraud nor did the Justice Department and dozens of lawsuits filed by Trump and his proxies to challenge voting results in several states failed br Stop the Steal was created by Republican political operative Roger Stone in in anticipation of potential future election losses that could be portrayed as stolen by alleged fraud A Facebook group with that name was created during the counting of votes by pro Trump group Women for America First co founder and Tea Party movement activist Amy Kremer Facebook removed the group on November describing it as organized around the delegitimization of the election process It was reported to have been adding new members every seconds with followers before Facebook shut it down Some Stop the Steal Facebook groups had discussed extreme violence incitement to violence and other threats CounterAction a social media analytics firm provided ProPublica and the Washington Post an audit of Facebook groups and posts which identified election delegitimization posts leading up to January On January Facebook announced that it would remove content containing the phrase stop the steal from Facebook and Instagram On January Twitter announced that it had suspended accounts that it said share harmful QAnon associated content at scale br br Several Stop the Steal groups were founded by right wing extremists after Trump published tweets on Twitter encouraging his supporters to Stop the Count Many unorganized Stop the Steal groups protested in various U S cities including Washington D C Detroit Michigan Lansing Michigan Las Vegas Nevada Madison Wisconsin Atlanta Georgia and Columbus Ohio Several of these protests included members of extremist groups such as Three Percenters Proud Boys and Oath Keepers which CNN reported was an illustration of the thinning of a line between the mainstream right and far right extremists br In Michigan on December Stop the Steal protestors gathered outside the private home of Michigan s Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to shout obscenities and chant threatening speech into bullhorns Biden s Michigan win by votes had been officially certified by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers in November br On December post election protests were held in Washington D C in which at least nine people were transported from the protest by D C Fire and emergency medical service workers for hospital treatment Among the injured were four people who suffered stab wounds and were said to be in critical condition Two police officers suffered non life threatening injuries and two others suffered minor injuries An additional people were arrested including one for assault with a dangerous weapon Earlier in the day large groups of protesters and counter protestors assembled outside the Supreme Court and Freedom Plaza br By March organizations linked to the Stop the Steal movement including the Proud Boys and the boogaloo movement had largely shifted their efforts to spreading misinformation about COVID vaccines as a way of undermining government credibility br On April the U S District Court of Minnesota charged self proclaimed Boogaloo Bois member Michael Paul Dahlager with illegal possession of a machine gun Dahlager had travelled to the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul for a December Stop the Steal rally where he scouted law enforcement positions and numbers Dahlager had discussed with confidential informants his willingness to kill law enforcement members and incite violent uprisings against the government Dahlager had allegedly planned to carry out an attack in early on the state s capitol building but abandoned it after he believed that informants were among his inner circle Dahlager pleaded guilty to federal weapons charges in July br In the days after the election Ginni Thomas wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas exchanged text messages with Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows urging him to pursue efforts to overturn the election Thomas asserted The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History and recited a message circulating in right wing media that the Biden crime family ballot fraud co conspirators were being arrested to face military tribunals for sedition at Guantanamo Bay detention camp Thomas wrote Do not concede It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back In March Thomas acknowledged she had attended the January Stop the Steal rally but there was no evidence she had been involved in its organization br br br Conspiracy theories br Multiple conspiracy theories were promoted such as the claim that billionaire liberal donor George Soros stole the election Another is Italygate a QAnon adjacent theory originating from a fake news website which claimed that the election was rigged in Biden s favor by the U S Embassy in Rome using satellites and military technology to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden There is no evidence to support this Republican congressman Scott Perry texted White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows a link to a YouTube video making the allegation The New York Times later reported that during Trump s last weeks in office Meadows emailed the video to the Department of Justice seeking an investigation br These conspiracy theories had multiple origins They were promoted by Trump and other individuals and were heavily pushed and expanded on by far right news organizations such as One America News Network OANN Newsmax and The Gateway Pundit as well as by Sean Hannity and some other Fox News commentators RT a Russian state media outlet also promoted the Trump campaign s false claims of electoral fraud Attempts by Facebook and other mainstream social networks to restrict groups that spread false election claims led to a surge in the popularity of Parler a right leaning alternative social networking site that has attracted supporters of Stop the Steal Parler subsequently went offline after Amazon Web Services withdrew support for the app on January br As of June Trump continued to echo the conspiracy theory that the election was stolen particularly focusing on the efforts of Arizona Senate Republicans to audit the results of the election in Maricopa County and on a lawsuit disputing the results of the election in Georgia The efforts of Arizona Republicans to audit the results have drawn the attention and support of some Republican politicians including Marjorie Taylor Greene Matt Gaetz and the former president Trump had reportedly told associates he could be reinstated as president by August however there is no constitutional mechanism to reinstate a president after the results of an election have been certified by Congress However several Trump allies denied reports that Trump would be reinstated as president in August including Lara Trump Jenna Ellis Jason Miller Corey Lewandowski and Marjorie Taylor Greene br The Gateway Pundit published an August article reporting analysis conducted by Seth Keshel a former Army intelligence officer purporting to prove election fraud and that Trump actually won seven states carried by Biden The analysis was false Keshel was among a group of military intelligence veterans including former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn who played central roles in spreading false information about the election br br br November br On at least one occasion in November Trump privately acknowledged that he lost the election Alyssa Farah Griffin a White House aide to Trump recalls him exclaiming Can you believe I lost to this guy while watching Biden on television This however was not Trump s public position br On November Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs called the election the most secure in American history leading Trump to fire him and Trump attorney Joseph diGenova to call for his execution br Emily Murphy the administrator of the General Services Administration delayed the start of the presidential transition until sixteen days after most media outlets had projected Biden to be the winner br br br Fake electors br br On November Gregory Jacob wrote to Marc Short that it would be undesirable for the public to perceive Vice President Pence as if he had prejudged questions concerning disputed electoral votes br On November White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows received a text message calling for an aggressive strategy of having the Republican led legislatures of three uncalled states just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the Supreme Court This was reportedly sent by Trump s secretary of energy Rick Perry br On November Donald Trump Jr sent a text message to Meadows outlining paths to subvert the Electoral College process and ensure his father a second term Excerpts from the message are br br It s very simple We have multiple paths We control them all We have operational control Total leverage Moral high ground POTUS must start second term now Republicans control states Democrats states Once again Trump wins We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress January br Biden had not yet been declared the winner at the time of the text Trump Jr testified to the House select committee on May that he had not written the message and did not recall who had but that the idea had sounded plausible and was the most sophisticated plan he d heard although it concerned things I don t necessarily you know know too much about br On November Ginni Thomas wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas emailed Arizona lawmakers including Russell Bowers and Shawnna Bolick encouraging them to pick a clean slate of Electors and telling them that the responsibility was yours and yours alone br On November James R Troupis a lawyer for the Trump campaign in Wisconsin received a memo from Boston attorney Kenneth Chesebro outlining a plan to create and submit alternate slates of electors in contested states br Another memo three weeks later went to Wisconsin and several other contested states The memos are evidence that within weeks of the election the Trump campaign was focusing on January as the hard deadline for determining the outcome of the election br The White House Counsel s Office reportedly reviewed the plans to use alternate electors and deemed them not to be legally sound br br br Lame duck firings and hirings br After vote counts showed a Biden victory Trump engaged in what has been called a post election purge firing or forcing out at least a dozen officials and replacing them with loyalists Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was fired by tweet on November Undersecretary for Defense Joseph D Kernan and Acting Undersecretary for Policy James H Anderson resigned in protest or were forced out The White House sought to learn the names of political appointees who had applauded Anderson upon his departure so they could be fired The DOD chief of staff Jen Stewart was replaced by a former staffer to Representative Devin Nunes On November Christopher P Maier the head of the Pentagon s Defeat ISIS Task Force was ousted and the task force was disbanded a White House official told him that the United States had won the war against the Islamic State so the task force was no longer needed br Trump s allegations of election fraud in battleground states were refuted by judges state election officials and his own administration s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA After CISA director Chris Krebs contradicted Trump s voting fraud allegations Trump fired him on November Three other Department of Homeland Security officials Matthew Travis CISA s deputy director Bryan Ware CISA s assistant director for cybersecurity and Valerie Boyd the DHS s assistant secretary of international affairs were also forced out br Bonnie Glick the deputy administrator of the United States Agency for International Development was abruptly fired on November she had prepared a transition manual for the next administration She was due to become acting administrator of the department on November Firing her left the position of acting administrator vacant so that Trump loyalist John Barsa could become acting deputy administrator br Career climate scientist Michael Kuperberg who for the past five years has produced the annual National Climate Assessment issued by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA was demoted on November and returned to his previous position at the Department of Energy Several media outlets reported that David Legates a deputy assistant secretary at NOAA who claims that global warming is harmless would be appointed to oversee the congressionally mandated report in place of Kuperberg based on information obtained from people close to the Administration including Myron Ebell the head of President Trump s Environmental Protection Agency transition team and director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute As of May the Biden administration reappointed Kuperberg as executive director of the U S Global Change Research Program br On November Neil Chatterjee was removed from his post as chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission br On November Lisa Gordon Hagerty resigned from her posts as Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security and administrator of the quasi independent National Nuclear Security Administration reportedly due to longstanding tensions and disagreements with Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette br In October Trump signed an executive order that created a new category of federal employee Schedule F which included all career civil servants whose job includes policymaking Such employees would no longer be covered by civil service protections against arbitrary dismissal but would be subject to the same rules as political appointees The new description could be applied to thousands of nonpartisan experts such as scientists who give advice to the political appointees who run their departments Heads of all federal agencies were ordered to report by January a list of positions that could be reclassified as Schedule F The Office of Management and Budget submitted a list in November that included percent of the office s workforce Federal employee organizations and Congressional Democrats sought to overturn the order via lawsuits or bills House Democrats warned in a letter that The executive order could precipitate a mass exodus from the federal government at the end of every presidential administration leaving federal agencies without deep institutional knowledge expertise experience and the ability to develop and implement long term policy strategies Observers predicted that Trump could use the new rule to implement a massive government purge on his way out the door br Meanwhile administration officials had ordered the Budget Office to begin work on a budget proposal that they would submit to Congress in February ignoring the fact that Biden would have already taken over by that point br br br Lawsuits br br After the United States presidential election the campaign for incumbent president Donald Trump filed a number of lawsuits contesting election processes vote counting and the vote certification process in multiple states including Arizona Georgia Michigan Nevada Pennsylvania Texas and Wisconsin Many such cases were quickly dismissed and lawyers and other observers noted that the lawsuits were unlikely to have an effect on the outcome of the election By November more than two dozen of the legal challenges filed since Election Day had failed br On November U S District Court in Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann a Republican dismissed the case before him with prejudice ruling br br In this action the Trump Campaign and the Individual Plaintiffs seek to discard millions of votes legally cast by Pennsylvanians from all corners from Greene County to Pike County and everywhere in between In other words Plaintiffs ask this Court to disenfranchise almost seven million voters This Court has been unable to find any case in which a plaintiff has sought such a drastic remedy in the contest of an election in terms of the sheer volume of votes asked to be invalidated One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption such that this Court would have no option but to regrettably grant the proposed injunctive relief despite the impact it would have on such a large group of citizens That has not happened Instead this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence In the United States of America this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state Our people laws and institutions demand more br br br Michigan officials pressured to not certify br Prior to November the four member board of canvassers of Wayne County Michigan was deadlocked on election result certification along party lines with the two Republican members refusing to certify but on November the board voted unanimously to certify its results Trump and Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel called the two Republican members of the board that day to pressure them to not sign the official statement of votes the next day the two Republicans sought but failed to rescind their votes for certification signing affidavits stating that they had voted for certification only because the two Democratic members had promised a full audit of the county s votes The two denied Trump s call had influenced their reversal A recording of the phone call surfaced in December on which McDaniel can be heard telling the two Republicans We will get you attorneys to which Trump added We ll take care of that Trump can also be heard to say We ve got to fight for our country We can t let these people take our country away from us br Trump issued an invitation to Michigan lawmakers to travel to Washington Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield State Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and State Representative Jim Lilly were photographed in the lobby of the D C Trump Tower where they were drinking a bottle champagne and were not wearing masks After the meeting Chatfield and Shirkey released a joint statement indicating that they would follow the law and would not attempt to have the legislature intervene in selecting electoral votes Chatfield later floated the possibility of a constitutional crisis in Michigan while Shirkey suggested that certification be delayed however neither took any concrete action to invalidate Biden s victory On November Ronna McDaniel and Michigan Republican Party Chair Laura Cox publicly called upon the Michigan State Board of Canvassers to not proceed with the planned certification of election results On November the State Board of Canvassers certified the election br br br Attempt to seize voting machines in Michigan br br Starting in November the Trump campaign attempted to get local law enforcement agencies to seize voting machines for the Trump operation to review In one Michigan county Trump advisors including Rudy Giuliani phoned the county prosecutor on or about November They asked him to obtain the county s voting machines and turn them over to the Trump team He refused but a judge later ordered the machines to be made available to Trump representatives They later produced a forensic report claiming evidence of fraud election experts have said the conclusion was false and the report critically flawed br At least one person was indicted for trying to illegally access voting machines after the election br br br Georgia Secretary of State pressured to disqualify ballots br br The United States presidential election in Georgia produced an initial count wherein Biden defeated Trump by around votes triggering an automatic recount due to the small margin On November while the recount was ongoing Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina privately called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to discuss Georgia s vote counting Raffensperger a Republican told The Washington Post that Graham had asked whether Raffensperger could disqualify all mail in ballots in counties that had more signature errors Gabriel Sterling a Republican election official and staffer to Raffensperger was present for the call and Sterling confirmed that Graham had asked that question br Raffensperger viewed Graham s question as a suggestion to throw out legally cast ballots although Graham denied suggesting that Graham acknowledged calling Raffensperger to find out how to protect the integrity of mail in voting and how does signature verification work but declared that if Raffensperger feels threatened by that conversation he s got a problem Graham stated that he was investigating in his own capacity as a senator although he is the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee Graham also claimed that he had spoken to the Secretaries of State in Arizona and Nevada The Secretaries however denied this and Graham then contradicted himself stating that he had talked to the Governor of Arizona but no official in Nevada br br br Wisconsin recount obstruction br br On November Andrew Iverson head of Trump s Wisconsin campaign told other campaign operatives in a strategy session Here s the deal Comms is going to continue to fan the flame and get the word out about Democrats trying to steal this election We ll do whatever they need Just be on standby if there s any stunts we need to pull br The Trump campaign requested a recount in Milwaukee and Dane counties both Democratic strongholds On November Wisconsin election officials reported that Trump campaign observers were attempting to obstruct the recount According to officials observers were constantly interrupting vote counters with questions and comments At one table a Republican representative was objecting to every ballot that was pulled for recount At other tables there were two Republican observers when only one was allowed it was also reported that some Republicans had been posing as independents Completed by November the recounts ended up increasing Biden s lead by votes br br br Partisan hearings with Republican legislatures br On November one day after Pennsylvania certified its election results a Republican state senator requested a hearing of the State Senate Majority Policy Committee to discuss election issues The event described as an informational meeting was held at a hotel in Gettysburg and featured Rudy Giuliani asserting that the election had been subject to massive fraud Trump also spoke to the group by speakerphone repeating his false claim that he had actually won in Pennsylvania and other swing states and saying We have to turn the election over br In Arizona a state won by Biden Republican members of the Arizona Senate promoted Trump s false claims of election fraud In mid December Eddie Farnsworth Chairman of the State Senate Judiciary Committee claimed that tampering or fraud might have marred the election despite the testimony given by election officials attorneys and the Arizona Attorney General Election Integrity Unit at a six hour hearing all of whom testified that there was no evidence for such claims Hearings held in the Michigan Legislature similarly presented no evidence of any fraud or other wrongdoing br br br Conspiracy allegations br Days before the presidential election Dennis Montgomery a software designer with a history of making dubious claims asserted that a program called Scorecard running on a government supercomputer called Hammer would be used to switch votes from Trump to Biden on voting machines Trump legal team attorney Sidney Powell promoted the conspiracy theory on Lou Dobbs Tonight on November and again two days later on Maria Bartiromo s Fox Business program claiming to have evidence that that is exactly what happened She also asserted that the CIA ignored warnings about the software and urged Trump to fire director Gina Haspel Christopher Krebs director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA characterized the supercomputer claim as nonsense and a hoax CISA described the election as the most secure in American history with no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes changed votes or was in any way compromised A few days later Trump fired Krebs by tweet claiming that Krebs analysis was highly inaccurate br On November the Trump campaign s deputy director of communications Zach Parkinson asked his staff to review the claims regarding the voting machines the staff concluded these claims were baseless br During a November press conference Powell alleged without evidence that an international Communist plot had been engineered by Venezuela Cuba China Hugo Ch vez who died in George Soros the Clinton Foundation and antifa to rig the elections She also alleged that Dominion Voting Systems can set and run an algorithm that probably ran all over the country to take a certain percentage of votes from President Trump and flip them to President Biden The source for many of these claims appeared to be the far right news organization One America News Network OANN She also repeated a conspiracy theory spread by Texan Congressman Louie Gohmert OANN and others that accurate voting results had been transmitted to the German office of the Spanish electronic voting firm Scytl where they were tabulated to reveal a landslide victory for Trump nationwide which included implausible Trump victories in Democratic strongholds such as California Colorado Maine statewide Minnesota and New Mexico after which a company server was supposedly seized in a raid by the United States Army The U S Army and Scytl refuted those claims Scytl has not had any offices in Germany since September and it does not tabulate any U S votes In a March report the Justice and Homeland Security Departments flatly rejected accusations of voting fraud conducted by foreign nations Rudy Giuliani also spoke at this press conference In a private text message Rupert Murdoch described the Powell Giuliani presentation as really crazy stuff and damaging br In a subsequent interview with Newsmax on November Powell accused Georgia s Republican governor Brian Kemp of being in on the Dominion scam and suggested financial impropriety Powell additionally alleged that fraud had prevented Doug Collins from winning a top two position in the November nonpartisan blanket primary against incumbent Kelly Loeffler in the Senate race in Georgia She also claimed that the Democratic Party had used rigged Dominion machines to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primary and that Sanders had learned of this but had sold out She stated that she would blow up Georgia with a biblical court filing Powell suggested that candidates paid to have the system rigged to work for them On the basis of these claims Powell called for Republican controlled state legislatures in swing states to disregard the election results and appoint a slate of loyal electors who would vote to re elect Trump based on authority supposedly resting in Article Two of the Constitution The Washington Post reported that on December Trump asked Kemp to convene a special session of the Georgia legislature for that purpose but Kemp declined Trump also pressured Pennsylvania Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler to overturn the result and use electors loyal to Trump but Cutler declined saying that the legislature had no power to overturn the state s chosen slate of electors br Conservative television outlets amplified baseless allegations of voting machine fraud Fox News host Lou Dobbs had been outspoken during his program supporting the allegations but on December his program aired a video segment debunking the allegations although Dobbs himself did not comment Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro and Maria Bartiromo had also been outspoken in supporting the allegations and both their programs aired the same video segment debunking the allegations over the following two days br Smartmatic a company accused of conspiring with Dominion demanded a retraction from Fox News Smartmatic wanted corrections to be published on multiple occasions during prime time to match the attention and audience targeted with the original defamatory publications They also threatened legal action On February Smartmatic filed a lawsuit against Dobbs Bartiromo Pirro and Fox News itself as well as against Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell seeking billion in total damages br In December Dominion sent a similar letter to Sidney Powell demanding that she retract her allegations and retain all relevant records the Trump legal team later instructed dozens of staffers to preserve all documents for any future litigation The company filed billion defamation suits against Powell in January While fighting the lawsuit in March Powell s attorneys claimed that her speech was protected because she was sharing her opinion and that because she was serving as an attorney for the Trump campaign it was her role to make accusations against Dominion Dominion had complained that Powell s comments were wild outlandish and impossible Powell s attorneys seemed to concede that Powell had been obviously lying saying that reasonable people would not accept such statements as fact and therefore that she had not defamed Dominion br In internal Fox News communications several prominent network hosts and senior executives including chairman Rupert Murdoch and CEO Suzanne Scott discussed their knowledge that the election fraud allegations they were reporting were false The communications showed the network was concerned that not reporting the falsehoods would alienate viewers and cause them to switch to rival conservative networks impacting corporate profitability In a deposition in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit Murdoch said I would have liked us to be stronger in denouncing it the false allegations in hindsight The communications and deposition were reported in February br br br Threats of violence by Trump supporters br After Biden won the election angry Trump supporters threatened election officials election officials family members and elections staff in at least eight states via emails telephone calls and letters some of the menacing and vitriolic communications included death threats Officials terrorized by the threats included officials in the swing states of Wisconsin Pennsylvania Michigan Nevada and Arizona as well as a few less competitive states Some officials had to seek police protection or move from their homes due to the threats The director of the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research described the threats as frightening and said These threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti Semitism More than once they specifically refer to gun violence Prominent Republicans ignored or said little about the threats of violence br On November the Georgia Secretary of State reported that he and his wife were receiving death threats On November Trump attorney Joseph diGenova said the recently fired head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs should be taken out and shot for disputing the president s claims about election fraud On December Republican Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling publicly condemned Trump and Georgia Senators Perdue and Loeffler for making unsubstantiated claims and for failing to condemn the threats of violence against election workers including those made against a young low level Dominion employee and his family After Democratic Georgia State Senator Elena Parent spoke out against the false claims of voter fraud she was targeted by online vitriol threatened with death and sexual violence and had her home address widely circulated online Parent attributed the onslaught to Trump saying He has created a cult like following and is exposing people like me across the country to danger because of his unfounded rhetoric on the election br In early December an enemies list circulated on the web falsely accusing various government officials and voting systems executives of rigging the election providing their home addresses and superimposing red targets on their photos br The Arizona Republican Party twice tweeted that supporters should be willing to die for something or give my life for this fight Ann Jacobs chairwoman of the Wisconsin Elections Commission said she had received constant threats including a message mentioning her children and photos of her house had been posted on the web br On January Vice President Mike Pence asked a federal judge to dismiss a suit naming him as the defendant filed by Texas Republican congressman Louis Gohmert and others the ultimately unsuccessful suit asserted that the vice president had the sole constitutional authority to conduct the congressional certification of Electoral College results without restriction Attorney Lin Wood a conspiracy theorist and

silence the press and hold a new election under military supervision br br br Trump s attempt to pressure state officials br On December Trump placed a call to Georgia governor Brian Kemp in which he urged the governor to call a special session of the state legislature to override the election results and appoint electors who would support Trump He also called the Pennsylvania speaker of the house with similar objectives and had earlier invited Michigan Republican state officials to the White House to discuss election results in that state The Georgia and Pennsylvania contacts were made after Biden s victories had been certified in those states Biden s Michigan victory was certified three days after the Trump White House meeting br After Georgia had twice recounted and twice certified its results Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger received death threats He was pressured to resign by others in his party including the state s two senators On December Trump called the investigations chief in the Georgia Secretary of State s office who was then investigating allegations of mail ballot fraud and urged the official to find the fraud a misquote that was amended by The Washington Post in March to you would find things that are gonna be unbelievable the investigation ultimately concluded that the allegations had no merit Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued the state and three others asking the U S Supreme Court to invalidate the states voting results alleging that they had violated the Constitution citing a litany of complaints that had already been rejected by other courts Trump and seventeen Republican state attorneys general filed motions to support the case the merits of which were sharply criticized by legal experts and politicians The day the suit was filed Trump warned Georgia attorney general Chris Carr to not rally other Republican officials in opposition to the suit br On December Republican members of the Pennsylvania General Assembly signed a letter urging the state s congressional delegation to reject Biden s electoral votes Kim Ward the Republican majority leader of the Pennsylvania senate said that Trump had called her to say there had been fraud in the election but she had not seen the letter before it had been released She stated that Republican leaders were expected to support Trump s claims and if she had announced opposition to the letter I d get my house bombed tonight br On December after several lawsuits had been dismissed Trump tweeted This is going to escalate dramatically This is a very dangerous moment in our history The fact that our country is being stolen A coup is taking place in front of our eyes and the public can t take this anymore br br br Supreme Court petitions br br Before and after the election Trump said he expected the outcome would be decided by the Supreme Court where conservative justices held a majority with three of the justices having been appointed by Trump br On November a group of Republican legislators in Pennsylvania petitioned the U S Supreme Court in appeal of a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision against the legislators who had asked to nullify mailed ballots after they had been cast or to direct the legislature to select Pennsylvania s electors The high court denied the request in a one sentence unsigned order on December By the time of the high court s decision the Pennsylvania election results had been certified in Biden s favor Lawyers for Pennsylvania argued to the high court that the legislators request was an affront to constitutional democracy and that Petitioners ask this court to undertake one of the most dramatic disruptive invocations of judicial power in the history of the Republic no court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor s certification of presidential election results br On December Texas attorney general Ken Paxton sued the states of Georgia Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania where certified results showed Joe Biden had won alleging a variety of unconstitutional actions in their presidential balloting arguments that had already been rejected in other courts Paxton asked the U S Supreme Court to invalidate those states electoral votes allowing Trump to be declared the winner of a second presidential term This case Texas v Pennsylvania was hailed by Trump as the big one Seventeen Republican state attorneys general filed amicus briefs to support the case and Republican members of the House of Representatives signed onto it On December the Supreme Court said it would not hear the case In denying the plaintiff s motion to invalidate those votes it said that the state of Texas motion had lack of standing Ted Cruz who had previously argued nine cases before the Supreme Court agreed to Trump s request to argue the Paxton suit should it come before the Court br In late December attorneys Chesebro and Troupis asked the Supreme Court to review whether competing

members of Trump s legal team saying that U S Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was key and proposing that they frame things so that Thomas could be the one to issue an order to undermine Georgia s election results Trump lawyer John Eastman responded in agreement br br br Consideration of special counsel and martial law br After legal efforts by Trump and his proxies had failed in numerous state and federal courts including the Supreme Court some right wing activists and Trump allies including Michael Flynn Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood suggested that Trump could suspend the Constitution declare martial law and rerun the election Many retired military officers attorneys and other commentators expressed horror at such a notion Trump held an Oval Office meeting on December with Rudy Giuliani Chief of Staff Mark Meadows White House Counsel Pat Cipollone Powell and Flynn At the meeting Trump entertained the idea of naming Powell who has promoted election conspiracy theories and falsehoods as special counsel to investigate election matters though most advisors in attendance strongly opposed the idea Two executive orders were drafted to appoint a special counsel and confiscate voting machines which Trump falsely claimed were rigged against him One order called for the Pentagon to seize machines while the other tasked the Department of Homeland Security At Trump s direction Giuliani called Ken Cuccinelli the second in command at DHS on December to ask if the department could seize the machines but Cuccinelli said it did not have the authority On Giuliani s advice Trump had rejected a recommendation from Flynn and Powell to have the Pentagon seize the machines and Bill Barr flatly rejected the president s suggestion that the Justice Department do it Flynn reportedly discussed his idea to declare martial law although others also resisted that idea and Trump s opinion on the matter was unclear That same day Flynn appeared on Newsmax TV to suggest that Trump had the power to deploy the military to rerun the election in the swing states that Trump had lost Trump dismissed reports about a discussion of martial law as fake news but it remained unclear whether he had endorsed the notion br An attempt by Trump to invoke martial law to invalidate the results of the election would be illegal and unconstitutional In late December legal scholars Claire O Finkelstein and Richard Painter wrote that while it was very unlikely that Trump would actually attempt to spark a military coup Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A Rosen should be prepared to direct federal law enforcement to arrest anyone including if necessary the president who conspired to carry out this illegal plan Likening a hypothetical invocation of martial law to overturn the election to the firing on Fort Sumter Finkelstein and Painter wrote that any such plan would constitute seditious conspiracy and possibly other crimes and that any military officers or enlisted personnel ordered to assist in such a plan would be required under the Uniform Code of Military Justice to disregard such an illegal order br On December Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and General James McConville the Army chief of staff issued a joint statement saying There is no role for the US military in determining the outcome of an American election On January all ten living former secretaries of defense Ashton Carter Dick Cheney William Cohen Mark Esper Robert Gates Chuck Hagel James Mattis Leon Panetta William Perry and Donald Rumsfeld published an op ed in The Washington Post calling for the orderly and peaceful transfer of power noting that efforts to involve the US armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous unlawful and unconstitutional territory and noting that civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable including potentially facing criminal penalties for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic The former defense secretaries wrote that acting defense secretary Christopher C Miller and his subordinates political appointees officers and civil servants are each bound by oath law and precedent to facilitate the entry into office of the incoming administration and to do so wholeheartedly They must also refrain from any political actions that undermine the results of the election or hinder the success of the new team br Elizabeth Neumann an adviser at Defending Democracy Together and a former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under Trump stated that In the conspiratorial conservative base supporting Trump there are calls for using the Insurrection Act to declare martial law When they hear that the president is actually considering this there are violent extremist groups that look at this as a dog whistle an excuse to go out and create violence br br br Planning for Congress to overturn the election on January br On December Congressman Mo Brooks who had been the first member of Congress to announce he would object to the January certification of the Electoral College results organized three White House meetings between Trump Republican lawmakers and others Attendees included Trump Vice President Pence representatives Jody Hice R Ga Jim Jordan R Ohio and Andy Biggs R Ariz representative elect Marjorie Taylor Greene R Ga and members of the Trump legal team The purpose of the meetings was to strategize about how Congress could overturn the election results on January Brooks confirmed after one such meeting that it had been a back and forth concerning the planning and strategy for January the th br Talking Points Memo reported in December that it had obtained the text messages Meadows had provided to the January committee including showing Meadows communicating with Republican members of Congress about plans to overturn the election br br br Pressure on Pence br br In the run up to election certification on January attempts to uncover significant election fraud bore no fruit and related legal challenges were rejected by the courts Hence those seeking to overturn the election focused attention increasingly on then vice president Mike Pence The Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the President of the Senate which was Pence for the January certification of the presidential election to supervise the counting of electoral ballots at a joint session of the Congress The Trump team developed multiple theories about how the Vice President might act on January to aid the overturning of election results and repeatedly encouraged him to act accordingly br br br Pence Card conspiracy br br Beginning in late December false legal theories went viral on pro Trump social media suggesting that Vice President Pence could invoke a Pence Card a supposed legal loophole that would enable him in his capacity as president of the Senate to reject electoral votes for Biden from contested swing states on the grounds that they had been cast by fraudulently appointed electors These theories originated from Ivan Raiklin an attorney and former Green Beret who was among a small group of military intelligence veterans associated with Michael Flynn who were instrumental in spreading false information alleging the election had been stolen from Trump The theory stems from a misreading of U S C which directs the vice president to request electoral vote certificates from any state that has not yet sent these votes to the National Archives by the fourth Wednesday in December Under the theory Pence had unilateral authority to declare that state certificates from contested states had not in fact been received and that new certificates presumably supporting President Trump should be issued Trump retweeted a post of Raiklin s calling for the invocation of the Pence Card on December the day specified in statute but Pence took no action consistent with the theory In late December Pence called former vice president Dan Quayle for advice and Quayle told him according to reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa Mike you have no flexibility on this None Zero I do know the position you re in I also know what the law is You have no power Although the fourth Wednesday had passed Trump still believed that Pence had the authority to reject electoral votes and kept asking him to do so however over lunch on January Pence informed Trump that he did not believe he had any such authority br Attorney John Eastman incorrectly told Pence in a January Oval Office meeting that Pence had the constitutional authority to block the certification which Trump reportedly urged Pence to consider Eastman also sent to Republican senator Mike Lee a six point plan of action for Pence to set aside electors in seven states which Lee rejected By January Trump was continuing to assert that Pence had unilateral power to throw out states official electoral certificates on grounds of fraud During the Capitol attack numerous rioters chanted Hang Mike Pence and the phrase trended on Twitter until Twitter banned it In March when ABC News Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he was worried about Pence while the crowd was chanting Trump defended the crowd saying they were very angry and that it was common sense that they would want to stop Congress from certifying the election result Of Pence Trump said I thought he was well protected and I had heard that he was in good shape br Dozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence on January asking him to delay for ten days the final certification of electors scheduled for the following day to allow them an opportunity to open special legislative sessions to decertify their electors and submit a new slate of electors This came three days after Trump Giuliani and Eastman held a conference call with legislators to present them purported evidence of election fraud Ted Cruz a decades long friend of Eastman proposed a complementary plan in the Senate garnering the support of ten other senators br In January as Congress began debating whether to amend the Electoral Count Act to make it clearer that the vice president has no power to overturn an election Trump released a statement asserting falsely that Pence did have such power Unfortunately he didn t exercise that power he could have overturned the Election and they now want to take that right away Pence responded several days later while addressing the Federalist Society President Trump is wrong Under the Constitution I had no right to change the outcome of our election br br br December timeline br John Eastman author of the Eastman memos began working with the Trump team in November Trump adviser Peter Navarro claimed that the Green Bay Sweep plan was developed over weeks prior to January br On December Trump allies in the House were developing a plan involving Pence to use Congress s tallying of electoral results on Jan to tip the election to President Trump Kenneth Chesebro emailed Rudy Giuliani and others pointing out that if Pence were to recuse himself Republican senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa would be in charge of certifying the election and if Grassley were to delay doing so this would give Trump more time for court battles Chesebro s subject line called this the President of the Senate strategy br On December Trump s legal advisors Pence and multiple members of Congress at a White House meeting discussed ways to challenge the January certification process and results br On December Trump re tweeted the Ivan Raiklin Operation Pence Card memo while stating America VP Mike Pence MUST do this tomorrow To defend our Constitution from our enemies Let him know br On December a Trump aide contacted John Eastman to request documentation of his legal theories concerning the certification process including the role of the vice president resulting in the Eastman memos br On December a lawsuit seeking to force action by Pence during the January certification Gohmert v Pence see below was filed in a Texas court br On December then White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows e mailed a memo prepared by Jenna Ellis a legal advisor to the Trump campaign to one of Pence s top aides The memo claimed that the Vice President should not open electoral ballots from six states that have electoral delegates in dispute and should defer the eventual count of electoral delegates until January br br br Pressure on Justice Department br On December two weeks after Barr stated there was no evidence of significant election fraud Trump announced that Barr would be leaving as attorney general by Christmas Before Trump s announcement he enlisted Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other aides to pressure deputy attorney Jeffrey Rosen who would replace Barr on December and other Justice Department officials to challenge the election results Meadows and a top Trump aide emailed allegations of voting anomalies in three states to Rosen and other officials Meadows also sought to have Rosen investigate a conspiracy theory promoted by a Giuliani ally that satellites and military technology had been used in Italy to remotely change votes from Trump to Biden Trump also enlisted a private attorney Kurt Olsen to seek a meeting with Rosen to propose a legal challenge he had drafted it was similar to a challenge initiated by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton and supported by dozens of Republican members of Congress and state attorneys general that attempted unsuccessfully to have the Supreme Court reject election results in four states Trump also spoke to Rosen about Olsen s proposal Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue resisted the efforts exchanging emails mocking them in one case as pure insanity Rosen later testified to Congress During my tenure no special prosecutors were appointed whether for election fraud or otherwise no public statements were made questioning the election no letters were sent to State officials seeking to overturn the election results and no DOJ court actions or filings were submitted seeking to overturn election results br In late December Trump reportedly phoned Rosen nearly every day to tell him about claims of voter fraud or improper vote counts Donoghue took notes of a December phone call between him Rosen and Trump in which he characterized the president saying Just say that the election was corrupt leave the rest to me and the R Congressmen The next day Jeffrey Clark acting assistant attorney general for the civil division approached Rosen and Donoghue with a draft letter and requested them to sign it The letter was addressed to officials in the state of Georgia saying that the Justice Department had evidence that raised significant concerns about the outcome of the presidential election contrary to what Barr had publicly announced weeks earlier and suggesting that the Georgia legislature call itself into special session for t he limited purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors Both Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign the letter and it was never sent br The Associated Press reported in December that Heidi Stirrup an ally of Trump advisor Stephen Miller who months earlier had been quietly installed at the Justice Department as the White House s eyes and ears had in recent days been banned from the building after it was learned she pressured officials for sensitive information about potential election fraud and other matters she could relay to the White House Stirrup had also circumvented Justice Department management to extend job offers to political allies for senior Department positions and interfered with the hiring of career officials br br br Pressure on Defense Department br According to ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl Michael Flynn called senior Trump intelligence official Ezra Cohen and told him to take extreme actions including seizing ballots to prevent the election results from favoring the Democrat Cohen didn t entertain Flynn s orders responding Sir the election is over It s time to move on Flynn replied You re a quitter This is not over Don t be a quitter br Trump attorney Sidney Powell called Cohen shortly thereafter and attempted to enlist his help with a far fetched claim involving then CIA Director Gina Haspel According to Karl s book Powell told Cohen that Haspel has been hurt and taken into custody in Germany You need to launch a special operations mission to get her The claim a conspiracy theory had been circulating among Powell s QAnon following for some time The conspiracy theory falsely claimed that Haspel had been injured while on a secret CIA operation to seize an election related computer server that belonged to a company named Scytl Powell alleged to Cohen that the server contained evidence of hundreds of thousands maybe millions of votes had been switched using rigged voting machines Powell was under the impression that Haspel had been engaged in this operation with the aim of destroying the nonexistent evidence on that nonexistent server According to the book Cohen thought Powell sounded out of her mind and he quickly reported the call to the acting defense secretary br A December memo proposed that the Trump administration seek evidence that there had been foreign interference in favor of Biden The memo laid out a plan for Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller to use National Security Agency and Defense Department powers to seize phone and email records One of Trump s informal advisers Michael Pillsbury described this as amateur hour perpetrated by people with no existing connection to Trump who were raising topics that the government had already said there was no evidence for In May Miller testified to the January House committee that he had feared Trump might invoke the Insurrection Act to politicize the military in an antidemocratic manner br br br Plan to seize voting machines br The then President s team also developed plans to have federal authorities seize voting machines from states where the election had been closely contested but won by Biden News reports indicate that at various points in the planning the Justice Department the Department of Defense Department of Homeland Security and the National Guard were considered as entities that would conduct the seizures Several versions of a draft Executive Order that would authorize the seizures were prepared Then President Trump was reported to have reviewed the draft Executive Order authorizing seizure by the National Guard but based on advice by among others Patrick Cipollone and Rudy Giuliani he did not sign and issue it br In June an email dated November surfaced sent by British biopharmaceuticals executive Andrew Whitney who in August pitched to Trump in the Oval Office the toxic botanical extract oleandrin as a cure for COVID The email included a draft authorizing letter to be presented by the president allowing three armed private companies to seize all voting machines and related materials with assistance from U S Marshals The email was sent to Doug Logan the president of Cyber Ninjas which later conducted the Maricopa County presidential ballot audit that sought but failed to find election fraud in that county and to cybersecurity expert Jim Penrose who had worked with Sidney Powell Michael Flynn and Patrick M Byrne who were seeking access to voting machines in an attempt to find proof of election fraud br br br Ellis memos br On New Year s Eve Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent a memo drafted by Trump attorney Jenna Ellis to a top Pence aide containing a detailed plan to overturn the election results The plan entailed Pence returning the electoral results to six battleground states on January with a deadline of January for the states to return them If any state did not return their electoral slate by that date neither Trump nor Biden would hold a majority so the election would be thrown to the House for a vote to determine the winner Per the Constitution in such a scenario the vote would be conducted on the basis of party control of state legislatures with Republicans holding of presumably giving Trump the victory br Ellis drafted a second memo dated January which she shared with Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow The memo argued that certain provisions of the Electoral Count Act that restricted Pence s authority to accept or reject selected electors were unconstitutional She proposed that when Pence reached Arizona in the alphabetical order during the certification he could declare the state s results as disputed and send all the electoral slates back to the states for the final ascertainment of electors to be completed before continuing Sekulow did not agree that Pence had such authority br br br Plan to obtain National Security Agency data br In February The Washington Post obtained a memo of unknown provenance dated December that had circulated among Trump allies and was shared with some Republican senators The memo called for Trump to direct acting defense secretary Christopher Miller to obtain NSA unprocessed raw signals data in an effort to prove foreign interference in the election The proposal called for Miller to direct three men named in the document to acquire the data At least two Republican senators received the memo after a January meeting at the Trump International Hotel attended by at least three senators and others which had been arranged by Mike Lindell The meeting centered around voting machines and alleged interference by China Venezuela and other countries The three men involved were not close to Trump and their names had not been previously reported in efforts to subvert the election Miller said he was not aware of the memo and Trump did not act on it br br br January br On New Year s Day White House director of personnel John McEntee sent a series of bullet points via text message to Pence s chief of staff to incorrectly assert that Thomas Jefferson Used His Position as VP to Win the election which McEntee claimed proves that the VP has at a minimum a substantial discretion to address issues with the electoral process Jonathan Karl the ABC News chief White House correspondent for the duration of the Trump administration wrote a November profile of McEntee characterizing him as particularly powerful because Trump knew he was the one person willing to do anything Trump wanted br Trump reportedly reached out to Steve Bannon for advice on his quest to overturn the election results In early January Bannon John Eastman and Rudy Giuliani were operating what they called a war room or command center at the Willard Hotel near the White House with the goal of overturning the election results Christina Bobb of the pro Trump One America News was also a participant Further related details of the effort to deny and overturn the election were also reported br Justice Department officials pressured Atlanta s top federal prosecutor B J Pak to say there had been widespread voter fraud in Georgia warning him that he would be fired if he did not The White House forced Pak to resign on January br On January a joint session of Congress presided over by Vice President Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took place to count the electoral votes Normally a ceremonial formality the session was interrupted by a mob that attacked the Capitol Trump had held a simultaneous rally on the Ellipse where he encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol building br Five lawyers who represented Trump resigned at the end of January after claiming he coerced them to repeat false claims of voter fraud br br br Gohmert v Pence br br On December Republican representative Louie Gohmert of Texas and the slate of Republican presidential electors for Arizona filed a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Vice President Mike Pence seeking to force him to decide the election outcome Gohmert argued that the Electoral Count Act of was unconstitutional that the Constitution gave Vice President Pence the sole power to decide the election outcome and that Pence had the power to count elector votes certified by a state s executive select a competing slate of duly qualified electors or ignore all electors from a certain state Pence represented by the Justice Department moved to dismiss the case since Congress and not the vice president was a more suitable defendant The Justice Department also argued that the Vice President the only defendant in this case is ironically the very person whose power plaintiffs seek to promote A suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count filed against the Vice President is a walking legal contradiction Lawyers for Congress also supported Pence s position br On January U S District Judge Jeremy Kernodle dismissed the suit saying that due to the plaintiffs lack of standing the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction relating to the constitutional status of the Electoral Count Act On appeal the next day the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit dismissed Gohmert s appeal in a unanimous decision by a three judge panel br br br Calls with state officials br br On January Trump Giuliani Eastman and others held a conference call with legislators of key states to provide them purported evidence of election fraud to justify calling special sessions of their legislatures in an attempt to decertify their electors Three days later dozens of lawmakers from five key states wrote Pence to ask he delay the January final certification of electors for ten days to allow legislators the opportunity to reconsider their states certifications br That same day Trump held a one hour phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger Trump was joined by Chief of Staff Mark Meadows trade adviser Peter Navarro Justice Department official John Lott Jr law professor John Eastman and attorneys Rudy Giuliani Cleta Mitchell and Kurt Hilbert Raffensperger was joined by his general counsel Ryan Germany Raffensperger recorded the call reportedly doing so while recalling his November call with Trump ally and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham after which Graham made public statements about the discussion that were at odds with Raffensperger s recollection br In the call with Raffensperger Trump repeatedly referred to disproven claims of election fraud and urged Raffensperger to overturn the election saying I just want to find votes Raffensperger refused noting that Georgia had certified its results after counting the votes three times and said at one point in the conversation Well Mr President the challenge you have is the data you have is wrong Trump issued a vague threat suggesting that Raffensperger and his general counsel Ryan Germany might be subject to criminal liability After the Georgia call Trump and his team spoke on Zoom with officials in Arizona Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin br Raffensperger told his advisers that he did not wish a recording or a transcript to be made public unless Trump made false claims about the conversation or attacked Georgia officials On the morning of January Trump tweeted that Raffensperger was unwilling or unable to answer questions about various election related conspiracy theories endorsed by Trump Raffensperger replied by tweet Respectfully President Trump what you re saying is not true The truth will come out Later that day The Washington Post reported on the call and published the full audio and transcript the Associated Press also obtained the recording that day br Two months later it was revealed that Trump had also called Raffensperger s chief investigator Frances Watson on December He spoke to her for six minutes during which he told her When the right answer comes out you ll be praised br Legal experts stated that Trump s attempt to pressure Raffensperger could have violated election law including federal and state laws against soliciting election fraud or interference in elections Election law scholar Edward B Foley called Trump s conduct inappropriate and contemptible while the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington called Trump s attempt to rig a presidential election a low point in American history and unquestionably impeachable conduct br Democrats condemned Trump s conduct Vice President elect Harris as well as Representative Adam Schiff the chief prosecutor at Trump s first impeachment trial said that Trump s attempt to pressure Raffensperger was an abuse of power Senator Dick Durbin as well as Representatives Ted Lieu and Kathleen Rice requested a criminal investigation while others called Trump s conduct an impeachable offense More than House Democrats supported a formal censure resolution introduced by Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia to censure and condemn Trump for having misused the power of his office by threatening an elected official with vague criminal consequences if he failed to pursue the president s false claims and for attempting to willfully deprive the citizens of Georgia of a fair and impartial election process in direct contravention of state and federal law In February Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened a criminal investigation into the phone call along with the phone call made by Lindsey Graham In January a panel of Fulton County judges agreed to Willis s request to impanel a special grand jury to compel testimony from individuals who had refused to cooperate br Several House and Senate Republicans also condemned Trump s conduct although no Republican described the conduct as criminal or an impeachable offense as of January Republican senator Pat Toomey who was not seeking reelection in called it a new low in this whole futile and sorry episode and commended Republican election officials across the country who have discharged their duties with integrity over the past two months while weathering relentless pressure disinformation and attacks from the president and his campaign Other congressional Republicans ignored or sought to defend Trump s Georgia call including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Georgia Senator David Perdue who told Fox News in an interview that he thought releasing the tape of the call was disgusting br br br Justice Department pressured and efforts made to replace acting attorney general br The day after Attorney General William Barr said he intended to resign Trump began to pressure his planned replacement Jeffrey Rosen to help him fight the election results In particular Trump asked Rosen to file legal briefs supporting lawsuits against the election results to announce Justice Department investigations of alleged serious election fraud and to appoint special prosecutors to investigate Trump s unfounded allegations of voter fraud and accusations against Dominion Voting Systems Rosen refused as did his deputy Richard Donoghue as the Justice Department had already determined and announced that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud However Trump continued to pressure them br Despite these disagreements Rosen became acting U S Attorney General on December as originally planned Trump continued to pressure Rosen asking him to go to the Supreme Court directly to invalidate the election results but Rosen along with his predecessor Barr and former acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall said such a case would have no basis and refused to file it br Meanwhile assistant attorney general Jeffrey Clark acting head of the Civil Division proposed himself as Rosen s replacement suggesting to Trump that he would support the president s efforts to overturn the election results Clark told Rosen and other top Justice Department officials that the Department should announce it was investigating serious election fraud issues Clark drafted a letter to Georgia officials claiming the DOJ had identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States and urging the Georgia legislature to convene a special session for the purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue rejected the suggestion as the Department had previously determined and announced that there was no significant fraud On January Clark revealed to Rosen that Trump intended to appoint him in Rosen s place Rosen Donoghue and head of the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel made a pact to resign if Rosen was removed Confronted with the threat of mass resignations the president backed away from the plan In early August Rosen and Donoghue told the Justice Department inspector general and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Clark attempted to help Trump subvert the election Rosen also told the Committee that Trump opened a January Oval Office meeting with Rosen Donoghue and Clark by saying One thing we know is you Rosen aren t going to do anything to overturn the election br During the closing weeks of the Trump presidency White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent multiple emails to Rosen asking him to investigate conspiracy theories including that satellites had been used from Italy to remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden Rosen did not open the investigation br br br Preparations by chief of staff br During the days leading up to January Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sent messages in support of preparing alternate Republican electors to replace those in some states in which Biden might win He also claimed in an email that the National Guard would be ready to protect pro Trump people br Additionally a PowerPoint presentation on how the election could be overturned was sent by email to Meadows on January The presentation circulated by retired Army Colonel Phil Waldron and apparently inspired by the ideas of Jovan Hutton Pulitzer alleged foreign interference in the election and recommended that the president declare a national emergency to delay the certification that Pence provide alternate electors and that the military count votes When Meadows was subpoenaed in September by the United States House Select Committee on the January Attack he provided the document to the Committee and stated that he had not acted on the plan it described Of the broader context U S Representative Ro Khanna said on December There were people who knew about it and were close to going through with it br br br More pressure on Pence br In early January Trump and his supporters continued to pressure Pence into aiding their attempts to overturn election results during the January certification In early January Trump criticized Pence for being too honest and warned him that people would hate him and believe he was stupid br On January Trump aide John McEntee sent a memo to Pence s chief of staff Marc Short titled Jefferson used his position as VP to win suggesting that Pence could emulate Thomas Jefferson by taking the actions encouraged by Trump and his supporters br On January in an appearance on Fox News Trump aide Peter Navarro claimed that Pence had authority to delay election certification and to require an audit of the states election results Navarro a promoter of the Green Bay Sweep was intimately involved with the election overturn effort His remarks elicited a public response from the Vice President s office br On January Eastman memos author John Eastman briefed Marc Short and vice presidential counsel Greg Jacob on the arguments he had been presenting to Trump about the Vice President s certification role br On January Trump tweeted the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors br Later that day Trump told an audience of thousands at a January rally in Georgia I hope Mike Pence comes through for us Of course if he doesn t come through I won t like him quite as much br On January and Trump met with Pence at the White House several times attempting to persuade Pence to act as recommended by the Eastman memos Eastman was present for at least one of the meetings br Also on January following a January call between Trump Giuliani Eastman and about state legislators several dozen of those legislators from five key states wrote to Pence and requested a day delay of certification to allow reconsideration of the electoral results previously certified by those state legislatures br Also on January Eastman communicated with Jacob That day Jacob wrote a memo to Pence stating that Eastman s plan would violate multiple provisions of the Electoral Count Act and would assuredly be blocked in court or if not considered by a court would create an unprecedented political crisis and the vice president would likely find himself in an isolated standoff against both houses of Congress with no neutral arbiter available to break the impasse br On January or the early morning of January after hearing from Pence and that he did not agree that the Vice President s power extended to actions that would change election results Trump issued a statement falsely claiming that Pence was in total agreement with his contention that the vice president has the power to act br On January in the morning Trump called Pence and again attempted to secure his cooperation Trump reportedly told Pence You can either go down in history as a patriot or you can go down in history as a pussy br On January at the rally preceding the United States Capitol attack Trump said If Mike Pence does the right thing we win the election Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us and if he doesn t that will be a sad day for our country and All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president br Other speakers at the January rally notably Giuliani and Eastman also highlighted the actions being requested of Pence After the rally during the United States Capitol attack rioters chanted Hang Mike Pence and displayed gallows complete with a hanging noose br During the Capitol attack on January Eastman emailed Jacob who was with Pence in the Capitol saying that the siege was occurring because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary br Also during the January Capitol attack and resulting interruption of the certification process Trump tweeted Mike Pence didn t have the

by Senior presidential advisor Jared Kushner Trump and Pence met each other on January for the purpose of reconciliation br br br January joint session br br br Senate efforts br In December several Republican members of the House led by Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama as well as Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri declared that they would formally object to the counting of the electoral votes of five swing states won by Biden during the January joint session The objections would then trigger votes from both houses At least House Republicans reportedly planned to vote against the counting of electoral votes despite the lack of any credible allegation of an irregularity that would have impacted the election and the allegations rejections by courts election officials the Electoral College and others and despite the fact that almost all of the Republican objectors had just won elections in the very same balloting they are now claiming was fraudulently administered br Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who on December had acknowledged Biden s victory the day after the Electoral College vote privately urged his Republican Senate colleagues not to join efforts by some House Republicans to challenge the vote count but he was unable to persuade Hawley not to lodge an objection Hawley used his objection stance in fundraising emails Eleven Republican senators and senators elect Ted Cruz Ron Johnson James Lankford Steve Daines John Kennedy Marsha Blackburn Mike Braun Cynthia Lummis Roger Marshall Bill Hagerty and Tommy Tuberville one quarter of Senate Republicans announced that they would join Hawley s challenge However many senators acknowledged that it would not succeed On January Vice President Pence had expressed support for the attempt to overturn Biden s victory Neither Pence nor the senators planning to object made any specific allegation of fraud rather they vaguely suggested that some wrongdoing might have taken place Other Senate Republicans were noncommittal or opposed to the attempt by the Republican senators to subvert the election results br Objections to the electoral votes had virtually no chance of success as Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives and although the Senate had a Republican majority there was no majority for overturning the election results Trevor Potter a Republican former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and the president of the Campaign Legal Center wrote that the counting joint session gives Trump s die hard supporters in Congress an opportunity to again provide more disinformation about the election on national television After Senator John Thune the second highest ranking Senate Republican said that the challenge to the election results would fail like a shot dog in the Senate Trump attacked him on Twitter br In early January Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election As vice president Pence presides over the Congressional session to count the electoral votes normally a non controversial ceremonial event For days beforehand Trump demanded both in public and in private that Pence use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump Pence the winners of the election Pence demurred that the law does not give him that power but Trump insisted that The vice president and I are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act Pence ultimately released a statement stating It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not br An hour before the joint session was set to start the president s lawyer Rudy Giuliani tried to call freshman senator Tommy Tuberville but accidentally left a message in the voicemail of another senator which was subsequently leaked to The Dispatch stating that we need you our Republican friends to try to just slow it down So if you could object to every state and along with a congressman get a hearing for every state I know we would delay you a lot but it would give us the opportunity to get the legislators who are very very close to pulling their vote they have written letters asking that you guys adjourn and send them back the questionable ones and they ll fix them up br br br House votes br At the January session after Republican senators had raised objections to Biden s electoral victory the House debated and voted A majority of Republicans totaling and including Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and his deputy Steve Scalise voted to support at least one objection br br br Report by Rep Zoe Lofgren br At the end of February Democratic Rep Zoe Lofgren chair of the House Administration Committee released a nearly page report that examined the social media posts between election night and January of Republican leaders who had voted against certifying the election results writing Many of former President Trump s false statements were made in very public settings Had Members made similar public statements in the weeks and months before the January th attack Statements which are readily available in the public arena may be part of any consideration of Congress constitutional prerogatives and responsibilities br br br Capitol attack br br Starting in December Trump repeatedly encouraged his supporters to protest in Washington D C on January in support of his campaign to overturn the election results telling his supporters to Be there will be wild The Washington Post editorial board criticized Trump for urging street protests referring to previous violence by some Trump supporters at two rallies and his statement during a presidential debate telling the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by Multiple groups of die hard Trump supporters staged rallies in Washington on that day Women for America First the Eighty Percent Coalition also at Freedom Plaza the group s name refers to the belief that approximately of Trump voters do not accept the legitimacy of Biden s win and The Silent Majority a group organized by a South Carolina conservative activist George Papadopoulos and Roger Stone ardent allies of Trump headlined some of the events In addition to the formally organized events the Proud Boys other far right groups and white supremacists vowed to descend on Washington on January with some threatening violence and pledging to carry weapons Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio said that his followers would be incognito and would spread across downtown DC in smaller teams On January Tarrio was arrested by District police on misdemeanor and felony charges br As the certification process was underway Trump gave a speech encouraging his supporters to march to the Capitol Many of them did whereupon they joined other protesters already gathered in the area and violently breached and stormed the Capitol eventually entering the Senate chamber as well as numerous offices The Congressional proceedings were suspended the legislators were taken to secure locations and Nancy Pelosi was evacuated Protestors penetrated the Senate chamber One unarmed woman was shot and killed by Capitol Police inside the Capitol building after she attempted to climb through a broken door into the Speaker s Lobby leading to the House chamber the officer who shot her was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation and was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing Another rioter died of a drug overdose and three succumbed to natural causes A Capitol Police officer died from a stroke the next day br As the attack progressed Pence was evacuated from the Senate chamber to a basement room as Trump tweeted Mike Pence didn t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution The Secret Service prepared to evacuate Pence to Andrews Air Force Base Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker reported in their book I Alone Can Fix It that Pence was brought to his armored limousine but told his security chief Tim Giebels I m not leaving the Capitol If I get in that vehicle you guys are taking off I m not getting in the car Pence remained at the Capitol and certified the election results late that night br On January Newsweek reported for the first time the deployment of undercover commandos at the Capitol on January to manage the most extreme possibilities including an attack on President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence br br According to a January CNN News report the United States House Select Committee on the January Attack has learned that Trump did nothing to stop the attack as it was unfolding Leaders of the committee Bennie Thompson D MS and Liz Cheney R WY have characterized his failure to intervene despite being asked to do so as dereliction of duty In April Cheney stated It s absolutely clear that what President Trump was doing what a number of people around him were doing that they knew it was unlawful I think what we have seen is a massive and well organized and well planned effort that used multiple tools to try to overturn an election br br br Trump operatives breach Coffee County Georgia election system br br On January lawyers on Trump s team asked a Georgia tech firm to assist them in looking into voting systems in Coffee County Georgia On January one of the fake electors in Georgia escorted two Trump operatives into the county s election office and the Trump team copied data from the office br Fani Willis examined this incident as part of the Georgia election investigation On August Trump and co defendants were indicted in the Georgia case and four of the defendants Sidney Powell Misty Hampton Cathleen Latham and Scott G Hall were charged in the Coffee County breach br br br Lindell memo br br On January Trump ally and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell visited the White House where he was photographed carrying notes that appeared to suggest an additional attempt to overturn the election The document bore a heading containing the words taken immediately to save Constitution and called for th Military Intelligence Brigade Cyber civilian lawyer Frank Colon NOW as Acting National Security illegible and mentioned the Insurrection Act and martial law It further recommended m ov ing Kash Patel to CIA Acting and made reference to Trump loyalist Sidney Powell br br br Later developments br br br Taxpayer costs br According to a Washington Post assessment published February Trump s falsehoods about fraud had cost taxpayers more than half a billion dollars in spending to enhance security resolve legal disputes and repair property among other things br br br Security concerns over March br br Security was bolstered in Washington D C in preparation for March which QAnon adherents adopting a false belief from sovereign citizen ideology believed would be the day Trump was re inaugurated as president The House prematurely ended its work for the week following an announcement by the Capitol Police of intelligence on a possible plot by an identified militia group to breach the Capitol building on that day Ultimately March passed without any serious incidents being reported br br br Election audits br Alleging fraud during Republicans initiated or proposed audits in several states in addition to the election audits done normally in some states which do not always include the presidency br An audit in Maricopa County Arizona that began in April inspired Republicans in other states to pursue similar efforts with some calling for audits in all fifty states More than a year after the election Trump supporters continued to pressure state election officials to investigate or decertify the outcome even in states where Trump won by a large margin br An Associated Press analysis published in December examined every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states that Trump had challenged The analysis found potential incidents Even if all the incidents involved votes for Biden which they did not and involved ballots that were actually counted which they did not the number was far smaller than would have been necessary to change the election outcome The analysis found no evidence of organized fraud but rather in virtually every case it involved an individual acting alone br br br Arizona br br On March the Arizona Senate Republican caucus hired four firms to perform an audit of the presidential ballots in Maricopa County with a Florida based company called Cyber Ninjas being the lead firm There was no stated purpose of overturning the election and there is no mechanism under the Constitution by which the Congressional certification of the result could be reversed Arizona Senate President Karen Fann said that the audit was not intended to overturn the state s election results including at a July hearing Nevertheless Trump and some of his supporters expressed the hope that the Arizona result would be changed and that there might be a domino effect in which other states changed their results br The auditors released a report on September finding no proof of fraud and that their ballot recount increased Biden s margin of victory by votes Following the audit Arizona Governor Doug Ducey rejected calls for the state s election to be decertified or overturned br In January Maricopa County election officials released a final report finding nearly every claim the auditors made was false or misleading The next day Cyber Ninjas announced it was shutting down as a Maricopa County judge imposed a contempt fine on the company for every day it refused to hand over documents as it had been ordered to do months earlier br After a six month investigation into alleged fraud by Maricopa County election officials in the presidential election Arizona attorney general Mark Brnovich said in April that he found no proof of fraud He released an interim report claiming that serious vulnerabilities had been identified omitting his investigators findings to the contrary and withholding the more complete report Brnovich was succeeded by Kris Mayes When Brnovich left office in January Mayes released the more complete report that had been written during Brnovich s tenure showing that none of the allegations against the Maricopa County election board had merit br On April Arizona indicted fake electors and seven Trump allies and described five unindicted coconspirators br br br Georgia br br A group called VoterGA filed a lawsuit requesting to examine by microscope Fulton County ballots that it asserted might be counterfeit The suit arose after four Republican auditors involved with the November statewide audit and manual recount claimed to see what they asserted were pristine absentee ballots which they suspected might have been computer generated though an October investigation by the Georgia secretary of state s office found that there were no counterfeit ballots in the batches named by the complainants After an initial ruling in favor of the suit by a superior court judge in May it was ultimately dismissed in October because the plaintiffs failed to allege a particularized injury The dismissal of the suit marked the end of the last remaining lawsuit challenging the Georgia election results until another suit making largely the same argument was subsequently filed In December that suit was joined by David Perdue who had announced his candidacy for Georgia governor days earlier Perdue lost his bid to be reelected as a United States senator in and asserted that he like Trump had been cheated br Trump had claimed that about dead people had voted in Georgia but an examination by the State Election Board released in December found that four absentee ballots of dead people had been mailed in by relatives br br br Idaho br In September Bonner County Idaho announced it would perform a recount of ballots cast in the election in response to an allegation by election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell that all Idaho counties had been digitally hacked Lindell provided a detailed list of IP addresses he asserted had been compromised County Clerk Mike Rosedale stated that all county voting machines were fully airgapped from the Internet also noting that seven Idaho counties don t use voting machines Lindell alleged that a specific formula had been applied by hackers to flip votes from Trump to Biden Rosedale said Lindell had not contacted his office before presenting his allegations The Bonner audit and audits of two other counties that don t use voting machines affirmed the accuracy of the ballot count Chief Deputy Secretary of State Chad Houck said Lindell would be sent a bill for the audits br br br Pennsylvania br br The Republican Commissioners agreed to a ballot audit in Fulton County PA due to a subpoena threat from State Senator Doug Mastriano Fulton County s audit was funded by Defending The Republic an organization founded by Trump s lawyer Sidney Powell Defying a directive from the State s Board of Elections the County allowed Wake Technology Services Inc to access voting machines The company had originally performed the hand recount in Maricopa County s ballot audit The original draft of its audit report concluded that Fulton s election was well run and followed all Commonwealth and Federal guidelines At a state Senate hearing the Republican chairman of Fulton County s Board of Commissioners testified that his county s audit found nothing wrong br By August Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers were preparing to hold formal hearings on the election and conduct a full forensic investigation Prior to the investigation Senate President Jake Corman made a statement asserting that the investigation is not meant to overturn the results of Pennsylvania s election and that the legislature does not have the authority to do so The next month Republicans approved subpoenas for a wide range of personal information on millions of voters who cast votes in the May primary and November general election Republicans intended to hire private firms to manage the data On September Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro filed a lawsuit seeking to block the subpoenas from being issued On October Corman said that he accepted the results of the election but also reaffirmed his support for the investigation br br br Texas br The Texas attorney general s office led by ardent Trump ally Ken Paxton spent more than staff hours investigating potential voting fraud in The investigation identified and prosecuted sixteen cases of false addresses on voter registration forms among nearly million registered voters in the state This was half as many cases as two years earlier A investigation found only three prosecutable cases among all elections in the state br In September hours after Trump wrote to Texas governor Greg Abbott demanding an audit of the state s election results the Texas secretary of state s office announced that audits had begun in four major counties County officials and others in the secretary of state s office initially said they were unaware of any audit underway br The audits were conducted by secretary of state John Scott whom Abbott appointed in October Scott is a former state litigator who briefly joined Trump s legal team in to challenge the election results He released preliminary findings of the audits in December that found few issues including votes cast by deceased voters and cross state duplicate votes among million ballots cast The duplicate votes remained under investigation br br br Wisconsin br br By May state election officials had identified potential cases of voting fraud among million ballots cast Sixteen of those cases involved people using a UPS Store rather than their residence for their mailing address br Trump and his allies filed multiple lawsuits challenging Wisconsin election results but lost all of them including a series of decisions by the state Supreme Court State Republicans initiated multiple types of investigations beginning in February That month the Republican majority legislature voted to direct the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau to conduct an examination of some election procedures br In May Robin Vos the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin state assembly hired three retired police officers and an attorney to examine reported tips of potential election irregularities br Janel Brandtjen who chairs the Assembly elections committee opened a forensic audit modeled after the Maricopa County Arizona audit She had traveled to Arizona to review that audit Brandtjen issued subpoenas to two major counties for ballots and voting machines but they were rejected because Vos had not signed them as required by law Vos indicated he did not intend to sign the subpoenas which requested information that doesn t exist or doesn t apply to Wisconsin elections Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson asserted the subpoena he received was clearly a cut and paste job from similar election related legal moves by Republicans in other states br In June Vos selected Republican former Wisconsin Supreme Court justice Michael Gableman to conduct an investigation of the election Gableman had been considered for a position in the Trump administration in Soon after the election Gableman had voiced conspiracy theories about the outcome and had attended an August conference hosted by election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell He also consulted Shiva Ayyadurai a conspiracy theorist whose work on the Arizona audit was discredited Gableman issued subpoenas later withdrawn some of which contained errors and requested information that was already public He later stated Most people myself included do not have a comprehensive understanding or even any understanding of how elections work Gableman sent emails to election officials across the state asking them to retain information but they came from a Gmail account associated with a different name and in some cases were blocked as a security concern or spam Gableman compared a newspaper s coverage of his investigation to Nazi propaganda In October the office of Democrat Wisconsin attorney general Josh Kaul sent Gableman a nine page letter characterizing the investigation as unlawful and called for it to be closed br On October the nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau released their findings of an audit ordered by Republicans in February The findings reported that there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud and that State Senator Robert Cowles said that the election was safe and secure State Senator Kathy Bernier said that the audit found no evidence of any attempt at vote fraud br A ten month review by the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty found in December that certain election procedures weren t adequately followed but there was little direct evidence of fraud and for the most part an analysis of the results and voting patterns does not give rise to an inference of fraud br Gableman s month investigation found no evidence of election fraud and cost taxpayers million Vos fired Gableman and multiple parties referred him to the Office of Lawyer Regulation of the Wisconsin Supreme Court on ethics complaints br br br Mike Lindell reinstatement prediction br br On March businessman and Trump supporter Mike Lindell predicted on Steve Bannon s podcast that Trump would be back in office on August the day after his three day cyber fraud conference in Sioux Falls stating it ll be the talk of the world When President Joe Biden remained in office Lindell moved his prediction for Trump s return to September and then to the end of br br br Senate Judiciary Committee report br br On October the Senate Committee on the Judiciary published their report on Trump s efforts to pressure the

high risk br br br House Select Committee on the January Attack br br In July the House Select Committee on the January Attack was formed largely along party lines br At the first public hearing on June the committee said that Trump had engaged in a seven part conspiracy to overturn a free and fair democratic election and they discussed it in the hearings that followed According to Bennie Thompson chair of the committee Jan was the culmination of an attempted coup a brazen attempt as one rioter put it shortly after Jan to overthrow the government The violence was no accident It represents Trump s last stand most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power Trump according to the committee lied to the American people ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president On October the committee subpoenaed Trump s testimony and relevant records He sued the committee and never testified On December the committee criminally referred him to the Justice Department though the Justice Department was already investigating br br br German federal election br During the German federal election the Center for Monitoring Analysis and Strategy CeMAS found that false claims of voter fraud had become commonplace on Telegram in Germany with accusations against Dominion Voting Systems being common despite the company s technology not being used in German elections CeMAS researcher Miro Dittrich said We have seen far right actors try to claim election fraud since at least but it didn t take off When Trump started telling the big lie it became a big issue in Germany sometimes bigger than the pandemic because far right groups and the AfD are carefully monitoring the success Trump is having with this narrative br br br Justice Department investigations br br By March Justice Department investigations of participants in the Capitol attack had expanded to include activities of Trump s inner circle leading up to the attack A federal grand jury was empaneled that issued at least one subpoena seeking records about people who organized spoke at or provided security at Trump rallies as well as information about members of the

admitted his loss to a group of historians in mid saying We had a deal all set and then when the election was rigged and lost what happened is that the deal went away br On September American legal scholar Laurence Tribe and colleagues described the legal background of the attempt to overturn the election and named possible ways of averting the use of such a strategy in the future On December Tribe and colleagues wrote that Attorney General Merrick Garland ought to be holding the leaders of the Jan insurrection all of them to account to teach the next generation that no one is above the law br Joshua Keating warned that the playbook used up until this point to challenges the legitimacy of election results could result in a coup trap where countries suffering a coup attempt are more likely to see another On December The Washington Post published an opinion piece by three retired generals on the need to be prepared for a possible insurrection in br br The New York Times reported later in April that Trump supporters were continuing to seek ways to overturn the election John Eastman state and federal legislators and right wing news outlets continued to press for state legislatures to rescind electoral votes for Biden and to bring new lawsuits asserting large scale voting fraud The Times reported that Trump was privately insisting he could be returned to power as he also continued to consider another run for the presidency in Legal experts expressed concerns that efforts were being made to undermine public confidence in democracy to lay the groundwork for baselessly challenging future elections Former federal appeals court judge J Michael Luttig a prominent conservative attorney for whom Eastman clerked remarked At the moment there is no other way to
