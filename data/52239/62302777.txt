br Content br OpIndia solely denounces what it describes as liberal media In an analysis of the articles published by OpIndia in University of Maryland researchers Prashanth Bhat and Kalyani Chadha identified five recurring patterns in OpIndia s content br br Portraying mistakes as fake news OpIndia has provided coverage of misquoted statements incorrect headlines or errors in various mainstream media outlets including NDTV The Times Group and BBC and claimed them to be fake news After the outlets published corrections OpIndia continued to allege that the errors were intentional According to Bhat and Chadha the rhetoric employed by OpIndia is similar to the strategies used by European right wing populist publications that aim to engender distrust in the mainstream media br Shaming journalists OpIndia has attacked the professional integrity of specific mainstream media journalists that the website believes to be opposed to the ruling BJP including journalists from The Wire The Indian Express NDTV and The Quint OpIndia has accused these journalists of sexual harassment plagiarism financial misconduct malicious editing and other forms of unethical behaviour Some stories in this category were obtained by monitoring the journalists social media accounts for inconsistencies or contradictions Bhat and Chadha compared OpIndia s method of attacking journalists to practices used by American right wing publications br Alleging partisanship OpIndia has alleged the existence of a news media conspiracy in which mainstream media outlets are biased against the ruling BJP and India itself and favourable toward the opposition Indian National Congress INC which the website considered part of the establishment OpIndia claimed that the media produced too little coverage of the INC s use of Cambridge Analytica while providing too much coverage of the BJP s handling of the Rafale deal controversy English language outlets are the primary targets of OpIndia s criticism br Amplifying criticism OpIndia has regularly featured stories in which celebrities and public officials criticised mainstream media outlets and reports in which the outlets apologised to critics In these stories OpIndia accused journalists of various faults including insensitivity and irresponsibility misinformation publishing sensitive information and compromising national security In one story OpIndia covered the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting s criticism of journalist Nidhi Razdan then played down the Minister s correction after the situation was revealed to be a misunderstanding br Alleging bias against India and Hindus OpIndia has accused Indian publications of having a liberal media bias and of publishing stories that are anti India particularly regarding India Pakistan relations The website published allegations that mainstream media outlets were anti Hindu including in rebukes of Times Now and CNN News for covering weight loss tips and fireworks bans around Diwali Bhat and Chadha wrote that OpIndia s portrayal of the mainstream media as pro minority and anti majority is in line with the narratives communicated through Norwegian and German right wing websites and that the Diwali accusations resemble the War on Christmas allegations published by American right wing outlets br Raj in intended for OpIndia to combat media manipulation and distinguish what is being reported from what the facts are In Sharma stated that OpIndia is openly right leaning and does not claim to be ideologically neutral Sharma described OpIndia s dislike of left liberal ideas as one of the website s ontological positions on the basis of which we operate in As of June OpIndia declares on its website that it aims to produce content that is free from the burden of liberal bias and political correctness The site accepts article contributions from its readers br Fact checkers certified by the Poynter Institute s International Fact Checking Network IFCN including Alt News and Boom have identified multiple instances in which OpIndia has published fake news According to a Newslaundry data compilation OpIndia published fake news stories and misreported stories between January and June that were fact checked by other organisations False reports on OpIndia frequently criticise Muslims Newslaundry found articles on OpIndia released from to November with headlines that explicitly named Muslims as perpetrators of various crimes A writer who left OpIndia due to this trend told Newslaundry If the accused in an incident belongs to the Muslim community then you have to mention his name in the heading The news is to be published in such a way that if the reader is a Hindu then he starts developing hatred for Muslims In April Bharti blamed the severity of the COVID pandemic in India on Muslim martyrdom in an OpIndia video that was disseminated among Hindutva oriented WhatsApp groups br After the Wikipedia community declared OpIndia an unreliable source in March OpIndia began publishing news content on a regular basis portraying Wikipedia in a negative light it has accused the English Wikipedia of having a left wing and socialist bias In OpIndia was sent a legal notice by a woman at the Tikri protest site for doxxing her and falsely claiming that she was raped at the site br br br Bihar human sacrifice claims br br Between May OpIndia published a series of seven articles one in English and six in Hindi falsely claiming that Rohit Jaiswal a Hindu boy was sacrificed in a mosque in Bela Dih a village in Kateya Gopalganj Bihar after which his body was disposed of in a river on March In the articles OpIndia alleged that the suspected perpetrators were all Muslims One of the articles asserted A new mosque had been built in the village and it is being alleged that there was a belief that if a Hindu was sacrificed the mosque would become powerful and its influence would increase The stories were accompanied with videos of Jaiswal s sister and father in which neither of them mentioned a sacrifice or mosque br Jaiswal s postmortem report indicated that his cause of death was asphyxia due to drowning Local residents in the village including Jaiswal s mother declined to corroborate the human sacrifice claims and a local journalist said that the village did not have a new mosque The first information report FIR filed by the father on March listed six suspects five Muslim boys and one Hindu boy and did not reference a sacrifice or mosque OpIndia later released an audio recording of its interview with Jaiswal s father in which he claimed that Jaiswal was murdered in a mosque In a follow up interview with Newslaundry the father retracted the claim and said that he made the accusations in sheer frustration of the attention around Jaiswal s death After Newslaundry interviewed Bharti then editor of OpIndia Hindi OpIndia deleted the word all from the phrase all Muslims in its description of the suspected perpetrators br Vijay Kumar Verma a Deputy Inspector General of Bihar Police disclosed on May that he had filed an FIR against OpIndia under Section obscenity of the Information Technology Act and Section A inciting religious outrage of the Indian Penal Code for its reporting of the false human sacrifice claims The FIR stated that OpIndia published the claims without knowing or understanding the case On May the Director General of Bihar Police Gupteshwar Pandey examined the drowning incident and found no evidence supporting the human sacrifice claims or the suspicion of communal motives behind the death br br br Plagiarism br OpIndia has also been engaged in plagiarism and copyright violation in their articles without attributing to the original publishers It was later discovered by Alt News when OpIndia published an article covering Pulitzer Prize nomination about three Kashmiri journalists who were awarded for their photographs taken during the state wide lockdown imposed in by the ruling party the BJP after the revocation of article involving the Kashmir conflict br br br Reception br In March the IFCN rejected OpIndia s application to be certified as a fact checker While noting partial compliance on a number of categories the IFCN rejected the application on grounds of political partisanship and lack of transparency and raised concerns over questionable fact checking methodologies The rejection disqualified OpIndia from fact checking contracts with web properties owned by Facebook and Google In response Sharma criticised the IFCN assessment and urged for acceptance of outlets with declared ideological leanings br After co founder Raj departed OpIndia he described the website as a blind mouthpiece of the BJP on Twitter in August Raj criticised Sharma alleging that she and others started as trolls and abuse and play victim card when questioned OpIndia was blacklisted from Wikipedia in March alongside Swarajya and TFIpost after Sharma in an OpIndia piece published personally identifying information about a Wikipedia editor who helped write the encyclopedia s article on the Delhi riots which resulted in the editor leaving Wikipedia br Stop Funding Hate a British social media campaign urged organisations to withdraw their advertising from OpIndia in May after the website published an article asserting that businesses should be able to declare that they do not hire Muslims The head of the campaign Richard Wilson said that OpIndia is becoming internationally notorious for its hateful and discriminatory coverage and that the campaign has rarely seen such overt advocacy of discrimination on religious grounds Over organisations including advertising network Rubicon Project video streaming service Mubi personal care brand Harry s and the Sa d Business School ceased advertising on OpIndia as a result of the campaign Sharma responded that she would stand by our article and our content and that OpIndia would never alter its core belief system or content
