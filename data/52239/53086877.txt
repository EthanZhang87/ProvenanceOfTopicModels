instance to harm corporate or political adversaries and improve brand reputation Internet manipulation is sometimes also used to describe the selective enforcement of Internet censorship or selective violations of net neutrality br br br Issues br Behavior Manipulation Internet manipulation often aims to change user perceptions and their corresponding behaviors Since the early s this notion of cognitive hacking meant a cyberattack aiming to change human behavior Today fake news disinformation attacks and deepfakes can secretly affect behavior in ways that are difficult to detect br High arousal emotion virality It has been found that content that evokes high arousal emotions e g awe anger anxiety or with hidden sexual meaning is more viral and that content that holds one or many of these elements surprising interesting or useful is taken into consideration br Simplicity over complexity Providing and perpetuating simple explanations for complex circumstances may be used for online manipulation Often such are easier to believe come in advance of any adequate investigations and have a higher virality than any complex nuanced explanations and information See also Low information rationality br Peer influence Prior collective ratings of an web content influences ones own perception of it In it was shown that the perceived beauty of a piece of artwork in an online context varies with external influence as confederate ratings were manipulated by opinion and credibility for participants of an experiment who were asked to evaluate a piece of artwork Furthermore on Reddit it has been found that content that initially gets a few down or upvotes often continues going negative or vice versa This is referred to as bandwagon snowball voting by reddit users and administrators br Filter bubbles Echo chambers and filter bubbles might be created by Website administrators or moderators locking out people with altering viewpoints or by establishing certain rules or by the typical member viewpoints of online sub communities or Internet tribes br Confirmation bias manipulated prevalence Fake news does not need to be read but has an effect in quantity and emotional effect by its headlines and sound bites alone Specific points views issues and people s apparent prevalence can be amplified stimulated or simulated See also Mere exposure effect br Information timeliness and uncorrectability Clarifications conspiracy busting and fake news exposure often come late when the damage is already done and or do not reach the bulk of the audience of the associated misinformation br Psychological targeting Social media activities and other data can be used to analyze the personality of people and predict their behaviour and preferences Michal Kosinski developed such a procedure Such can be used for media or information tailored to a person s psyche e g via Facebook According to reports such may have played an integral part in Donald Trump s win See also Targeted advertising Personalized marketing br br br Algorithms echo chambers and polarization br br Due to overabundance of online content social networking platforms and search engines have leveraged algorithms to tailor and personalize users feeds based on their individual preferences However algorithms also restrict exposure to different viewpoints and content leading to the creation of echo chambers or filter bubbles br With the help of algorithms filter bubbles influence users choices and perception of reality by giving the impression that a particular point of view or representation is widely shared Following the referendum of membership of the European Union in the United Kingdom and the United States presidential elections this gained attention as many individuals confessed their surprise at results that seemed very distant from their expectations The range of pluralism is influenced by the personalized individualization of the services and the way it diminishes choice Five manipulative verbal influences were found in media texts There are self expression semantic speech strategies persuasive strategies swipe films and information manipulation The vocabulary toolkit for speech manipulation includes euphemism mood vocabulary situational adjectives slogans verbal metaphors etc br Research on echo chambers from Flaxman Goel and Rao Pariser and Gr mping suggest that use of social media and search engines tends to increase ideological distance among individuals br Comparisons between online and off line segregation have indicated how segregation tends to be higher in face to face interactions with neighbors co workers or family members and reviews of existing research have indicated how available empirical evidence does not support the most pessimistic views about polarization A study suggested that individuals own choices drive algorithmic filtering limiting exposure to a range of content While algorithms may not be causing polarization they could amplify it representing a significant component of the new information landscape br br br Research and use by intelligence and military agencies br br The Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group unit of the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British intelligence agency was revealed as part of the global surveillance disclosures in documents leaked by

covertly manipulating online communities The disclosures also revealed the technique of credential harvesting in which journalists could be used to disseminate information and identify non British journalists who once manipulated could give information to the intended target of a secret campaign perhaps providing access during an interview It is unknown whether the journalists would be aware that they were being manipulated br Furthermore Russia is frequently accused of financing trolls to post pro Russian opinions across the Internet The Internet Research Agency has become known for

suspended accounts before the presidential election in France in a strike against information operations br Inventor of the World Wide Web Tim Berners Lee considers putting few companies in charge of deciding what is or is not true a risky proposition and states that openness can make the web more truthful As an example he points to Wikipedia which while not being perfect allows anyone to edit with the key to its success being not just the technology but also the governance of the site Namely it has an army of countless volunteers and ways of determining what is or is not true br Furthermore various kinds of software may be used to combat this problem such as fake checking software or voluntary browser extensions that store every website one reads or use the browsing history to deliver fake revelations to those who read a fake story after some kind of consensus was found on the falsehood of a story br Furthermore Daniel Suarez asks society to value critical analytic thinking and suggests education reforms such as the introduction of formal logic as a discipline in schools and training in media literacy and objective evaluation br br br Government responses br
