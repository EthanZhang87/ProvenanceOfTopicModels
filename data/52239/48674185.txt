Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels br The team s main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review in English and Russian languages launched in November The goal is to provide data for analysts journalists and officials dealing with this issue The Disinformation Review also

primarily about the EU s foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular Most of the organization s efforts are distributed on providing information support on issues related to the Russo Ukrainian War One of the ESTF s main challenges has been described as distinguishing disinformation from legitimate dissent br ESCTF has documented numerous examples of propaganda and disinformation published by Russian media Between and EUvsDisinfo registered confirmed disinformation cases with each week on average Between November and August the project identified more than cases of disinformation Among the most common topics was the topic of migration As of March cases of disinformation were related to the COVID pandemic and cases related to the war in Ukraine br br br Reception br EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff br The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing An EP preparatory action for StratCom Plus has allocated m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically br br Pavel Teli ka Vice President of the European Parliament I place great value in the fact that Europe has experts who address Russia s ongoing disinformation campaigns The quality and the substance of their work is outstanding Their work is valuable as it indicated the alarming nature of our European security br Keir Giles from Chatham House about East StratCom Task Force a critically important capability ESTF has quite a high credit among experts br European Security Union Commissioner Julian King noted that East Stratcom Task Force gathered more than examples of pro Kremlin disinformation contradicting publicly available facts repeated on many languages on many occasions It also launched a Russian language service from Brussels providing updates and fact based background information about the Union for RU language journalists The aim is to increase visibility and more accurate representation of EU policies in the Russian language media It produces a weekly Disinformation review Their Twitter account ensures that the Task Force s products reach up to million people per month in addition to their regular briefings This work is very important br Rebecca Harms Member of the European Parliament MEP from Germany and member of the Greens group It s important to have this Stratcom but its interaction with national bodies is not strong enough br Former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann Jensen said that They provide an excellent instrument We would of course not be able to do it in other ways br Former Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka This team is capable of generating quality results br Edward Lucas vice president at Center for European Policy Analysis CEPA said that the East StratCom s Disinformation Review is the best weekly bulletin on Russian propaganda in the West next after Ukrainian similar project StopFake which he considers to be the gold standard br According to The New York Times East Stratcom serves as Europe s front line against this onslaught of fake news br Canadian Maclean s magazine As for who first noticed that Moscow was gunning for Freeland that s something that has yet to show up in any banner Canadian headlines It was the European Union s East StratCom Task Force a unit of the External Action Service the EU s foreign ministry and diplomatic branch The Task Force was set up in March as a kind of early warning system to detect incoming Kremlin disinformation campaigns br East StratCom Task Force in EUobserver Eight member states have urged the EU s foreign service to significantly expand its work on countering Russian propaganda They said in a letter to EU head of foreign affairs Federica Mogherini that in the face of unabated third party disinformation campaigns we see an urgent need to further enhance the EU s StratCom capabilities East StratCom circulates online notes that debunk Russian disinformation and has attracted followers to its Twitter account It also promotes positive coverage of the EU in former Soviet states More in EUobserver Its Disinformation Review a weekly newsletter and its daily tweets and infographics should be in the laptops and phones of all MEPs and senior EU officials br Lawfare about the team The task force has made some meaningful contributions to the efforts to counter disinformation warfare Over the course of its operation East StratCom has identified over disinformation cases These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country s borders East StratCom s supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole rather than isolated incidents in individual countries br br br Criticism br The ESTF has been described as possibly the most widely recognised and criticised anti disinformation unit set up to handle Russian disinformation In The New York Times wrote that the ESTF is unique because its biggest supporters countries in Central and Eastern Europe with a history of Communist influence are also among its loudest critics They say the task force has been underfunded and undersupported and should be more ambitious br Danish newspaper Politiken criticized East StratCom for writing that Russian backed militants were fighting in Ukraine at the Battle of Avdiivka They said that ESTF only used Ukrainian sources in their review and claimed that one of the sources the Ukrainian website Inform Napalm was linked to the controversial and secretive Ukrainian website Myrotvorets br In it was found that the ESTF s database of news articles that contain disinformation had incorrectly included three articles from Dutch news outlets in part due to a translation error The outlets GeenStijl The Post Online and De Gelderlander sued the EU for libel On March the Dutch Parliament passed a motion to advocate that the EU remove the ESTF s funding In response the ESTF removed the articles from their database and changed the language it uses when describing outlets that it identifies as publishing disinformation On March Dutch Minister of the Interior who had previously opposed closing EUvsDisinfo said that the government would make a case for closing it in the European Union Professor Wouter Hins from Leiden University admitted that EUvsDisinfo made a mistake but argued that it should not be closed The idea that the government should then shut up is rather unworldly On March the three Dutch media withdrew their case br br br See also br Counterpropaganda br Fact checking br Fake news br Russia
