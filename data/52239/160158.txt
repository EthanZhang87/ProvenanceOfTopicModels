Phineas Taylor Barnum July April was an American showman businessman and politician remembered for promoting celebrated hoaxes and founding the Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus with James Anthony Bailey br He was also an author publisher and philanthropist although he said of himself I am a showman by profession and all the gilding shall make nothing else of me According to Barnum s critics his personal aim was to put money in his own coffers The adage there s a sucker born every minute has frequently been attributed to him although no evidence exists that he had indeed coined the phrase br Barnum became a small business owner in his early twenties and founded a weekly newspaper before moving to New York City in He embarked on an entertainment career first with a variety troupe called Barnum s Grand Scientific and Musical Theater and soon after by purchasing Scudder s American Museum which he renamed after himself He used the museum as a platform to promote hoaxes and human curiosities such as the Fiji mermaid and General Tom Thumb In he promoted the American tour of Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind paying her an unprecedented equivalent to in per night for nights He suffered economic reversals in the s from unwise investments as well as years of litigation and public humiliation but he embarked on a lecture tour as a temperance speaker to emerge from debt His museum added America s first aquarium and expanded its wax figure department br Barnum served two terms in the Connecticut legislature in as a Republican for Fairfield Connecticut He spoke before the legislature concerning the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude A human soul that God has created and Christ died for is not to be trifled with It may tenant the body of a Chinaman a Turk an Arab or a Hottentot it is still an immortal spirit He was elected in as mayor of Bridgeport Connecticut where he worked to improve the water supply bring gas lighting to streets and enforce liquor and prostitution laws He was instrumental in the inception of Bridgeport Hospital in and was its first president The circus business begun when he was years old was the source of much of his enduring fame He established P T Barnum s Grand Traveling Museum Menagerie Caravan Hippodrome in a traveling circus menagerie and museum of freaks that adopted many names over the years br Barnum was married to Charity Hallett from until her death in and they had four children In a few months after his wife s death he married Nancy Fish his friend s daughter and years his junior They were married until when Barnum died of a stroke at his home He was buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery Bridgeport which he designed himself br br Barnum was born in Bethel Connecticut the son of innkeeper tailor and storekeeper Philo Barnum and Philo s second wife Irene Taylor Barnum s maternal grandfather Phineas Taylor was a Whig legislator landowner justice of the peace and lottery schemer who had a great influence upon him br br Barnum ran several businesses including a general store a book auctioning trade real estate speculation and a statewide lottery network He started a weekly newspaper in called The Herald of Freedom in Bethel Connecticut His editorials against the elders of local churches led to libel suits and prosecution and he was imprisoned for two months While incarcerated Barnum sought the help of Rev L F W Andrews publisher of the Gospel Witness from Hartford Barnum and Andrews then published a joint paper the Herald of Freedom and Gospel Witness They dissolved their partnership a year later in October Barnum then moved the publication of the paper to Danbury Connecticut br In November after publishing issues of the Herald of Freedom Barnum passed control of the paper to his brother in law John W Amerman who published the paper for another year in Norwalk Connecticut When Amerman sold the paper to Mr George Taylor the Barnum family s connection to the Herald of Freedom ended Barnum sold his store in br He began his career as a showman in at the age of with the purchase and exhibition of a blind and almost completely paralyzed slave woman named Joice Heth whom an acquaintance was billing around Philadelphia as George Washington s year old former nurse Slavery was already outlawed in New York but Barnum exploited a loophole that allowed him to lease Heth for a year for borrowing to complete the sale Barnum forced her to work for to hours per day and she died in February at no more than years of age Barnum hosted a live autopsy of Heth s body in a New York saloon to demonstrate her actual age before spectators paying cents each br br Barnum had a year of mixed success with his first variety troupe Barnum s Grand Scientific and Musical Theater followed by the Panic of and three years of difficult circumstances He purchased Scudder s American Museum in located at Broadway and Ann Street in Manhattan Renaming it Barnum s American Museum he improved it upgrading the building and adding exhibits br It became a popular showplace He added a lighthouse lamp that attracted attention up and down Broadway and flags along the roof s edge that attracted attention in daytime while giant paintings of animals between the upper windows drew attention from pedestrians The roof was transformed to a strolling garden with a view of the city where Barnum launched hot air balloon rides daily A changing series of live acts and curiosities were added to the exhibits of stuffed animals including albinos giants little people jugglers magicians exotic women detailed models of cities and famous battles and a menagerie of animals br br In Barnum introduced his first major hoax a creature with the body of a monkey and the tail of a fish known as the Feejee mermaid He leased it from fellow museum owner Moses Kimball of Boston who became his friend confidant and collaborator Barnum justified his hoaxes by calling them advertisements to draw attention to the museum He said I don t believe in duping the public but I believe in first attracting and then pleasing them br He followed the mermaid act by exhibiting the four year old actor Charles Stratton billed as the year old General Tom Thumb Stratton was taught to imitate famous figures such as Hercules and Napoleon br In Barnum hired the Native American dancer Do Hum Me the first of many Natives that he would present During he toured with General Tom Thumb in Europe and met Queen Victoria who was amused but saddened by Stratton and the event was a publicity coup It opened the door to visits with royalty throughout Europe including the tsar of Russia and enabled Barnum to acquire many new attractions including automatons and other mechanical marvels During this time he bought other museums including artist Rembrandt Peale s Philadelphia Museum the nation s first major museum and the Baltimore Museum and Gallery of Fine Arts By late Barnum s American Museum was drawing visitors per year br br Barnum became aware of the popularity of Jenny Lind the Swedish Nightingale during his European tour with Tom Thumb when her career was at its height in Europe Barnum admittedly unmusical had never heard Lind s voice but he offered her the chance to sing in the US at a night for nights with all expenses paid br Lind demanded the fee in advance and Barnum agreed She used the fee to raise a fund for charities principally endowing schools for poor children in Sweden Barnum borrowed heavily on his mansion and his museum to raise the money to pay Lind He was still short of funds so he persuaded a Philadelphia minister that Lind would be a positive influence on American morals and the minister lent him the final The contract also afforded Lind the option of withdrawing from the tour after or performances paying Barnum million in if she did so br Lind and her small company sailed to the US in September She was a celebrity before she arrived following Barnum s months of preparations Nearly people greeted her at the docks and another at her hotel and merchandise was sold When Lind realized how much money she stood to earn from the tour she insisted upon a new agreement which Barnum signed on September This paid Lind the original fee plus the remainder of each concert s profits after Barnum s management fee Lind was determined to accumulate as much money as possible for her charities br br The tour began with a concert at Castle Garden on September It was a major success recouping Barnum four times his investment Washington Irving proclaimed She is enough to counterbalance of herself all the evil that the world is threatened with by the great convention of women So God save Jenny Lind Tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that Barnum sold them at auction and public enthusiasm was so strong that the press coined the term Lind mania The blatant commercialism of Barnum s ticket auctions distressed Lind and she persuaded him to reserve a substantial portion of tickets at reduced prices br On the tour Barnum s publicity always preceded Lind s arrival and generated enthusiasm as he had as many as journalists on his payroll After New York the company toured the East Coast with continued success and later traveled through the southern states and Cuba By early Lind had become uncomfortable with Barnum s relentless marketing of the tour and she invoked a contractual right to sever her ties with him They parted amicably and she continued the tour for nearly a year under her own management Lind performed concerts in the US for Barnum earning her about while Barnum netted at least equivalent to in br br Barnum s next challenge was to change public attitudes about the theater which was widely regarded as a salacious enterprise He wanted theaters to become palaces of edification and delight as respectable middle class entertainment He built New York City s largest and most modern theater naming it the Moral Lecture Room Barnum hoped that this would avoid seedy connotations attract a family crowd and win the approval of the city s moral crusaders He started the nation s first theatrical matin es to encourage families and to lessen the fear of crime br The theater opened with The Drunkard a thinly disguised temperance lecture Barnum had become a teetotaler after returning from Europe He followed it with melodramas farces and historical plays performed by highly regarded actors He edited Shakespearean plays and other works such as Uncle Tom s Cabin to render them more palatable for family audiences br Barnum organized flower shows beauty contests dog shows and poultry contests but the most popular were baby contests In he started the pictorial weekly newspaper Illustrated News He completed his autobiography one year later which sold more than one million copies over the course of numerous revisions Mark Twain loved the book but the British Examiner thought it trashy and offensive and wrote that it inspired nothing but sensations of disgust and sincere pity for the wretched man who compiled it br In the early s Barnum began investing to develop East Bridgeport Connecticut He extended substantial loans to the Jerome Clock Company to lure it to move to his new industrial area but the company went bankrupt by taking Barnum s wealth with it This began four years of litigation and public humiliation Ralph Waldo Emerson proclaimed that Barnum s downfall showed the gods visible again and other critics celebrated Barnum s public dilemma However Tom Thumb offered his services as he was touring on his own and the two began another European tour Barnum also started a lecture tour mostly as a temperance speaker By he emerged from debt and built a mansion that he called Lindencroft and he resumed ownership of his museum br br Barnum created America s first aquarium and expanded the wax figure section of his museum His Seven Grand Salons demonstrated the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World The collections expanded to four buildings and he published a museum guidebook that claimed curiosities Late in Siamese twins Chang and Eng emerged from retirement and appeared at Barnum s museum for six weeks Also in Barnum introduced Zip the Pinhead a microcephalic black man who spoke a mysterious language created by Barnum In Barnum discovered giantess Anna Swan and dwarf Commodore Nutt a new Tom Thumb with whom Barnum visited President Abraham Lincoln at the White House br During the Civil War Barnum s museum drew large audiences seeking diversion from the conflict He added pro Union exhibits lectures and dramas and he demonstrated commitment to the cause He hired Pauline Cushman in an actress who had served as a spy for the Union to lecture about her thrilling adventures behind Confederate lines Barnum s Unionist sympathies incited a Confederate sympathizer to start a fire in Barnum s American Museum burned to the ground on July from a fire of unknown origin Barnum reestablished it at another location in New York City but this was also destroyed by fire in March The loss was too great the second time and Barnum retired from the museum business br br Barnum did not enter the circus business until he was years old He established P T Barnum s Grand Traveling Museum Menagerie Caravan Hippodrome in Delavan Wisconsin in with William Cameron Coup It was a traveling circus menagerie and museum of freaks that assumed various names P T Barnum s Travelling World s Fair Great Roman Hippodrome and Greatest Show on Earth and P T Barnum s Greatest Show on Earth and the Great London Circus Sanger s Royal British Menagerie and the Grand International Allied Shows United after an merger with James Bailey and James L Hutchinson soon shortened to Barnum Bailey s This was the first circus to display three rings br The show s first primary attraction was Jumbo an African elephant that Barnum purchased in from the London Zoo The Barnum and Bailey Circus still contained acts similar to his Traveling Menagerie including acrobats freak shows and General Tom Thumb Barnum persisted in growing the circus in spite of more fires train disasters and other setbacks and he was aided by circus professionals who ran the daily operations He and Bailey parted ways in but they rejoined in with the Barnum Bailey Greatest Show on Earth later the Barnum Bailey Circus which toured the world br Barnum was among the first circus owners to move his circus by train a suggestion by Bailey and other business partners and probably the first to own his own train He became known as the Shakespeare of Advertising because of his innovative and impressive ideas In this new business venture Barnum leaned on the advice of Bailey and other business partners br br Barnum wrote several books including Life of P T Barnum The Humbugs of the World Struggles and Triumphs Forest and Jungle or Thrilling Adventures in All Quarters of the Globe and The Art of Money Getting br Barnum was often called the Prince of Humbugs and felt that entertainers and vendors perpetrating hoaxes or humbugs in promotional material were justified if the public received value in return However he was contemptuous of those who accrued money through fraud especially the spiritualist mediums popular in his day He testified against noted spirit photographer William H Mumler in his trial for fraud and he exposed the tricks employed by mediums to cheat the bereaved In The Humbugs of the World Barnum offered equivalent to in to any medium who could prove the power to communicate with the dead br br Barnum was significantly involved in politics He mainly focused on race slavery and sectionalism in the period preceding the American Civil War He opposed the Kansas Nebraska Act of which supported slavery and left the Democratic Party because it had endorsed slavery Barnum joined the new anti slavery

acquire insider information on the New York and New Haven Railroad lines and exposed a secret that would raise fares by percent He said during the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution A human soul that God has created and Christ died for is not to be trifled with It may tenant the body of a Chinaman a Turk an Arab or a Hottentot it is still an immortal spirit He acknowledged that he had owned slaves when he lived in the South I whipped my slaves I ought to have been whipped a thousand times for this myself But then I was a Democrat one of those nondescript Democrats who are Northern men with Southern principles br Barnum was elected for the next four Connecticut legislature sessions and succeeded senator Orris S Ferry He was the legislative sponsor of an law that prohibited the use of any drug medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception and criminalized acting as an accessory to the use of contraception This
