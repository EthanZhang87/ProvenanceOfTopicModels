title: Fake news websites in the United States
id: 52548243
Fake news websites target United States audiences by using disinformation to create or inflame controversial topics such as the election Most fake news websites target readers by impersonating or pretending to be real news organizations which can lead to legitimate news organizations further spreading their message Most notable in the media are the many websites that made completely false claims about political candidates such as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as part of a larger campaign to gain viewers and ad revenue or spread disinformation Additionally satire websites have received criticism for not properly notifying readers that they are publishing false or satirical content since many readers have been duped by seemingly legitimate articles br br br Definition br Fake news websites deliberately publish hoaxes propaganda and disinformation to drive web traffic inflamed by social media These sites are distinguished from news satire as fake news articles are usually fabricated to deliberately mislead readers either for profit or more ambiguous reasons such as disinformation campaigns Many sites originate in or are promoted by Russia North Macedonia Romania and the United States Many sites directly targeted the United States both because the U S is a high value ad consumer and extraordinary claims are more likely to be believed during a political crisis br The New York Times noted in a December article that fake news had previously maintained a presence on the Internet and within tabloid journalism in years prior to the U S election However prior to the election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fake news had not impacted the election process to such a high degree Subsequent to that election the issue of fake news turned into a political weapon between supporters of Clinton and Trump due to these back and forth complaints the definition of fake news as used for such argumentation became vaguer br br br Methods br Fake news websites use a variety of methods to fool their readers into believing their content either by attempting to persuade the readers that they are legitimate or by distracting readers with incredible news br br br Clickbait br br Fake news websites often have article titles that are incredible prompting the user to click on it and read more This method of enticing readers to view content on their website often leads to exaggerated or even fake titles When linked to from other sites usually social media having an extraordinary story title played a large part in tricking users who cannot tell if the article is real or not This became especially relevant in the election Additionally out of context or manipulated images can cause readers to incorrectly assume an article s legitimacy often due to their inflammatory image choice br Facebook s Vice President of News Feed says the social media giant defines clickbait as headlines that withhold significant amounts of information and mislead the user Because it is difficult to determine what content exactly is fake news the website uses a data set to calculate the likelihood of a headline being clickbait br br br Impersonation br Another method of gaining readers is impersonating a legitimate news organization This can come in two forms either by copying a popular news organization s website formatting and pretending to be a lesser known publication or by completely copying an existing website down to its name and authors Exact copies can trick viewers into believing the website is an official organization such as the Bloomberg ma or cnn trending com br ABCnews com co was a fake news website that crudely spoofed legitimate journalistic organization ABC News but was in reality completely unrelated The site published only fake stories usually with a realistic clickbait headline albeit with story details containing enough flaws that the discerning reader would likely notice it was false br The Denver Guardian was a blog site registered in that claimed to be a legitimate newspaper in Denver but only ran a single fabricated story that went viral br br br Typosquatting br Typosquatting a form of cybersquatting is based on Internet users mistyping the name of a popular Web site A typosquatter will monitor how many clicks a typo domain name receives and use the information to sell advertising for the sites that receive a high volume of accidental traffic Many popular fake news websites like ABCnews com co attempted to impersonate a legitimate U S news publication relying on readers not actually checking the address they typed or clicked on They exploited common misspellings slight misphrasings and abuse of top level domains such as com co as opposed to com Many social media users were duped believing they were going to an actual news publication s website br br br Obscurity br Since the authors of these websites are not actual reporters many fake news sites either pretend to have the identity of a reporter or simply do not include an About Us page When these sites are publicized by actual organizations they receive a bit of legitimacy along with more viewers br br br Fake news campaigns br The election cycle of the US office of president has become a focal point around which many campaigns of fake news are organized br br br election cycle br br A November editorial in the San Diego Union Tribune suggested that Facebook and Google do what broadcast and cable TV networks have done for decades have politically neutral fact checkers vet every single political ad This approach has not prevented past campaigns from running powerful hard hitting ads What it does prevent or at least limit is the rapid spread of disinformation br According to Will Robinson a Democratic consultant and a founding partner of New Media Firm This is the first post mass media election in which for the first time in U S history more significant amounts of money will be spent on social media and digital than on broadcast Glen Bolger a partner at Public Opinion Strategies a leading Republican polling firm predicted that If you like clean positive issue oriented campaigns you re going to be disappointed It s going to be rough and tumble br In December Facebook and Twitter disabled a global network of pages groups and accounts sending pro Trump messages The fake news accounts managed to avoid detection as being inauthentic and they used photos generated with the aid of artificial intelligence The campaign was based in the U S and Vietnam There s no question that social media has really changed the way that we talk about politics said Deen Freelon a media professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill The No example is our president who whether you like him or not uses social media in ways that are unprecedented for a president and I would say any politician br A article in USA Today stated that In the election with so many people running for president and so many bad actors trying to spread disinformation about them it will be difficult to determine what is fake news and who created it The question is not if or when there will be disinformation campaigns because they have already started br br br election cycle br br Fake news websites played a large part in the online news community during the election reinforced by extreme exposure on Facebook and Google Approximately pro Trump fake stories were shared on Facebook a total of million times and pro Clinton fake stories shared a total of million times There were two main reasons for creating fake news economical and ideological The teenagers in Veles for example produced stories favoring both Trump and Clinton that earned them tens of thousands of dollars Some fake news providers seek to advance candidates they favor The Romanian man who ran endingthefed com for example claims that he started the site mainly to help Donald Trump s campaign br br br Major fake news sites involved br ABCnews com co pro right br Conservative Daily Post both anti left and anti right br Denver Guardian known for anti Hillary Clinton articles br Disinfomedia anti right articles that aimed to trick alt rights br News Examiner anti left articles br SubjectPolitics com known for anti Hillary Clinton articles br NewsPunch inflammatory for both sides as well as conspiratorial br br br Social media br Professor Philip N Howard of the University of Oxford found that about one half of all news on Twitter directed at Michigan prior to the election was junk or fake The other half came from real news sources Criticized for failing to stop fake news from spreading on its platform during the election Facebook thought that the problem could be solved by engineering until May when it announced plans to hire content reviewers Fraudulent stories during the U S presidential election popularized on Facebook included a viral post that Pope Francis and actor Denzel Washington had endorsed Donald Trump br BuzzFeed News found that on Facebook during the last three months of the election fake news stories received more attention than real news stories It was discovered that the top twenty fake news stories had shares reactions and comments while the top twenty real news stories were only shared commented on and reacted to times One prominent fraudulent news story released after the election that protesters at anti Trump rallies in Austin Texas were bused in started as a tweet by one individual with Twitter followers Over the next three days the tweet was shared at least times on Twitter and times on Facebook and promoted in the conservative blogosphere before the individual stated that he had fabricated his assertions br President Barack Obama commented on the significant problem of fraudulent information on social networks impacting elections in a speech the day before Election Day in saying lies repeated on social media created a dust cloud of nonsense Shortly after the election Obama again commented on the problem saying in an appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel if we can t discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems President Trump also commented significantly on fake news creating the Fake News Awards to highlight real news outlets that publicly misrepresented him br br br Pizzagate br br In early November fake news sites and Internet forums falsely implicated the restaurant Comet Ping Pong and Democratic Party figures as part of a fictitious child trafficking ring which was dubbed Pizzagate The conspiracy theory was debunked by the fact checking website Snopes com The New York Times and Fox News The restaurant s owners and staff were harassed and threatened on social media After threats Comet Ping Pong increased security for concerts held inside its premises br Days after the attack Hillary Clinton spoke out on the dangers of fake news in a tribute speech to retiring Senator Harry Reid at the U S Capitol Clinton called the spread of fraudulent news and fabricated propaganda an epidemic that flowed through social media She said it posed a danger to citizens of the U S and to the country s political process Clinton said in her speech she supported bills before the U S Congress to deal with fake news br br br Notable examples of fake news websites br Many of these websites are categorized as fake news because they have a satirical take on the news but ultimately fail to convince their readers that their content is actually fake br br br RealTrueNews br br Marco Chacon created the fake news site RealTrueNews to show his alt right friends their alleged gullibility Chacon wrote a fake transcript for Clinton s leaked speeches in which Clinton explains bronies to Goldman Sachs bankers Chacon was shocked when his fiction was reported as factual by Fox News and he heard his writings on Megyn Kelly s The Kelly File Trace Gallagher repeated Chacon s fiction and falsely reported Clinton had called Bernie Sanders supporters a bucket of losers a phrase made up by Chacon After denials from Clinton staff Megyn Kelly apologized with a public retraction br Chacon later told Brent Bambury of CBC Radio One program Day that he was so shocked at readers ignorance he felt it was like an episode from The Twilight Zone In an interview with ABC News Chacon defended his site saying it was an over the top parody of fake sites to teach his friends how ridiculous they were The Daily Beast reported on the popularity of Chacon s fictions being reported as if it were factual and noted pro Trump message boards and YouTube videos routinely believed them In a follow up piece Chacon wrote as a contributor for The Daily Beast after the U S election he concluded those most susceptible to fake news were consumers who limited themselves to partisan media outlets br br br Global Associated News MediaFetcher com br MediaFetcher com is a fake news website generator It has various templates for creating false articles about celebrities of a user s choice Often users miss the disclaimer at the bottom of the page before re sharing The website has prompted many readers to speculate about the deaths of various celebrities br br br Huzlers br Similar to Global Associated News many readers have been tricked into believing the satire website Huzlers Snopes has over separate fact checks on their articles each one correcting the fake news from Huzlers According to owner Pablo Reyes Jr the website does not try to trick people intentionally br br br news br news was a WordPress based blog site which produced fake news during in particular one story falsely stated that Donald Trump had won the popular vote in the election fooled search engine algorithms and ranked very highly in results the day after the election br When googling final election vote count the website News was the top one to come up It truthfully stated that Trump had won the electoral college but falsely stated that Trump was ahead of Hillary Clinton in the popular vote By the next day the story had dropped one spot to number two on the search list Google commented that its software algorithms use hundreds of factors to determine the ranking br br br Disinfomedia br In addition to disconnected sites that run on an inadequate budget there are sites with many connections behind them Jestin Coler from Los Angeles founded Disinfomedia a company that owns many fake news sites He gave interviews under a pseudonym Allen Montgomery With the help of tech company engineer John Jansen journalists from NPR found Coler s identity Coler explained how his intent for his project backfired he wanted to expose alt right echo chambers and point out their gullibility He stated his company wrote fake articles for the left wing that were not shared as much as those from a right wing point of view br br br National Report and News Examiner br Both of these fake news websites heavily profited through the use of clickbait headlines which were usually false Paul Horner a lead writer at both of these websites focused significantly on the election since it drew strong ad revenue He told The Washington Post he made per month through ads linked to fake news After the election Horner said that he felt his efforts helped Trump In a follow up interview with Rolling Stone Horner revealed The Washington Post profile piece on him spurred increased interest with over interview requests from media including ABC News CBS News and CBS s Inside Edition Horner explained his writing style articles that appeared legitimate at the top and became increasingly absurd as the reader progressed These two websites often referenced each other br br br Christian Times Newspaper br In an interview with The New York Times Cameron Harris of Annapolis Maryland explains how he profited from creating fake news on his website ChristianTimesNewspaper com that included a false story claiming that premarked ballots for Mrs Clinton were being held in boxes at a warehouse in Ohio Within a few days the story had earned him around br br br KMT News br During the summer of KMT News published a series of fake news stories regarding celebrity appearances and filming locations in random local towns These towns included Brentwood Tennessee Chandler Arizona and Atlantic City New Jersey br br br Spread and identification of fake news br percent of all US adults get news from Facebook Investigations conducted in showed nearly percent of content by far right Facebook pages and percent of far left pages were false or misleading In the months leading up to the presidential election fake news articles shared on Facebook dramatically increased from million shares reactions and comments to nearly million Mainstream media articles on the other hand declined from million shares reactions and comments in February to only million by Election Day br In Christine Michel Carter a writer who has reported on Generation Alpha for Forbes stated that one third of the generation can decipher false or misleading information in the media A study conducted by the Stanford Graduate School of Education from January revealed difficulties that middle high school and college students experienced in differentiating between advertisements and news articles or identifying where information originated One concern noted by researchers of the study is that democracy is at risk of devolving due to the ways in which falsehoods about civic issues can quickly spread with a growing ease of access In one assessment high school students were asked to evaluate two Facebook posts mentioning Donald Trump s candidacy for president one was from an actual Fox News account and the other was from a fake account Over percent of students stated that the fake account was more reliable because of its graphic elements and only a quarter recognized the significance of the blue checkmark on Twitter and Facebook which indicates that an account was marked as legitimate br br br U S response br br br Educational br Elementary school teachers have decided to challenge results from the Stanford study by showing children the importance of not being deceived by what is fake Fifth grade teacher Scott Bedley in California created his own version of Simon Says in which students are given three minutes to read an article and decide whether a news story is true or false Bedley worked with another teacher in Kansas Todd Flory to devise a fake news challenge via Skype whereby Flory s class picked two real articles and wrote a fake one to be presented to Bedley s class in California Teachers are promoting these learning techniques with the hope that such strategies and skills will stay with their students for the rest of their adolescent and adult lives br Andreas Schleicher the lead of Organization for Economic Co operation and Development OECD announced in that his organization was initiating global competencies tests that will be taken by year olds around the world alongside the OECD s current reading maths and science assessments which are conducted every three years This will test how well students can discern fake news outside of their sociopolitical bubble br Jennifer Coogan editor in chief of education startup Newsela has partnered with the American Press Institute to help combat fake news consumption in addition to its regular literacy classes She believes it is now the teacher s responsibility to help teach their students about which media to believe since it is near impossible for a parent to monitor every source that a child will read br br br Commercial br br br Facebook br br After receiving heavy criticism for not stopping the extreme number of fake news articles on its platform Facebook announced in December that it would begin to flag fake news If enough users flagged a story the story would be sent to a third party organization to check its veracity If it failed it would lose news feed priority as well as have disputed by rd party fact checkers as a caption Facebook is also attempting to reduce their financial incentives in an attempt to decrease the amount of fake news The fact checking organizations involved are ABC News Associated Press FactCheck org PolitiFact and Snopes br In Facebook has admitted that it fell short in stopping outside meddling in the U S presidential election This admission comes after increased scrutiny from lawmakers in a broader backlash against Silicon Valley as well as a Senate hearing for social media company executives br In today s world young people rely heavily on social media to access information that is broadcast on the news Many teens described traditional news as boring and the same implying that it was predictable and devoid of any questioning of power In contrast they felt that Facebook postings YouTube videos blogs opinionated talk shows and fake news provided background information and perspectives that enabled them to understand the larger meanings of political events and develop their own opinions For them this was a more truthful and authentic rendition of news br br br Fact checking organizations br br In the aftermath of the election many fact checking websites teamed up with Facebook in order to check on the veracity of linked articles Many of these organizations have also posted lists of fake news websites and guides on how to identify them br br br Governmental br br br Legislative br Members of the U S Senate Intelligence Committee traveled to Ukraine and Poland in March and heard from officials in both countries on Russian operations to influence their affairs U S Senator Angus King told the Portland Press Herald that tactics used by Russia during the U S election were analogous to those used against other countries King recalled the legislators were informed by officials from both Ukraine and Poland about Russian tactics of planting fake news stories during elections On November King joined a letter in which seven members of the U S Senate Intelligence Committee asked President Obama to publicize more information from the intelligence community on Russia s role in the U S election In an interview with CNN Senator King warned against ignoring the problem saying it was a bipartisan issue br Amid worries about fake news and disinformation being spread by Russia representatives in the U S Congress called for more action to track and counter alleged propaganda emanating from overseas On November legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U S State Department act against propaganda with an inter agency panel The legislation authorized funding of million over a two year period The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act written by U S Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy Portman urged more U S government action to counter propaganda Murphy said after the election it was apparent the U S needed additional tactics to fight Russian propaganda U S Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden said frustration over covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan br Republican U S Senators stated they planned to hold hearings and investigate Russian influence on the U S elections By doing so they went against the preference of incoming Republican President elect Donald Trump who downplayed any potential Russian meddling in the election U S Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain and U S Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr discussed plans for collaboration on investigations of Russian cyberwarfare during the election U S Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker planned a investigation Senator Lindsey Graham indicated he would conduct a sweeping investigation in the th U S Congress session br br br FTC br In the Federal Trade Commission as part of a campaign to crack down on bogus health claims charged over million to Beony International owner Mario Milanovic and

promoted their acai berry weight loss products br br br Counter Disinformation Team br br The United States Department of State planned to use a unit called the Counter Disinformation Team formed with the intention of combating disinformation from the Russian government it was disbanded in September after department heads missed the scope of propaganda before the U S election The U S State Department put eight months into developing the unit before scrapping it It would have been a reboot of the Active Measures Working Group set up by President Reagan The Counter Disinformation Team was set up under the Bureau of International Information Programs Work began in with the intention to combat propaganda from Russian sources such as Russia Today U S Intelligence officials explained to former National Security Agency analyst and counterintelligence officer John R Schindler that the Obama Administration decided to cancel the unit as they were afraid of antagonizing Russia U S
