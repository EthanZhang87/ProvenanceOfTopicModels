certain that is very appealing to a certain section of the country I really feel a dichotomy in the American populace What is important What you want to be true or what is true br br Truthiness is What I say is right and nothing anyone else says could possibly be true It s not only that I feel it to be true but that I feel it to be true There s not only an emotional quality but there s a selfish quality br During an interview on December with Charlie Rose Colbert stated br br I was thinking of the idea of passion and emotion and certainty over information And what you feel in your gut
