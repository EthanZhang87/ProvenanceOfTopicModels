Company in American Folklore An Encyclopedia published by Garland in br br br Mr Urban Legend br While teaching folklore at the University of Utah Brunvand noticed a disconnect with his students and their views toward folklore They always seemed to think that folklore belonged to somebody else usually in the past that was something quaint and outdated He began asking his students to think about and discuss stories from their own lives These stories helped form the basis of a collection which Brunvand later included in several popular books on the topic of urban legends br In Brunvand s first book devoted to urban legends was published The Vanishing Hitchhiker American Urban Legends and Their Meanings helped to popularize the topic for a student audience Urban legends Brunvand explains are kissing cousins of myths fairy tales and rumors Legends differ from rumors because the legends are stories with a plot And unlike myths and fairy tales they are supposed to be current and true events rooted in everyday reality that at least could happen Urban legends reflect modern day societal concerns hopes and fears but are weird whoppers we tell one another believing them to be factual br Over the next two decades Brunvand added to the collection with new urban legends The Choking Doberman and Other New Urban Legends The Big Book of Urban Legends which was formatted as a comic book The Mexican Pet More New Urban Legends Curses Broiled Again The Baby Train And Other Lusty Urban Legends Too Good to be True The Colossal Book of Urban Legends and The Truth Never Stands in the Way of a Good Story He made several appearances on Late Night with David Letterman and in began a twice weekly syndicated newspaper column called Urban Legends He participated in countless radio talk shows and dozens of press interviews educating people about this pass along folk narrative that typically involves people misunderstanding or making false assumptions about a story they heard They forget details and fill in the gaps by inventing what they are missing to make sense of the story Though criticized for the popular orientation of his books Brunvand was dedicated to publicizing the field of folklore exploring the roots of the stories where possible and in some cases debunking them Folklorists fill different educational roles Brunvand told members of The Missouri Folklore Society in sometimes in classrooms but often in a more public forum I believe that the public and media image of what a folklorist does is in fact part of what we should be doing whether we were trained specifically for it or not whether we work in academe or not and whether we like it or not br Brunvand and his books became so popular that when Richard Wolkomir dubbed him Mr Urban Legend in an article for the Smithsonian the title was later added to book jackets and other publicity In an article for Western Folklore Brunvand mentioned a notice he found on a computer newsgroup dated March presumably an insider s joke I think Jan Harold Brunvand alleged author of The Choking Doberman is an urban legend Has anybody ever actually seen this guy A Harvard Lampoon publication Mediagate parodied urban legend books with this fake publisher s notice Bookman Publishing s Catalog for Fall The Embarrassing Fart and More New Urban Legends by Jan Harold Brunvand Yet another set of rumors

competition was the last we heard from Jan We assume he made it home but maybe he vanished br His favorite hobbies are fly fishing and skiing He and his wife Judith continue to reside in Salt Lake City Utah br br br Popular books about urban legends br br br The Vanishing Hitchhiker br The Vanishing Hitchhiker American Urban Legends and Their Meanings is a book intended to introduce the idea of urban legends to the general public Included in the book are such chilling and humorous stories as The Vanishing Hitchhiker The Economical Car The Ghost Airliner The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo The Solid Cement Cadillac and The Killer in the Back Seat Brunvand s approach according to reviewer Janet L Langlois sensitizes the reader in a highly readable and effective way to both the dynamic narrative process in an urban context and the discipline of folklore and folklife studies Some of these stories previously appeared in an article Brunvand wrote for the June issue of Psychology Today As with Heard About the Solid Cement Cadillac or the Nude in the Camper Brunvand categorizes the different legends included in The Vanishing Hitchhiker into classic urban legend types For each legend type Brunvand offers samples that show variations on the legends themselves historical evidence of how the legend may have originated often with European or East Asian roots and an explanation of what the legend might mean in an urban or modern context br Although recognized by critics for its usefulness as an introductory volume and reference point for expanding the field of folklore reviewers cautioned that The Vanishing Hitchhiker lacked the depth necessary for people actively researching urban legends Janet L Langlois for example wondered what criteria Brunvand used in selecting stories for the book as well as what made the legends American urban and modern Reviewer Gary Alan Fine wrote The paperback edition makes an excellent supplementary reading for introductory folklore students It s all good fun and Brunvand folklore s Carl Sagan should thrive and prosper letting the all purpose intelligentsia know that folklore is just as much fun as interplanetary travel and not nearly as expensive To this Brunvand countered I really won t think I have arrived until they refer to Carl Sagan as The Jan Brunvand of astronomy br br br The Choking Doberman br Patricia T O Connor writer for The New York Times described The Choking Doberman and Other New Urban Legends as a collection of urban legends fictitious narratives that are passed from person to person in the guise of true stories and sometimes persist until they reach the status of folklore These stories are bizarre but believable and often attributed to a friend of a friend FOAF Like in his book The Vanishing Hitchhiker Brunvand provided the reader with a survey of urban legends stories such as The Choking Doberman The Poison Dress and The Death of Little Mikey Each story with its accompanying variations are categorized into themes and motifs victimized women and children food and beverage contamination fearful encounters sexual embarrassment and humorous retribution br Though Robert D Bethke called The Choking Doberman the kind of work one immediately wants to share with friends he also criticized the work for the rhetorical devises Brunvand used apparently to suit the popular market Critics also pointed out that Brunvand s urban legend books raise a question about race and stereotypes that to some are left unaddressed Bethke wrote We are told that the stories are projective of American popular culture but precisely what racial segment of the culture participates in the currency of such stories Specifically we are dealing with a phenomenon like the ethnic joke examples of which are told by target groups or is the urban legend essentially a mainstream occurrence I don t think the final word has been written yet on the genre but Jan Brunvand has made admirable strides toward that end br br br The Mexican Pet New Urban Legends br The Mexican Pet New Urban Legends is Brunvand s third book in a series of books about urban legends meant to appeal to a general audience This time Brunvand includes stories collected from colleagues students professional newscasters and appeals through his own publications lectures and media appearances He organized the book in thematic categories animal stories automobiles horrors contaminations sex and scandal crime and products professionals and personalities There are new versions of earlier legends newly obtained pieces and leftovers from his files Among the stories included in the book are The Mexican Pet Cabbage Patch Kids death certificates The Green Stamps Many of the stories have been disseminated through print and broadcast media br Brunvand wrote in a article Nowadays it would be naive to ask for mere press releases and print articles when most people turn to websites and on line databases for information He recognized that urban legend reference sites like Snopes com provide readers with far more timely examples and current information than he could keep up with in his books br br br Academic books on American folklore br br br The Study of American Folklore An Introduction br The Study of American Folklore An Introduction is a book intended for students of folklore with a particular emphasis on American Folklore as transmitted in the English language For the purposes of this book Brunvand defines folklore as those materials in culture that circulate traditionally among members of any group in different versions whether in oral form or by means of customary example The book is divided into three main categories verbal dialect and speech habits proverbs riddles tales rhymes folk songs ballads partly verbal superstitions customs dances plays and non verbal gestures music handcrafts folk architecture food Within the text Brunvand provided for the reader information on data collecting methods a general assessment of folklore material bibliographic essays and extensive lists of books and articles To some like reviewer Elliott Oring the classification system used by Brunvand made The Study of American Folklore more of an index of American folklore rather than a study of it Reviewer Kenneth Laine Ketner criticized the book for its failure to make explicit the background theory used to evaluate the works and classification system included in the book contradictions in detail and narrative its authoritarian tone and its charismatic or arbitrary approach to knowledge with serious ethnocentric biases Peter Tokofsky in his article Introducing Folklore A Review Essay suggested that the longevity and presumably continuing strong sales of the Brunvand text seems to confirm that introducing folklore by way of genres remains an effective and for many a preferred teaching tool even if it does not reflect the most current theoretical perspectives br br br American Folklore An
