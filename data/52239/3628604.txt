stock market br Rumours of Napoleon s defeat had been circulating throughout the month When the news from Dover began to circulate among traders at the London Stock Exchange the value of government securities increased rapidly However with no official confirmation of the news prices began to drop back only to increase again on reports of the supposed celebrations of the French officers br However the entire affair proved to be a hoax In the afternoon the government confirmed that reports of Napoleon s death and the Bourbon restoration were false The relevant stocks prices immediately fell back to their previous levels br br br Investigation br The Committee of the Stock Exchange suspecting stock manipulation launched an investigation It was soon discovered that there had been a

those found guilty of perjury in England and Wales in Its use was completely discontinued in in England and Wales though the stocks a similar device were used over the rest of the nineteenth century br Lord Cochrane continued to petition the government for redress in he was granted a free pardon including reinstatement to his rank of Rear Admiral Restoration of the Order of the Bath and other honours followed in the subsequent decades and in a Select committee found that his treatment since constituted nothing less than a public recognition by those Governments of his innocence br Lord

Brian Vale s book The Audacious Admiral Cochrane also argues for his guilt In his PhD thesis John Sugden argued that the question of his guilt cannot satisfactorily be resolved Two other historians Christopher Lloyd in and David Cordingly in concluded that Lord Cochrane was innocent br br br Literary references br Security speculation based on allegedly accurate news delivered by semaphore telegraph forms a plot event in the novel The Count of Monte Cristo published br The Great Stock Exchange Fraud forms the basis for the th novel in Patrick O Brian s Aubrey Maturin series The Reverse of the Medal published br The Great Stock Exchange Fraud is a key plot element in Katherine Cowley s The True Confessions of a London Spy published br br br Note br In the terminology of stocks refer to interest bearing securities of the type that are today called bonds The fraud particularly involved government bearer bond instruments called Omniums which were partly paid government bonds where the purchaser initially only had to pay or of the face value and later made further installment payments This feature gave the securities a great deal of price volatility as a small change in the value of the fully paid bonds would represent a much greater change in the value of the partly paid Omniums br br br br br Yapp Nick Great Hoaxes of the World and the hoaxers behind them Robson Books
