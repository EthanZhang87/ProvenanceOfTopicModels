virus It could also be a scam that convinces users to spread the letter to other people for a specific reason or send money or personal information Phishing attacks could fall into this br Urban legends Urban legends are designed to be redistributed and usually warn users of a threat or claim to be notifying them of important or urgent information Another common form are the emails that promise users monetary rewards for forwarding the message or suggest that they are signing something that will be submitted to a particular group Urban legends usually have no negative effect aside from wasted time br In the United States chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants such as the infamous Make Money Fast scheme are illegal br Some colleges and military bases have passed regulations stating that in the private mail of college students and military personnel respectively chain letters are not authorized and will be thrown out However it is often difficult to distinguish chain letters from genuine correspondence br br br Channels br br br Print br br The oldest known channel for chain letters is written or printed on letters on paper These might be exchanged hand to hand or distributed through the mail One notorious early example was the Prosperity Club or Send a Dime letter This letter started in Denver Colorado in based on an earlier luck letter It soon swamped the Denver post office with hundreds of thousands of letters before spilling into St Louis and other cities br br br Email br Some email messages sent as chain letters may seem fairly harmless for example a grammar school student wishing to see how many people can receive their email for a science project but they can grow
