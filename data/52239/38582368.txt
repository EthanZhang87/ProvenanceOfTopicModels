the context These include br br An indication of Dutch written and spoken in Flanders including the Dutch standard language as well as the non standardized dialects including intermediate forms between vernacular dialects and the standard Some linguists avoid the term Flemish in this context and prefer the designation Belgian Dutch or South Dutch br A synonym for the so called intermediate language in Flanders region the Tussentaal br An indication of the non standardized dialects and regiolects of Flanders region br An indication of the non standardized dialects of only the former County of Flanders i e the current provinces of West Flanders and East Flanders Zeelandic Flanders and French Flanders br An indication of the non standardized West Flemish dialects of the province of West Flanders the Dutch Zeelandic Flanders and French Frans Vlaanderen br Glottolog considers Western Flemish to be a separate language classified as a part of the Southwestern Dutch family together with the Zeelandic language According to Glottolog Western Flemish includes the dialects of French Flemish and West Flemish Brabantian and East Flemish are classified as Dutch dialects under the Central Southern Dutch dialect group Ethnologue considers Limburgish and West Flemish to be separate regional languages br br br Characteristics br Dutch is the majority language in northern Belgium being used in written language by three fifths of the population of Belgium It is one of the three national languages of Belgium together with French and German and is the only official language of the Flemish Region br The various Dutch dialects spoken in Belgium contain a number of lexical and grammatical features that distinguish them from the standard Dutch Basic Dutch words can have a completely different meaning in Flemish or imply different context comparable to the differences between the British and North American variants of English As in the Netherlands the pronunciation of Standard Dutch is affected by the native dialect of the speaker br All Dutch dialect groups spoken in Belgium are spoken in adjacent areas of the Netherlands as well East Flemish forms a continuum with both Brabantic and West Flemish Standard Dutch is primarily based on the Hollandic dialect spoken in the Western provinces of the Netherlands and to a lesser extent on Brabantian which is the dominant dialect in Flanders as well as in the south of the Netherlands br br br Tussentaal br The supra regional semi standardized colloquial form mesolect of Dutch spoken in Belgium uses the vocabulary and the sound inventory of the Brabantic dialects It is often called an in between language or intermediate language intermediate between dialects and standard Dutch Despite its name Brabantian is the dominant contributor to the Flemish Dutch tussentaal br It is a rather informal variety of speech which occupies an intermediate position between vernacular dialects and the standard language It incorporates phonetic lexical and grammatical elements not part of the standard language but drawn from local dialects br It is a relatively new phenomenon that has been gaining popularity during the past decades Some linguists note that it seems to be undergoing a process of limited standardisation or that it is evolving into a koin variety br Tussentaal is slowly gaining popularity in Flanders because it is used a lot in television dramas and comedies Often middle class characters in a television series will be speaking tussentaal lower class characters use the dialect of the location where the show is set such as Western Flanders and upper class characters will speak Standard Dutch That has given tussentaal the status of normalcy in Flanders It is slowly being accepted by the general population but it has met with objections from writers and academics who argue that it dilutes the usage of Standard Dutch Tussentaal is used in entertainment television but rarely in informative programmes like the news which normally use Flemish accents with standard Dutch vocabulary br br br Belgicisms br A belgicism is a word or expression that occurs only in the Belgian variant of Dutch Some are rarely used others are used daily and are considered part of the Belgian Dutch standard language Many belgicisms are loanwords and words or expressions literally translated from French also called gallicisms others in contrast are actually remarkably purist such as droogzwierder a compound of Dutch droog dry and zwierder spinner meaning spin dryer common standard Dutch centrifuge a loanword from French and duimspijker a compound of Dutch duim thumb and spijker nail meaning thumbtack common standard Dutch punaise a loanword from French Among the belgicisms there are also many words that are considered obsolete formal or purist in standard Dutch Moreover many belgicisms have their origin in the Belgian official nomenclature For example misdaad felony is not a legal term in the Netherlands but it is in Belgium br br br Etymology br The English adjective Flemish first attested as flemmysshe c compare Fl ming c meaning from Flanders was probably borrowed from Old Frisian The Old Dutch form is fl misk which becomes vlamesc vlaemsch in Middle Dutch and Vlaams in Modern Dutch br The word Vlaams itself is derived from Ingvaeonic fl m from Germanic flauma meaning flooded The name Vlaanderen was formed from a stem fl m with a suffix r dr attached br br br See also br br Belgian French br Dutch in Belgium br French Flemish the West Flemish dialect as
