title: Grievance studies affair
id: 58713610
The grievance studies affair was the project of a team of three authors Peter Boghossian James A Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose to highlight what they saw as poor scholarship and erosion of standards in several academic fields Taking place over and their project entailed submitting bogus papers to academic journals on topics from the field of critical social theory such as cultural queer race gender fat and sexuality studies to determine whether they would pass through peer review and be accepted for publication Several of these papers were subsequently published which the authors cited in support of their contention br The affair echoed Alan Sokal s hoax in Social Text a cultural studies journal which inspired Boghossian Lindsay and Pluckrose br The trio set out with the intent to expose problems in what they called grievance studies referring to academic areas where they claim a culture has developed in which only certain conclusions are allowed and put social grievances ahead of objective truth As such the trio identifying themselves as leftists and liberals described their project as an attempt to raise awareness of what they believed was the damage that postmodernism and identity politics based scholarship was having on leftist political projects as well as on science and academia more broadly br Boghossian Lindsay and Pluckrose wrote articles that promoted deliberately absurd ideas or morally questionable acts and submitted them to various peer reviewed journals Although they had planned for the project to run until January the trio admitted to the hoax in October after journalists from The Wall Street Journal revealed that Helen Wilson the pseudonym used for their article published in Gender Place Culture did not exist By the time of the revelation of their papers had been published had been accepted but not yet published had been rejected and were still under review Included among the articles that were published were arguments that dogs engage in rape culture and that men could reduce their transphobia by anally penetrating themselves with sex toys as well as a part of a chapter of Adolf Hitler s Mein Kampf rewritten in feminist language The first of these had won special recognition from the journal that published it br The hoax received a polarized reception within academia Some academics praised it for exposing flaws that they saw as widespread among sectors of the humanities and social sciences influenced by postmodernism critical theory and identity politics Others criticised what they perceived as the unethical nature of submitting deliberately bogus research Some critics also asserted that the work did not represent a scientific investigation given that the project did not include a control group further arguing that invalid arguments and poor standards of peer review were not restricted to grievance studies subjects but found across much of academia br br Through their series of hoax articles James A Lindsay Peter Boghossian and Helen Pluckrose intended to expose issues in what they term as grievance studies a subcategory of academic areas where the three believe a culture has developed in which only certain conclusions are allowed and put social grievances ahead of objective truth The trio referred to several academic fields postcolonial theory gender studies queer theory critical race theory intersectional feminism and fat studies as grievance studies because according to Pluckrose such areas begin from the assumption of a grievance and then bend the available theories to confirm it Pluckrose argued that all of these fields derive their underlying theoretical perspectives from the postmodern philosophy that developed in the late s Focusing on the work of French postmodern philosopher Michel Foucault she highlighted how he argued that knowledge and power were interwoven and emphasized the role of discourse in society br Pluckrose suggested that fields such as postcolonial theory and queer theory could be called applied postmodernism in that they sprung up largely in the late s as a means of pushing the gains of the civil rights movement gay rights movement and liberal feminism from the arena of legislative change and into the territory of reshaping discourse She argued that these fields adapted postmodernism to suit their activist agendas From postmodernism they adopted the idea that knowledge is a social construct but at the same time they held to the modernist view that no progress could be made unless some things were objectively true Thus the applied postmodernists Pluckrose argued insisted that systems of power and privilege that oppressed women people of color and the LGBT are objectively real and could be revealed by analyzing discourses At the same time she argued they retained postmodernism s skepticism toward science and objective knowledge its view of society as a system of power and privilege and commitment to the belief that all imbalances are socially constructed rather than arising from biological reality br Pluckrose described herself and her collaborators as being left wing liberal skeptics She stated that a core reason for why they wanted to carry out the project was to convince other leftist academics that there was a problem with corrupted scholarship in academic fields that were based on identity politics and postmodernism She argued that in rejecting modernism much postmodernist derived scholarship was also rejecting science reason and liberal democracy and thus undermining many important progressive gains Pluckrose also expressed concern that in both foregrounding the importance of group identity and facilitating the growth of post truth by claiming that there is no objective truth this postmodernist theory was contributing to the reactionary surge to the right seen in many countries during the s br br Prior to the affair various academics highlighted concerns about the intellectual validity of much research influenced by postmodern philosophy and critical theory by publishing hoax articles in various journals It was the hoax by Alan Sokal in Social Text in particular that influenced James A Lindsay and Peter Boghossian to publish a hoax article of their own br On May peer reviewed journal Cogent Social Sciences published The conceptual penis as a social construct which argued that penises are not male rather they should be analyzed as social constructs instead The same day Lindsay and Boghossian revealed it to be a hoax aimed at discrediting gender studies although Cogent Social Sciences is not exclusively a gender studies journal While the journal did conduct a postmortem both authors concluded the impact of the hoax was very limited and much criticism of it was legitimate br br The authors claim to have started their second attempt on August with Helen Pluckrose joining them in September The new methodology called for the submission of multiple papers each of which would be submitted to higher ranked journals if it were rejected feedback from the peer review process was used to revise the paper before it was submitted to a lower ranked journal This process was repeated until the paper was accepted or until the three authors gave up on that paper The authorship of each paper was either fictional such as Helen Wilson of Portland Ungendering Research Initiative or real people willing to lend their name such as Richard Baldwin professor emeritus of history at Gulf Coast State College br Over the course of the project twenty papers were submitted and forty eight new submissions of those papers were made The first acceptance Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity at the Dog Park was achieved five months after the project began During the initial peer review for its second and ultimately successful attempt at publication in Gender Place Culture what the hoaxers called the Dog Park paper was praised by the first reviewer as incredibly innovative rich in analysis and extremely well written and organized Similar respectful feedback was provided for other accepted papers br br The project was intended to run until January but came to a premature end On June the Twitter account New Real Peer Review discovered one of their papers This brought it to the attention of reporters at The College Fix Reason and other news outlets who began trying to contact the fictional author and journal it was published in The journal Gender Place Culture published a note on August stating that it suspected Helen Wilson had breached their contract to not fabricate or misappropriate anyone s identity including their own adding that the author has not responded to our request to provide appropriate documentation confirming their identity According to the trio another journal and a reporter at The Wall Street Journal were asking for proof of identity at this point and that it was the right time to go public they admitted the hoax to the journalist in early August br When The Wall Street Journal report went public on October the trio released an essay describing their project as well as a Google Drive archive of most of their papers and email correspondence which included reviewer comments Simultaneously filmmaker Mike Nayna released a video on YouTube revealing the story behind the project As of Nayna and producer Mark Conway were working on a documentary film about the project br br The project drew both praise and criticism The science writer Tom Chivers suggested that the result was a predictable furore whereby those already skeptical of gender studies hailed it as evidence for how the whole field is riddled with nonsense while those sympathetic to gender studies thought it was dishonestly undermining good scholarship br The political scientist Yascha Mounk dubbed it Sokal squared in reference to the Sokal affair hoax accomplished by Alan Sokal and said that the result is hilarious and delightful It also showcases a serious problem with big parts of academia The psychologist Steven Pinker said the project posed the question is there any idea so outlandish that it won t be published in a Critical PoMo Identity Theory journal In contrast Joel P Christensen and Matthew A Sears both classicists referred to it as the academic equivalent of the fraudulent hit pieces on Planned Parenthood produced in more interested in publicity than valid argumentation or scholarship br In The Atlantic Mounk said that Like just about everything else in this depressing national moment Sokal Squared is already being used as ammunition in the great American culture war He characterized two sets of responses to the affair as intellectually dishonest right wing responses that used the affair to discredit wider academia and left wing responses that treated it as a politically motivated attack on academia He said the former overlooked that There are many fields of academia that have absolutely no patience for nonsense including the fact that all the papers submitted to sociology journals had been rejected while the latter attacked the motives behind the hoax instead of refuting it br br Ann Garry a co editor of Hypatia which had accepted one of the hoax papers When the Joke s on You which purported to be a feminist critique of hoaxes but had not published it yet said she was deeply disappointed by the hoax Garry told The New York Times that Referees put in a great deal of time and effort to write meaningful reviews and the idea that individuals would submit fraudulent academic material violates many ethical and academic norms Nicholas Mazza editor of the Journal of Poetry Therapy said Although a valuable point was learned regarding the authenticity of articles authors the authors of the study clearly engaged in flawed and unethical research br br Mounk of Johns Hopkins University said that while the authors received no favors for preparing the hoax they demonstrated mastery in postmodern jargon and not only ridiculed the journals in question but more importantly outed double standards of gender studies which happily welcome hoaxes against morally suspect fields like economics but are unable to accept a criticism of their own methods He also noted the sheer amount of tribal solidarity it has elicited among leftists and academics and the fact that many of the reactions were purely ad hominem while few have actually noted that there is an actual problem highlighted by the hoax some of the leading journals in areas like gender studies have failed to distinguish between real scholarship and intellectually vacuous as well as morally troubling bullshit Rejecting complaints that the trio lacking a control group engaged in a confused attempt to import statistics into a question where it doesn t apply Mounk stated that the trio had promised nothing of the sort in the first place and had instead successfully accomplished their goal of demonstrating that it was possible to get bullshit published in the journals in question br Justin E H Smith defended hoaxing as an intellectual or scholarly practice providing a series of examples of hoaxes ranging from the Italian Renaissance to the s In The Chronicle of Higher Education Heather E Heying pointed out that the hoax helped to expose many pathologies of the modern social sciences such as repudiation of science and logic and extolling activism over inquiry br Upon Boghossian s employer Portland State University initiating a research misconduct inquiry on the grounds of conducting human subject based research without approval and further considering a charge of fabricating data a number of prominent academics submitted letters of support to him and defended the motive of the hoax including Steven Pinker and various Portland State students Richard Dawkins compared Boghossian to a novelist pointing out that George Orwell s novel Animal Farm could be criticized for its many falsehoods regarding the capabilities of animals to speak English He asked br br Do your humourless colleagues who brought this action want Portland State to become the laughing stock of the academic world Or at least the world of serious scientific scholarship uncontaminated by pretentious charlatans of exactly the kind Dr Boghossian and his colleagues were satirising br The psychologist Jonathan Haidt stated that the inquiry would be a profound moral error an injustice that will be obvious to all who hear about your decision and that will have bad effects upon the public perception of PSU and of universities in general and concluded that Boghossian and his co authors are whistleblowers who undertook a career risking project to stand up for academic integrity by exposing what is arguably an academic subculture that tolerates intellectual fraud Philosopher Daniel Dennett stated that Boghossian s targets could learn a few things about academic integrity from his fine example undertaken in good faith Alan Sokal and Jordan Peterson also supported Boghossian br The World Socialist Web Site s Eric London said the hoax was a well timed blow against the identity politics industry and postmodernism br br On Slate Daniel Engber wrote that the hoaxers project say s nothing whatsoever about the fields the hoaxers chose to target Since w e know from long experience that expert peer review offers close to no protection against outright data fraud Engber asserted that one could have run this sting on almost any empirical discipline and returned the same result even if such disciplines journals were peer reviewed echoing Tim Smith Laing s The Daily Telegraph article br Sarah Richardson Harvard University professor of women s studies criticized the hoaxers for not including a control group in their experiment telling BuzzFeed News By their own standards we can t scientifically conclude anything from it br Evolutionary biologist Carl T Bergstrom in The Chronicle of Higher Education wrote that the hoaxers appear woefully na ve about how the system actually works adding that peer review is not designed to remove fraud or even absurd ideas and that replication will lead to self correction In the same article David Schieber said he was one of the two anonymous reviewers for Rubbing One Out and argued that the hoaxers selectively quoted from his review They were turning my attempt to help the authors of a rejected paper into an indictment of my field and the journal I reviewed for even though we rejected the paper br Ten Portland State University professors signed an open letter saying the hoax was not comparable to the Sokal affair the latter taking place during a time of debate and exploration in the field of philosophy and science and that the trio were only exploiting credulous journalists interested mainly in spectacle to conduct academic fraud They compared the trio s style to Trumpist politics and wrote that d esperate reasoning basic spite and a perverse interest in public humiliation seem to have overridden any actual scholarly goals The authors asked to remain anonymous alleging Boghossian had targeted academics at other institutions and that they would likely receive threats of death and assault from online trolls br An n article pointed out blatant manipulation of its own data the lack of meaningful controls br In UnHerd Chivers noted that while the so called grievance studies fields probably contain more bullshit than most scientific fields the hoax drew attention away from scholarly shoddiness across the entirety of academia including the whole of science especially psychology and medicine He highlighted that several weeks prior to the hoax s public revelation professor of food behaviour Brian Wansink had resigned from his position at Cornell University following exposure of instances of scientific misconduct on his part br Mikko Lagerspetz analyzed the project s experimental design and its possible results based on the peer reviews and editorial decisions available through the project s website He sums it up on the journal Science Technology and Human Values br br journals with higher impact factors were more likely to reject papers submitted as part of the project the chances were better if the manuscript was allegedly based on empirical data peer reviews can be an important asset in the process of revising a manuscript and when the project authors with academic education from neighboring disciplines closely followed the reviewers advice they were able to learn relatively quickly what is needed for writing an acceptable article The boundary between a seriously written paper and a hoax gradually became blurred Finally the way the project ended showed that in the long run the scientific community will uncover fraudulent practices br He concludes that the experiment was flawed both experimentally and ethically and failed to provide the evidence it sought It is unclear on what grounds the project group decided what journals to target One third of the final editorial decisions the authors received were positive two thirds of the decisions were negative In the absence of a control group it is impossible to tell whether this proportion would have been lower or higher within other disciplines br br Helen Wilson pseudonym Human
