journalist Anna Polyanskaya a former assistant to assassinated Russian politician Galina Starovoitova and two other authors Andrey Krivov and Ivan Lomako The authors claim that up to contributions to forums on Russian Internet sites Runet predominantly reflected liberal and democratic values but after the vast majority of contributions reflected totalitarian values This sudden change was attributed to the appearance of teams of pro Russian commenters who appeared to be organized by the Russian state security service According to the authors about of Russian Internet posters were of generally liberal views prior to while a surge of antidemocratic posts about suddenly occurred at many Russian forums in This could also be a reflection to the fact that access to Internet among the general Russian population soared during this time which was until then accessible only to some sections of the society br In January a hacktivist group calling itself the Russian arm of Anonymous published a massive collection of email allegedly belonging to former and present leaders of the pro Putin youth organization Nashi including a number of government officials Journalists who investigated the leaked information found that the pro Putin movement had engaged in a range of activities including paying commentators to post content and hijacking blog ratings in the fall of The e mails indicated that members of the brigades were paid rubles about US or more per comment depending on whether the comment received replies Some were paid as much as roubles about US for leaving hundreds of comments on negative press articles on the internet and were presented with iPads A number of high profile bloggers were also mentioned as being paid for promoting Nashi and government activities The Federal Youth Agency whose head and the former leader of Nashi Vasily Yakemenko was the highest ranking individual targeted by the leaks refused to comment on the authenticity of the e mails br In a Freedom House report stated that of countries examined have been using paid pro government commentators to manipulate online discussions and that Russia has been at the forefront of this practice for several years along with China and Bahrain In the same year Russian reporters investigated the St Petersburg Internet Research Agency which employs at least people They found that the agency covertly hired young people as Internet operators paid to write pro Russian postings and comments smearing opposition leader Alexei Navalny and U S politics and culture br br Each commenter was to write no less than comments a day while people in the other room were to write four postings a day which then went to the other employees whose job was to post them on social networks as widely as possible Some Russian opposition journalists state that such practices create a chilling effect on the few independent media outlets remaining in the country br Further investigations were performed by Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and Institute of Modern Russia in inspired by the peak of activity of the pro Russian brigades during the Russo Ukrainian War and assassination of Boris Nemtsov The effort of using troll armies to promote Putin s policies is reported to be a multimillion dollar operation According to an investigation by the British Guardian newspaper the flood of pro Russian comments is part of a coordinated informational psychological war operation One Twitter bot network was documented to use more than fake Twitter accounts to spam negative comments after the death of Boris Nemtsov and events related to the Ukrainian conflict br An article based on the original Polyanskaya article authored by the Independent Customers Association was published in May at

celebrities and politicians along with over global news outlets identified to have inadvertently shared content from Russian troll farm accounts br br br Methods br Web brigades commentators sometimes leave hundreds of postings a day that criticize the country s opposition and promote Kremlin backed policymakers Commentators simultaneously react to discussions of taboo topics including the historical role of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin political opposition dissidents such as Mikhail Khodorkovsky murdered journalists and cases of international conflict or rivalry with countries such as Estonia Georgia and Ukraine but also with the foreign policies of the United States and the European Union Prominent journalist and Russia expert Peter Pomerantsev believes Russia s efforts are aimed at confusing the audience rather than convincing it He states that they cannot censor information but can trash it with conspiracy theories and rumours br To avert suspicions the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on travelling cooking and pets They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible br br The effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big but they manage to make certain forums meaningless because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive hostile atmosphere toward those whom they don t like The trolls react to certain news with torrents of mud and abuse This makes it meaningless for a reasonable person to comment on anything there br A collection of leaked documents published by Moy Rayon suggests that work at the troll den is strictly regulated by a set of guidelines Any blog post written by an agency employee according to the leaked files must contain no fewer than characters during day shifts and no fewer than characters on night shifts Use of graphics and keywords in the post s body and headline is also mandatory In
