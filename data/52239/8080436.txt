id: 8080436
Website spoofing is the act of creating a website with the intention of misleading readers that the website has been created by a different person or organization Normally the spoof website will adopt the design of the target website and it sometimes has a similar URL A more sophisticated attack results in an attacker creating a shadow copy of the World Wide Web by having all of the victim s traffic go through the attacker s machine causing the attacker to obtain the victim s sensitive information br Another technique is to use a cloaked URL By using domain forwarding or inserting control characters the URL can appear to be genuine while concealing the actual address of the malicious website Punycode can also be used for this purpose Punycode based attacks exploit the similar characters in different writing systems in common fonts For example on one large font the greek letter tau is similar in appearance to the Latin lowercase letter t However the greek letter tau is represented in punycode as xa while the Latin lowercase letter is simply represented as t since it is present on the ASCII system In a security researcher managed to register the domain xn ak aa e com and have it show on several mainstream browsers as apple com While the characters used didn t belong to the latin script due to the default font on those browsers the end result was non latin characters that were indistinguishable from those on the latin script br The objective may be fraudulent often associated with phishing or e mail spoofing or to criticize or make fun of the person or body whose website the spoofed site purports to represent Because the purpose is often malicious spoof an expression whose base meaning is innocent parody is a poor term for this activity so that more accountable organisations such as government departments and banks tend to avoid it preferring more explicit descriptors such as fraudulent or phishing br As an example of the use of this technique to parody an organisation in November two spoof websites www msfirefox com and www msfirefox net were produced claiming that Microsoft had bought Firefox and released Microsoft Firefox br br br Prevention tools br br br Anti phishing software br Spoofed websites predominate in efforts developing anti phishing software though there are concerns about their effectiveness A majority of efforts are focused on the PC market leaving mobile devices lacking You can see from the table below that few user studies have been run against the current tools in the market br br br DNS filtering br DNS is the layer at which botnets control drones In OpenDNS began offering a free service to prevent users from entering website spoofing sites Essentially OpenDNS has gathered a large database from various anti phishing and anti botnet organizations as well as its own data to compile a list of known website spoofing offenders When a user attempts to access one of these bad websites they are blocked at the DNS level APWG statistics show that most phishing attacks use URLs not domain names so there would be a large amount of website spoofing that OpenDNS would be unable to track At the time of release OpenDNS is unable to prevent unnamed phishing exploits that sit on Yahoo Google etc br br br See also br Email spoofing Creating email spam or phishing messages with a forged sender identity or address br Fake news website Website that deliberately publishes hoaxes and disinformation br Login spoofing Techniques used to steal a user s password br Phishing Form of social engineering br Spoofing attack Cyber attack in which a person or program successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data br Referer spoofing Practice in HTTP networking of intentionally sending incorrect referer information br br br
