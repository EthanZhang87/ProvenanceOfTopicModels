id: 35842043
Whataboutism or whataboutery as in what about is a pejorative for the strategy of responding to an accusation with a counter accusation instead of a defense against the original accusation br From a logical and argumentative point of view whataboutism is considered a variant of the tu quoque pattern Latin you too term for a counter accusation which is a subtype of the ad hominem argument br The communication intent is often to distract from the content of a topic red herring The goal may also be to question the justification for criticism and the legitimacy integrity and fairness of the critic which can take on the character of discrediting the criticism which may or may not be justified Common accusations include double standards and hypocrisy but it can also be used to relativize criticism of one s own viewpoints or behaviors A Long term unemployment often means poverty in Germany B And what about the starving in Africa and Asia Related manipulation and propaganda techniques in the sense of rhetorical evasion of the topic are the change of topic and false balance bothsidesism br Some commentators have defended the usage of whataboutism and tu quoque in certain contexts Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair and behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be appropriate in a given geopolitical neighborhood Accusing an interlocutor of whataboutism can also in itself be manipulative and serve the motive of discrediting as critical talking points can be used selectively and purposefully even as the starting point of the conversation cf agenda setting framing framing effect priming cherry picking The deviation from them can then be branded as whataboutism Both whataboutism and the accusation of it are forms of strategic framing and have a framing effect br br The term whataboutism is a portmanteau of what and about is synonymous with whataboutery and means to twist criticism back on the initial critic br br According to lexicographer Ben Zimmer the term originated in Northern Ireland in the s Zimmer cites a letter by history teacher Sean O Conaill which was published in The Irish Times where he complained about the Whatabouts people who defended the IRA by pointing out supposed wrongdoings of their enemy br br I would not suggest such a thing were it not for the Whatabouts These are the people who answer every condemnation of the Provisional I R A with an argument to prove the greater immorality of the enemy and therefore the justice of the Provisionals cause What about Bloody Sunday internment torture force feeding army intimidation Every call to stop is answered in the same way What about the Treaty of Limerick the Anglo Irish treaty of Lenadoon Neither is the Church immune The Catholic Church has never supported the national cause What about Papal sanction for the Norman invasion condemnation of the Fenians by Moriarty Parnell br Three days later an opinion column by John Healy in the same paper entitled Enter the cultural British Army picked up the theme by using the term whataboutery As a correspondent noted in a recent letter to this paper we are very big on Whatabout Morality matching one historic injustice with another justified injustice We have a bellyfull sic of Whataboutery in these killing days and the one clear fact to emerge is that people Orange and Green are dying as a result of it Zimmer says the term gained wide currency in commentary about the conflict between unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland Zimmer also notes that the variant whataboutism was used in the same context in a book by Tony Parker br In Australian journalist Michael Bernard wrote a column in The Age applying the term whataboutism to the Soviet Union s tactics of deflecting any criticism of its human rights abuses Merriam Webster details that the association of whataboutism with the Soviet Union began during the Cold War As the regimes of Joseph Stalin and his successors were criticized by the West for human rights atrocities the Soviet propaganda machine would be ready with a comeback alleging atrocities of equal reprehensibility for which the West was guilty br Zimmer credits British journalist Edward Lucas for beginning regular common use of the word whataboutism in the modern era following its appearance in a blog post on October reporting as part of a diary about Russia which was re printed in the November issue of The Economist On January The Economist printed another article by Lucas titled Whataboutism Ivan Tsvetkov associate professor of International Relations in St Petersburg also credits Lucas for modern uses of the term br br The philosopher Merold Westphal said that only people who know themselves to be guilty of something can find comfort in finding others to be just as bad or worse Whataboutery as practiced by both parties in The Troubles in Northern Ireland to highlight what the other side had done to them was one of the commonest forms of evasion of personal moral responsibility according to Bishop later Cardinal Cahal Daly After a political shooting at a baseball game in journalist Chuck Todd criticized the tenor of political debate commenting What about ism is among the worst instincts of partisans on both sides br br Whataboutism usually points the finger at a rival s offenses to discredit them but in a reversal of this usual direction it can also be used to discredit oneself while one refuses to critique an ally During the U S presidential campaign when The New York Times asked candidate Donald Trump about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo an s treatment of journalists teachers and dissidents Trump replied with a criticism of U S history on civil liberties Writing for The Diplomat Catherine Putz pointed out The core problem is that this rhetorical device precludes discussion of issues e g civil rights by one country e g the United States if that state lacks a perfect record Masha Gessen wrote for The New York Times that usage of the tactic by Trump was shocking to Americans commenting No American politician in living memory has advanced the idea that the entire world including the United States was rotten to the core br br Joe Austin was critical of the practice of whataboutism in Northern Ireland in a piece The Obdurate and the Obstinate writing And I d no time at all for What aboutism if you got into it you were defending the indefensible In The New Yorker described the tactic as a strategy of false moral equivalences and Clarence Page called the technique a form of logical jiu jitsu Writing for National Review commentator Ben Shapiro criticized the practice whether it was used by those espousing right wing or left wing politics Shapiro concluded It s all dumb And it s making us all dumber Michael J Koplow of Israel Policy Forum wrote that the usage of whataboutism had become a crisis concluding that the tactic did not yield any benefits Koplow charged that whataboutism from either the right or the left only leads to a black hole of angry recriminations from which nothing will escape br br Some commentators have defended the usage of whataboutism and tu quoque in certain contexts Whataboutism can provide necessary context into whether or not a particular line of critique is relevant or fair In international relations behavior that may be imperfect by international standards may be quite good for a given geopolitical neighborhood and deserves to be recognized as such br br Christian Christensen Professor of Journalism in Stockholm argues that the accusation of whataboutism is itself a form of the tu quoque fallacy as it dismisses criticisms of one s own behavior to focus instead on the actions of another thus creating a double standard Those who use whataboutism are not necessarily engaging in an empty or cynical deflection of responsibility whataboutism can be a useful tool to expose contradictions double standards and hypocrisy For example one s opponent s action appears as forbidden torture one s own actions as enhanced interrogation methods the other s violence as aggression one s own merely as a reaction Christensen even sees utility in the use of the argument The so called whataboutists question what has not been questioned before and bring contradictions double standards and hypocrisy to light This is not na ve justification or rationalization it is a challenge to think critically about the sometimes painful truth of our position in the world br br In his analysis of Whataboutism logic professor Axel Barcel of the UNAM concludes that the counteraccusation often expresses a justified suspicion that the criticism does not correspond to the critic s real position and reasons br Abe Greenwald pointed out that even the first accusation leading to the counteraccusation is an arbitrary setting which can be just as one sided and biased or even more one sided than the counter question what about Thus whataboutism could also be enlightening and put the first accusation in perspective br br In her analysis of whataboutism in the US Presidential Campaign Catherine Putz notes in in The Diplomat Magazine that the core problem is that this rhetorical device precludes discussion of a country s contentious issues e g civil rights on the part of the United States if that country is not perfect in that area It required by default that a country be allowed to make a case to other countries only for those ideals in which it had achieved the highest level of perfection The problem with ideals he said is that we rarely achieve them as human beings But the ideals remain important he said and the United States should continue to advocate for them It is the message that is important not the ambassador br br Gina Schad sees the characterization of counterarguments as whataboutism as a lack of communicative competence insofar as discussions are cut off by this accusation The accusation of others of whataboutism is also used as an ideological protective mechanism that leads to closures and echo chambers The reference to whataboutism is also perceived as a discussion stopper to secure a certain hegemony of discourse and interpretation br br A number of commentators among them Forbes columnist Mark Adomanis have criticized the usage of accusations of whataboutism by American news outlets arguing that accusations of whataboutism have been used to simply deflect criticisms of human rights abuses perpetrated by the United States or its allies Vincent Bevins and Alex Lo argue that the usage of the term almost exclusively by American outlets is a double standard and that moral accusations made by powerful countries are merely a pretext to punish their geopolitical rivals in the face of their own wrongdoing br Left wing academics Kristen Ghodsee and Scott Sehon argue that mentioning the possible existence of victims of capitalism in popular discourse is often dismissed as whataboutism which they describe as a term implying that only atrocities perpetrated by communists merit attention They also argue that such accusations of whataboutism are invalid as the same arguments used against communism can also be used against capitalism br Scholars Ivan Franceschini and Nicholas Loubere argue it is not whataboutism to document and denounce authoritarianism in different countries and noted global parallels such as the role Islamophobia played in China s Xinjiang internment camps and the US s War on terror and travel bans targeting Muslim countries as well as influence of corporations and other international actors in the documented abuses which is becoming more obscured Franceschini and Loubere conclude that authoritarianism must be opposed everywhere and that only by finding the critical parallels linkages and complicities can we develop immunity to the virus of whataboutism and avoid its essentialist hyperactive immune response achieving the moral consistency and holistic perspective that we need in order to build up international solidarity and stop sleepwalking towards the abyss br br Jesus statement Let he who is without fault cast the first stone John the similar parable of the beam in the eye Matthew and proverbs based on it such as He who sits in a glass house should not throw stones are sometimes compared to whataboutism Nigel Warburton sees the difference in the fact that the point of view in the Bible and in Proverbs is different from that in politics Jesus is in the right to remind the sinner of his own guilt because he himself has no guilt he is on the side of good Although a wrongdoer can sometimes be in the right by pointing out an actual shortcoming this does not change the difference in principle The whataboutery move seems to rest on the false assumption that wrongdoing is mitigated if others have done something similar and the feeling that accusers need to be innocent of the crime of which they are accusing others You think I m doing something terrible so look around you at all the others doing much the same as me What is more you don t have a credible position from which to attack me At best that is just self serving rationalisation but as a tactical move it can work br br Although the term whataboutism spread recently Edward Lucas s Economist article states that Soviet propagandists during the cold war were trained in a tactic that their western interlocutors nicknamed whataboutism Any criticism of the Soviet Union Afghanistan martial law in Poland imprisonment of dissidents censorship was met with a What about apartheid South Africa jailed trade unionists the Contras in Nicaragua and so forth Lucas recommended two methods of properly countering whataboutism to use points made by Russian leaders themselves so that they cannot be applied to the West and for Western nations to engage in more self criticism of their own media and government In his book The New Cold War Putin s Russia and the Threat to the West Edward Lucas characterized whataboutism as the favourite weapon of Soviet propagandists br Following the publication of Lucas s and articles and his book opinion writers at prominent English language media outlets began using the term and echoing the themes laid out by Lucas including the association with the Soviet Union and Russia Journalist Luke Harding described Russian whataboutism as practically a national ideology Juhan Kivir hk and colleagues called it a polittechnological strategy br Writing in The National Interest in Samuel Charap was critical of the tactic commenting Russian policy makers meanwhile gain little from petulant bouts of whataboutism National security journalist Julia Ioffe commented in a article Anyone who has ever studied the Soviet Union knows about a phenomenon called whataboutism Ioffe said that Russia Today was an institution that is dedicated solely to the task of whataboutism and concluded that whataboutism was a sacred Russian tactic Garry Kasparov discussed the Soviet tactic in his book Winter Is Coming calling it a form of Soviet propaganda and a way for Russian bureaucrats to respond to criticism of Soviet massacres forced deportations and gulags Mark Adomanis commented for The Moscow Times in that Whataboutism was employed by the Communist Party with such frequency and shamelessness that a sort of pseudo mythology grew up around it Adomanis observed Any student of Soviet history will recognize parts of the whataboutist canon br Writing in for Bloomberg News journalist Leonid Bershidsky called whataboutism a Russian tradition while The National called the tactic an effective rhetorical weapon In their book The European Union and Russia Forsberg and Haukkala characterized whataboutism as an old Soviet practice and they observed that the strategy has been gaining in prominence in the Russian attempts at deflecting Western criticism In her book Security Threats and Public Perception author Elizaveta Gaufman called the whataboutism technique A Soviet Russian spin on liberal anti Americanism comparing it to the Soviet rejoinder And you are lynching negroes Foreign Policy supported this assessment Daphne Skillen discussed the tactic in her book Freedom of Speech in Russia identifying it as a Soviet propagandist s technique and a common Soviet era defence Writing for Bloomberg News Leonid Bershidsky called whataboutism a Russian tradition while The New Yorker described the technique as a strategy of false moral equivalences br In a piece for CNN Jill Dougherty compared the technique to the pot calling the kettle black Dougherty wrote There s another attitude that many Russians seem to share what used to be called in the Soviet Union whataboutism in other words who are you to call the kettle black Julia Ioffe called whataboutism a sacred Russian tactic and also compared it to accusing the pot calling the kettle black br Russian journalist Alexey Kovalev told GlobalPost in that the tactic was an old Soviet trick Peter Conradi author of Who Lost Russia called whataboutism a form of moral relativism that responds to criticism with the simple response But you do it too Conradi echoed Gaufman s comparison of the tactic to the Soviet response Over there they lynch Negroes Writing for Forbes in journalist Melik Kaylan explained the term s increased pervasiveness in referring to Russian propaganda tactics Kremlinologists of recent years call this whataboutism because the Kremlin s various mouthpieces deployed the technique so exhaustively against the U S Kaylan commented upon a suspicious similarity between Kremlin propaganda and Trump propaganda Foreign Policy wrote that Russian whataboutism was part of the national psyche EurasiaNet stated that Moscow s geopolitical whataboutism skills are unmatched while Paste correlated whataboutism s rise with the increasing societal consumption of fake news br br Several articles connected whataboutism to the Soviet era by pointing to the And you are lynching Negroes example as Lucas did of the s in which the Soviets deflected any criticism by referencing racism in the segregated American South The tactic was extensively used even after the racial segregation in the South was outlawed in the s and s Ioffe who has written about whataboutism in at least three separate outlets called it a classic example of whataboutism citing the Soviet response to criticism And you are lynching negroes as a classic form of whataboutism br The Soviet government engaged in a major cover up of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in When they finally acknowledged the disaster although without any details the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union TASS then discussed the Three Mile Island accident and other American nuclear accidents which Serge Schmemann of The New York Times wrote was an example of the common Soviet tactic of whataboutism The mention of a commission also indicated to observers the seriousness of the incident and subsequent state radio broadcasts were replaced with classical music which was a common method of preparing the public for an announcement of a tragedy in the USSR br In Canadian columnist Terry Glavin asserted in the Ottawa Citizen that Noam Chomsky used the tactic in an October speech delivered after the September attacks that was critical of US foreign policy In Putin replied to George W Bush s criticism of Russia s human rights record by stating that he did not want to head a democracy like Iraq s referencing the US intervention in Iraq br Some writers also identified examples in when Russian officials responded to critique by for example redirecting attention to the United Kingdom s anti protest laws or Russians difficulty obtaining a visa to the United Kingdom br The term receives increased attention when controversies involving Russia are in the news For example writing for Slate in Joshua Keating noted the use of whataboutism in a statement on Russia s annexation of Crimea where Putin listed a litany of complaints about Western intervention br RT a Russian state controlled international news source portrayed the Baltimore and Ferguson protests in America with tones of whataboutism Its coverage narrowly fixated on sensationalizing the perceived dissolution of the US judicial system Additionally it depicted the US government as inept while manipulating video footages by darkening them to create a more ominous tone br In Ben Zimmer noted that Putin also used the tactic in an interview with NBC News journalist Megyn Kelly br br The practice of labelling whataboutism as typically Russian or Soviet is sometimes rejected as russophobic Glenn Diesen sees this usage as an attempt to delegitimize Russian politics As early as Ronald Reagan had introduced the construct of false ethical balance to denounce any attempt at comparison between the US and other countries Jeane Kirkpatrick in her essay The Myth of Moral Equivalence saw the Soviet Union s whataboutism as an attempt to use moral reasoning to present themselves as a legitimate superpower on an equal footing with the United States The comparison was inadmissible in principle since there was only one legitimate superpower the USA and it did not stand up for power interests but for values Glenn Diesen sees this as a framing of American politics with the aim of defining the relationship of countries to each other analogously to a teacher pupil relationship whereby in the political framework the USA is the teacher Kirkpatrick invoked Harold Lasswell s understanding of the enforcement of an ideological framework using political dominance to analyze the semantic manipulations of the Soviet Union According to Lasswell every country tries to impose its interpretive framework on others even by the means of revolution and war For Kirkpatrick however these interpretive frameworks of different states are not equivalent br br A synonymous Chinese language metaphor is the stinky bug argument traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin Ch uch ngl n coined by Lu Xun a leading figure in modern Chinese literature in to describe his Chinese colleagues common tendency to accuse Europeans of having equally bad issues whenever foreigners commented upon China s domestic problems As a Chinese nationalist Lu saw this mentality as one of the biggest obstructions to the modernization of China in the early th century which Lu frequently mocked in his literary works In response to tweets from Donald Trump s administration criticizing the Chinese government s mistreatment of ethnic minorities and the pro democracy protests in Hong Kong Chinese Foreign Ministry officials began using Twitter to point out racial inequalities and social unrest in the United States which led Politico to accuse China of engaging in whataboutism br br Writing for The Washington Post former United States Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul wrote critically of Trump s use of the tactic and compared him to Putin McFaul commented That s exactly the kind of argument that Russian propagandists have used for years to justify some of Putin s most brutal policies Los Angeles Times contributor Matt Welch classed the tactic among six categories of Trump apologetics Mother Jones called the tactic a traditional Russian propaganda strategy and observed The whataboutism strategy has made a comeback and evolved in President Vladimir Putin s Russia br In early amid coverage of interference in the election and the lead up to the Mueller Investigation into Donald Trump several people including Edward Lucas wrote opinion pieces associating whataboutism with both Trump and Russia Instead of giving a reasoned defense of his health care plan he went for blunt offense which is a hallmark of whataboutism wrote Danielle Kurtzleben of NPR adding that he sounds an awful lot like Putin br When in a widely viewed television interview that aired before the Super Bowl in Fox News host Bill O Reilly called Putin a killer Trump responded by saying that the US government was also guilty of killing people He responded There are a lot of killers We ve got a lot of killers What do you think our country s so innocent This episode prompted commentators to accuse Trump of whataboutism including Chuck Todd on the television show Meet the Press and political advisor Jake Sullivan br br The term whataboutery has been used by Loyalists and Republicans since the period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland br br The tactic was employed by Azerbaijan which responded to criticism of its human rights record by holding parliamentary hearings on issues in the United States Simultaneously pro Azerbaijan Internet trolls used whataboutism to draw attention away from criticism of the country br The Turkish government engaged in whataboutism by publishing an official document listing criticisms of other governments that had criticized Turkey for its dramatic purge of state institutions and civil society in the wake of a failed coup attempt in July of that year br The tactic was also employed by Saudi Arabia and Israel In Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Israeli occupation is nonsense there are plenty of big countries that occupied and replaced populations and no one talks about them In July the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman engaged in this tactic by raising the killing of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and the torture and abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers during the Iraq War after US President Joe Biden raised the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October by agents of the Saudi government during a conversation with Mohammed as part of Biden s state visit to Saudi Arabia br Iran s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif used the tactic in the Zurich Security Conference on February When pressed by BBC s Lyse Doucet about eight environmentalists imprisoned in his country he mentioned the killing of Jamal Khashoggi Doucet picked up the fallacy and said let s leave that aside br The Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has been accused of using whataboutism especially in regard to the Indian writers protest and the nomination of former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi to parliament br br Whataboutism at Fallacy Check br Whataboutism at Merriam Webster br br Aspeitia Axel
