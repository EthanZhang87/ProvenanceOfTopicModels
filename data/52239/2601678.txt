title: Military deception
id: 2601678
Military deception MILDEC is an attempt by a military unit to gain an advantage during warfare by misleading adversary decision makers into taking action or inaction that creates favorable conditions for the deceiving force This is usually achieved by creating or amplifying an artificial fog of war via psychological operations information warfare visual deception or other methods As a form of disinformation it overlaps with psychological warfare Military deception is also closely connected to operations security OPSEC in that OPSEC attempts to conceal from the adversary critical information about an organization s capabilities activities limitations and intentions or provide a plausible alternate explanation for the details the adversary can observe while deception reveals false information in an effort to mislead the adversary br Deception in warfare dates back to early history The Art of War an ancient Chinese military treatise emphasizes the importance of deception as a way for outnumbered forces to defeat larger adversaries Examples of deception in warfare can be found in ancient Egypt Greece and Rome the Medieval Age the Renaissance and the European Colonial Era Deception was employed during World War I and came into even greater prominence during World War II In modern times the militaries of several nations have evolved deception tactics techniques and procedures into fully fledged doctrine br br br Definition br Many standard military activities can be considered deceptive but not deception For example a unit may move into an assembly area to complete organizing and rehearsing prior to a mission It is a standard deceptive tactic to camouflage the vehicles equipment and personnel in the assembly area with the intent of confusing the enemy Military deception is more complex than simple deceptive activities with a unit deliberately planning and carrying out an elaborate effort that will cause a targeted adversary decision maker to take an action that is detrimental to the adversary and beneficial to the side employing deception br br br Types br br Deception can be accomplished through either increasing or decreasing an adversary s understanding of the operating environment Ambiguity increasing deception is intended to sow confusion in the mind of the enemy decision maker by presenting multiple possible friendly courses of action Because the adversary does not know which is true his reactions are delayed or paralyzed which gives the friendly side an advantage With ambiguity decreasing deception the friendly side intends to make the adversary certain of the friendly course of action certain but wrong As a result the adversary will misallocate time personnel or resources which enables the friendly side to obtain an advantage br The Operation Bodyguard deception in World War II can be viewed as an ambiguity increasing deception that over time became ambiguity decreasing Initially the aim was to increase confusion among German planners and leaders by presenting the possibilities of Allied invasions at the Pas de Calais and Normandy in France as well as the Balkans southern France and Norway Eventually the deception increased certainty on the German side by causing them to conclude that Calais was the real invasion site When the Allies attacked at Normandy they did so with the advantage of surprise br br br Tactics br Military deception may take place at the tactical operational and strategic levels of warfare The five basic tactics include br br Diversion br Use of feints demonstrations displays or ruses to draw the enemy s attention away from a friendly main effort and induce the enemy to concentrate resources at a time and place that is to the enemy s disadvantage br Example On the night of August the Royal Air Force carried out Operation Hydra the bombing of a World War II rocket research center at Peenem nde a German town on the Baltic Sea Over a period of time the British had conditioned the Germans to expect and respond to attacks on Berlin by sending de Havilland Mosquito bombers along the same route towards the city When the British executed Operation Hydra the Germans believed eight Mosquitoes flying towards Berlin were the vanguard of yet another attack on the same target As a result of this diversion the Germans deployed the majority of their fighter aircraft over Berlin which gave the British an advantage over Peenem nde br Feint br An offensive action involving force on force contact with the adversary which deceives the adversary as to the location and or time of the friendly side s main effort A feint will cause the enemy to concentrate resources at an incorrect time and location A series of feints will condition the enemy to friendly activities in the same location causing the enemy to lower their guard or respond ineffectively to the friendly main effort br Example In May Nazi Germany s Army Group B attacked the Netherlands and Belgium At the same time Army Group A invaded France by attacking through the Ardennes towards the city of Sedan Army Group B s attack was a feint intended to disguise Germany s main effort from British and French military leaders br Demonstration br br A demonstration presents a show of force similar to a feint but avoids actual force on force contact with the adversary The intent of a demonstration is for the adversary to incorrectly determine the time and location of the friendly main effort which gives the friendly side an advantage by causing the adversary to incorrectly allocate resources move to the wrong location or fail to move br Example During the Peninsula campaign of the American Civil War Union commander George B McClellan believed he faced a stronger Confederate force commanded by John B Magruder than he actually did Magruder reinforced McClellan s perception with numerous demonstrations including parading his soldiers where they could be viewed by Union observers concealing them as they moved back to the start point then parading them again within sight of McClellan s observers McClellan concluded that he was outnumbered and decided to retreat br Ruse br The deliberate exposure to the enemy of false information that causes the enemy to reach an incorrect conclusion about friendly intentions and capabilities A ruse is a trick of warfare that relies on guile to contribute to a larger deception plan br Example The creation of the fictional Major William Martin The Man Who Never Was as a British officer carrying important World War II battle plans As part of the Operation Mincemeat deception that concealed the location of the planned Allied invasion of Sicily the Allies intended for the Nazis to acquire the false documents which indicated a planned Allied invasion of Greece and the Balkans and then incorrectly allocate troops and materiel br Display br The static portrayal of activity troops or equipment A display is intended to deceive the adversary s visual observation capability causing him to believe the friendly force is in a location other than where it is that it has a capacity or capability it does not possess or that it does not have a capacity or capability that it does possess br Example The Allied use of sunshields in Operation Bertram and inflatable decoys in Operation Bodyguard during World War II to deceive the enemy as to the size location and objectives of Allied forces br These basic deception tactics are often used in combination with each other as part of a larger deception plan br br br Legality br Adherents to Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions agree not to engage in acts of perfidy during the conduct of warfare Perfidious conduct is a deceitful action in which one side promises to act in good faith with the intention of breaking that promise to gain an advantage Examples include one side raising a flag of truce to entice an enemy to come into the open and take them as prisoners of war then opening fire on the uncovered adversary Additional examples include misusing protected signs and symbols such as the red cross crescent and crystal to conceal weapons and ammunition by making them appear to be a medical facility br br br Axioms maxims and principles br br The development of modern military deception doctrine has led to the codification of several rules and maxims In U S doctrine three of the most important are expressed as Magruder s Principle the Jones Dilemma and Care in the Placement of Deceptive Material Avoid Windfalls br br br Magruder s Principle br Named for Confederate general John B Magruder the principle asserts that it is easier to convince a target into holding on to a pre existing belief than it is to convince a target of something it does not believe Examples include the Allies of World War II making use in the Operation Mincemeat deception of the pre existing German belief that Greece and the Balkans would be their next invasion target after North Africa when the Allies actually intended to invade Sicily br br br Jones Dilemma br Named for British scientist Reginald Victor Jones who played an important role in the Allied effort during World War II the Jones dilemma indicates that the greater the number of intelligence and information gathering and transmitting resources available to the deception target the more difficult it is to deceive the target Conversely the more of the target s intelligence and information systems that are manipulated in a deception plan or denied to the target the more likely the target is to believe the deception One reason the World War II Operation Bodyguard deception was accepted as true on the German side is that Germany s ability to acquire information about activities in England was limited enabling the Allies to manipulate the few German intelligence gathering resources that were available br br br Avoid Windfalls br If a deception target obtains deceptive information too easily too good to be true the target is unlikely to act on it and the deception will fail This requires deception planners to take care in placing deceptive information so that it will appear to have been acquired in a seemingly natural manner The deception target is then able to assemble details from multiple sources into a coherent believable but untrue story The best deception plans co opt the enemy s skepticism through requiring enemy participation either by expending time and resources in obtaining the deceptive information or by devoting significant effort to interpreting it In an example of valid information being dismissed as a windfall early in World War II a plane carrying German officers to Cologne became lost in bad weather and landed in Belgium Before being arrested by Belgian authorities the Germans attempted to burn the papers they were carrying which included copies of the actual invasion plans for Belgium and the Netherlands Belgian authorities discounted this true information as false because of the ease with which they obtained it br br br Multiple Forms of Surprise br Friendly events about which an adversary can be deceived are described in the mnemonic SALUTE IS which stands for Size Activity Location Unit Time Equipment Intent and Style The maxim indicates that the more of these categories the friendly side can deceive the adversary about the more likely the adversary is to believe the deception Conversely if there are plans and activities about which the adversary is already aware attempting to deceive him about them is unlikely to succeed In Operation Bodyguard the Germans knew there would be an invasion on the coast of France that it would happen in and that it would be based in England They did not know the exact date and the exact location The Allies concentrated their deception on the SALUTE IS details the Germans did not know about and did not attempt to deceive them about what they already knew br br br Planning process br The doctrine for planning deception has been codified over time In the U S military this doctrine begins with understanding the deception target s cognitive process Expressed as See Think Do this understanding of the adversary considers what information has to be conveyed to the target through what medium for the target to develop the perception of the situation that will cause the enemy to take an action beneficial to the friendly side In the planning process See Think Do is considered in reverse order what does the friendly side want the enemy to do as a result of the deception what perceptions will the target have to form to take the action and what information needs to be transmitted to the target through which medium so that the target will develop the desired perception br As an example the intent for Operation Bodyguard was for Germany to allocate forces away from Normandy Do The perception the Allies wanted to create in the mind of the deception target Hitler was that the Allies were planning to invade at Calais Think The information the Allies conveyed to the target to create the perception included the false radio traffic dummy equipment displays and deceptive command messages of the fictional First United States Army Group See br br br History br br br Ancient Egypt br br According to a story from an ancient Egyptian papyrus in about BC an Egyptian army under Pharaoh Thutmose III and his general Djehuty besieged the Caananite city of Yapu later Joppa and now Jaffa Unable to gain entry they resorted to deception Djehuty hid several soldiers in baskets and had the baskets delivered to the town with the message that the Egyptians were admitting defeat and sending tribute The people of Yapu accepted the gift and celebrated the end of the siege Once inside the city the hidden soldiers emerged from the baskets opened the city gates and admitted the main Egyptian force The Egyptians then conquered the city br br br Ancient Greece br The Iliad and The Odyssey epic poems composed between the th and th centuries BC are credited to the Ancient Greek author Homer These poems contain details of the Trojan War presumed by the Greeks to have been fought in approximately the th century BC The Odyssey provides the details of the Trojan Horse a successfully executed deception After several years of stalemate a Greek leader Odysseus devised a deception Over three days the Greeks constructed a hollow wooden horse which they inscribed as an offering to the goddess Athena in prayer for safe return to their homes The Greeks then pretended to depart the area around Troy giving the impression that they had sailed for Greece Rather than risk offending Athena the Trojans brought the horse into the city That night Greek soldiers concealed inside the horse came out of their hiding place and opened the city gates The main force of Greek soldiers who had actually remained nearby then entered the city and killed the inhabitants br br br Ancient Macedon br In BC the army of Macedon which was led by Alexander the Great had advanced through the Middle East to Asia conquering numerous kingdoms along the way Alexander planned for battle against the forces of Porus the king of the region of Pakistan and India that is now Punjab To confront Porus Alexander needed to cross the Hydaspes River Porus used the terrain to his advantage and arranged his forces to prevent Alexander from crossing the river at the most likely fording point Leading up to the battle Alexander scouted several alternative fords but Porus moved each time to counter him br Alexander eventually located a suitable crossing point approximately miles north of his base He then led a portion of his army to the crossing site while his subordinate Craterus kept the entire army s campfires burning within sight of Porus and feigned several river crossings that Porus was able to observe With Porus distracted Alexander successfully led his detachment across the river then marched south to engage in battle In the Battle of the Hydaspes Alexander s army had the element of surprise and quickly defeated Porus troops while sustaining relatively few casualties on the Macedonian side Having conquered Porus kingdom Alexander then allowed Porus to rule it as one of Alexander s satraps br br br Ancient China br br In BC troops under the general Sun Bin of the state of Qi faced battle with the forces of the state of Wei Knowing that Wei regarded the army of Qi as inferior and cowardly Sun Bin decided to use Wei s perception to his advantage When Qi s forces invaded Wei Sun Bin ordered them to light camp fires on the first night On the second night they lit On the third Sun Bin s deception caused the Wei forces led by general Pang Juan to believe Qi faced mass desertions Rushing to attack what they believed to be an inferior army the Wei forces assaulted Qi s troops at a narrow gorge not knowing Sun Bin s soldiers had prepared it as an ambush site When Pang Juan s troops reached the gorge they observed that a sign had been posted Lighting a torch to see the message the Wei commander read Pang Juan dies beneath this tree The lighting of the torch was the signal for Qi to initiate the ambush Sun Bin s army quickly routed Pang Juan s and Pang Juan committed suicide br Another well known deceptive measure from ancient China has come to be known as the Empty Fort Strategy Employed several times in numerous conflicts the best known example is a fictional one contained in a historical novel from the s AD Romance of the Three Kingdoms This work which contains embellished tales of actual Chinese history from to AD includes the story of general Zhuge Liang of Shu Han employing the Empty Fort Strategy As recounted in the novel s description of Zhuge Liang s Northern Expeditions an actual historical event the forces of general Sima Yi of Cao Wei arrived at Zhuge Liang s location the city of Xicheng while the bulk of Zhuge Liang s army was deployed elsewhere Zhuge Liang instructed the few troops he had on hand to pretend to be townspeople and told them to perform tasks which would make them visible to Sima Yi including sweeping the town s streets Zhuge Liang ordered Xichneg s gates to be opened then took up a visible position on a viewing platform playing his Guqin while flanked by only two pages Because Zhuge Liang s reputation as a military leader was so great Sima Yi assumed Zhuge Liang had prepared an ambush so he declined to enter Xicheng Zhuge Liang s deception saved the town and prevented the few soldiers he had with him from being massacred or taken prisoner br br br Ancient Carthage br During the Second Punic War the Carthaginian general Hannibal employed deception during the Battle of Cannae in BC In preparing to face a Roman force led by Lucius Aemilius Paullus and Gaius Terentius Varro Hannibal had soldiers as compared to the over that had been amassed by Rome To overcome the Roman advantage in numbers Hannibal placed his less experienced and disciplined Gauls in the center of his formation arranged to bulge out towards the Romans On either side of his line Hannibal positioned his experienced and disciplined Libyan and Gaetuli infantry Hannibal intended for the Gauls to give way to the advancing Romans with the center of his line bending but not breaking Seeing the Gauls appear to retreat the Romans would advance into the bowl shape or sack created by the bending of Hannibal s line Once inside the sack the African infantry positioned on the left and right would wheel inwards and attack the Roman flanks In combination with the Carthaginian cavalry the infantry on the flanks would continue moving until they encircled the Romans and could attack their rear The battle unfolded as Hannibal had envisioned Only Romans escaped with the rest either killed or captured The battle came to be seen as evidence of Hannibal s genius for tactical generalship while it was among the worst defeats suffered by Ancient Rome br br br Ancient Rome br During the Gallic Wars in BC Roman commander Julius Caesar attempted to engage the forces of tribal leader Vercingetorix in open battle in what is now central France Vercingetorix kept the River Elave now Allier between Caesar s forces and his own His troops destroyed or removed the bridges and mirrored the movements of Caesar s troops preventing Caesar from crossing the river Caesar responded by hiding forty of his sixty cohorts and arranging the remaining twenty to give the appearance of sixty as viewed from the opposite riverbank The twenty cohorts continued to march along the river and Vercingetorix s troops continued to mirror their movements Caesar then led the forty hidden cohorts back to a repairable bridge had it fixed led his troops across and sent for the other twenty cohorts to rejoin him Now on the same side of the river as Vercingetorix Caesar was able to engage the Gallic tribes in battle as he intended br br br Mongol Empire br br The Mongol Empire frequently used deception to aid its military success A favored tactic was to exaggerate the size of their army which would cause their enemies to surrender or flee When he fought the Naimans in Chinggis Khan ordered his soldiers to light five campfires each giving the impression of a more numerous army In M ngke Khan invaded Sichuan with soldiers and spread rumors of in an effort to intimidate his enemy br When confronting numerically superior forces the Mongols often sent troops behind their own lines to raise dust with branches tied to their horses tails which created the impression that reinforcements were en route Mongol soldiers had more than one horse each and to exaggerate the size of their army they would compel prisoners or civilians to ride their spare horses within sight of the enemy or mount dummies on their spare horses To make their forces appear smaller the Mongols would ride in single file minimizing dust and making the hoofprints of their horses more difficult to count Mongol armies also used the feigned retreat A typical tactic was to deploy the mangudai a vanguard unit that would charge the enemy break up its formation and then fall back in an attempt to draw the enemy into a position more favorable to the Mongols br br br Middle Ages br Examples of deception occurred during the Crusades In Sultan Baybars captured the formidable Krak des Chevaliers by handing the besieged knights a letter supposedly from their commander ordering them to surrender The letter was fake but the knights believed it was genuine and capitulated br In during the Glynd r Rising the Tudors of Wales were seeking a revocation of the price that Henry Percy had placed on their heads After deciding to capture Percy s Conwy Castle one member of the Tudor faction posed as a carpenter gained access and then admitted his compatriots The successful deception was in part responsible for the creation of England s Tudor dynasty br br br Renaissance br In an event from the early s that was recounted in Washington Irving s Conquest of Granada during the Granada War the Alhama de Granada was besieged by Moors During the siege a portion of the fortress outer wall was destroyed after the earth beneath it was washed away in a violent storm To conceal the breach the Conde de Tendilla leader of the Spanish defenders directed the erection of a cloth screen The screen deceived the Moors because it was painted to resemble stone and no Moorish besiegers ventured close enough to spot the fakery The wall was repaired over the next several days and the Moors did not learn of the gap in the Alhama s defenses br Henry VIII of England led troops on the European mainland during the War of the League of Cambrai On September Henry s forces began to besiege the city of Tournai in what is now Belgium The site of a thriving tapestry industry and home to many well known painters Tournai prolonged the siege by using painted canvas that resembled trenchworks to exaggerate the strength of its defenses As a result of this deception the city held out for several days longer than expected and obtained favorable terms when it surrendered br br br Colonial Africa br br In the kingdom of Denmark Norway constructed Fort Christiansborg near what is now Accra in Ghana Used to control commerce in slaves as well as raw materials including gold and ivory the site changed hands several times between Denmark Norway Portugal and Sweden sometimes by force sometimes by purchase In Nana Asamani the king of the Akwamu people planned to capture the fort from Denmark Norway Disguising himself as a cook and interpreter he obtained work at the fort where over the next year he became proficient in the Danish language and conducted reconnaissance to learn about the activities of the facility s occupants and the people with whom they traded br After gaining familiarity with Fort Christiansborg s occupants and operations in Asamani informed the Danish traders who occupied it about a group of Akwamu who desired to purchase weapons and ammunition and suggested they were so anxious to buy that the Danes should inflate their prices Lured by the prospect of large profits the Danes bartered with the Akwamu that Asamani had brought to the fort When the Danes allowed the Akwamu to inspect rifles and prepare to test fire them the Akwamu instead used the guns to commence an attack on the Danes Caught by surprise the Danes were quickly overpowered and ejected from Fort Christiansborg The Akwamu occupied the post for a year before Asamani agreed to sell it back to Denmark Norway Asamani kept the keys as a trophy and they are still in the possession of the Akwamu br br br French and Indian War br br During the Seven Years War in North America known in the United States as the French and Indian War British commander James Wolfe attempted throughout the summer of to force French commander Louis Joseph de Montcalm to come out of his well defended position in Quebec City When artillery fire that destroyed most of the city did not produce the desired effect Wolfe employed a deception strategy called uproar east attack west Wolfe ordered Admiral Charles Saunders to move the British fleet on the Saint Lawrence River to a position opposite one of Montcalm s main camps east of Quebec City This demonstration gave the appearance of preparations for an upcoming attack Montcalm was deceived and moved troops to guard against a British assault from that location br Wolfe s soldiers at Quebec City capitalized on the favorable balance of forces created by the deception First they opened a road from the riverbank to the city heights Next they deployed into battle formation on a farmer s field near the city walls Caught by surprise Montcalm knew he would not be able to withstand a siege and had no choice but to fight On September s Battle of the Plains of Abraham the French were decisively beaten The loss of Quebec led to defeat in the war and France was forced to cede Canada to the British br br br American Revolution br br br Siege of Boston br As head of the Continental Army George Washington successfully used deception to equalize the odds in the fight against the larger better equipped and better trained British army and its mercenary allies During the Siege of Boston from April to March the newly organized Continental Army suffered from numerous equipment and supply shortages Among the most critical was a lack of gunpowder which was so acute that in a battle Washington s troops would be able to fire no more than nine bullets per man To conceal the lack of gunpowder from the British Washington s quartermaster soldiers filled gunpowder casks with sand and shipped them from Providence Rhode Island to the Continental Army s depots The deception fooled British spies and British commanders decided not to risk an attack during the siege br br br Battle of Long Island br After the Patriot defeat at the Battle of Long Island in late August Washington s forces retreated to Brooklyn Heights with a superior British force surrounding them on three sides and their backs to the East River The British expected Washington would find his position untenable and surrender Washington instead arranged for a flotilla of small boats to ferry his troops across the river to the relative safety of Manhattan Island Moving under cover of darkness Washington s troops withdrew unit by unit to avoid the appearance that a general retreat was taking place The wheels of supply wagons and gun carriages were wrapped in rags to muffle their noise and troops ordered to remain silent to avoid alerting the nearby British Rear guard units kept campfires blazing through the night These measures fooled British scouts into thinking the Patriot army was still on Brooklyn Heights A morning fog obscured visibility which helped the Continentals complete their retreat and all were safely ferried across the river When the British advanced they were surprised to find the American positions completely empty br br br Battle of Trenton br br Prior to the Battle of Trenton on Christmas Day Washington used a spy John Honeyman to gain information about the positions of Britain s Hessian mercenaries Posing as a Loyalist butcher and weaver Honeyman traded with British and Hessian troops and acquired useful intelligence At the same time he aided Washington s plan by spreading disinformation that convinced the British and Hessians that Continental Army morale was low and an end of year attack against British positions unlikely Honeyman s deceptive information enabled Washington to gain the element of surprise and his troops routed the stunned Hessians br br br Battle of Princeton br After the Battle of Trenton the British dispatched a large army under General Charles Cornwallis to chase down Washington s smaller force At the January Battle of the Assunpink Creek the Continental troops under Washington successfully repulsed three British attacks on their positions Darkness ended the British attacks and they planned to resume the following morning That night Washington again resorted to the same deceptive tactics he had used in Brooklyn including muffling the wheels of wagons and gun carriages to reduce noise and leaving a rear guard to keep campfires burning The British were again fooled and Washington was able to move his army into a position from which he defeated the British at the Battle of Princeton on January br br br Siege of Fort Stanwix br In August the first Patriot attempt to relieve the Siege of Fort Stanwix New York was blocked by the British as the result of the Battle of Oriskany A second attempt led by Benedict Arnold succeeded in part because of a successful effort to deceive the British besiegers Arnold dispatched a messenger Hon Yost Schuyler to the British lines Schuyler was a Loyalist and regarded by the British army s Mohawk allies as a prophet because of his strange dress and conduct To ensure his good conduct Arnold held Schuyler s brother as a hostage Upon reaching the British positions outside Fort Stanwix Schuyler informed the Mohawk that Arnold s relief column was nearer than it was and that it was much larger than it actually was The Mohawk initially disbelieved Schuyler but assumed he was telling the truth after other American Indian messengers sent by Arnold began to arrive with the same information The Mohawk decided to leave forcing British commander Barry St Leger to order a retreat The end of the siege also ended British attempts to control the Mohawk Valley br br br Battle of Cowpens br br In the fall of Continental Army general Nathanael Greene commander of the Southern Department carried out a harassment campaign against the British in North and South Carolina One of Greene s subordinates Daniel Morgan commanded a force of approximately and was tasked with harassing the enemy in the backcountry of South Carolina In January as a British force commanded by Banastre Tarleton closed in on Morgan near Cowpens South Carolina on the Broad River he opted to fight rather than risk being attacked while attempting to cross the water br Knowing the British regarded Patriot militia as inferior Morgan used this perception to his advantage by arranging his troops in three lines The first was sharpshooters who provided harassing fire and attempted to pick off British officers The sharpshooters would then fall back to the second line which would consist of militiamen The militia would fire two volleys then feign a rout and pretend to flee If the British believed they had caused a panic in the militiamen they would charge forward But instead of catching up to the fleeing militia they would run into the third line Continental Army soldiers commanded by John Eager Howard As a reserve Morgan had a small Continental cavalry force commanded by William Washington br Morgan s deception proved decisive At the Battle of Cowpens on January the British under Tarleton launched a frontal assault The militia feigned retreat and Tarleton s troops charged forward As planned they were met by Howard s troops then surprised by Washington s cavalry charging into their flanks The British lost over killed over wounded and over captured Morgan s command sustained only killed and wounded br br br French Revolutionary Wars br Napoleon Bonaparte made significant use of deception during his campaigns At the Battle of Lodi he used deception to achieve a successful crossing of the River Po As a diversion Napoleon mounted a token crossing attempt against a strong Austrian force under Johann Peter Beaulieu Meanwhile the bulk of his force moved upriver and obtained an uncontested bridgehead at Piacenza Once it had crossed the river Napoleon s force attacked the enemy s rear guard in a tactic he referred to as manoeuvre sur les derri res maneuvering behind br br br War of the First Coalition br br During the War of the First Coalition France attempted an invasion of Britain During the February Battle of Fishguard Colonel William Tate an Irish American commanding French and Irish troops landed near Fishguard in Wales English and Welsh militia and civilians under the command of John Campbell st Baron Cawdor hastily assembled to defend the town When discipline began to break down among Tate s troops and their attempted invasion slowed down Tate asked for surrender terms that would permit his command to leave Instead of offering terms Cawdor demanded unconditional surrender As Tate and his subordinates considered Cawdor s demands overnight Cawdor backed up his bluff with several deceptive measures According to local lore these included having women in Traditional Welsh costumes and Welsh hats line the cliffs near the French camp from a distance the women appeared to be British soldiers in red coats and Shakos Convinced that he was outnumbered Tate surrendered and his troops were taken prisoner br br br First Barbary War br In October the frigate USS Philadelphia ran aground off the North African port of Tripoli during the First Barbary War and was captured by the Tripolitan forces In February a U S military detachment under the command of Stephen Decatur Jr was assigned to retrieve the ship or destroy it to keep Tripoli from putting it into service The raiding party deceived the Tripolitan authorities by sailing into Tripoli harbor aboard USS Intrepid a captured Tripolitan ketch which they disguised as a Maltese merchant ship The ship s Sicilian harbor pilot spoke to the Tripolitan authorities in Arabic claimed the ship had lost its anchors in a storm and sought permission to tie up next to the captured Philadelphia Permission was granted and Decatur and his crew overwhelmed the small force guarding Philadelphia using only swords and pikes to avoid gunshots that would alert authorities on shore of their presence Unable to sail Philadelphia away Decatur and his crew burned it then safely escaped br br br War of br br br First American Invasion of Canada br In July General William Hull was at Fort Detroit as the British fortified a defensive position across the Detroit River in Windsor Ontario Hull decided to move the British to Fort Malden further away from Detroit so that he could seize the defenses in Windsor To implement his plan Hull resorted to deception which began when his troops collected all the boats and canoes they could find On July Hull sent some boats down the river to Springwells south of Detroit in full view of the British At the same time the American regiment commanded by Duncan McArthur marched from Detroit to Springwells also observed by the British br With the British now anticipating an American crossing south of Detroit a second American force moved north in the dark until they reached Bloody Run a crossing point a mile and a half north of Fort Detroit and opposite the Ontario town of Sandwich Finding no activity at Springwells the British believed the Americans had already crossed the river and marched on Fort Malden Assuming Fort Malden was vulnerable the British troops in Sandwich marched south and in the morning the Americans at Bloody Run crossed to Sandwich unopposed After landing in Sandwich the Americans then marched from Sandwich to Windsor and seized the British defensive works br br br Retaking the brig Nerina br In July the British warship HMS Belvidera captured the American brig Nerina which had sailed for New York City from Newry Ireland without knowing that war had been declared in June Nerina s crew was transferred to a British ship except for the captain James Stewart who remained on board with a British prize crew which intended to sail Nerina to Halifax Nova Scotia so a prize court could adjudicate the British claim When the British ship was out of sight Stewart suggested to the prize master the propriety of opening the hatches to air out Nerina s hold The master gave the order and the fifty American passengers Stewart had hidden belowdecks before Nerina was boarded rushed out and retook the ship Stewart s successful deception enabled him to resume command and sail Nerina to New London Connecticut which he reached on August br br br Siege of Detroit br br In a notable deception that occurred during the War of s Siege of Detroit British Major General Isaac Brock and Native American chief Tecumseh used a variety of tricks including letters they allowed to be intercepted which exaggerated the size of their forces disguising Brock s militia contingent as more fearsome regular army soldiers and repeatedly marching the same body of Native Americans past U S observers to make it appear they were more numerous than they were Though he had superior troop strength the U S commander Brigadier General William Hull believed he faced overwhelming numbers of British regular troops and hordes of uncontrollable Indians Fearing a massacre in August Hull surrendered the town and the attached fort Most of his militia were allowed to return home while his regular army soldiers were held as prisoners of war br br br Capture of brigs Catharine and Rose br American Lieutenant John Downes was in command of Georgiana as part of Captain David Porter s naval force which raided British shipping in the Galapagos chain On May lookouts on Georgiana spotted two British ships Catharine and Rose off James Island Resorting to deception Downes raised the British flag which tricked the British whalers into thinking they were not under threat When the Americans were within range they lowered a few boats filled with men which rowed to Catharine and Rose and captured them without resistance The British captains revealed to Downes that they had no idea of the attack until the Americans were already on deck br br br Capture of HMS Eagle br In the British Royal Navy continued to blockade America s major ports The British flagship HMS Poictiers commanded by Commodore J B Beresford maintained station just outside Sandy Hook on Lower New York Bay supported by the schooner HMS Eagle Eagle had a notorious reputation among local fishermen for seizing both fishing boat crews and the boats valuable cargoes John Percival of the United States Navy volunteered to end the threat and acquired a fishing boat named Yankee On the morning of July he concealed armed volunteers in the hold while he and two volunteers stayed on deck dressed as fishermen Percival then sailed Yankee as though it was departing on a fishing voyage Eagle s commander spotted Yankee and sailed in close so he could order it to transfer the livestock it carried on deck to the nearby Poictiers Percival pretended to comply and when Eagle was less than ten feet away he signaled his volunteers to launch a surprise attack by shouting Lawrence in honor of slain U S Navy Captain James Lawrence Percival s volunteers poured out on deck and began firing Eagle s crew were taken by surprise and fled below deck One of Eagle s crew struck her colors thus surrendering to Yankee Two British sailors were killed and another received mortal wounds but there were no American casualties Percival brought the captured Eagle into port and delivered his prisoners to New York City s Whitehall Street docks as thousands of Americans were celebrating Independence Day br br br Ambush at Black Swamp Road br In July Benjamin Forsyth one of the company commanders in the American Regiment of Riflemen wanted to enlist the aid of Seneca warriors during planned military operations against the British near Newark Ontario now Niagara on the Lake Forsyth and the Seneca leaders agreed to work together to ambush the Mohawks who were allied with the British American riflemen and Seneca warriors hid on both sides of the Black Swamp Road A few Seneca horse riders rode out to gain the Mohawks attention then conducted a feigned retreat After the Seneca horsemen passed the hidden American riflemen and Senecas Forsyth blew his bugle as a signal The concealed Americans and Senecas rose from their hiding places and fired into the pursuing Mohawks Fifteen Mohawks were killed and thirteen surrendered including a British interpreter A few Mohawks escaped while the Americans and their Seneca allies marched their prisoners back to American lines br br br Battle of Fort Stephenson br br In August American Major George Croghan was in charge of soldiers at Fort Stephenson a base on the Sandusky River in what is now Sandusky County Ohio which guarded a nearby supply depot British commander Henry Procter arrived with a superior force that included at least British regulars American Indians under Major Robert Dickson and at least more under Tecumseh Procter met Croghan under a flag of truce and urged him to surrender but Croghan refused The British then bombarded the fort by artillery and gunboat to little effect Croghan returned fire with his single cannon Old Betsy while frequently changing its position in the hopes that the British would believe he had more than one artillery piece When Croghan s supply of ammunition ran low he ordered his men to cease fire br Croghan deduced that the British were going to strike in full force at the northwestern angle of the fort so he ordered his men to conceal Old Betsy in a blockhouse at that location The next morning the British feinted twice at the southern angle then approached the northwest one American gunners surprised them by uncovering Old Betsy and firing at point blank range which destroyed the British column Procter withdrew and sailed away Procter reported British casualties as killed wounded and missing American casualties were only one killed and seven wounded Croghan was celebrated as a national hero and promoted to lieutenant colonel br br br Ambush at Odelltown br On June Benjamin Forsyth commander of the American Regiment of Riflemen advanced from Chazy New York to Odelltown Lower Canada intending to draw a British force of Canadians and American Indian allies into an ambush Upon arriving at the British positions Forsyth sent a few men forward as decoys to make contact When the British responded the American decoys conducted a feigned retreat which successfully lured Canadians and American Indian allies into the ambush site br During the ensuing fight Forsyth needlessly exposed himself by stepping on a log to watch the attack and was shot and killed Forsyth s riflemen still hidden and now enraged over the death of their commander rose from their covered positions and fired a devastating volley The British were surprised by the ambush and retreated in confusion leaving seventeen dead on the field Forsyth was the only American casualty Even though Forsyth was killed his feigned retreat and ambush succeeded at inflicting heavy casualties on the British force br br br Battle of Lundy s Lane br In the July Battle of Lundy s Lane American forces used deception at several critical points When troops under Winfield Scott returned from attacks on British formations they were twice mistaken in the dark for a British unit and allowed to pass In one incident a British leader asked who was approaching by shouting The th The Americans recognized the opportunity to pass unmolested and called back The th br In another event American Captain Ambrose Spencer saw a unit approaching in the dark He rode up and called out What regiment is that The Royal Scots Sir a Scottish officer replied Spencer called out Halt Royal Scots and then rode off Believing a superior officer had given them a command the regiment stopped then remained in place until a real British officer found them and gave them new orders br In a third incident British soldier Shadrach Byfield reported that an individual in a company of hidden Americans impersonated a British officer and told the British troops opposing them to form up and stand tall in preparation for inspection The British troops believed a superior officer was addressing them and stood enabling the Americans to fire a volley after which they escaped retaliation by scattering in the dark br br br Battle of Conjocta Creek br In August American Major Lodowick Morgan of the Regiment of Riflemen who was based in Buffalo New York correctly deduced that the British were going to attack Buffalo from Canada by crossing the bridge at Conjocta Creek also called Scajaquada Morgan and riflemen marched to the point where the road from Black Rock crossed the Conjocta They sabotaged the bridge by pulling up a number of planks then built breastworks at the south side Afterwards they continued on to Black Rock Once at Black Rock Morgan s troops marched back the way they came while playing music and making as much noise as possible to gain the attention of the British and make them believe the Americans were headed to Buffalo br Once out of sight Morgan and his men marched secretly through the woods to occupy the breastworks they had constructed on the south bank of the creek The unsuspecting British arrived at the bridge and discovered the sabotage While they halted to consider their options Morgan began the Battle of Conjocta Creek by blowing a whistle to signal his soldiers who fired a devastating volley The British sought cover on the north bank and fired back but the American troops remained protected behind their breastworks The British attempted an assault on the breastworks which the Americans repulsed The British then attempted a flanking maneuver which the Americans also repulsed Unable to proceed past the Conjocta the British retreated back to Canada The Americans lost two killed and eight wounded while the British sustained twelve killed and twenty one wounded br br br American Civil War br br br Peninsula campaign br br In the American Civil War s Peninsula campaign Union commander George B McClellan was the victim of a deception executed by the forces under Confederate commander John B Magruder during the Siege of Yorktown Magruder who had acted in and produced plays used his knowledge of visual and audio effects to deceive McClellan into believing Magruder s force was larger than it was These included placing straw dummy crewmen alongside Quaker guns logs painted black to resemble cannons in his defensive works Magruder interspersed his Quaker guns with the few real cannons he possessed making his artillery seem more numerous than it was In addition he used shouted orders and bugle calls to march his relatively small force of about in front of Union positions until they were out of sight then had them loop around unseen and march through the same area again making his troop strength seem greater than it was Magruder s elaborate charade convinced McClellan who outnumbered Magruder by ten to one that he faced a more formidable opponent than was actually the case which caused him to delay attacking McClellan s delay allowed Confederate reinforcements to arrive causing him to retreat back to Washington D C br br br Vicksburg campaign br br In early Union naval commander David Dixon Porter lost a new ironclad USS Indianola after it ran aground on the Mississippi River near Vicksburg Mississippi and was captured by Confederate forces As the Confederates attempted to repair and refloat the damaged ship so they could use it against Porter s fleet Porter executed a deception to thwart their effort His men constructed a giant dummy ironclad from barges barrels and other materials that were on hand Made to resemble a new real ironclad USS Lafayette the dummy was painted black to give it a sinister appearance and flew the Jolly Roger pirate flag Porter s sailors floated the dummy christened Black Terror downstream at night and it appeared impervious to Confederate shore battery fire Exaggerated rumors about the seemingly indestructible super ship quickly spread to Vicksburg and reached salvage crews working on Indianola In a panic they halted their efforts blew up Indianola and abandoned the wreckage When Black Terror ran aground and was inspected by Confederates local newspapers roundly criticized military and naval commanders for being unable to tell the difference between a real warship and a fake br br br Second Boer War br br During the Second Boer War British commander Robert Baden Powell made extensive use of deception during his October to May defense of Mafeking After he occupied the town with a force of Baden Powell faced Boers who intended to begin a siege As the Boers advanced Baden Powell wrote a letter to a friend in Transvaal whom he knew had died which contained news of the imminent approach of more British troops Baden Powell intended for the letter to be intercepted and when it fell into Boer hands they believed it was real As a result they diverted troops to guard the approaches against Baden Powell s fictional reinforcements Baden Powell s troops also set up fake defensive works at a distance from the town itself including one marked as his command post which further diverted Boer attention In addition he had local residents execute deceptive tactics including carrying boxes of sand labeled mines in places where they could be observed Word of these supposed mines reached the Boers and when they soon afterwards observed supposed minefields appear around the edge of the town they assumed the danger was real These deceptive measures held off a Boer attack which allowed Baden Powell time to improve Mafeking s defences As a result of his effort the British were able to hold out until reinforcements arrived and lifted the siege br br br World War I br br br Gallipoli campaign br During World War I deception shifted from the tactical level to the strategic as modernized warfare and advances in technology increased the size and complexity of battlefield organizations Several methods of deception were used by the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps Anzac during its withdrawal from Gallipoli in Turkey which was completed on December As early as mid November artillery and sniper activity went silent for periods of time giving the impression that the Anzacs were preparing to remain in the defense with limited resupply of ammunition during the upcoming winter To cover the removal of the last troops drip rifles were prepared to fire about minutes after they were set with a water can leaking into a second can that was tied to a rifle trigger When the second can was full the weight caused the unmanned rifle to fire The sporadic firing created by this ruse convinced the Turks that the Anzac troops were still manning their defenses In addition Anzac troops used dummy artillery and mannequins to further enhance the impression that soldiers remained in their positions As a result of these deceptive measures both the main body of Anzac troops and the rear guard retreated unmolested Given the failure of the Gallipoli effort from the Anzac perspective the evacuation was considered the most successful part of the entire campaign br br br Western front br br In March leaders of the German Army on the Western Front decided to withdraw from their positions in France to the Hindenburg Line a mile long defensive position that ran from Arras to Laffaux With Germany unable to conduct an offensive because of personnel losses earlier in the war commanders intended for unrestricted submarine warfare and strategic bombing to weaken the British and French giving the German army time to recuperate In addition the move to the Hindenburg Line supported the plan of commanders Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff to shift the German focus to Russia and the Eastern Front The withdrawal to the new defensive line would shorten Germany s front by miles enabling divisions to be employed against the Russians br Under the plan code named Operation Alberich the Germans abandoned their old positions in a staged series that began in late February The majority of their movement occurred between and March and the full German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line was completed on April The German withdrawal included numerous efforts to deceive the Allies among them night movements and skeleton crews who remained behind to provide screening fire from machine guns rifles and mortars The deception activities proved generally successful and Germany completed its withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line largely unmolested br In August the Allies intended to launch two offensives one led by British Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig Commander in chief C in C of the British Expeditionary Force BEF near Amiens and the other by American General John J Pershing C in C of the American Expeditionary Forces AEF near Saint Mihiel Prior to the Battle of Amiens Haig s subordinate General Henry Rawlinson commander of the British Fourth Army employed several deceptive tactics including periods of radio silence by units involved in the coming attack and false radio traffic from other parts of the British lines In addition Rawlinson delayed troop movement for as long as possible prior to the start of the attack to prevent German observers from obtaining data on his disposition of forces and moved troops and materiel almost entirely at night The British offensive was immediately successful because they had maintained the element of surprise British troops and tanks advanced eight miles captured artillery pieces and inflicted casualties including prisoners br In an effort to gain an advantage near Saint Mihiel U S planners including Arthur L Conger attempted to deceive the Germans into believing the American attack would come at Belfort miles to the south False orders left where spies or informants could find them and staff officer reconnaissance activity created the appearance that the U S intended to conduct operations in and around Belfort Pershing gained surprise at Saint Mihiel and his offensive was successful In Conger discovered from a former German officer that while the Belfort Ruse had not been completely successful it had aided Pershing Concerned that an Allied attack in the Belfort area was at least a possibility many German units that could have reinforced German lines in the Saint Mihiel area delayed movement from their rear area positions near Saint Mihiel until it was too late As a result of the success of Pershing s offensive they did not have time to execute their withdrawal plans and either abandoned their weapons and fled or were taken as prisoners br br br Eastern front br At a war council held with senior commanders and the czar in April Russian General Aleksei Brusilov presented a plan to the Stavka the Russian high command proposing a massive offensive by his Southwestern Front against the Austro Hungarian forces in Galicia Brusilov s plan aimed to take some of the pressure off French and British armies in France and the Italian Army along the Isonzo Front and if possible to knock Austria Hungary out of the war As the Austrian army was heavily engaged in Italy the Russian army enjoyed a significant numerical advantage in the Galician sector br Brusilov s plan was approved and he massed infantry divisions and cavalry divisions in preparation for the Brusilov Offensive Deception efforts included false radio traffic false orders sent by messengers who were intended be captured and equipment displays including dummy artillery to mislead Austria Hungary as to the location of his units Beginning in June Brusilov s surprise offensive caused Germany to halt its Western front attack on Verdun and transfer considerable forces to the Eastern front It also severely reduced the fighting effectiveness of Austria Hungary s forces effectively depriving Germany of its most important ally br br br Palestine br br In October Edmund Allenby commander of Britain s Egyptian Expeditionary Force planned to attack the Ottomans in southern Palestine Rather than repeat previous frontal assaults at Gaza which had been unsuccessful he planned a flanking attack at Beersheba As part of the larger deception effort to convince the Ottomans that Gaza was his objective an officer under Allenby s command executed a deceptive tactic now known as the Haversack Ruse In this effort usually attributed to Richard Meinertzhagen the officer intentionally dropped a knapsack which contained false plans for an attack on Gaza which the Ottomans recovered As a result of the Haversack Ruse and other deceptive measures the British surprised the Ottomans and achieved victory at the October Battle of Beersheba br Allenby again resorted to deception as he prepared to attack the Ottomans again at Tel Megiddo in September In preparation for the battle British forces concealed the movement of three cavalry and several infantry divisions from the eastern end of the front line the Jordan Valley to the western end on the Mediterranean Sea The single mounted division that remained in the east reinforced with infantry maintained the illusion that the Jordan Valley remained fully garrisoned Deceptive measures included marching infantry into the valley during the day when they could be observed by the Ottomans transporting them out by truck at night then marching them back the next day The tents of the departed units were left standing and dummy horses mules and soldiers made from canvas and straw were displayed throughout the encampment In addition mules dragged branches up and down the valley to generate thick clouds of dust giving the impression of more animals and men on hand than there actually were Though the deceptions did not induce Otto Liman von Sanders the commander of the Ottoman Army to concentrate his forces on the eastern flank as Allenby hoped the Ottomans could not be certain of his intentions so they could not mass their forces With the Ottomans spread throughout their line Allenby s forces had a numerical advantage at the to September Battle of Megiddo and attained victory over the Ottomans br br br At sea br Britain s Royal Navy made extensive use of Q ships to combat German submarines Camouflaged to look like a civilian sailing vessel or decrepit tramp steamer the Q ships were decoys that carried concealed heavy guns The function of the Q ships was to appear to be an undefended target If successful German submarines would be lured to the surface to sink or destroy the ship by using deck guns enabling the submarine to conserve its limited supply of torpedoes for use against warships If a German U boat surfaced the Q ship would immediately display the Royal Navy s White Ensign flag in compliance with international law then deploy its guns against the submarine In engagements British Q ships destroyed U boats and damaged of the Q ships the British employed were lost to German attacks br br br World War II br br br Eastern Front br br Before Operation Barbarossa in June the German High Command explained away the creation of a massive force arrayed to invade the Soviet Union by informing Soviet leaders including Joseph Stalin that it was training in preparation for an invasion of the United Kingdom The deception worked and Stalin continued to ignore German preparations until after the invasion of the Soviet Union had actually commenced br When the Allies on the Western Front planned the Normandy invasion for June the Soviet Union simultaneously planned for a major Eastern front offensive against German forces Called Operation Bagration this Soviet attack was designed to catch the Germans unprepared in Belorussia at the center of their lines To gain and maintain the element of surprise for Bagration the Soviets executed a successful deception effort The overall intent was to make German commanders believe the Soviets would only defend in the center of the front Belorussia while launching a major offensive to the south in Ukraine and Crimea and a feint to the north in Finland Soviet military leaders successfully masked preparations for action in Belorussia and limited German reconnaissance in the center of the front while drawing German attention to deceptive activities in the north and south Germany was caught off guard at the start of the Bagration offensive on June and the Soviets quickly pushed retreating German forces from the Soviet Union all the way to Poland br br br Western Front br br br Africa br From early Dudley Clarke commanded the A Force based in Cairo Egypt which developed much of the war s Allied deception strategy In an initial deception failure from which Clarke derived an important lesson he put to use in the future the British intended to retake British Somaliland by an advance from Sudan into Eritrea Operation Camilla was intended to deceive the Italians occupying British Somaliland into thinking the British intended to retake British Somaliland by an amphibious assault from Aden Instead of moving their troops to meet the potential amphibious landing or retreating to Italian occupied Somalia the Italians withdrew into Eritrea As a result they possessed greater strength at the British objective when the genuine British attack occurred Clarke s lesson was to focus deception not on what the enemy should think is happening but what the deception planner wants the enemy to do as a result br br br North Africa br br Deception played an important part in the war in North Africa In a British Army unit led by magician and illusionist Jasper Maskelyne prevented the destruction of Alexandria Egypt by using lights to recreate the nighttime image of the city while blacking out the actual city lights Coupled with explosives that simulated German bombs landing on the city Maskelyne s illusion caused German planes to release their ordnance on the empty coastal site he had prepared rather than on the city br Maskelyne was subsequently tasked with preventing the Germans from attacking the Suez Canal a key asset in the Allied supply chain He responded by creating a system of swirling searchlights which cast a spray of strobe light over more than miles of the sky above Egypt German pilots were unable to see the canal and so were unable to destroy it br As part of the deception surrounding Operation Crusader during the Siege of Tobruk camouflage artist Steven Sykes built a dummy railhead near Misheifa in Egypt The intent which succeeded was to divert German aerial attacks from the real railhead and deceive the Germans into believing that the British attack would not begin until the dummy was completed Before the Second Battle of El Alamein camouflage unit commander Geoffrey Barkas led Operation Sentinel and Operation Bertram which used dummy equipment and other deceptive measures to deceive German commander Erwin Rommel about Allied strength and the timing and location of the Allied attack br In Operation Sly Bob Maskalyne s unit attempted to create a dummy submarine that would draw the attention of German reconnaissance aircraft along the German and Italian Italy to Tripoli supply line enabling British ships to gain the element of surprise when attacking Axis shipping By using old railroad sleeper cars a wooden frame nailed and welded beams and metal tubing Maskalyne s unit succeeded in creating a prototype that British ship commanders unaware of the deception plan nearly sank when they observed it near the Suez Canal The difficulty in creating a viable dummy rendered the project impractical and Sly Bob was abandoned before it was fully implemented br Based on the experience with Sly Bob the British attempted to portray an aging cruiser as a battleship that would pose a threat to German shipping When the effort proved unsuccessful because the dummy equipment and fixtures added to the cruiser were unrealistic Maskalyne s team used the partially dummied cruiser as sucker bait With sucker bait a magician uses an audience s powers of observation against it by allowing members to falsely believe they see through a trick By appearing to attempt to camouflage the cruiser turned dummy battleship which Maskalyne christened HMS Houdin after magician Jean Eug ne Robert Houdin but allowing German observers to see through the camouflage Maskalyne s team enabled the Germans to conclude on their own that the British were attempting to hide a battleship Allowing the Germans to believe they had penetrated the camouflage and detected the battleship created in the minds of German military leadership the same risk to German shipping a real battleship would have posed br br br Normandy br Before the June D Day invasion of Normandy the Allies launched a deception codenamed Operation Bodyguard As part of Bodyguard the Operation Quicksilver deception portrayed First United States Army Group FUSAG a skeleton headquarters commanded by Omar Bradley as an army group commanded by George Patton In Operation Fortitude South another component of Bodyguard the Germans were persuaded that FUSAG would invade France at Pas de Calais in the fall of British and American troops used dummy equipment false radio traffic and double agents see Double Cross System to deceive German intelligence on the location and timing of the invasion The Germans awaited the Calais landing for many weeks after the real landings in Normandy leaving in place near Calais several divisions that could have helped delay or defeat the Normandy attack By the time the Germans realized the Normandy landings were the actual offensive Allied units were so well established in Normandy that they could not be dislodged br br br Pacific theater br Japan continued diplomatic engagement with the U S on several issues of concern throughout late November and into early December even though attacking ships had sailed from their base in the remote Kuril Islands The surprise December attack on Pearl Harbor took place several hours before Japan presented a formal declaration of hostilities and officially broke diplomatic ties Japan also made extensive use of decoys and other deceptive displays throughout the war which took on increased importance as the tide of the war went against it in and br Prior to the October Battle off Samar the Japanese incorporated deception into their plan of attack by luring Admiral William Halsey Jr into leading his powerful Third Fleet to chase a decoy fleet a target so inviting Halsey took with him every ship he commanded br With Halsey s force out of the way the Japanese intended to attack the Allied landings on Leyte The U S responded with their few remaining forces the three escort carrier groups of the Seventh Fleet Escort carriers and destroyer escorts had been built to protect slow convoys from submarine attack and were later adapted to attack ground targets but they had few torpedoes as they normally relied on Halsey s fleet to protect them from armored warships These ships organized as Task Unit Taffy and commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague possessed neither the firepower nor the armor to oppose the ships of the Japanese force which included Yamato s inch guns but took the initiative and attacked In addition to ships firing on the Japanese from point blank range aircraft including FM Wildcats F F Hellcats and TBM Avengers strafed bombed torpedoed rocketed and depth charged the Japanese force until they ran out of ammunition They then resorted to deception including numerous dry runs at the Japanese ships Concerned that he faced a larger force than he actually did Japanese commander Admiral Takeo Kurita decided to withdraw br During the Battle of Iwo Jima in February and March Japanese deception included dummy tanks sculpted out of the island s soft volcanic rock At the Japanese held airfield in Tianhe District China the Japanese painted on the ground the image of a B Bomber that appeared to be on fire Their intent was for the painted image to appear real to high flying aircraft which would lower their altitude to investigate thus making them targets for Japanese anti aircraft fire In addition the Japanese made extensive use of bamboo framed dummy aircraft to project airpower and protect their remaining aircraft straw dummy soldiers and wood weapons that made defensive works appear to be manned and wood dummy tanks to make infantry soldiers appear to have more combat power than they actually possessed br The Allies planned an invasion of Japan to take place after the end of fighting in Europe This plan codenamed Operation Downfall had several components including the Operation Olympic invasion of the southern Japanese island of Kyushu The deception created to enable Olympic to succeed Operation Pastel would have included false attacks against Japanese held ports in China as well as Japanese positions on the island of Formosa The end of the war following the U S atomic bomb attacks on Japan ended the need for a ground invasion or a deception plan so Pastel was never implemented br br br At sea br br As a liaison to the British Navy early in the war actor and U S Navy officer Douglas Fairbanks Jr observed and participated in several raiding parties and diversions on the French coast Upon returning to the United States Fairbanks proposed to Ernest King the Chief of Naval Operations the creation of a unit that would plan and execute diversionary and deception missions King authorized Fairbanks to recruit officers and enlisted men for the program which was named Beach Jumpers There are several stories about how the unit was named during an interview late in life Fairbanks said British admiral Louis Mountbatten coined it with the intention of creating a designation that provided cover for the unit s activities by being partly descriptive and partly in code br On March Beach Jumper Unit ONE BJU was commissioned with the mission To assist and support the operating forces in the conduct of Tactical Cover and Deception in Naval Warfare Eleven BJUs deployed during the war and were used in all theaters The Beach Jumpers raided false landing zones and shore defenses during amphibious attacks sowing confusion with the enemy about actual landing sites and causing the enemy to defend in the wrong place To carry out these deceptions their boats were equipped with two caliber machine guns window chaff rockets smoke generators and floating time delay explosive packs They were also outfitted with naval balloons and communications and psychological operations equipment including recorders speakers generators and radio jammers The balloons included radar reflective strips that when towed would cause Beach Jumper units to appear to enemy radar operators as a larger force than they actually were br Beach Jumper units created diversionary landings during several battles including Operation Husky and Operation Dragoon The Beach Jumpers were inactivated after World War II but were reconstituted for service during the Korean War and Vietnam War With the U S military creating and fielding an Information Operations capability beginning in the early s the modern Beach Jumpers exist as part of U S Naval Information Forces br br br Korean War br In the summer of the Korean People s Army KPA of North Korea attacked South Korea South Korean and allied soldiers were nearly defeated In August and September South Korea and its allies waged the Battle of Pusan Perimeter against the KPA and succeeded in establishing a defensive line that prevented the KPA from destroying them br To enable the counterattack that started with an amphibious landing at Inchon codenamed Operation Chromite United Nations U N forces staged an elaborate deception that made it appear the landing would take place at Gunsan miles away from the actual landing site at Inchon and closer to the Pusan Perimeter On September the U S Air Force began attacks on roads and bridges to isolate Gunsan This was followed by a naval bombardment which was followed by heavy bombing of military installations in and near the town These tactics were typical pre invasion steps and were intended to cause North Korea to believe Gunsan was the planned U N invasion site br In addition to the aerial and naval bombardment United States Marine Corps officers briefed their units on the supposed Gunsan landing within earshot of many Koreans assuming that the information would make its way to KPA leaders through rumors or spies On the night of September the British Royal Navy landed U S Army special operations troops and Royal Marines commandos at Gunsan making sure that enemy forces noticed their supposed reconnaissance of the area U N forces also conducted rehearsals on the coast of South Korea at several sites with conditions were similar to Inchon These drills enabled U N forces to perfect the timing and actions of the planned Inchon landing while simultaneously confusing the North Koreans as to the actual landing site br On September United Nations forces under Douglas MacArthur surprised the KPA with the Inchon landing In the ensuing Battle of Inchon the U N ended a string of victories by North Korea The KPA collapsed within a month and KPA troops were taken prisoner br br br Cuban Missile Crisis br br During the period leading up to the Cuban Missile Crisis of October Cuba and the Soviet Union employed several deceptive measures to hide their activities These included the codename for the plan to deploy missiles in Cuba Anadyr a Russian town is associated with the sparsely populated and inaccessible area of Northeastern Russia and did not suggest an operation in the Caribbean Soviet soldiers constructed false superstructures to hide the defenses of the ships transporting missiles and launching equipment to Cuba and placed agricultural equipment and other non military machinery on deck where it could be seen Upon arrival the ships unloaded at eleven different Cuban ports to deceive American surveillance efforts At the same time Soviet and Cuban news media reported on the supposedly massive agricultural assistance the Soviets were providing Cuba which provided a plausible explanation for the activity and equipment that could be observed The Soviet deception proved highly effective and the missiles were discovered only after they were already operational br br br Vietnam War br Both North Vietnam and the forces of South Vietnam and the United States made use of deception during the Vietnam War br br br Operation El Paso br As part of Operation El Paso which took place from May to July the U S st Infantry Division deliberately exposed information about a planned resupply and engineer equipment convoy from Minh Than north to An L c Division planners anticipated the enemy response would be an ambush at one of a number of possible locations As a result the supposedly lightly armed convoy actually consisted of armored cavalry and infantry Additionally st ID planners prepared for air assault operations at the most likely ambush sites Events unfolded as the planners had foreseen and the Viet Cong ambushed the convoy The ambush sprang the st Infantry Division s trap and the subsequent Battle of Minh Thanh Road resulted in percent of the Viet Cong regiment becoming casualties br br br Operation Bolo br br In s Operation Bolo a United States Air Force unit led by Robin Olds successfully countered the threat posed by Soviet MiG fighter planes operating in North Vietnam br During bombing missions unescorted U S Republic F Thunderchief fighter bombers would often be attacked by MiG s Heavily laden with ordnance the F s were no match for the faster MiGs On occasions when the F s were escorted by F Phantom II fighter planes the MiGs would refuse to engage In addition the rules of engagement on the U S side prevented attacking the MiGs when they were on the ground This measure was intended to keep the Soviet Union from becoming further engaged in the conflict by preventing casualties to the Soviet mechanics and technical advisors who were assisting North Vietnam br To counter the MiG threat Olds th Fighter Wing prepared its F s to display the electronic and radar signatures of F s To create this effect the th Fighter Wing outfitted F s with QRC jamming pods a device used only by F s When they flew the mission Olds and his fellow pilots assumed the route elevation speed and formation of an F flight They also staggered the takeoff and arrival times of the F s enabling later arriving F s to prevent the MiGs from landing br The Bolo deception was executed successfully The North Vietnamese believed they faced an F flight and dispatched their MiGs The later arriving F s prevented the MiGs from returning to their base The th Fighter Wing destroyed seven MiGs in a matter of minutes while Olds fighters sustained no losses The destruction of half their MiGs and uncertainty about whether future flights observed on radar and electronic sensors were unescorted F s or F s pretending to be F s caused North Vietnam to ground its MiGs The MiGs failed in their mission of preventing U S Operation Rolling Thunder bombing runs over North Vietnam br br br Tet Offensive br br In the government and military of North Vietnam began planning for an offensive that would begin in early The intent within the war s area of operations was to spark an uprising by the Viet Cong and others in South Vietnam who were sympathetic to the government in the north In a wider sense North Vietnam hoped the offensive would cause a withdrawal of U S troops from South Vietnam by undermining U S public confidence in the war br North Vietnam implemented several deceptive measures to mask preparations for the offensive In October the North Vietnamese government announced that it would observe a seven day holiday truce from January to February several days longer than previous Tet truces had lasted The U S and South Vietnam presumed that the coming offensive of which they had received some intelligence would take place before or after the truce When the attacks had not commenced before the holiday South Vietnamese and U S leaders assumed it would come after the holiday As a result they allowed many soldiers to take holiday leave and relaxed the usual security measures br As an additional deceptive measure while intending to attack South Vietnam s major cities and military installations the North Vietnamese continued attacks along the border between the two countries during late These diversionary assaults served to draw U S attention to the border and U S forces away from the actual objectives the heavily populated South Vietnamese coastal lowlands and cities br When the offensive commenced South Vietnam and the U S were surprised by the coordinated attacks However the U S and South Vietnam regrouped and over several days repulsed the North Vietnamese assaults North Vietnam failed to attain the immediate objective of creating an uprising in South Vietnam In the longer term the offensive aided in swaying U S public opinion against the war which led to a decreased U S presence in Vietnam and eventual withdrawal br br br Cherbourg Project br br In France abruptly declared an arms embargo against countries in the Middle East chiefly aimed at Israel and cancelled a contract to build patrol boats for Israel s navy France also refused to release the last five boats built under the contract even though Israel had already paid for them In response the Israel Defense Forces mounted an elaborate scheme involving the purchase of the boats by a civilian company for non military purposes When they became concerned that the dummy transaction would be exposed Israel decided to secretly take possession of the boats The Israeli navy dispatched crews disguised as civilians who gradually arrived at the French Atlantic seaport of Cherbourg Once the crews assembled they secretly sailed the five boats out of the harbor on the night of Christmas Eve Though they encountered a winter storm the boats reached the Mediterranean Sea and safely completed the voyage to Israel The plan to take possession of the boats which the Israelis called Operation Noa but came to be known as the Cherbourg Project was assisted by sympathetic Cherbourg shipyard and boat building company employees but the French government was kept totally unaware until the boats had left port br br br Yom Kippur War br br In the period before the Yom Kippur War between Israel and the joint forces of Egypt and Syria Egypt executed annual maneuvers near the Sinai Peninsula Tahrir which conditioned Israel to Egyptian troop activity in the area In addition several months before the start of the war Egypt created the false impression of an imminent attack which caused Israel to announce an emergency military reserve call up When the war started Israel believed the initial Egyptian troop movements were another iteration of the exercises the Egyptians had previously undertaken In addition because an emergency call up was costly and disruptive the Israeli government was reluctant to conduct another one until it was sure an attack was underway As a result of the deception Egypt had surprise on its side when it attacked br br br Operation Entebbe Rescue Mission br br After the hijacking of an Air France plane in late June the perpetrators had the aircraft diverted to Entebbe Airport in Uganda where they threatened to kill all the Jewish and Israeli passengers if their demands were not met The Israeli government pursued diplomatic efforts to free the hostages while the Israeli Defense Forces planned a rescue mission in secrecy When the raid was launched IDF commandos secretly landed at an old unused area of the airport where they offloaded decoy vehicles resembling Ugandan president Idi Amin s motorcade By making themselves appear to be Amin and his security detail the Israelis intended to gain the element of surprise on Ugandan guards at the terminal where the hostages were held The ruse was only partly successful because Amin had recently changed limousines and his new one was white while the one the Israelis were using was black The Ugandan guards realized the trick which led to a gunfight that cost the Israeli commandos the element of surprise but the raid ended with the successful rescue of the hostages br br br Falklands War br br The Falklands War took place between April and June During the period prior to the war Argentina s military leaders who were subordinate to general and president Leopoldo Galtieri used the December change of command ceremony for Argentina s new chief of naval operations as cover to begin secretly planning for an invasion of the Falkland Islands In April the forces of Argentina carried out the Invasion of South Georgia an island possession of the United Kingdom In mid March Argentina had used deception to successfully position an advance guard on South Georgia An Argentinian company received a contract to dismantle a British whaling station for scrap When the contractor s ship arrived it contained members of an Argentinian Navy special forces unit who were disguised as scientists br When the British prepared to conduct a Falklands landing in response to Argentina s invasion Argentina anticipated an assault at Port Stanley the capital and site of the largest airport on the islands The British gained the element of surprise by launching a feint at Stanley while conducting their main assault at San Carlos on the opposite side of East Falkland The British then marched overland to Port Stanley where they launched a land based attack on the Argentine defenses surrounding the city The Argentinians were caught off guard and were soon compelled to surrender br br br Operation Just Cause br When the leader of Panama Manuel Noriega realized he was being surveilled by the U S military prior to the United States invasion of Panama in December Noriega resorted to several deceptive measures to mask his movements and locations These included look alike doubles decoy vehicles and aircraft false convoys frequent changes of clothes recordings of his voice played at locations where he was not present and frequent changes of his actual location br On the U S side deception included troop movements in and around U S bases in Panama made to look like routine training missions a logistics buildup disguised as routine activity and large scale exercises in the United States that desensitized Panamanian leaders as to U S capabilities and intent While Noriega and his subordinates knew the United States had the capacity to act they were misled by their perceptions of U S activity and misreading of U S intent into believing that the U S would not attack As a result when the attack occurred the U S had the element of surprise which helped it gain a quick victory br br br Operation Desert Storm br br During the period prior to the Gulf War Iraqi president Saddam Hussein positioned troops near Iraq s border with Kuwait To mask his true intention of invading Kuwait during the summer of Saddam told ambassadors to Iraq the leaders of other countries and members of the international news media that his troops were on a training mission or were near the border merely as a tactic to extract concessions from Kuwait during diplomatic negotiations On August Iraq s invasion commenced the small Kuwaiti military was quickly

Kuwait from the rear Facing overwhelming Coalition combat power in Kuwait and unable to retreat to Iraq the Iraqi military in Kuwait quickly surrendered br br br Kosovo War br During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as part of the Kosovo War the Serbian Army made extensive use of deception which caused NATO forces to expend time effort and resources attacking false targets According to post war assessments NATO often attacked crude decoy tanks artillery and wheeled vehicles made of easy to obtain material including sticks and plastic Many of these decoys included easily produced heat sources such as burning cans of oil which deceived the thermal imaging systems of NATO aircraft As a result NATO believed it inflicted far more damage on the Serbian Army than it actually had and Serbia gained a propaganda victory by showing how easily NATO had been deceived br br br Lebanon War br Prior to the Lebanon War the Hezbollah terrorist group employed deceptive measures intended to degrade Israel s military reputation both internationally and within Israel Deceptive measures included the construction of false bunkers and command posts which Hezbollah allowed Israel to observe while the

transport soldiers into portions of the disputed territory The rapid troop movements came without warning and took India by surprise As a result China gained numerical superiority in several of Ladakh

sustained effort to convince Israeli leadership that Hamas was focused on economic improvement in Gaza not armed conflict Hamas also trained and rehearsed its attacks in plain sight allowing the Israelis to assume that these activities were merely posturing on the part of Hamas fighters In addition Hamas ramped down conflict in the Gaza strip while increasing tensions in the West Bank Israel moved forces from one location to the other giving Hamas a more favorable force ratio in Gaza Additional deceptive activities included acquiring and pre positioning non military vehicles intended for

papier m ch The populace does not resist because it believes the threat is real br br br Opinions br Opinions vary among military strategists and authors as to the value of military deception For example the two books on warfare usually considered the most famous classics Sun Tzu s The Art of War and Clausewitz s On War have diametrically opposed views Sun Tzu emphasizes military deception and considers it the key to victory Clausewitz argues that the fog of war prevents a commander from having a clear understanding of the operating environment so creating some sort of false appearance particularly on a large scale is unlikely to be meaningful Because of the cost and effort Clausewitz argues that from a cost benefit analysis a large deception is an acceptable part of a course of action only under special circumstances br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br Media related to Military deception at Wikimedia Commons br Sworn to
