To counterfeit means to imitate something authentic with the intent to steal destroy or replace the original for use in illegal transactions or otherwise to deceive individuals into believing that the fake is of equal or greater value than the real product Counterfeit products are fakes or unauthorized replicas of the real product Counterfeit products are often produced with the intent to take advantage of the superior value of the imitated product The word counterfeit frequently describes both the forgeries of currency and documents as well as the imitations of items such as clothing handbags shoes pharmaceuticals automobile parts unapproved aircraft parts which have caused many accidents watches electronics and electronic parts software works of art toys and movies br Counterfeit products tend to have fake company logos and brands which results in patent or trademark infringement in the case of goods They also have a reputation for being lower quality sometimes not working at all and sometimes containing toxic substances such as lead This has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people due to automobile and aviation accidents poisoning or ceasing to take essential compounds e g in the case a person takes non working medicine br The counterfeiting of money mostly paper money is usually attacked aggressively by governments worldwide br br br Forgery of money or government bonds br br Counterfeit money is currency that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government this is a crime in all jurisdictions of the world The United States Secret Service mostly known for its guarding of officials task was initially organized primarily to combat the counterfeiting of U S dollars in the wake of the American Civil War Both sides had printed counterfeit notes in attempts to destabilize the other s economy an example of economic warfare br Counterfeit government bonds are public debt instruments that are produced without legal sanction with the intention of cashing them in for authentic currency or using them as collateral to secure loans or lines of credit through legitimate channels br br br Counterfeiting of documents br br Forgery is the process of making facsimiles or adapting documents with the intention to deceive It is a form of fraud and is often a key technique in the execution of identity theft Uttering and publishing is a term in United States law for the forgery of non official documents such as a trucking company s time and weight logs br Questioned document examination is a scientific process for investigating many aspects of various documents and is often used to examine the provenance and verity of a suspected forgery Security printing is a printing industry specialty focused on creating legal documents which are difficult to forge br br br Counterfeit goods br br The spread of counterfeit goods including consumer goods commonly called knock offs or rip offs and parts within the manufacturing supply chain has become global in recent years and the range of goods subject to infringement has increased significantly Apparel and accessories accounted for over percent of the counterfeit goods seized by U S Customs and Border Control According to the study of Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau CIB of the International Chamber of Commerce ICC counterfeit goods make up to of world trade however these figures cannot be substantiated due to the secretive nature of the industry br A report by the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development indicates that up to US billion of international trade could have been in counterfeit and illegally copied goods in In November the OECD updated these estimates concluding that the share of counterfeit and illegitimate goods in world trade had increased from in to in That represents an increase to US billion worldwide br br In a detailed breakdown of the counterfeit goods industry the total loss faced by countries around the world is billion with the United States facing the most economic impact br When calculating counterfeit products current estimates place the global losses at billion On November the Department of Homeland Security seized and shut down websites as part of a U S crackdown of websites that sell counterfeit goods and was timed to coincide with Cyber Monday the start of the holiday online shopping season br br Some see the rise in counterfeiting of goods as being related to globalisation As more and more companies in an effort to increase profits move manufacturing to the cheaper labour markets of the third world areas with weaker labour laws or environmental regulations they give the means of production to foreign workers These new managers of production have little or no loyalty to the original corporation They see that profits are being made by the global brand for doing little other than advertising and see the possibilities of removing the middle men i e the parent corporation and marketing directly to the consumer This can result in counterfeit products being virtually indistinguishable from original products as they are being produced in the same company and in damage to the parent corporation due to copyright infringement br Certain consumer goods especially very expensive or desirable brands or those that are easy to reproduce cheaply have become frequent and common targets of counterfeiting The counterfeiters either attempt to deceive the consumer into thinking they are purchasing a legitimate item or convince the consumer that they could deceive others with the imitation An item which makes no attempt to deceive such as a copy of a DVD with missing or different cover art or a book without a cover is often known as a bootleg or a pirated copy instead br Counterfeiting has also been issued to cash in on the ever growing record collecting market One major example is bootleggers have cloned copies of Elvis Presley s early singles for Sun Records since original copies starting changing hands amongst music fans for hundreds and then thousands of dollars Some who produce these even do so with the wrong material For example the song Heartbreak Hotel which was never released on Sun as by the time Elvis first heard it prior to ever recording it he had moved from Sun to RCA Victor Rare releases by The Beatles such as their album with the butcher cover fan club only released Christmas records and early demonstration discs issued by EMI are also examples of product reproduced by counterfeiters due to their high value to collectors br br Many counterfeit goods are produced and manufactured in China making it the counterfeit capital of the world the counterfeiting industry accounts for of China s GDP Counterfeit goods are also made in Russia North Korea Taiwan Bulgaria and Turkey Turkey is responsible for of word s counterfeit goods according to OCDE Some counterfeits are produced in the same factory that produce the original authentic product using inferior materials A United States Senate Committee on Armed Services report regarding counterfeit electronic parts in the defense supply chain highlighted in an investigation commenced in March found that cases of suspected counterfeit components were in use within over million individual products A follow up report found that counterfeit parts came overwhelmingly from China br Another trend in counterfeiting especially seen in consumer electronics is the manufacture of entirely new products using poor quality materials or more often incorporating desirable features not present in a brand s authentic product line and then including prominent and fake brand names and logotypes to profit from brand recognition or brand image An example would be imitation Nokia and iPhone cellular phones with features like dual SIM slots or analog television which are unavailable in authentic originals or visually identical clones of high end smartphones using inferior components and the Android operating system often with user interfaces made to resemble the devices they imitate Another example would be imitation iPod MP players whose batteries are removable and replaceable whereas in authentic originals the batteries are permanently installed br In the United States a federal crackdown on counterfeit imports is driving an increase in domestic output of fake merchandise according to investigators and industry executives Raids carried out in New York City resulted in the seizure of an estimated million in counterfeit apparel bearing the logos of brands such as The North Face Polo Izod Lacoste Rocawear Seven for all Mankind and Fubu One of the largest seizures was a joint operation in Arizona Texas and California that seized seventy seven containers of fake Nike Air Jordan shoes and a container of Abercrombie Fitch clothing valued at million Another current method of attacking counterfeits is at the retail level Fendi sued the Sam s Club division of Walmart for selling fake Fendi bags and leather goods in five states Sam s Club agreed to pay Fendi a confidential amount to settle the dispute and dismiss the action In the case Tiffany v eBay Tiffany Co sued auction site eBay for allowing the sale of counterfeit items but lost on all claims br A number of companies involved in the development of anti counterfeiting and brand protection solutions have come together to form special industry wide and global organisations dedicated to combating the so called brand pirates such as the International Hologram Manufacturers Association Other companies and organisations have established web based communities that provide a framework for crowd sourced solutions to counterfeiting One such free community Collectors Proof enables manufacturers and users alike to associate unique identification numbers to virtually any item so that each new owner can update its chain of custody Because quality counterfeit items are often difficult to distinguish from authentic goods this approach enables potential customers to access an item s current and previous owners its provenance prior to purchase br To combat counterfeiting companies may have the various parts of an item manufactured in independent factories and then limit the supply of certain distinguishing parts to the factory that performs the final assembly to the exact number required for the number of items to be assembled or as near to that number as is practicable or may require the factory to account for every part used and to return any unused faulty or damaged parts To help distinguish the originals from the counterfeits the copyright holder may also employ the use of serial numbers or holograms etc which may be attached to the product in another factory br br br Counterfeit culture br br Counterfeit culture is the thriving markets surrounding fake streetwear Most commonly these markets originate out of areas where the inability to buy popular streetwear brands has fueled more sophisticated markets for counterfeit goods These markets have spawned the emergence of a tribe of widely available copycat brands br In countries like North Korea and Russia where trade sanctions were imposed in the past to prevent the importation of popular brands demand was stimulated for available counterfeit alternatives The economic standing of a country or region also contributed to the demand for these products as the average consumer can t afford luxury prices but will gain the same social impact purchasing a knock off whose quality is almost indistinguishable from the original s br Luxury streetwear is out of reach for many people not just because of international sanctions and low wages but because exclusivity is built into its business model Social and cultural forces are driving the unique fashion scene In particular social media has a huge influence on over these markets giving people images of things they can t own and further fueling the desire to obtains certain hyped items by any means accessible br Designers have even begun to acknowledge the trend of counterfeit culture by referencing fake or knock off goods in their designs This brought counterfeit culture into the realm of mainstream culture and has essentially shifted global acceptance towards becoming more lenient of these products as an appropriate alternative br br br Anti counterfeiting technologies br Anti counterfeiting technologies are added to products or their packaging to allow consumers or inspectors to check whether a product is authentic The EUIPO Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights has developed an anti counterfeiting technology guide to address the lack of information on technology solutions available on the market and help companies improve their protection against counterfeiting In this guide the main anti counterfeiting technologies currently on the market are described and classified into five main categories br br Electronic technologies br Marking technologies br Chemical and physical technologies br Mechanical technologies br Technologies for digital media br The International Standard Organization has also published standards related to the implementation of anti counterfeiting solutions including ISO and ISO br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br OECD
