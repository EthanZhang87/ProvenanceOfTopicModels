id: 327856
The Dreadnought hoax was a practical joke pulled by Horace de Vere Cole in Cole tricked the Royal Navy into showing their flagship the battleship HMS Dreadnought to a fake delegation of Abyssinian royals The hoax drew attention in Britain to the emergence of the Bloomsbury Group among whom some of Cole s collaborators numbered The hoax was a repeat of a similar impersonation that Cole and Adrian Stephen had organised while they were students at Cambridge University in br br br Background br br br Hoaxers br br Horace de Vere Cole was born in Ireland in to a well to do family He was commissioned into the Yorkshire Hussars and served in the Second Boer War where he was seriously wounded and invalided out of service On his return to Britain he became an undergraduate at Trinity College Cambridge he studied little and spent his time entertaining and undertaking hoaxes and pranks br One of Cole s closest friends at Trinity was Adrian Stephen a keen sportsman and actor Cole s biographer Martyn Downer considers that Stephen was a perfect foil for Cole someone sympathetic and encouraging yet unafraid to take him on Stephen was the son of Leslie the writer and critic and Julia the philanthropist and Pre Raphaelite model Adrian Stephen s elder brother Thoby was also at Trinity and their sisters Vanessa later Vanessa Bell and Virginia later Virginia Woolf would visit After university the four Stephen siblings became members of the Bloomsbury Group the set of associated writers intellectuals philosophers and artists many of whose members had also been at Trinity College Cole was on the fringes of the group but never a member br br br Cambridge Zanzibar hoax br br In early while in their second year at Trinity College Cambridge Cole and Adrian Stephen decided to use a visit to England of Sayyid Ali bin Hamud Al Busaid the eighth Sultan of Zanzibar as the basis for a hoax A plan was put together to fake a state visit of the sultan to Cambridge although they realised that as the sultan s picture had recently appeared in the press there was a risk the visiting sultan would be shown as a fraud They decided that Cole would impersonate the sultan s uncle rather than the sultan On March they sent a telegram to the Mayor of Cambridge to ask if he could arrange a suitable reception for the sultan br br The Sultan of Zanzibar will arrive today at Cambridge at for a short visit Could you arrange to show him buildings of interest and send carriage br Henry Lucas Hotel Cecil London br The students obtained robes and turbans from the theatrical costumier Willy Clarkson applied blackface make up and took the train from London A carriage met the group at Cambridge railway station and took them to the guildhall where they were met by the mayor and town clerk After a brief reception they were taken on a tour of the town including some of the university s colleges the hoaxers were seen by some of their friends and acquaintances who did not recognise them After less than an hour they demanded to be returned to the station As they did not want to return to London returning from which would have meant them breaking the pm college curfew on arrival at the station they ran out of a side exit and took two hansom cabs to a friend s house where they changed back into their normal attire br The following day Cole gave an interview to the Daily Mail about the hoax the story appeared in the paper on March and was repeated in local newspapers The St James s Gazette considered the events a most audacious practical joke The Mayor wanted the students involved to be sent down but was persuaded by the Vice Chancellor that this would damage his reputation further br br br Dreadnoughts and the Royal Navy br br In the early th century Britain s naval fleet was seen as one of the foundations of its empire and a reflection of the country s power and wealth As Britain was portrayed in books plays and popular culture as an island nation the Royal Navy was seen as the defender of the island and its first line of defence A leading article in The Observer in described the supremacy of the Royal Navy as the best security for the world s peace and advancement br HMS Dreadnought the first of Britain s dreadnought class of battleship entered into Royal Navy service in Dreadnought was the most technologically advanced ship built it was better armed faster and stronger than any other vessel afloat According to the historian Jan R ger from the time the ship was launched it took on cultural significance as a symbol and it entered into public consciousness through songs and advertising When the ship visited London in part of three fleet reviews held a million people were estimated to have watched its arrival and by it had become a cultural icon with undeniable symbolic status R ger gives examples of advertising for Oxo stock cubes Drink OXO and dread nought a tailoring business that used the slogan Dreadnought and wear British clothing and Dreadnought trams ran styled as battleships and complete with imitation guns The cultural historian Elisa deCourcy describes the Dreadnought as having a near sacrosanct nature for the Edwardians br In February the captain of Dreadnought was Herbert Richmond Admiral Sir William May was the Commander in Chief Home Fleet as such Dreadnought was his flagship Also present on Dreadnought was Commander Willie Fisher the Stephens cousin who was on the staff of the Admiral br br br Hoax br br In a talk given in Woolf described how in young naval officers enjoyed playing practical jokes on one another br br the officers of the Hawke and the Dreadnought had a feud And Cole s friend who was on the Hawke had come to Cole and said to him You re a great hand at hoaxing people couldn t you do something to pull the leg of the Dreadnought They want taking down a bit Couldn t you manage to play off one of your jokes against them br This involved Cole and five friends writer Virginia Stephen later Virginia Woolf her brother Adrian Stephen Guy Ridley Anthony Buxton and the artist Duncan Grant who had themselves disguised by the theatrical costumier Willy Clarkson with skin darkeners and turbans to resemble members of the Abyssinian royal family The main limitation of the disguises was that the royals could not eat anything or their make up would be ruined Adrian Stephen took the role of interpreter br On February Clarkson s employees visited Woolf s home and applied the stage make up to Woolf Grant Buxton and Ridley then provided eastern robes According to the Daily Mirror they were also wearing of jewellery Martin Downer in his biography of Cole doubts the amount which is not repeated by any of the participants br A friend of Stephen s sent a telegram to the C in C Home Fleet Commander in chief of the vessels defending Britain stating that Prince Makalen of Abbysinia sic and suite arrive today Weymouth He wishes to see Dreadnought Kindly arrange meet them on arrival the message was signed Harding Foreign Office Cole had found a post office staffed only by women as he thought they were less likely to ask questions about the message Cole with his entourage went to London s Paddington station where Cole claimed that he was Herbert Cholmondeley of the Foreign Office and demanded a special train to Weymouth the stationmaster arranged a VIP coach br In Weymouth the navy welcomed the princes with an honour guard An Abyssinian flag was not found so the navy proceeded to use that of Zanzibar and to play Zanzibar s national anthem br The group inspected the fleet To show their appreciation they communicated in a gibberish of words drawn from Latin and Greek they asked for prayer mats and attempted to bestow fake military honours on some of the officers Commander Fisher failed to recognise either of his cousins br br When the prank was uncovered in London the ringleader Horace de Vere Cole contacted the press and sent a photo of the princes to the Daily Mirror The group s pacifist views were considered a source of embarrassment and the Royal Navy briefly became an object of ridicule The navy later demanded that Cole be arrested However Cole and his compatriots had not broken any law Instead except for Virginia Woolf they were subjected to a symbolic thrashing on the buttocks by junior Royal Navy officers br br br Aftermath br According to press reports during the visit to Dreadnought the visitors repeatedly showed amazement or appreciation by exclaiming Bunga Bunga In during the First World War HMS Dreadnought rammed and sank a German submarine the only battleship ever to do so Among the telegrams of congratulation was one that read BUNGA BUNGA br A song was heard in music halls that year sung to the tune of The Girl I Left Behind br br Thirty years later in Virginia Woolf gave talks about the Dreadnought hoax to the Rodmell Women s Institute and also to the Memoir Club the latter attended
