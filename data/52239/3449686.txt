A speech error commonly referred to as a slip of the tongue Latin lapsus linguae or occasionally self demonstratingly lipsus languae or misspeaking is a deviation conscious or unconscious from the apparently intended form of an utterance They can be subdivided into spontaneously and inadvertently produced speech errors and intentionally produced word plays or puns Another distinction can be drawn between production and comprehension errors Errors in speech production and perception are also called performance errors Some examples of speech error include sound exchange or sound anticipation errors In sound exchange errors the order of two individual morphemes is reversed while in sound anticipation errors a sound from a later syllable replaces one from an earlier syllable Slips of the tongue are a normal and common occurrence One study shows that most people can make up to as much as slips of the tongue per day br Speech errors are common among children who have yet to refine their speech and can frequently continue into adulthood When errors continue past the age of they are referred to as residual speech errors or RSEs They sometimes lead to embarrassment and betrayal of the speaker s regional or ethnic origins However it is also common for them to enter the popular culture as a kind of linguistic flavoring Speech errors may be used intentionally for humorous effect as with spoonerisms br Within the field of psycholinguistics speech errors fall under the category of language production Types of speech errors include exchange errors perseveration anticipation shift substitution blends additions and deletions The study of speech errors has contributed to the establishment refinement of models of speech production since Victoria Fromkin s pioneering work on this topic br br br Psycholinguistic explanations br Speech errors are made on an occasional basis by all speakers They occur more often when speakers are nervous tired anxious or intoxicated During live broadcasts on TV or on the radio for example nonprofessional speakers and even hosts often make speech errors because they are under stress Some speakers seem to be more prone to speech errors than others For example there is a certain connection between stuttering and speech errors Charles F Hockett explains that whenever a speaker feels some anxiety about possible lapse he will be led to focus attention more than normally on what he has just said and on what he is just about to say These are ideal breeding grounds for stuttering Another example of a chronic sufferer is Reverend William Archibald Spooner whose peculiar speech may be caused by a cerebral dysfunction but there is much evidence that he invented his famous speech errors spoonerisms br An explanation for the occurrence of speech errors comes from psychoanalysis in the so called Freudian slip Sigmund Freud assumed that speech errors are the result of an intrapsychic conflict of concurrent intentions Virtually all speech errors are caused by the intrusion of repressed ideas from the unconscious into one s conscious speech output Freud explained In fact his hypothesis explains only a minority of speech errors br br br Psycholinguistic classification br There are few speech errors that clearly fall into only one category The majority of speech errors can be interpreted in different ways and thus fall into more than one category For this reason percentage figures for the different kinds of speech errors may be of limited accuracy Moreover the study of speech errors gave rise to different terminologies and different ways of classifying speech errors Here is a collection of the main types br br Speech errors can affect different kinds of segments or linguistic units br br br Types br Grammatical For example children take time to learn irregular verbs so in English use the ed form incorrectly This is explored by Steven Pinker in his book Words and Rules br Mispronunciation br Vocabulary Young children make category approximations using car for truck for example This is known as hyponymy br br br Examples br particuly particularly elision br syntaxically syntactically vocabulary br br br Scientific relevance br Speech production is a highly complex and extremely rapid process and thus research into the involved mental mechanisms proves to be difficult Investigating the audible output of the speech production system is a way to understand these mental mechanisms According to Gary S Dell the inner workings of a highly complex system are often revealed by the way in which the system breaks down Therefore speech errors are of an explanatory value with regard to the nature of language and language production br Performance errors may provide the linguist with empirical evidence for linguistic theories and serve to test hypotheses about language and speech production models For that reason the study of speech errors is significant for the construction of performance models and gives insight into language mechanisms br br br Evidence and insights br Speech errors provide investigators with insights into the sequential order of language production processes br Speech errors clue investigators in on the interactivity of language production modules br The existence of lexical or phonemic exchange errors provides evidence that speakers typically engage in forward planning their utterances It seems that before the speaker starts speaking the whole utterance is available br Anticipation br Target Take my bike br Error Bake my bike br Perseveration br Target He pulled a tantrum br Error He pulled a pantrum br Performance errors supply evidence for the psychological existence of discrete linguistic units br Speech errors involve substitutions shifts additions and deletions of segments In order to move a sound the speaker must think of it as a separate unit Obviously one cannot account for speech errors without speaking of these discrete segments They constitute the planning units of language production Among them are distinctive features phonemes morphemes syllables words and phrases Victoria Fromkin points out that many of the segments that change and move in speech errors are precisely those postulated by linguistic theories Consequently speech errors give evidence that these units are psychologically real br One can infer from speech errors that speakers adhere to a set of linguistic rules br There is a complex set of rules which the language user follows when making use of these units Among them are for example phonetic constraints which prescribe the possible sequences of sounds Moreover the study of speech error confirmed the existence of rules that state how morphemes are to be pronounced or how they should be combined with other morphemes The following examples show that speech errors also observe these rules br Target He likes to have his team rested rest id br Error He likes to have his rest teamed ti m d br Target Both kids are sick kid z br Error Both sicks are kids sik s br Here the past tense morpheme resp the plural morpheme is phonologically conditioned although the lemmas are exchanged This proves that first the lemmas are inserted and then phonological conditioning takes place br Target Don t yell so loud Don t shout so loud br Error Don t shell so loud br Shout and yell are both appropriate words in this context Due to the pressure to continue speaking the speaker has to make a quick decision which word should be selected This pressure leads to the speaker s attempt to utter the two words simultaneously which resulted in the creation of a blend According to Charles F Hockett there are six possible blends of shout and yell Why did the speaker choose shell and not one of the alternatives The speaker obeyed unconscious linguistic rules because he selected the blend which satisfied the linguistic demands of these rules the best Illegal non words are for example instantaneously rejected br In conclusion the rules which tell language users how to produce speech must also be part of our mental organization of language br Substitution errors for instance reveal parts of the organization and structure of the mental lexicon br Target My thesis is too long br Error My thesis is too short br In case of substitution errors both segments mostly belong to the same category which means for example that a noun is substituted for a noun Lexical selection errors are based on semantic relations such as synonymy antonymy or membership of the same lexical field For this reason the mental lexicon is structured in terms of semantic relationships br Target George s wife br Error George s life br Target fashion square br Error passion square br Some substitution errors which are based on phonological similarities supply evidence that the mental lexicon is also organized in terms of sound br Errors in speech are non random Linguists can elicit from the speech error data how speech errors are produced and which linguistic rules they adhere to As a result they are able to predict speech errors br Four generalizations about speech errors have been identified br Interacting elements tend to come from a similar linguistic environment which means that initial middle final segments interact with one another br Elements that interact with one another tend to be phonetically or semantically similar to one another This means that consonants exchange with consonants and vowels with vowels br Slips are consistent with the phonological rules of the language br There are consistent stress patterns in speech errors Predominantly both interacting segments receive major or minor stress br These four generalizations support the idea of the lexical bias effect This effect states that our phonological speech errors generally form words rather than non words Baars showed evidence for this effect when he presented word pairs in rapid succession and asked participants to say both words in rapid succession back In most of the trials the mistakes made still formed actual words br br br Information obtained from performance additions br An example of the information that can be obtained is the use of um or uh in a conversation These might be meaningful words that tell different things one of which is to hold a place in the conversation so as not to be interrupted There seems to be a hesitant stage and fluent stage that suggest speech has different levels of production The pauses seem to occur between sentences conjunctional points and before the first content word in a sentence That suggests that a large part of speech production happens there br Schachter et al conducted an experiment to examine if the numbers of word choices affect pausing They sat in on the lectures of undergraduate professors from different departments and calculated the number and times of filled pauses and unfilled pauses They found significantly more pauses in the humanities departments as opposed to the natural sciences These findings suggest that the greater the number of word choices the more frequent are the pauses and hence the pauses serve to allow us time to choose our words br Slips of the tongue are another form of errors that can help us understand the process of speech production better Slips can occur at various levels syntactic phrasal lexical semantic morphological and phonological They can take multiple forms such as additions substitutions deletions exchanges anticipations perseverations shifts and haplologies M F Garrett Slips are orderly because language production is orderly br There are some biases shown through slips of the tongue One kind is a lexical bias which shows that the slips people generate are more often actual words than random sound strings Baars Motley and Mackay found that it was more common for people to turn two actual words to two other actual words than when they do not create real words This suggests that lexemes might overlap somewhat or be stored similarly br A second kind is a semantic bias which shows a tendency for sound bias to create words that are semantically related to other words in the linguistic environment Motley and Baars found that a word pair like get one will more likely slip to wet gun if the pair before it is damp rifle These results suggest that we are sensitive to how things are laid out semantically br br br Euphemistic misspeaking br Since the s the word misspeaking has been used increasingly in politics to imply that errors made by a speaker are accidental and should not be construed as a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts of a case As such its usage has attracted a degree of media coverage particularly from critics who feel that the term is overly approbative in cases where either ignorance of the facts or intent to misrepresent should not be discarded as possibilities br The word was used by a White House spokesman after George W Bush seemed to say that his government was always thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people a classic example of a Bushism and more famously by then American presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who recalled landing in at the US military outpost of Tuzla under sniper fire in fact video footage demonstrates that there were no such problems on her arrival Other users of the term include American politician Richard Blumenthal who incorrectly stated on a number of occasions that he had served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War br br br See also br br br br br br
