title: Piltdown Man
id: 56223
The Piltdown Man was a paleoanthropological fraud in which bone fragments were presented as the fossilised remains of a previously unknown early human Although there were doubts about its authenticity virtually from the beginning in the remains were still broadly accepted for many years and the falsity of the hoax was only definitively demonstrated in An extensive scientific review in established that amateur archaeologist Charles Dawson was responsible for the fraudulent evidence br In Charles Dawson claimed that he had discovered the missing link between early apes and man In February Dawson contacted Arthur Smith Woodward Keeper of Geology at the Natural History Museum stating he had found a section of a human like skull in Pleistocene gravel beds near Piltdown East Sussex That summer Dawson and Smith Woodward purportedly discovered more bones and artifacts at the site which they connected to the same individual These finds included a jawbone more skull fragments a set of teeth and primitive tools br Smith Woodward reconstructed the skull fragments and hypothesised that they belonged to a human ancestor from years ago The discovery was announced at a Geological Society meeting and was given the Latin name Eoanthropus dawsoni Dawson s dawn man The questionable significance of the assemblage remained the subject of considerable controversy until it was conclusively exposed in as a forgery It was found to have consisted of the altered mandible and some teeth of an orangutan deliberately combined with the cranium of a fully developed though small brained modern human br The Piltdown hoax is prominent for two reasons the attention it generated around the subject of human evolution and the length of time years that elapsed from its alleged initial discovery to its definitive exposure as a composite forgery br br At a meeting of the Geological Society of London on December Charles Dawson claimed that a workman at the Piltdown gravel pit had given him a fragment of the skull four years earlier According to Dawson workmen at the site discovered the skull shortly before his visit and broke it up in the belief that it was a fossilised coconut Revisiting the site on several occasions Dawson found further fragments of the skull and took them to Arthur Smith Woodward keeper of the geological department at the British Museum Greatly interested by the finds Woodward accompanied Dawson to the site Though the two worked together between June and September Dawson alone recovered more skull fragments and half of the lower jaw The skull unearthed in was the only find discovered in situ with most of the other pieces found in the gravel pit s spoil heaps French Jesuit paleontologist and geologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin participated in the uncovering of the Piltdown skull with Woodward br At the same meeting Woodward announced that a reconstruction of the fragments indicated that the skull was in many ways similar to that of a modern human except for the occiput the part of the skull that sits on the spinal column and brain size which was about two thirds that of a modern human He went on to indicate that save for two human like molar teeth the jaw bone was indistinguishable from that of a modern young chimpanzee From the British Museum s reconstruction of the skull Woodward proposed that Piltdown Man represented an evolutionary missing link between apes and humans since the combination of a human like cranium with an ape like jaw tended to support the notion then prevailing in England that human evolution began with the brain br br The find was considered legitimate by Otto Schoetensack who had discovered the Heidelberg fossils just a few years earlier he described it as being the best evidence for an ape like ancestor of modern humans br But almost from the outset Woodward s reconstruction of the Piltdown fragments was strongly challenged by some researchers At the Royal College of Surgeons copies of the same fragments used by the British Museum in their reconstruction were used to produce an entirely different model one that in brain size and other features resembled a modern human This reconstruction by Prof later Sir Arthur Keith was called Homo piltdownensis in reflection of its more human appearance br Woodward s reconstruction included ape like canine teeth which was itself controversial In August Woodward Dawson and Teilhard de Chardin began a systematic search of the spoil heaps specifically to find the missing canines Teilhard de Chardin soon found a canine that according to Woodward fitted the jaw perfectly A few days later Teilhard de Chardin moved to France and took no further part in the discoveries Noting that the tooth corresponds exactly with that of an ape Woodward expected the find to end any dispute over his reconstruction of the skull However Keith attacked the find Keith pointed out that human molars are the result of side to side movement when chewing The canine in the Piltdown jaw was impossible as it prevented side to side movement To explain the wear on the molar teeth the canine could not have been any higher than the molars Grafton Elliot Smith a fellow anthropologist sided with Woodward and at the next Royal Society meeting claimed that Keith s opposition was motivated entirely by ambition Keith later recalled Such was the end of our long friendship br As early as David Waterston of King s College London published in Nature his conclusion that the sample consisted of an ape mandible and human skull Likewise French paleontologist Marcellin Boule concluded the same in A third opinion from the American zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller Jr concluded that Piltdown s jaw came from a fossil ape In Franz Weidenreich examined the remains and correctly reported that they consisted of a modern human cranium and an orangutan jaw with filed down teeth br br In Dawson claimed to have found three fragments of a second skull Piltdown II at a new site about two miles m away from the original finds Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson but was unsuccessful So far as is known the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson s death in August and deliberately implied that he knew where they had been found In Henry Fairfield Osborn President of the American Museum of Natural History examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together without question and that the Sheffield Park fragments were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original type br The Sheffield Park finds were taken as proof of the authenticity of the Piltdown Man it may have been chance that brought an ape s jaw and a human skull together but the odds of it happening twice were slim Even Keith conceded to this new evidence though he still harboured personal doubts br br On July at Barkham Manor Piltdown Sir Arthur Keith unveiled a memorial to mark the site where Piltdown Man was discovered by Charles Dawson Sir Arthur finished his speech saying br br So long as man is interested in his long past history in the vicissitudes which our early forerunners passed through and the varying fare which overtook them the name of Charles Dawson is certain of remembrance We do well to link his name to this picturesque corner of Sussex the scene of his discovery I have now the honour of unveiling this monolith dedicated to his memory br The inscription on the memorial stone reads br br Here in the old river gravel Mr Charles Dawson FSA found the fossil skull of Piltdown Man The discovery was described by Mr Charles Dawson and Sir Arthur Smith Woodward Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society br br From the outset some scientists expressed scepticism about the Piltdown find see above Gerrit Smith Miller Jr for example observed in that deliberate malice could hardly have been more successful than the hazards of deposition in so breaking the fossils as to give free scope to individual judgment in fitting the parts together In the decades prior to its exposure as a forgery in scientists increasingly regarded Piltdown as an enigmatic aberration inconsistent with the path of hominid evolution as demonstrated by fossils found elsewhere br In November Time magazine published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner proving that Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was a composite of three distinct species It consisted of a human skull of medieval age the year old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and chromic acid Microscopic examination revealed file marks on the teeth and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet br The Piltdown Man hoax succeeded so well because at the time of its discovery the scientific establishment believed that the large modern brain preceded the modern omnivorous diet and the forgery provided exactly that evidence Stephen Jay Gould argued that nationalism and cultural prejudice played a role in the ready acceptance of Piltdown Man as genuine because it satisfied European expectations that the earliest humans would be found in Eurasia and the British in particular wanted a first Briton to set against fossil hominids found elsewhere in Europe br br The identity of the Piltdown forger remains unknown but suspects have included Dawson Pierre Teilhard de Chardin Arthur Keith Martin A C Hinton Horace de Vere Cole and Arthur Conan Doyle br br The focus on Charles Dawson as the main forger is supported by the accumulation of evidence regarding other archaeological hoaxes he perpetrated in the decade or two before the Piltdown discovery The archaeologist Miles Russell of Bournemouth University analysed Dawson s antiquarian collection and determined that at least of his specimens were fakes Among these were the teeth of a multituberculate mammal Plagiaulax dawsoni found in and whose teeth had been filed down in the same way that the teeth of Piltdown Man were to be some years later the so called shadow figures on the walls of Hastings Castle a unique hafted stone axe the Bexhill boat a hybrid seafaring vessel the Pevensey bricks allegedly the latest datable finds from Roman Britain the contents of the Lavant Caves a fraudulent flint mine the Beauport Park Roman statuette a hybrid iron object the Bulverhythe Hammer shaped with an iron knife in the same way as the Piltdown elephant bone implement would later be a fraudulent Chinese bronze vase the Brighton Toad in the Hole a toad entombed within a flint nodule the English Channel sea serpent the Uckfield Horseshoe another hybrid iron object and the Lewes Prick Spur Of his antiquarian publications most demonstrate evidence of plagiarism or at least naive referencing Russell wrote Piltdown was not a one off hoax more the culmination of a life s work In addition Harry Morris an acquaintance of Dawson had come into possession of one of the flints obtained by Dawson at the Piltdown gravel pit He suspected that it had been artificially aged stained by C Dawson with intent to defraud He remained deeply suspicious of Dawson for many years to come though he never sought to discredit him publicly possibly because it would have been an argument against the eolith theory which Morris strongly supported br Adrian Lister of the UK s Natural History Museum has said that some people have suggested that there may also have been a second fraudster seeking to use outrageous fraud in the hope of anonymously exposing the original frauds This was a theory first proposed by Miles Russell He has explained that the piece nicknamed the cricket bat a fossilised elephant bone was such a crudely forged early tool that it may have been planted to cast doubt upon the other finds the Earliest Englishman in effect being recovered with the earliest evidence for the game of cricket This seems to have been part of a wider attempt by disaffected members of the Sussex archaeological community to expose Dawson s activities other examples being the obviously fraudulent Maresfield Map the Ashburnham Dial and the Piltdown Palaeolith Nevertheless the cricket bat was accepted at the time even though it aroused the suspicions of some and ultimately helped lead to the eventual recognition of the fraud decades later br In the results of an eight year review of the forgery were released identifying Dawson s modus operandi Multiple specimens demonstrated the same consistent preparation application of the stain packing of crevices with local gravel and fixation of teeth and gravel with dentist s putty Analysis of shape and trace DNA showed that teeth from both sites belonged to the same orangutan The consistent method and common source indicated the work of one person on all the specimens and Dawson was the only one associated with Piltdown II The authors did not rule out the possibility that someone else provided the false fossils to Dawson but ruled out several other suspects including Teilhard de Chardin and Doyle based on the skill and knowledge demonstrated by the forgeries which closely reflected ideas fashionable in biology at the time br On the other hand Stephen Jay Gould judged that Pierre Teilhard de Chardin conspired with Dawson in the Piltdown forgery Teilhard de Chardin had travelled to regions of Africa where one of the anomalous finds originated and resided in the Wealden area from the date of the earliest finds although others suggest that he was without doubt innocent in this matter Hinton left a trunk in storage at the Natural History Museum in London that in was found to contain animal bones and teeth carved and stained in a manner similar to the carving and staining on the Piltdown finds Phillip Tobias implicated Arthur Keith in helping Dawson by detailing the history of the investigation of the hoax dismissing other theories and listing inconsistencies in Keith s statements and actions Other investigations suggest that the hoax involved accomplices rather than a single forger br Richard Milner an American historian of science argued that Arthur Conan Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the Piltdown Man hoax Milner noted that Doyle had a plausible motive namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one of his favourite psychics and said that The Lost World appeared to contain several clues referring cryptically to his having been involved in the hoax Samuel Rosenberg s book Naked is the Best Disguise purports to explain how throughout his writings Doyle had provided overt clues to otherwise hidden or suppressed aspects of his way of thinking that seemed to support the idea that Doyle would be involved in such a hoax However more recent research suggests that Doyle was not involved In researchers at the Natural History Museum and Liverpool John Moores University analyzed DNA evidence showing that responsibility for the hoax lay with Dawson who had originally found the remains Dawson had initially not been considered the likely perpetrator because the hoax was seen as being too elaborate for him to have devised However the DNA evidence showed that a supposedly ancient tooth Dawson had discovered in at a different site came from the same jaw as that of the Piltdown Man suggesting that he had planted them both That tooth too was later proven to have been planted as part of a hoax br Chris Stringer an anthropologist from the Natural History Museum was quoted as saying Conan Doyle was known to play golf at the Piltdown site and had even given Dawson a lift in his car to the area but he was a public man and very busy and it is very unlikely that he would have had the time to create the hoax So there are some coincidences but I think they are just coincidences When you look at the fossil evidence you can only associate Dawson with all the finds and Dawson was known to be personally ambitious He wanted professional recognition He wanted to be a member of the Royal Society and he was after an MBE sic He wanted people to stop seeing him as an amateur br br In the majority of the scientific community believed the Piltdown Man was the missing link between apes and humans However over time the Piltdown Man lost its validity as other discoveries such as the Taung Child and Peking Man were made R W Ehrich and G M Henderson note To those who are not completely disillusioned by the work of their predecessors the disqualification of the Piltdown skull changes little in the broad evolutionary pattern The validity of the specimen has always been questioned Eventually during the s and s more advanced dating technologies such as the fluorine absorption test proved scientifically that this skull was actually a fraud br br The Piltdown Man fraud significantly affected early research on human evolution Notably it led scientists down a blind alley in the belief that the human brain expanded in size before the jaw adapted to new types of food Discoveries of Australopithecine fossils such as the Taung child found by Raymond Dart during the s in South Africa were ignored because of the support for Piltdown Man as the missing link and the reconstruction of human evolution was confused for decades The examination and debate over Piltdown Man caused a vast expenditure of time and effort on the fossil with an estimated papers written on the topic br The book Scientology A History of Man by L Ron Hubbard features the Piltdown Man as a phase of biological history capable of leaving a person with subconscious memories of traumatic incidents that can only be resolved by use of Scientology technology Recovered memories of this phase are prompted by one s obsession with biting hiding the teeth or mouth and early familial issues Nominally this appears to be related to the large jaw of the Piltdown Man specimen The book was first published in shortly before the fraud was confirmed and has since been republished times most recently in br Creationists often cite the hoax along with Nebraska Man as evidence of an alleged dishonesty of paleontologists who study human evolution although scientists themselves had exposed the Piltdown hoax and the Nebraska Man incident was not a deliberate fraud br In November the Natural History Museum in London held an exhibition to mark the th anniversary of the exposure of the fraud br br The Piltdown case is an example of how race nationalism and gender influenced scientific and public opinion Newspapers explained the seemingly primitive and contradictory features of the skull and jaw by attempting to demonstrate an analogy with non white races presumed at the time to be more primitive and less developed than white Europeans The influence of nationalism resulted in the differing interpretations of the find whilst the majority of British scientists accepted the discovery as the earliest Englishman European and American scientists were considerably more sceptical and several suggested at the time that the skull and jaw were from two different creatures and had been accidentally mixed up Although Woodward suggested that the specimen discovered might be female most scientists and journalists referred to Piltdown as a male The only notable exception was the coverage by the Daily Express newspaper which referred to the discovery as a woman but only to mock the suffragette movement of which the Express was
