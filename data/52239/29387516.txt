false allegations or false claims They can occur in any of the following contexts br br Informally in everyday life br Quasi judicially br Judicially br br When there is insufficient supporting evidence to determine whether it is true or false an accusation is described as unsubstantiated or unfounded Accusations that are determined to be false based on corroborating evidence can be divided into three categories br br A completely false allegation in that the alleged events did not occur br An allegation that describes events that did occur but were perpetrated by an individual who is not accused and in which the accused person is innocent br An allegation that is false in that it mixes descriptions of events that actually happened with other events that did not occur br A false allegation can occur as the result of intentional lying on the part of the accuser or unintentionally due to a confabulation either arising spontaneously due to mental illness or resulting from deliberate or accidental suggestive questioning or faulty interviewing techniques In researchers Poole and Lindsay suggested that separate labels should be applied to the two concepts proposing that the term false allegations be used specifically when the accuser is aware that they are lying and false suspicions for the wider range of false accusations in which suggestive questioning may have been involved br When a person is suspected of a wrongdoing for which they are in fact responsible false accusation may be used to divert attention from one s own guilt False accusation may also arise in part from the conduct of the accused particularly where the accused engages in behaviors consistent with having committed the suspected wrongdoing either unconsciously or for purposes of appearing guilty br Additionally once a false accusation has been made particularly an emotionally laden one normal human emotional responses to being falsely accused such as fear anger or denial of the accusation may be misinterpreted as evidence of guilt Examples would include accusing based off irrational psychotic paranoia A real life example Mr Psych had a picture knocked off his book shelf by
