Life is an American magazine published weekly from to as an intermittent special until a monthly from until and an online supplement since During its golden age from to Life was a wide ranging weekly general interest magazine known for the quality of its photography and was one of the nation s most popular magazines regularly reaching one quarter of the population br Life was published independently for its first years until as a general interest and light entertainment magazine heavy on illustrations jokes and social commentary It featured some of the most important writers editors illustrators and cartoonists of its time including Charles Dana Gibson Norman Rockwell and others In Gibson became the magazine s editor following the death of John Ames Mitchell its owner and editor During its later years the magazine offered brief capsule reviews similar to those in The New Yorker of plays and movies running in New York City but with the innovative touch of a colored typographic bullet resembling a traffic light appended to each review green for a positive review red for a negative one and amber for mixed notices br In Time publisher Henry Luce bought Life solely for its title and greatly redesigned the publication LIFE stylized in all caps became the first all photographic American news magazine and it dominated the market for several decades with a circulation peaking at over million copies a week The magazine s role in the history of photojournalism is considered its most important contribution to publishing Its prestige attracted the memoirs of President Harry S Truman Prime Minister Winston Churchill and General Douglas MacArthur all serialized in its pages br After Time Inc continued to use the Life brand for special and commemorative issues Life returned to regularly scheduled issues as a weekly newspaper supplement from to The website life com originally one of the channels on Time Inc s Pathfinder service was for a time in the late s

Miller Both men retained their holdings until their deaths Miller served as secretary treasurer of the magazine and managed the business side of the operation Mitchell a year old illustrator who used a inheritance to invest in the weekly magazine served as its publisher He also created the first Life name plate with cupids as mascots and later on drew its masthead of a knight leveling his lance at the posterior of a fleeing devil Then he took advantage of a new printing process using zinc coated plates which improved the reproduction of his illustrations and artwork This edge helped because Life faced stiff competition from the best selling humor magazines Judge and Puck which were already established and successful Edward Sandford Martin was brought on as Life s first literary editor the recent Harvard University graduate was a founder of the Harvard Lampoon br The motto of the first issue of Life was While there s Life there s hope The new magazine set forth its principles and policies to its readers br br We wish to have some fun in this paper We shall try to domesticate as much as possible of the casual cheerfulness that is drifting about in an unfriendly world We shall have something to say about religion about politics fashion society literature the stage the stock exchange and the police station and we will speak out what is in our mind as fairly as truthfully and as decently as we know how br The magazine was a success and soon attracted the industry s leading contributors of which the most important was Charles Dana Gibson Three years after the magazine was founded the Massachusetts native first sold Life a drawing for a dog outside his kennel howling at the Moon Encouraged by a publisher also an artist Gibson was joined at Life by illustrators Palmer Cox creator of the Brownie A B Frost Oliver Herford and E W Kemble Life s literary roster included John Kendrick Bangs James Whitcomb Riley and Brander Matthews br br br th century br br Mitchell was

s death in Gibson bought the magazine for million but the end of World War I had brought on social change Life s brand of humor was outdated as readers wanted more daring and risque works and Life struggled to compete A little more than three years after purchasing Life Gibson quit and turned the decaying property over to publisher Clair Maxwell and treasurer Henry Richter Gibson retired and relocated to Maine where he painted and lost interest in the magazine br In Gibson selected former Vanity Fair staffer Robert E Sherwood as editor A WWI veteran and member of the Algonquin Round Table Sherwood tried to inject sophisticated humor onto the pages Life published Ivy League jokes cartoons flapper sayings and all burlesque issues Beginning in Life undertook a crusade against Prohibition It also tapped the humorous writings of Frank Sullivan Robert Benchley Dorothy Parker Franklin Pierce Adams and Corey Ford Among the illustrators and cartoonists were Ralph Barton Percy Crosby Don Herold Ellison Hoover H T Webster Art Young and John Held Jr br Life had readers in but as the Jazz Age rolled into the Great Depression the magazine lost money and subscribers By the time Maxwell and editor George Eggleston took over Life had switched from publishing weekly to monthly The two men went to work revamping its editorial style to meet the times which resulted in improved readership However Life had passed its prime and was sliding toward financial ruin The New Yorker debuting in February copied many of the features and styles of Life it recruited staff from its editorial and art departments Another blow to Life s circulation came from raunchy humor periodicals such as Ballyhoo and Hooey which ran what can be termed outhouse gags In Esquire joined Life s competitors In its final years Life struggled to make a profit br Announcing the end of Life Maxwell stated We cannot claim like Mr Gene Tunney that we resigned our championship undefeated in our prime But at least we hope to retire gracefully from a world still friendly br For Life s final issue in its original format year old Edward Sandford Martin was recalled from editorial retirement to compose its obituary He wrote br br That Life should be passing into the hands of new owners and directors is of the liveliest interest to the sole survivor of the little group that saw it born in January As for me I wish it all good fortune grace mercy and peace and usefulness to a distracted world that does not know which way to turn nor what will happen to it next A wonderful time for a new voice to make a noise that needs to be heard br br br Weekly news magazine br br br br In publisher Henry Luce purchased Life magazine for US million in because he wanted the name for his company Time Inc to use Time Inc sold

images as to words The first issue of Life which sold for ten cents worth in had five pages of Alfred Eisenstaedt s photographs br In planning the weekly news magazine Luce circulated a confidential prospectus within Time Inc in which described his vision for the new Life magazine and what he viewed as its unique purpose Life magazine was to be the first publication with a focus on photographs that enabled the American public br br To see life to see the world to eyewitness great events to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud to see strange things machines armies

Collier s magazine Capa accompanied the first wave of the D Day invasion in Normandy France on June and returned with only a handful of images many of them out of focus The magazine wrote in the
