title: Infodemic
id: 63449421
An infodemic is a rapid and far reaching spread of both accurate and inaccurate information about certain issues The word is a portmanteau of information and epidemic and is used as a metaphor to describe how misinformation and disinformation can spread like a virus from person to person and affect people like a disease This term originally coined in by David Rothkopf rose to prominence in during the COVID pandemic br br br History br In his May article in the Washington Post also published in Newsday The Record the Oakland Tribune and the China Daily foreign policy expert David Rothkopf referred to the information epidemic or infodemic in the context of the SARS outbreak The outbreak of SARS which was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus began in a remote region in Guangdong China in November By the time the outbreak ended in May it had reached countries and there were over confirmed cases and deaths br Rothkopf who was at that time a member of the advisory committee s board of directors at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health s Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security which provides policy recommendations to the United States government and the World Health Organization said that the infodemic was the second of two concurrent epidemics Rothkopf described how the information epidemic transformed SARS from a regional health crisis into a debacle that spread globally with both economic and social repercussions He said this infodemic was not the rapid spread of simple news via the media nor is it simply the rumor mill on steroids Rather as with SARS it is a complex phenomenon caused by the interaction of mainstream media specialist media and internet sites and informal media which is to say wireless phones text messaging pagers faxes and e mail all transmitting some combination of fact rumor interpretation and propaganda Rothkopf citing the State Department said that was the year of the most heightened state of terrorism panic in our history even though terrorism globally had decreased to its lowest level since His company the Washington DC based strategic intelligence and analysis firm Intellibridge which he had founded in tracked the January Chinese reports on the outbreak On February Intellibridge provided their analysis to the U S defense community and then posted the information on ProMED a Federation of American Scientists Web site br The general public did not learn of the outbreak until February when an elderly woman died of SARS in her home in Toronto Canada from Hong Kong Her son who spread the disease in a Toronto hospital also died With the first death in North America the Western media began to cover the outbreak Rothkopf said that if more had been done earlier to manage the disease as well as information about SARS perhaps there might not have been a worldwide panic The infodemic spread globally far beyond the countries that had SARS victims and set off a chain reaction of economic and social consequences It also made it harder for health organizations to control the SARS epidemic as panic spread online br In his December article entitled Infodemiology The epidemiology of mis information in The American Journal of Medicine health researcher Gunther Eysenbach coined the term infodemiologist and later used the term to refer to attempts at digital disease detection br Use of the term infodemic increased rapidly during the COVID pandemic A study found that from there were articles mentioning the word infodemic while between and there were published stories using the term The United Nations and the World Health Organization began using the term infodemic during the COVID pandemic as early as February The related term disinfodemic referring to COVID disinformation campaigns has been used by UNESCO By the time that the Journal of Medical Internet Research published their June issue featuring the WHO s framework for managing the infodemic related to the COVID pandemic the WHO and public health agencies had acknowledged infodemiology as an emerging scientific field that was of critical importance during a pandemic By the WHO had published a number of resources clarifying the infodemic br A Royal Society and British Academy joint report published in October said of infodemics that COVID vaccine deployment faces an infodemic with misinformation often filling the knowledge void characterised by distrust of science and selective use of expert authority distrust in pharmaceutical companies and government straightforward explanations use of emotion and echo chambers and to combat the ill and inoculate the public endorsed the Singaporean POFMA legislation which criminalises misinformation The Aspen Institute even started their misinformation project before the pandemic br A blue ribbon working group on infodemics from the Forum on Information and Democracy produced a report in November highlighting recommendations to protect democracies human rights and health br The Merriam Webster Dictionary tracked its renewed usage during the COVID pandemic br br br Definitions br In his May article in the Post Rothkopf wrote that the information epidemic or infodemic was a combination of a few facts mixed with fear speculation and rumor amplified and relayed swiftly worldwide by modern information technologies br On February the World Health Organization defined infodemic as a an over abundance of information some accurate and some not that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it A February WHO publication said that a n infodemic is too much information including false or misleading information in digital and physical environments during a disease outbreak br Eysenbach described infodemiology as the study of the determinants and distribution of health information and misinformation br br br Research during COVID br As COVID swept across the globe information about how to stay safe and how to identify symptoms became vital However especially in the first phases of the pandemic the amount of false not validated and partially true information on the media was huge Even seemingly reliable government sources did not always follow best practices in disseminating data about COVID with many potentially misleading maps published on official websites The inappropriate use of maps on these websites may have contributed to political polarization in response to COVID epidemiological control measures There was also a proliferation of systematic reviews of COVID related evidence not all of which was robustly conducted Researchers have pointed out a few primary challenges of communicating with the public about COVID First social media platforms that prioritize engagement over accuracy and allow fringe opinions to thrive without correction create an information ecology that is difficult to understand Second as fast moving science and politics intertwine during the pandemic making decisions related to combatting misinformation becomes complicated by a volatile political environment and frequently changing scientific information A U S based survey research revealed that during March and April higher news consumption about COVID especially through social media was associated with lower levels of knowledge and more fake news beliefs However preliminary research published in fall suggested that visual information e g infographics about science and scientists designed to address trust might be able to mitigate belief in misinformation about COVID br br br Combatting infodemics br Researchers have been seeking tools to combat infodemics Gunther Eysenbach brings up four pillars of infodemic management information monitoring infoveillance building eHealth literacy and science literacy capacity encouraging knowledge refinement and quality improvement processes such as fact checking and peer review and accurate and timely knowledge translation which minimizes distorting factors such as political or commercial influences Scholars also advocate for tech platforms to police their content more effectively and empower individuals to make better decisions on their own to promote the emergence of truth Social media companies may offer a variety of cues to help people make better judgments of whether a message is legitimate or not For example Facebook might in addition to showing how many likes a post has received allow the count of dislikes to offer a more symmetric view of opinions br Research on information dissemination during the COVID pandemic identified issues with standardization and presentation of related information on official U S government sources specifically state and federal government COVID dashboards When the most authoritative sources of information are not presenting the data accurately bad conclusions are inevitable The research suggested official sources for information take steps to ensure the way data are collected analyzed and presented is up to the highest standards and adheres to all conventions Standards of web maps for government agencies should be developed widely published and adhered to The web based maps and dashboards are if properly employed suggested as possible ways to combat infodemics in the future br However scholars emphasize that traditionally proposed ways to combat misinformation tend to rely on the assumption that if people encounter the correct information about an issue they will make rational decisions based on the best scientific information available Research shows that this is often not the case and that people do not act in the best interest of scientific fact for reasons including cognitive preferences for old habits forgetfulness small inconveniences in the moment preferences for the path of least resistance and motivated reasoning Thus combatting misinformation should rely on a more nuanced analysis of both the content of the misinformation as well as the socio political environment in which it was disseminated br br br Criticism br Financial Times journalist Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan said in his August article that casting the spread of misinformation and disinformation in terms of disease risks oversimplifying the problem and that unlike the status of being healthy or infected by an actual disease what constitutes accurate information is also subject to change Venkataramakrishnan also pointed out that the focus of the infodemic has often been on conspiracy theorists and snake oil salesmen largely ignoring the at times problematic actions and confusing messaging of governments and public health bodies throughout the pandemic br Communication scholars Felix Simon and Chico Camargo at Oxford University said in their July New Media Society article that infodemic as metaphor can be misleading as it conflates multiple forms of social behaviour oversimplifies a complex situation and helps constitute a phenomenon for which concrete evidence remains patchy Pointing out that the infodemic as a concept is journalistically powerful intuitively satisfying and in strong resonance with personal experiences and intuition Simon and Camargo argue that empirical evidence for many of the claims surrounding the term is lacking Instead of a genuine phenomenon they see the infodemic as a territorial claim for those who want to apply their skills a signal to others that they are working in this area or a framing device to tie one s work to larger debates Along the same lines Krause Freiling and Scheufele warn of difficulties related to creating an infodemic about the infodemic and that research surrounding the term warrants clarification and acknowledgment of uncertainties related to its novelty and impact br br br In popular culture br In the PC videogame Infodemic Journalism in crisis was announced by the Peruvian media and information literacy MIL non
