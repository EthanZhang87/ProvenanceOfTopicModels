id: 573139
In politics and economics a Potemkin village Russian romanized potyomkinskiye derevni is a construction literal or figurative whose purpose is to provide an external fa ade to a situation to make people believe that the situation is better than it is The term comes from stories of a fake portable village built by Grigory Potemkin a field marshal and former lover of Empress Catherine II solely to impress the Empress during her journey to Crimea in Modern historians agree that accounts of this portable village are exaggerated The original story was that Potemkin erected phony portable settlements along the banks of the Dnieper River in order to impress the Russian Empress and foreign guests The structures would be disassembled after she passed and re assembled farther along her route to be seen again br br br Origin br br Grigory Potemkin was a minister and lover of the Russian Empress Catherine II After the Russian annexation of Crimea from the Ottoman Empire and liquidation of the Cossack Zaporozhian Sich see New Russia Potemkin became governor of the region Crimea had been devastated by the war and the Muslim Tatar inhabitants of Crimea were viewed as a potential fifth column of the Ottoman Empire Potemkin s major tasks were to pacify and rebuild by bringing in Russian settlers In as a new war was about to break out between Russia and the Ottoman Empire Catherine II with her court and several ambassadors made an unprecedented six month trip to New Russia One purpose of this trip was to impress Russia s allies prior to the war To help accomplish this Potemkin was said to have set up mobile villages on the banks of the Dnieper River As soon as the barge carrying the Empress and ambassadors arrived Potemkin s men dressed as peasants would populate the village Once the barge left the village was disassembled then rebuilt downstream overnight br br br Historical accuracy br According to Simon Sebag Montefiore Potemkin s most comprehensive English language biographer the tale of elaborate fake settlements with glowing fires designed to comfort the monarch and her entourage as they surveyed the barren territory at night is largely fictional Aleksandr Panchenko an established specialist on th century Russia used original correspondence and memoirs to conclude that the Potemkin villages are a myth He writes Based on the above said we must conclude that the myth of Potemkin villages is exactly a myth and not an established fact He writes that Potyomkin indeed decorated existing cities and villages but made no secret that this was a decoration br The close relationship between Potemkin and the empress could have made it difficult for him to deceive her Thus if there were deception it would have been mainly directed towards the foreign ambassadors accompanying the imperial party br Although Potemkin village has come to mean especially in a political context any hollow or false construct physical or figurative meant to hide an undesirable or potentially damaging situation it is possible that the phrase cannot be applied accurately to its own original historical inspiration According to some historians some of the buildings were real and others were constructed to show what the region would look like in the near future and at least Catherine and possibly also her foreign visitors knew which were which According to these historians the claims of deception were part of a defamation campaign against Potemkin br According to a legend in when Catherine passed through Tula on her way back from the trip the local governor Mikhail Krechetnikov attempted a deception of that kind in order to hide the effects of a bad harvest br br br Modern usage br br In the Old West of the United States Western false front architecture was often used to create the illusion of affluence and stability in a new frontier town The style included a tall vertical fa ade with a square top in front of a wood framed building often hiding a gable roof The goal for the architecture was to project an image of stability and success for the town while the business owners did not invest much in buildings that might be temporary These towns often did not last long before becoming ghost towns so businessmen wanted to get started quickly but did not want to spend a lot on their stores Many Western movies feature this kind of architecture because just like the original buildings it is quick and cheap to create br As told in his book The Gulag Archipelago Solzhenitsyn declined to visit the Kriukovo Gulag with a Soviet official seemingly chosen by the Soviets well in advance of their meeting as Solzhenitsyn assumed it would be a Potemkin structure br Many of the newly constructed base areas at ski resorts are referred to as Potemkin villages These create the illusion of a quaint mountain town but are actually carefully planned theme shopping centers hotels and restaurants designed for maximum revenue Similarly in The Geography of Nowhere American writer James Howard Kunstler refers to contemporary suburban shopping centers as Potemkin village shopping plazas br br Sometimes instead of the full phrase just Potemkin is used as an adjective For example the use of a row of trees to screen a clearcut area from motorists has been called a Potemkin forest For example the glossary entry for clearcut in We Have The Right To Exist A Translation of Aboriginal Indigenous Thought states that Much of the extensive clearcut in northern Minnesota is insulated from scrutiny by the urbanized public by a Potemkin forest or as the D N R terms it an aesthetic strip a thin illusion of forest about six trees deep along most highways and fronting waters frequented by tourists Another example is the phrase Potemkin court which implies that the court s reason to exist is being called into question differing from the phrase kangaroo court with which the court s standard of justice is being impugned br Potemkin village is a phrase that has been used by American judges especially members of a multiple judge panel who dissent from the majority s opinion on a particular matter to refer to an inaccurate or tortured interpretation and or application of a particular legal doctrine to the specific facts at issue Use of the phrase is meant to imply that the reasons espoused by the panel s majority in support of its decision are not based on accurate or sound law and their restrictive application is merely a masquerade for the court s desire to avoid a difficult decision For example in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v Casey chief justice of the United States William Rehnquist wrote that Roe v Wade stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin Village which may be pointed out to passers by as a monument to the importance of adhering to precedent Similarly Judge William G Young of the District of Massachusetts described the use of affidavits in U S litigation as the Potemkin Village of today s litigation landscape because adjudication by affidavit is like walking down a street between two movie sets all lawyer painted fa ade and no interior architecture br br br
