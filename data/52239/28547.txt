id: 28547
The Sokal affair also called the Sokal hoax was a demonstrative scholarly hoax performed by Alan Sokal a physics professor at New York University and University College London In Sokal submitted an article to Social Text an academic journal of cultural studies The submission was an experiment to test the journal s intellectual rigor specifically to investigate whether a leading North American journal of cultural studies whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross would publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if a it sounded good and b it flattered the editors ideological preconceptions br The article Transgressing the Boundaries Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity was published in the journal s spring summer Science Wars issue It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct The journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist Three weeks after its publication in May Sokal revealed in the magazine Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax br The hoax caused controversy about the scholarly merit of commentary on the physical sciences by those in the humanities the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general and academic ethics including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors or readers of Social Text and whether Social Text had abided by proper scientific ethics br In Sokal published Beyond the Hoax which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications br br br Background br br In an interview on the U S radio program All Things Considered Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading Higher Superstition in which authors Paul R Gross and Norman Levitt claim that some humanities journals will publish anything as long as it has the proper leftist thought and quoted or was written by well known leftist thinkers br Gross and Levitt had been defenders of the philosophy of scientific realism opposing postmodernist academics who questioned scientific objectivity They asserted that anti intellectual sentiment in liberal arts departments especially English departments caused the increase of deconstructionist thought which eventually resulted in a deconstructionist critique of science They saw the critique as a repertoire of rationalizations for avoiding the study of science br br br Article br Sokal reasoned that if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it What would matter would be ideological obsequiousness fawning references to deconstructionist writers and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon After the article was published and the hoax revealed he wrote br br The results of my little experiment demonstrate at the very least that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy The editors of Social Text liked my article because they liked its conclusion that the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project sec They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence the cogency of the arguments or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion br br br Content of the article br Transgressing the Boundaries Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity proposed that quantum gravity has progressive political implications and that the morphogenetic field could be a valid theory of quantum gravity A morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by Rupert Sheldrake in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair s aftermath as a bizarre New Age idea Sokal wrote that the concept of an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being was dogma imposed by the long post Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook br After referring skeptically to the so called scientific method the article declared that it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical reality is fundamentally a social and linguistic construct It went on to state that because scientific research is inherently theory laden and self referential it cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities and that therefore a liberatory science and an emancipatory mathematics spurning the elite caste canon of high science needed to be established for a postmodern science that provide s powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project br Moreover the article s footnotes conflate academic terms with sociopolitical rhetoric e g br br Just as liberal feminists are frequently content with a minimal agenda of legal and social equality for women and pro choice so liberal and even some socialist mathematicians are often content to work within the hegemonic Zermelo Fraenkel framework which reflecting its nineteenth century liberal origins already incorporates the axiom of equality supplemented only by the axiom of choice br br br Publication br Sokal submitted the article to Social Text whose editors were collecting articles for the Science Wars issue Transgressing the Boundaries was notable as an article by a natural scientist biologist Ruth Hubbard also had an article in the issue Later after Sokal revealed the hoax in Lingua Franca Social Text s editors wrote that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make and had had concerns about the quality of the writing We requested him a to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and b to excise most of his footnotes Still despite calling Sokal a difficult uncooperative author and noting that such writers were well known to journal editors based on Sokal s credentials Social Text published the article in the May Spring Summer Science Wars issue The editors did not seek peer review of the article by physicists or otherwise they later defended this decision on the basis that Social Text was a journal of open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to physics br br br Responses br br br Follow up between Sokal and the editors br In the May issue of Lingua Franca in the article A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies Sokal revealed that Transgressing the Boundaries was a hoax and concluded that Social Text felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias br In their defense Social Text s editors said they believed that Sokal s essay was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field and that its status as parody does not alter substantially our interest in the piece itself as a symptomatic document Besides criticizing his writing style Social Text s editors accused Sokal of behaving unethically in deceiving them br Sokal said the editors response demonstrated the problem that he sought to identify Social Text as an academic journal published the article not because it was faithful true and accurate to its subject but because an academic authority had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation Sokal remarked br br My goal isn t to defend science from the barbarian hordes of lit crit we ll survive just fine thank you but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology Sociology of science at its best has done much to clarify these issues But sloppy sociology like sloppy science is useless or even counterproductive br Social Text s response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal s piece was a parody Instead they speculated Sokal s admission represented a change of heart or a folding of his intellectual resolve Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article s absurdity was hard to spot br br In the second paragraph I declare without the slightest evidence or argument that physical reality note the scare quotes is at bottom a social and linguistic construct Not our theories of physical reality mind you but the reality itself Fair enough Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment I live on the twenty first floor br br br Book by Sokal and Bricmont br br In Sokal and Jean Bricmont co wrote Impostures intellectuelles US Fashionable Nonsense Postmodern Intellectuals Abuse of Science UK Intellectual Impostures The book featured analysis of extracts from established intellectuals writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology It closed with a critical summary of postmodernism and criticism of the strong programme of social constructionism in the sociology of scientific knowledge br In Sokal published a followup book Beyond the Hoax which revisited the history of the hoax and discussed its lasting implications br br br Jacques Derrida br The French philosopher Jacques Derrida whose statement about Einstein s theory of relativity was quoted in Sokal s paper was singled out for criticism particularly in U S newspaper coverage of the hoax One weekly magazine used two images of him a photo and a caricature to illustrate a dossier on Sokal s paper Arkady Plotnitsky commented Even given Derrida s status as an icon of intellectual controversy on the Anglo American cultural scene it is remarkable that out of thousands of pages of Derrida s published works a single extemporaneous remark on relativity made in before Derrida was the Derrida and in a certain sense even before deconstruction is made to stand for nearly all of deconstructive or even postmodernist not a term easily if at all applicable to Derrida treatments of science Derrida later responded to the hoax in Sokal et Bricmont ne sont pas s rieux Sokal and Bricmont Aren t Serious first published on November in Le Monde He called Sokal s action sad for having trivialized Sokal s mathematical work and ruining the chance to carefully examine controversies about scientific objectivity Derrida then faulted him and Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith in their follow up book Impostures intellectuelles they had published two articles almost simultaneously one in English in The Times Literary Supplement on October and one in French in Lib ration on October but while the two articles were almost identical they differed in how they treated Derrida br The English language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal s and Bricmont s book Such well known thinkers as Althusser Barthes and Foucault who as readers of the TLS will be well aware have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel appear in our book only in a minor role as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize The French language list however included Derrida Des penseurs c l bres tels qu Althusser Barthes Derrida et Foucault sont essentiellement absents de notre livre Famous thinkers such as Althusser Barthes Derrida and Foucault are essentially absent from our book br According to Brian Reilly Derrida may also have been sensitive to another difference between the French and English versions of Impostures intellectuelles In the French his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an isolated instance of abuse whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida s work contained no systematic misuse or indeed attention to science Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was banal Nevertheless Derrida concluded that Sokal was not serious in his method but had used the spectacle of a quick practical joke to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved br br br Criticism of social sciences br Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner chairman of Cornell University s science and technology studies department wrote The Sokal Affair in Context comparing Sokal s hoax to Confirmational Response Bias Among Social Work Journals an article by William M Epstein published in Science Technology Human Values Epstein used a similar method to Sokal s submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response Though much more systematic than Sokal s work it received scant media attention Hilgartner argued that the asymmetric effect of the successful Sokal hoax compared with Epstein s experiment cannot be attributed to its quality but that t hrough a mechanism that resembles confirmatory bias audiences may apply less stringent standards of evidence and ethics to attacks on targets that they are predisposed to regard unfavorably As a result according to Hilgartner though competent in terms of method Epstein s experiment was largely muted by the more socially accepted social work discipline he critiqued while Sokal s attack on cultural studies despite lacking experimental rigor was accepted Hilgartner also argued that Sokal s hoax reinforced the views of well known pundits such as George Will and Rush Limbaugh so that his opinions were amplified by media outlets predisposed to agree with his argument br The Sokal Affair extended from academia to the public press Anthropologist Bruno Latour who was criticized in Fashionable Nonsense described the scandal as a tempest in a teacup Retired Northeastern University mathematician turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays criticizing the statements of Sokal and his allies arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized rendering their criticism meaningless In Social Studies of Science Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg denouncing his representations of their work and criticizing his commentary about the strong programme of the sociology of science Stolzenberg replied in the same issue that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments of each party bearing in mind that the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true br br br Influence br br br Sociological follow up study br In Cornell sociologist Robb Willer performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal s paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic He found that students who believed the paper s author was a high status intellectual rated it better in quality and intelligibility br br br Sokal III br In October the scholarly journal Higher Education Quarterly published a bogus article authored by Sage Owens and Kal Avers Lynde III The initials stand for Sokal III The Quarterly retracted the article br br br See also br br
