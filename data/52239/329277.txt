id: 329277
Cherry picking suppressing evidence or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position while ignoring a significant portion of related and similar cases or data that may contradict that position Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally br The term is based on the perceived process of harvesting fruit such as cherries The picker would be expected to select only the ripest and healthiest fruits An observer who sees only the selected fruit may thus wrongly conclude that most or even all of the tree s fruit is in a likewise good condition This can also give a false impression of the quality of the fruit since it is only a sample and is not a representative sample A concept sometimes confused with cherry picking is the idea of gathering only the fruit that is easy to harvest while ignoring other fruit that is higher up on the tree and thus more difficult to obtain see low hanging fruit br Cherry picking has a negative connotation as the practice neglects overlooks or directly suppresses evidence that could lead to a complete picture br Cherry picking can be found in many logical fallacies For example the fallacy of anecdotal evidence tends to overlook large amounts of data in favor of that known personally selective use of evidence rejects material unfavorable to an argument while a false dichotomy picks only two options when more are available Some scholars classify cherry picking as a fallacy of selective attention the most common example of which is the confirmation bias Cherry picking can refer to the selection of data or data sets so a study or survey will give desired predictable results which may be misleading or even completely contrary to reality br br br History br A story about the th century BCE atheist philosopher Diagoras of Melos says how when shown the votive gifts of people who had supposedly escaped death by shipwreck by praying to gods he pointed out that many people had died at sea in spite of their prayers yet these cases were not likewise commemorated this is an example of survivorship bias Michel de Montaigne in his essay on prophecies comments on people willing to believe in the validity of supposed seers br br I see some who are mightily given to study and comment upon their almanacs and produce them to us as an authority when anything has fallen out pat and for that matter it is hardly possible but that these alleged authorities sometimes stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lies I think never the better of them for some such accidental hit N obody records their flimflams and false prognostics forasmuch as they are infinite and common but if they chop upon one truth that carries a mighty report as being rare incredible and prodigious br br br In science br Cherry picking is one of the epistemological characteristics of denialism and widely used by different science denialists to seemingly contradict scientific findings For example it is used in climate change denial evolution denial by creationists denial of the negative health effects of consuming tobacco products and passive smoking br br Choosing to make selective choices among competing evidence so as to emphasize those results that support a given position while ignoring or dismissing any findings that do not support it is a practice known as cherry picking and is a hallmark of poor science or pseudo science br br Rigorous science looks at all the evidence rather than cherry picking only favorable evidence controls for variables as to identify what is actually working uses blinded observations so as to minimize the effects of bias and uses internally consistent logic br br br br In medicine br In a study a review of previous medical data found cherry picking in tests of anti depression medication br br researchers reviewed antidepressant efficacy trials to identify the primary exclusion criteria used in determining eligibility for participation Their findings suggest that patients in current antidepressant trials represent only a minority of patients treated in routine clinical practice for depression Excluding potential clinical trial subjects with certain profiles means that the ability to generalize the results of antidepressant efficacy trials lacks empirical support according to the authors br br br In argumentation br In argumentation the practice of quote mining is a form of cherry picking in which the debater selectively picks some quotes supporting a position or exaggerating an opposing position while ignoring those that moderate the original quote or put it into a different context Cherry picking in debates is a large problem as the facts themselves are true but need to be put in context Because research cannot be done live and is often untimely cherry picked facts or quotes usually stick in the public mainstream and even when corrected lead to widespread misrepresentation of groups targeted br br br One sided argument br A one sided argument also known as card stacking stacking the deck ignoring the counterevidence slanting and suppressed evidence is an informal fallacy that occurs when only the reasons supporting a proposition are supplied while all reasons opposing it are omitted br br Philosophy professor Peter Suber has written The one sidedness fallacy does not make an argument invalid It may not even make the argument unsound The fallacy consists in persuading readers and perhaps ourselves that we have said enough to tilt the scale of evidence and therefore enough to justify a judgment If we have been one sided though then we haven t yet said enough to justify a judgment The arguments on the other side may be stronger than our own We won t know until we examine them So the one sidedness fallacy doesn t mean that your premises are false or irrelevant only that they are incomplete br With rational messages you need to decide if you want to use a one sided argument or a two sided argument A one sided argument presents only the pro side of the argument while a two sided argument presents both sides Which one you use will depend on which one meets your needs and the type of audience Generally one sided arguments are better with audiences already favorable to your message Two sided arguments are best with audiences who are opposed to your argument are better educated or have already been exposed to counter arguments br Card stacking is a propaganda technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another Such emphasis may be achieved through media bias or the use of one sided testimonials or by simply censoring the voices of critics The technique is commonly used in persuasive speeches by political candidates to discredit their opponents and to make themselves seem more worthy br The term originates from the magician s gimmick of stacking the deck which involves presenting a deck of cards that appears to have been randomly shuffled but which is in fact stacked in a specific order The magician knows the order and is able to control the outcome of the trick In poker cards can be stacked so that certain hands are dealt to certain players br The phenomenon can be applied to any subject and has wide applications Whenever a broad spectrum of information exists appearances can be rigged by highlighting some facts and ignoring others Card stacking can be a tool of advocacy groups or of those groups with specific agendas For example an enlistment poster might focus upon an impressive picture with words such as travel and adventure while placing the words enlist for two to four years at the bottom in a smaller and less noticeable point size br br br See also br br br
