title: Fallacy
id: 53986
A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning in the construction of an argument that may appear to be well reasoned if unnoticed The term was introduced in the Western intellectual tradition by the Aristotelian De Sophisticis Elenchis br Fallacies may be committed intentionally to manipulate or persuade by deception unintentionally because of human limitations such as carelessness cognitive or social biases and ignorance or potentially due to the limitations of language and understanding of language These delineations include not only the ignorance of the right reasoning standard but also the ignorance of relevant properties of the context For instance the soundness of legal arguments depends on the context in which they are made br Fallacies are commonly divided into formal and informal A formal fallacy is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid while an informal fallacy originates in an error in reasoning other than an improper logical form Arguments containing informal fallacies may be formally valid but still fallacious br A special case is a mathematical fallacy an intentionally invalid mathematical proof with a concealed or subtle error Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes usually taking the form of false proofs of obvious contradictions br br br Overview br Fallacies are types of erroneous reasoning that render arguments logically unsound According to The New Handbook of Cognitive Therapy Techniques they include unsubstantiated assertions that are often delivered with a conviction that makes them sound as though they are proven facts Informal fallacies in particular are frequently found in mass media such as television and newspapers Understanding fallacies may allow one to recognize them in either one s own or others writing Avoiding fallacies may help improve one s ability to produce sound arguments br It can be difficult to evaluate whether an argument is fallacious as arguments exist along a continuum of soundness and an argument that has several stages or parts might have some sound sections and some fallacious ones Moreover whether a specific argument is fallacious often depends on the content rather than the form of the argument An example is a probabilistically valid instance of the formally invalid argument form of denying the antecedent or affirming the consequent Thus fallacious arguments usually have the deceptive appearance of being good arguments because for most fallacious instances of an argument form a similar but non fallacious instance can be found Evaluating an instance of an argument as fallacious is therefore often a matter of evaluating the context of the argument br Recognizing fallacies in everyday arguments may be difficult since arguments are often embedded in rhetorical patterns that obscure the logical connections between statements Informal fallacies may also exploit the emotional intellectual or psychological weaknesses of the audience Recognizing fallacies can develop reasoning skills to expose the weaker links between premises and conclusions to better discern between what appears to be true and what is true br Argumentation theory provides a different approach to understanding and classifying fallacies In the pragma dialectical theory for instance an argument is regarded as an interactive protocol between individuals who attempt to resolve their disagreement on the merits of a case The protocol consists of normative rules of interaction and violations of these rules are considered fallacies because they frustrate the attempt at resolving the disagreement br Fallacies are used in place of valid reasoning to communicate a point with the intention to persuade Examples in the mass media today include but are not limited to propaganda advertisements politics newspaper editorials and opinion based news shows br br br Systems of classification br Fallacies are generally classified strictly by either their structure or their content such as by classifying them as formal fallacies or informal fallacies respectively The classification of informal fallacies may be subdivided into categories such as linguistic relevance through omission relevance through intrusion and relevance through presumption Alternatively fallacies may be classified by the process by which they occur such as material fallacies content verbal fallacies linguistic and formal fallacies error in inference In turn material fallacies may be placed into the more general category of informal fallacies Verbal fallacies may be placed in either formal or informal classifications Compare equivocation which is a word or phrase based ambiguity to the fallacy of composition which is premise and inference based ambiguity br br br Greek logic br The Greek philosopher Aristotle BC was the first to systematize logical errors into a list to make it easier to refute an opponent s thesis and thus win an argument Aristotle s Sophistical Refutations De Sophisticis Elenchis identifies thirteen fallacies He divided them up into two major types linguistic fallacies and non linguistic fallacies some of which depend on language and others that do not These fallacies are called verbal fallacies and material fallacies respectively A material fallacy is an error in what the arguer is talking about while a verbal fallacy is an error in how the arguer is talking Verbal fallacies are those in which a conclusion is obtained by improper or ambiguous use of words br An example of a language dependent fallacy is given as a debate as to who in humanity are learners the wise or the ignorant A language independent fallacy is for example br br Coriscus is different from Socrates br Socrates is a man br Therefore Coriscus is different from a man br br br Indian logic br Indian logicians took great pains to identify fallacies in arguments An influential collection of texts on logic and reason the Ny ya S tras attributed to Aksapada Gautama variously estimated to have been composed between the th century BCE and the nd century CE lists in its theory of inference five such reasons used in an argument that was further developed by later logicians br br Asiddha It is the unproved reason that results in this fallacy Paksadharmata br Savyabhichara This is the fallacy of irregular reason br Satpratipaksa Here the reason is contradicted by another reason If both have equal force then nothing follows Sound is eternal because it is audible and Sound is non eternal because it is produced Here audible is counterbalanced by produced and both are of equal force br Badhita When another proof as by perception definitely contradicts and disproves the middle term reason Fire is cold because it is a substance br Viruddha Instead of proving something it is proving the opposite Sound is eternal because it is produced br br br Whately s grouping br English scholar and theologian Richard Whately defines a fallacy broadly as any argument or apparent argument which professes to be decisive of the matter at hand while in reality it is not br Whately divided fallacies into two groups logical and material According to Whately logical fallacies are arguments where the conclusion does not follow from the premises Material fallacies are not logical errors because the conclusion follows from the premises He then divided the logical group into two groups purely logical and semi logical The semi logical group included all of Aristotle s sophisms except ignoratio elenchi petitio principii and non causa pro causa which are in the material group br br br Other systems of classification br Other famous methods of classifying fallacies are those of Francis Bacon and J S Mill Bacon Novum Organum Aph sqq divided fallacies into four Idola Idols i e False Appearances which summarize the various kinds of mistakes to which the human intellect is prone J S Mill discussed the subject in book five of his Logic and Jeremy Bentham s Book of Fallacies contains valuable remarks br br br Formal fallacy br br A formal fallacy deductive fallacy logical fallacy or non sequitur Latin for it does not follow is a flaw in the structure of a deductive argument that renders the argument invalid The flaw can be expressed in the standard system of logic Such an argument is always considered to be wrong br The presence of the formal fallacy does not imply anything about the argument s premises or its conclusion Both may actually be true or may even be more probable as a result of the argument but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described br Even non deductive arguments can be said to be fallacious for example an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality But since deductive arguments depend on formal properties and inductive arguments don t formal fallacies apply only to deductive arguments br A logical form such as A and B is independent of any particular conjunction of meaningful propositions Logical form alone can guarantee that given true premises a true conclusion must follow However formal logic makes no such guarantee if any premise is false the conclusion can be either true or false Any formal error or logical fallacy similarly invalidates the deductive guarantee Both the argument and all its premises must be true for a conclusion to be true br The term logical fallacy is in a sense self contradictory because logic refers to valid reasoning whereas a fallacy is the use of poor reasoning Therefore the term formal fallacy is preferred In informal discourse however logical fallacy is used to mean an argument that is problematic for any reason br The term non sequitur denotes a general formal fallacy often meaning one that does not belong to any named subclass of formal fallacies like affirming the consequent br br br Common examples br br br Ecological fallacy br An ecological fallacy is committed when one draws an inference from data based on the premise that qualities observed for groups necessarily hold for individuals for example if countries with more Protestants tend to have higher suicide rates then Protestants must be more likely to commit suicide br br br Fallacy fork br Maarten Boudry and others have argued that formal deductive fallacies rarely occur in real life and that arguments that would be fallacious in formally deductive terms are not necessarily so when context and prior probabilities are taken into account thus making the argument defeasible and or inductive Boudry coined the term fallacy fork For a given fallacy one must either characterize it by means of a deductive argumentation scheme which rarely applies the first prong of the fork or one must relax definitions and add nuance to take the actual intent and context of the argument into account the other prong of the fork To argue for example that one became nauseated after eating a mushroom because the mushroom was poisonous could be an example of the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy br br br Informal fallacy br br In contrast to a formal fallacy an informal fallacy originates from a reasoning error other than a flaw in the logical form of the argument A deductive argument containing an informal fallacy may be formally valid but still remain rationally unpersuasive Nevertheless informal fallacies apply to both deductive and non deductive arguments br Though the form of the argument may be relevant fallacies of this type are types of mistakes in reasoning that arise from the mishandling of the content of the propositions constituting the argument br br br Faulty generalization br A special subclass of the informal fallacies is the set of faulty generalizations also known as inductive fallacies Here the most important issue concerns inductive strength or methodology for example statistical inference In the absence of sufficient evidence drawing conclusions based on induction is unwarranted and fallacious With the backing of sufficient amounts of the right type of empirical evidence however the conclusions may become warranted and convincing at which point the arguments are no longer considered fallacious br br br Hasty generalization br Hasty generalization is described as making assumptions about a whole group or range of cases based on a sample that is inadequate usually because it is atypical or just too small br Stereotypes about people frat boys are drunkards grad students are nerdy women don t enjoy sports etc are common examples of the principle br Hasty generalization often follows a pattern such as br br X is true for A br X is true for B br Therefore X is true for C D etc br While never a valid logical deduction if such an inference can be made on statistical grounds it may nonetheless be convincing This is because with enough empirical evidence the generalization is no longer a hasty one br br br Relevance fallacy br The fallacies of relevance are a broad class of informal fallacies generically represented by missing the point presenting an argument that may be sound but fails to address the issue in question br br br Argument from silence br An argument from silence is a faulty conclusion that is drawn based on the absence of evidence rather than on the presence of evidence br br br Examples of informal fallacies br br br Post hoc false cause br The post hoc fallacy assumes that because B comes after A A caused B It gets its name from the Latin phrase post hoc ergo propter hoc which translates as after this therefore because of this br Sometimes one event really does cause another one that comes later for example if one registers for a class and their name later appears on the roll it s true that the first event caused the one that came later But sometimes two events that seem related in time are not really related as cause and event That is temporal correlation does not necessarily entail causation For example if one eats a sandwich and then gets food poisoning that does not necessarily mean the sandwich caused the food poisoning Something else eaten earlier might have caused the food poisoning br br br Slippery slope br For an argument to be a slippery slope type of argument it must meet the requirements of that argumentation scheme A slippery slope argument originates from a conversation or debate in which two actors take turns It usually originates from one actor giving advice on a decision or act Along the way the actor must make additional choices on similar matters through which the actor enters the grey area of the slippery slope At this point the actor potentially loses control over the direction of the arguments thus leading to a fatal outcome br Such an argument is built up according to the following argumentation scheme initial premise sequential premise indeterminacy premise control premise loss of control premise catastrophic outcome premise and conclusion Slippery slope arguments may be defeated by asking critical questions or giving counterarguments br There are several reasons for a slippery slope to be fallacious for example the argument is going too far into the future it is a too complex argument whose structure is hard to identify or the argument makes emotional appeals br It may be that a slippery slope is not necessarily fallacious if context is taken into account and there is an effort to assess plausibility br br br False analogy br Informally known as the apples and oranges fallacy a false analogy uses unsound comparisons br br br Straw man fallacy br The straw man fallacy refers to the refutation of a standpoint in an argument that was never proposed The fallacy usually occurs in the presentation of an opponent s standpoint as more extreme distorted or simplistic than it actually is Compared to criticizing the opponent s actual standpoint this allows the arguer to offer a seeming refutation of what is however not the actual standpoint Such an argument involves two arguers with one criticizing the other s perspective The reason for the straw man argument to be fallacious originates from the problem of how to deal with natural discourse The opponent s argument is not reflected by the arguments that are proposed by the speaker br br br Measurement fallacy br Some of the fallacies described above may be committed in the context of measurement br Where mathematical fallacies are subtle mistakes in reasoning leading to invalid mathematical proofs measurement fallacies are unwarranted inferential leaps involved in the extrapolation of raw data to a measurement based value claim The ancient Greek Sophist Protagoras was one of the first thinkers to propose that humans can generate reliable measurements through his human measure principle and the practice of dissoi logoi arguing multiple sides of an issue This history helps explain why measurement fallacies are informed by informal logic and argumentation theory br br br Knowledge value measurement fallacy br The increasing availability and circulation of big data are driving a proliferation of new metrics for scholarly authority and there is lively discussion regarding the relative usefulness of such metrics for measuring the value of knowledge production in the context of an information tsunami br For example anchoring fallacies can occur when unwarranted weight is given to data generated by metrics that the arguers themselves acknowledge are flawed For example the limitations of the journal impact factor JIF are well documented and even JIF pioneer Eugene Garfield notes that while citation data create new tools for analyses of research performance it should be stressed that they supplement rather than replace other quantitative and qualitative indicators To the extent that arguers jettison the acknowledged limitations of JIF generated data in evaluative judgments or leave behind Garfield s supplement rather than replace caveat they commit anchoring fallacies br A naturalistic fallacy can occur for example in the case of sheer quantity metrics based on the premise more is better or in the case of developmental assessment in the field of psychology higher is better br A false analogy occurs when claims are supported by unsound comparisons between data points For example the Scopus and Web of Science bibliographic databases have difficulty distinguishing between citations of scholarly work that are arms length endorsements ceremonial citations or negative citations indicating the citing author withholds endorsement of the cited work Hence measurement based value claims premised on the uniform quality of all citations may be questioned on false analogy grounds br As another example consider the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index of Academic Analytics This tool purports to measure overall faculty productivity yet it does not capture data based on citations in books This creates a possibility that low productivity measurements using the tool commit argument from silence fallacies to the extent that such measurements are supported by the absence of book citation data br Ecological fallacies can be committed when one measures the scholarly productivity of a sub group of individuals e g Puerto Rican faculty via reference to aggregate data about a larger and different group e g Hispanic faculty br br br Intentional fallacy br Sometimes a speaker or writer uses a fallacy intentionally In any context including academic debate a conversation among friends political discourse advertising or comedic purposes the arguer may use fallacious reasoning to try to persuade the listener or reader by means other than offering relevant evidence that the conclusion is true br Examples of this include the speaker or writer br br Diverting the argument to unrelated issues with a red herring Ignoratio elenchi br Insulting someone s character argumentum ad hominem br Assuming the conclusion of an argument a kind of circular reasoning also called begging the question petitio principii br Making jumps in logic non sequitur br Identifying a false cause and effect post hoc ergo propter hoc br Asserting that everyone agrees argumentum ad populum bandwagoning br Creating a false dilemma either or fallacy in which the situation is oversimplified also called false dichotomy br Selectively using facts card stacking br Making false or misleading comparisons false equivalence or false analogy br Generalizing quickly and sloppily hasty generalization secundum quid br Using an argument s connections to other concepts or people to support or refute it also called guilt by association association fallacy br Claiming that a lack of proof counts as proof appeal to ignorance br In humor errors of reasoning are used for comical purposes Groucho Marx used fallacies of amphiboly for instance to make ironic statements Gary Larson and Scott Adams employed fallacious reasoning in many of their cartoons Wes Boyer and Samuel Stoddard have written a humorous essay teaching students how to be persuasive by means of a whole host of informal and formal fallacies br When someone uses logical fallacies intentionally to mislead in academic political or other high stakes contexts the breach of trust calls into question the authority and intellectual integrity of that person br br br Assessment pragmatic theory br br According to the pragmatic theory a fallacy can be either a heuristic error or a ploy used intentionally to unfairly win an argument There are always two parties to an argument containing a fallacy the perpetrator and the intended victim br The dialogue framework required to support the pragmatic theory of fallacy is built on the presumption that argumentative dialogue has both an adversarial component and a collaborative component A dialogue has individual goals for each participant as well as shared goals that apply to all participants A fallacy of the second kind is seen as more than simply a violation of the rule of reasonable dialogue It is also a deceptive tactic of argumentation based on sleight of hand Aristotle explicitly compared contentious reasoning to unfair fighting in athletic contests But the roots of the pragmatic theory go back even further in history to the Sophists The pragmatic theory finds its roots in the Aristotelian conception of a fallacy as a sophistical refutation but also supports the view that many of the types of arguments traditionally labeled as fallacies are in fact reasonable techniques of argumentation that can be used in many cases to support legitimate goals of dialogue Hence under the pragmatic approach each case needs to be analyzed individually to determine whether the argument is fallacious or reasonable br br br See
