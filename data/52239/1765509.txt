Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds is an early study of crowd psychology by Scottish journalist Charles Mackay first published in under the title Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions The book was published in three volumes National Delusions Peculiar Follies and Philosophical Delusions Mackay was an accomplished teller of stories though he wrote in a journalistic and somewhat sensational style br The subjects of Mackay s debunking include alchemy crusades duels economic bubbles fortune telling haunted houses the Drummer of Tedworth the influence of politics and religion on the shapes of beards and hair magnetisers influence of imagination in curing disease murder through poisoning prophecies popular admiration of great thieves popular follies of great cities and relics Present day writers on economics such as Michael Lewis and Andrew Tobias laud the three chapters on economic bubbles br In later editions Mackay added a footnote referencing the Railway Mania of the s as another popular delusion which was at least as important as the South Sea Bubble In the st century the mathematician Andrew Odlyzko pointed out in a published lecture that Mackay himself played a role in this economic bubble as a leader writer in The Glasgow Argus Mackay wrote on October There is no reason whatever to fear a crash br br br Volume I National Delusions br br br Economic bubbles br The first volume begins with a discussion of three economic bubbles or financial manias the South Sea Company bubble of the Mississippi Company bubble of and the Dutch tulip mania of the early seventeenth century According to Mackay during this bubble speculators from all walks of life bought and sold tulip bulbs and had even declared futures contracts on them Allegedly some tulip bulb varieties briefly became the most expensive objects in the world during Mackay s accounts are enlivened by colorful comedic anecdotes such as the Parisian hunchback who supposedly profited by renting out his hump as a writing desk during the height of the mania surrounding the Mississippi Company br Two modern researchers Peter Garber and Anne Goldgar independently conclude that Mackay greatly exaggerated the scale and effects of the Tulip bubble and Mike Dash in his modern popular history of the alleged bubble notes that he believes the importance and extent of the tulip mania were overstated br br br Chapters br The Mississippi Scheme br The South Sea Bubble br The Tulip Mania br Relics br Modern Prophecies br Popular Admiration for Great Thieves cf

the pilgrimages of Europeans to the Holy Land Mackay is generally unsympathetic to the Crusaders whom he compares unfavourably to the superior civilisation of Asia Europe expended millions of her treasures and the blood of two millions of her children and a handful of quarrelsome knights retained possession of the Kingdom of Jerusalem for about one hundred years br br br Witch mania br br Witch trials in th and th century Western Europe are the primary focus of the Witch Mania section of the book which asserts that this was a time when ill fortune was likely to be attributed to supernatural causes Mackay notes that many of these cases were initiated as a way of settling scores among neighbors or associates and that extremely low standards of evidence were applied to most of these trials Mackay claims that thousands upon thousands of people were executed as witches over two and a half centuries with the largest numbers killed in Germany br br br Sections br The Crusades

metals into gold Mackay notes that many of these practitioners were themselves deluded convinced that these feats could be performed if they discovered the correct old recipe or stumbled upon the right combination of ingredients Although alchemists gained money from their sponsors mainly noblemen he notes that the belief in alchemy by sponsors could be hazardous to its practitioners as it wasn t rare for an unscrupulous noble to imprison a supposed alchemist until he could produce gold br br br Books br Book I The Alchemysts br Book II Fortune Telling br Book III The Magnetisers br br br
