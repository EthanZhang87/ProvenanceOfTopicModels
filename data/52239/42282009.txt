title: HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa
id: 42282009
In South Africa HIV AIDS denialism had a significant impact on public health policy from to during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki Mbeki criticized the scientific consensus that HIV is the cause of AIDS beginning shortly after his election to the presidency In he organized a Presidential Advisory Panel regarding HIV AIDS including several scientists who denied that HIV caused AIDS br In the following eight years of his presidency Mbeki continued to express sympathy for HIV AIDS denialism and instituted policies denying antiretroviral drugs to AIDS patients The Mbeki government even withdrew support from clinics that started using AZT to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV He also restricted the use of a pharmaceutical company s donated supply of nevirapine a drug that helps keep newborns from contracting HIV br Instead of providing these drugs which he described as poisons shortly after he was elected to the presidency he appointed Manto Tshabalala Msimang as the country s health minister who promoted the use of unproven herbal remedies such as ubhejane garlic beetroot and lemon juice to treat AIDS which led to her acquiring the nickname Dr Beetroot These policies have been blamed for the preventable deaths of between and people from AIDS br Since Mbeki has been silent about his views and policies on AIDS according to The New York Times his spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga said Mr Mbeki would not discuss his thinking on HIV and AIDS explaining that policy decisions were made collectively by the cabinet and so questions should be addressed to the government Upon becoming president in Mbeki s successor Kgalema Motlanthe appointed Barbara Hogan as health minister to replace Tshabalala Msimang on the first day of his presidency Hogan told The New York Times The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa br br The reason Mbeki became so enamored with HIV AIDS denialism remains unclear but some have suggested that it was influenced by Christine Maggiore meeting with him in the s Another factor may have been when in Anthony Brink published an article entitled A Medicine from Hell which described AZT as dangerous and ineffective Brink would later claim that this article was responsible for Mbeki s policies banning the use of the drug Brink contacted Mbeki after the article was published and was welcomed as an expert Mbeki in a document of which he was the co author also cited John le Carr s novel The Constant Gardener as influencing his fear of pharmaceutical companies and their influence on scientific research Given that Mbeki explicitly accused supporters of the consensus position on HIV AIDS of racism it has also been proposed that his denialist views arose from a history of racist portrayals of black people in South Africa under the apartheid system br An article in Race Class by Joy Wang proposes that both of these factors influenced Mbeki s embrace of AIDS denialism and cites Frantz Fanon s essay Medicine and Colonialism to explain what Wang describes as the impasse between scientists and Mbeki s government Martin Asser has also proposed that Mbeki s views on AIDS may have been influenced by the high price of ARV therapy relative to the relatively small amount of money his country s citizens have at their disposal In Theodore F Sheckels of Randolph Macon College argued that Mbeki while discussing HIV AIDS as president of South Africa attempted to portray the West as the scapegoat in order to unite the country s black majority Barton Gellman has proposed an alternative explanation for Mbeki s views namely that he is a sort of restless roving intellect who likes to surf the Internet and is accustomed to being a dissident who allies himself against establishments After all he spent his whole adult life fighting apartheid He also noted that even if Mbeki followed every recommendation of the mainstream scientific community regarding AIDS he still wouldn t solve the problem so according to Gellman Mbeki is keeping the scientific uncertainties alive because he doesn t want to portray himself as helpless br br On May Nelson Mandela became President of South Africa remaining in that office until replaced by Thabo Mbeki five years later During his presidency which lasted from then until Mandela remained largely indifferent to HIV AIDS and did not speak out about the danger it posed to South Africa until the early s Mandela had reportedly expressed regret that he did not do more to combat AIDS during his presidency br br In early Mbeki who was then the Deputy President of South Africa approached the other members of the African National Congress to pitch the idea of using a new anti AIDS drug developed in South Africa called Virodene The advantages over existing ARV drugs which proved appealing to Mbeki included being times less expensive than antiretroviral triple therapy and the possibility of bypassing the Western medical establishment if it was proven to work This led to a group of AIDS patients who had been treated with Virodene being invited to testify before the Cabinet of South Africa Their testimonies included many statements that they had gained weight and seen boils on their faces vanish after they started being treated br However the fact remained that the makers of Virodene had previously been denied a license by the South African Medicines Control Council MCC The company argued that this happened because the South African AIDS establishment did not want any drugs other than ARVs to become available because the establishment was funded by Western drug firms Mbeki found this argument compelling The drug was then legalized and heavily and favorably promoted in the popular media until it became apparent that it posed a severe health hazard The MCC subsequently declared the drug unfit for human consumption br br On June Mbeki was elected President of South Africa br br On October the th Mbeki gave a speech to the National Council of Provinces in which he touched upon the issue of HIV AIDS and especially whether his government should distribute ARV drugs He argued that they shouldn t be so quick to do so because of their adverse effects and recommended that the members of the council read the information on the Internet on the topic br br On March it was reported that Mbeki had consulted biochemist David Rasnick and history professor Charles Geshekter both of whom are AIDS denialists for advice on HIV AIDS Awa Marie Coll Seck reacted to the news by saying At first we were thinking we would just ignore it but now we think this confusion can really undermine all the efforts people have made to prevent this disease br br On April Mbeki sent a five page letter to Bill Clinton in which he describes AIDS as a uniquely African catastrophe and compared the persecution of HIV AIDS denialists to the treatment of black people in South Africa during the apartheid era The letter was leaked to The Washington Post shortly afterward which provoked condemnation from many commentators and infuriated and embarrassed Mbeki The following day Jacob Zuma then South African deputy president compared those criticizing HIV AIDS denialists to critics of Galileo during the th century His views were considered to be so threatening to the scientific establishment that he was forced to publicly recant Zuma was quoted as saying in a statement released by the office of the presidency br br Later that year Mbeki convened a panel of scientists whom he referred to as experts of whom about half were AIDS denialists such as Peter Duesberg and Harvey Bialy The panel known as the Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS also included AIDS researchers who supported the scientific consensus that HIV causes AIDS and was split about evenly between the two groups Their first meeting was held from May to May Nicoli Nattrass has blamed Duesberg and his supporters on this panel as well as Mbeki for the popularity of AIDS denialism in South Africa br br The Presidential Advisory Panel on AIDS s second meeting took place on July and in Johannesburg Both meetings were closed to the general public and to nearly all journalists with the exception of Mark Schoofs of the Village Voice Schoofs reported that David Rasnick another AIDS denialist member of the panel had called for HIV testing to be completely banned and had argued he hadn t seen any evidence of an AIDS catastrophe The meeting also culminated in research proposals by both supporters and denialists of the HIV AIDS hypothesis South African health official Khotso Mokhele praised both proposals saying that once concluded one side of the HIV AIDS debate might shut up once and for all The AIDS denialists at the meeting recommended that the disease be treated not with antiretroviral drugs but rather with vitamins and alternative and complementary therapies including massage therapy music therapy yoga spiritual care homeopathy Indian ayurvedic medicine light therapy and many other methods On July the scientific community responded with the Durban Declaration signed by scientists and published in Nature The declaration stated among other things that HIV causes AIDS It is unfortunate that a few vocal people continue to deny the evidence This position will cost countless lives Nevertheless when the International AIDS Conference in Durban was held just three days later where Mbeki was scheduled to give the opening speech he openly rejected the mainstream view that HIV is the cause of AIDS and instead argued that it was caused by poverty bad nourishment and general ill health The solution was not Mbeki continued expensive western medicine but the alleviation of poverty in Africa He also invited Maggiore an outspoken AIDS denialist to give a talk at the conference and in one of his own speeches exhorted the other delegates at the conference to speak to one another honestly and frankly with sufficient tolerance to respect everybody s point of view with sufficient tolerance to allow all voices to be heard His speech met with largely negative reception from the delegates attending the conference hundreds of whom walked out br br In September Mbeki told the South African Parliament that The programme of the government in this country is based on this thesis that HIV causes Aids and everything in the programme says that However he later stated that he still did not think HIV caused AIDS and that it could in his view only be a contributing factor not a sole cause br br In mid October the South African government announced that Mbeki would be reducing his role in the HIV AIDS debate with Mbeki himself acknowledging he may have caused confusion by publicly challenging the mainstream view of the cause of AIDS Nevertheless his approval rating had already dropped from to percent in the previous year Many senior American politicians had expressed private doubts about his judgment though other South African politicians were even more outspoken in their criticism For example many South African trade and banking officials expressed concern that Mbeki s statements were driving away potential investors In a interview Mbeki told his biographer Mark Gevisser that he only did this because he was pressured to by his cabinet and he regrets his decision to do so br br In August Mbeki incorrectly claimed based on outdated statistics that HIV AIDS is only the th leading killer in South Africa when it was actually the leading killer He also asked health officials to reassess the budget accordingly and proposed that the new healthcare budget include a decreased emphasis on HIV AIDS br br The following October Mbeki gave two speeches in which he demonstrated that according to the New York Times he remains badly misinformed about HIV In the speeches he exaggerated the dangers of antiretroviral drugs ARVs downplayed the dangers of AIDS itself and suggested that his critics were racist The Economist reacted to his speech to Parliament in which he claimed that ARVs are becoming as dangerous to health as the thing they are supposed to treat by saying that this claim was simply wrong adding that ARVs not only prolong life but also make sufferers less infectious They also criticized the government s dismissal of its critics as stooges for international drug companies by arguing that government intransigence not the cost of drugs is the real problem br br On September Mbeki s spokesman confirmed that Mbeki had in fact stated that he didn t know anyone with AIDS This remark provoked considerable criticism from AIDS activists and opposition politicians with Xolani Kunene of Treatment Action Campaign remarking that Mbeki was not living in the real South Africa br br Mbeki was asked by the South African Parliament if he thought rape played any role in spreading AIDS to which he replied that The disease of racism led to blacks being portrayed as lazy liars foul smelling diseased corrupt violent amoral sexually depraved animalistic savage and rapist In an opinion piece written four years later Roger Cohen cited this remark as evidence that Mbeki considered HIV AIDS to be a fabrication foisted on Africans by whites determined to distract the continent from real problems of racism and poverty and accepted by blacks afflicted with the slave mentality engendered by apartheid br br The ARVs that had been approved by the government of South Africa five months earlier first began reaching hospitals in April Some AIDS activists considered this timing suspicious as it was two weeks before the national elections were to take place that year br br Matthias Rath traveled to South Africa to sell his vitamins which he claimed were effective at curing AIDS He soon began organizing clinical trials of the efficacy of these vitamins which led to the Treatment Action Campaign suing him later that year Nevertheless Tshabalala Msimang stood by Rath and even appeared at a forum in April to defend Rath s right to free speech and claim that his drugs had equal validity to ARVs Only after a long running legal battle with the Medicines Control Council were these trials finally declared illegal AIDS activists have linked Rath s distribution of these vitamins to the deaths of some HIV AIDS patients br br On October South Africa s government announced that they were reversing their previous policies on treatment of HIV AIDS patients and would now be distributing ARV drugs through the country s public health services The announcement was made at a conference of AIDS activists whom the government had previously ignored These activists had been spending the previous few years in a legal battle with the country s government in an effort to get them to distribute ARV drugs br br In late Tshabalala Msimang fell ill after which the country s deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala Routledge assumed leadership over South Africa s health policies after being summoned to do so by deputy president Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka While she was at the helm of South Africa s health policies from then until she was fired next August she attempted to reverse Mbeki s AIDS denialist policies by describing the number of South Africans waiting for ARV drugs as a serious violation of human rights She was also one of the principal authors of the country s aggressively anti AIDS health plan which was adopted that December br br On August despite ongoing calls to fire Tshabalala Msimang Mbeki instead fired Madlala Routledge South Africa s then deputy health minister and a longtime critic of his AIDS policies The stated reason was that she had attended an AIDS conference without his permission but critics argued this was merely an excuse for Mbeki to rid himself of a politician who was willing to criticize his policies Given that few other South African officials were willing to criticize Mbeki s views on AIDS The Economist expressed concern that her absence would lead to a reversal of the superior AIDS policies she had helped implement br On August after Tshabalala Msimang came under attack for denying that HIV caused AIDS and promoting unorthodox treatments for the disease Mbeki leapt to her defense writing in ANC Today that she would go down in history as one of the pioneer architects of a South African public health system constructed to ensure that we achieve the objective of health for all our people and especially the poor He also referred to her as a hero and to her critics as wild animals br br On February research by Nicoli Nattrass estimated that the failure of Mbeki s administration to provide ARV drugs until was responsible for about deaths Later that year a study by Pride Chigwedere et al published in the December issue of the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes estimated that Mbeki s HIV AIDS policies were responsible for more than deaths br On September Kgalema Motlanthe succeeded Mbeki as president of South Africa On the first day of his presidency he removed Tshabalala Msimang from the office of health minister and replaced her with Barbara Hogan Hogan s views on AIDS reflected a dramatic shift from her predecessor s in December she promised to increase the supply of ARV drugs available to pregnant women in South Africa as well as to improve HIV prevention programs br br On July a paper co authored by Duesberg and several other denialists was published as an Epub ahead of print in the non peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses though it had originally been submitted to the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes The paper which was mainly a response to Chigwedere s study argued that official statistics showed that Chigwedere et al s estimates of deaths due to AIDS in South Africa about per year were wildly overestimated and that there was as yet no proof that HIV causes AIDS Eventually the journal received numerous expressions of concern about the paper including accusations of libel and concern about its potential adverse impact on public health and therefore retracted it that September This led to Elsevier the journal s publisher threatening to fire Bruce Charlton the journal s editor if he did not institute a peer review process for the journal Charlton refused and was therefore fired in May br br On October South Africa s president Jacob Zuma who had been elected president the previous May gave a speech which was seen by many as the end of AIDS denialism in South Africa In the speech Zuma acknowledged HIV AIDS as one of South Africa s most serious problems saying that all South Africans need to know their HIV status and be informed of the treatment options available to them br br During Mbeki s presidency many medical researchers harshly criticized his AIDS policies and predicted that these policies would lead to countless deaths Another critic of these policies was Harvard University s Robert Rotberg who in said of Mbeki s AIDS policies This is very foolish and uncharacteristic of him In Mbeki s AIDS policies faced even more criticism this time from Nelson Mandela who said in an interview that This AIDS is a war It has killed more people than has been the case in all previous wars and in all previous natural disasters We must not continue to be debating to be arguing when people are dying The Anglican Archbishop of Cape Town Njongonkulu Ndungane also criticized these policies saying that the government was sinning by withholding truth and maintaining the silence of denial over AIDS Desmond Tutu also spoke out against Mbeki s AIDS denialist policies and compared them to fiddling while Rome burns Ndungane along with Max Essex have argued that Mbeki s policies were worse than just bad judgment Ndungane even described these policies as a crime against humanity on the same scale as apartheid After Chigwedere et al s research estimating AIDS denialist policies in South Africa led to over deaths was published philosopher Peter Singer cited it in support of his conclusion that Mbeki like Mandela was active in the struggle against apartheid Yet the Harvard study shows that he is responsible for the deaths of times as many black South Africans as the white South African police who fired on the crowd at Sharpeville Singer also wrote that while Mbeki was not motivated by malice in deciding his AIDS policies that he was nevertheless culpable not for having initially entertained a view held by a tiny minority of scientists but for having clung to this view without allowing it to be tested in fair and open debate among experts Other critics such as Karl Kruszelnicki have noted that South Africa unlike many of its fellow sub Saharan African countries has both the medical personnel and wealth to meet the HIV AIDS challenge head on making it especially unfortunate that these resources were not used for so long br br In of South Africans believed there was a cure for AIDS Research presented by Nicoli Nattrass at a Harvard symposium on October concluded that denialist beliefs are held disproportionately by black African men and are far more likely to be held by those supportive of Mbeki s health minister Tshabalala Msimang
