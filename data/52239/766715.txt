can also be performed during ceremonial rituals or prayers In the world of magic wizards witches and fairies are common performers of incantations in culture and folklore br In medieval literature folklore fairy tales and modern fantasy fiction enchantments are charms or spells This has led to the terms enchanter and enchantress for those who use enchantments The English language borrowed the term incantation from Old French in the late th century the corresponding Old English term was gealdor or galdor song spell cognate to ON galdr The weakened sense delight compare the same development of charm is modern first attested in OED br Words of incantation are often spoken with inflection and emphasis on the words being said The tone and rhyme of how the words are spoken and the placement of words used in the formula may differ depending on the desired outcome of the magical effect br Surviving written records of historical magic spells were largely obliterated in many cultures by the success of the major monotheistic religions Islam Judaism and Christianity which label some magical activity as immoral or associated with evil br br The Latin incantare which means to consecrate with spells to charm to bewitch to ensorcel forms the basis of the word enchant with deep linguistic roots going back to the Proto Indo European kan prefix So it can be said that an enchanter or enchantress casts magic spells or utters incantations br The words that are similar to incantations such as enchantment charms and spells are the effects of reciting an incantation To be enchanted is to be under the influence of an enchantment usually thought to be caused by charms or spells br br Magic words or words of power are words which have a specific and sometimes unintended effect They are often nonsense phrases used in fantasy fiction or by stage prestidigitators Frequently such words are presented as being part of a divine adamic or other secret or empowered language Certain comic book heroes use magic words to activate their powers br Examples of traditional magic words include Abracadabra Alakazam Hocus Pocus Open Sesame and Sim Sala Bim br In Babylonian incantations can be used in rituals to burn images of one s own enemies An example would be found in the series of Mesopotamian incantations of urpu and Maql In the Orient the charming of snakes have been used in incantations of the past and still used today A person using an incantation would entice the snake out of its hiding place in order to get rid of them br br In Mesopotamian mythology Udug Hul incantations are used to exorcise demons evil Udug who bring misfortune or illnesses such as mental illness or anxiety These demons can create horrible events such as divorce loss of property or other catastrophes br br In traditional fairy tales magical formulas are sometimes attached to an object When the incantation is uttered it helps transform the object In such stories incantations are attached to a magic wand used by wizards witches and fairy godmothers One example is the spell that Cinderella s Fairy Godmother used to turn a pumpkin into a coach Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo a nonsense rhyme which echoes more serious historical incantations br br The performance of magic almost always involves the use of language Whether spoken out loud or unspoken words are frequently used to access or guide magical power In The Magical Power of Words S J Tambiah argues that the connection between language and magic is due to a belief in the inherent ability of words to influence the universe Bronis aw Malinowski in Coral Gardens and their Magic suggests that this belief is an extension of man s basic use of language to describe his surroundings in which the knowledge of the right words appropriate phrases and the more highly developed forms of speech gives man a power over and above his own limited field of personal action Magical speech is therefore a ritual act and is of equal or even greater importance to the performance of magic than non verbal acts br Not all speech is considered magical Only certain words and phrases or words spoken in a specific context are considered to have magical power Magical language according to C K Ogden and I A Richards s categories of speech is distinct from scientific language because it is emotive and it converts words into symbols for emotions whereas in scientific language words are tied to specific meanings and refer to an objective external reality Magical language is therefore particularly adept at constructing metaphors that establish symbols and link magical rituals to the world br Malinowski argues that the language of magic is sacred set and used for an entirely different purpose to that of ordinary life The two forms of language are differentiated through word choice grammar style or by the use of specific phrases or forms prayers spells songs blessings or chants for example Sacred modes of language often employ archaic words and forms in an attempt to invoke the purity or truth of a religious or a cultural golden age The use of Hebrew in Judaism is an example br Another potential source of the power of words is their secrecy and exclusivity Much sacred language is differentiated enough from common language that it is incomprehensible to the majority of the population and it can only be used and interpreted by specialized practitioners magicians priests shamans or Imams In this respect Tambiah argues that magical languages violate the primary function of language communication Yet adherents of magic are still able to use and to value the magical function of words by believing in the inherent power of the words themselves and in the meaning that they must provide for those who do understand them This leads Tambiah to conclude that the remarkable disjunction between sacred and profane language which exists as a general fact is not necessarily linked to the need to embody
