documented phenomenon linked to the return of Marcos immediate family and political allies to government positions as well as the hero s burial of Marcos himself in It continues Marcos own efforts to create a cult of personality for himself which in itself involved various forms of historical distortion br Some of the earlier examples of distortion involved various instances of historical denialism by the remaining Marcos family members and their followers which involved trivializing of the human rights violations and economic plunder that took place during the Marcos administration as well as the role played by the Marcos children in the administration br Into the s various studies have uncovered systematic disinformation campaigns run by top public relations firm executives

statements by politicians self aggrandizement narratives pompous declarations and political posturing and propaganda br During his campaign to become Vice President of the Philippines he also attempted to dismiss the events saying Filipinos should leave history to the professors prompting over faculty staff and history professors from Ateneo de Manila University to issue a statement condemning the act as part of an ongoing willful distortion of our history and a shameless refusal to acknowledge the crimes of the Martial Law regime br More than Catholic Schools through the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines CEAP later joined the call of the Ateneo faculty followed by the Department of History of the University of the Philippines Diliman which released a statement decrying what they called a dangerous effort for Marcos to create myth and deception br br br By Imee Marcos br Imee Marcos has also issued similar statements which include her statement that she was too young to have any power during her father s administration although she was already years old when her father was ousted in February and her assertion that critics should just move on regarding the crimes and excesses of the martial law era br br br By Marcos associates br On September Marcos Jr released a YouTube video depicting a t te t te between him and Juan Ponce Enrile in which Enrile made a number of claims denying the unlawful arrests and killings of critics during the Marcos administration These were quickly refuted and denounced by martial law victims including former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel Jr former Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo former Commission on Human Rights chair Etta Rosales and Palanca award winning writer Boni Ilagan among others It was also denounced by families and friends of Martial Law victims such as former President Noynoy Aquino and former Senator Rene Saguisag br Enrile eventually backpedalled from some of his claims saying they were the products of unlucid intervals but continuing to claim that the extent of the atrocities was subject to debate br br br Organized disinformation efforts and use of troll accounts br In Dr Jason Caba es of the University of Leeds School of Media and Communication and Dr Jonathan Corpus Ong of the University of Massachusetts Amherst released a study of organized disinformation efforts in the Philippines titled Architects of Networked Disinformation Behind the Scenes of Troll Accounts and Fake News Production in the Philippines Based on participant observation in Facebook community groups and Twitter accounts as well as key informant interviews with disinformation architects conducted from December to December the study described a professionalized and hierarchized group of political operators who design disinformation campaigns mobilize click armies and execute innovative digital black ops and signal scrambling techniques for any interested political client This network had ad and PR strategists at the top br The Ong and Caba es study also described how techniques for personal branding were used to tell a revisionist account of the year Marcos regime as the golden age of the Philippines using such tools as YouTube videos in a bid to restore the political luster of the Marcos family br br br Role in the Marcos burial br br One of the revelations from the Ong and Caba es study was the existence of Ilibing Na Bury now campaign designed to create public support for a hero s burial for Ferdinand Marcos using diversionary tactics to elude allegations of human rights violations and corruption during the term of Ferdinand Marcos and launching digital black ops that targeted prominent critics of the Marcoses particularly vice

father s regime that presented false narratives about the past br Philippine researchers said that networked political manipulation on social media played a role in the presidential elections The study by the Philippine Media Monitoring Laboratory said that through Facebook YouTube and Twitter anti democratic actors were able to influence political discourse by mimicking survey organizations and news media br br br Studies on disinformation spread br A study from the University of the Philippines Diliman found that the Marcoses their loyalists and their allies had produced and reproduced disinformation for years intending to create an impression that the propaganda had actually come from a reputable community of scholars br A related study published that year by Vera Files found claims about the Marcoses that had been debunked by various news organizations and examined how they were distributed Although a number of pro Marcos propaganda sourcebooks had been published in the study found that about of confirmed Marcos disinformation originated directly from social media rather than print sources Specifically it found out that of these were distributed via social media and not attributable to pro Marcos books of them came from a person quoted by media which cannot traced to a preexisting text and about were about recent events Only about could be traced to text in various propaganda books while a remaining consisted of general claims br Researchers from the University of the Philippines Third World Studies Center noted that after Bongbong Marcos announced in October his candidacy for the presidency claims praising his father s regime increased significantly In addition to spreading disinformation pro Marcos posts also vilified post Marcos administrations by falsely claiming that the Philippine economy was better under Marcos Most of the propaganda used photos and videos and were widely shared Pro Marcos propaganda are often spread through Facebook pages by self proclaimed Marcos Sr loyalists who support Bongbong Marcos Among the celebrities who have helped amplify pro Marcos disinformation are singer Richard Poon comedian Isko Salvador vlogger Tricia Arias and director Darryl Yap director Videos with false claims have also been spread by political party Katipunan ng Demokratikong Pilipino Fact checks done by mainstream media tend to have limited effects partly due to distrust of the media sown by Juan Ponce Enrile columnist Rigoberto Bobi Tiglao officials of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and pro

power and then in the second half of the film focusing on the political comeback of the Marcos family after Ferdinand Marcos had died and highlighing the stories of those who had survived abuses during Martial Law Greenfield s exploration characterizes Imelda Marcos as the documentary s unreliable narrator but takes on what The New York Times calls a dialectic approach allowing Imelda to literally tell her narrative and slowly introducing opposing viewpoints as the movie progresses br Various universities in the Philippines have released various publications and have held numerous academic fora regarding the topic referring to it as historical denialism negationism disinformation or distortion br br br See also br Historical negationism br Fake news in the Philippines br Post
