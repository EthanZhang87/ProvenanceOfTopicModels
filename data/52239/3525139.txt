The Psychological Warfare Division of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force PWD SHAEF or SHAEF PWD was a joint Anglo American organization set up in World War II tasked with conducting predominantly white tactical psychological warfare against German troops and recently liberated countries in Northwest Europe during and after D Day It was headed by US Brigadier General Robert A McClure who had previously commanded the Psychological Warfare Branch PWB AFHQ of U S General Dwight D Eisenhower s staff for Operation Torch The Division was formed from staff of the US Office of War Information OWI and Office of Strategic Services OSS and the British Political Warfare Executive PWE br The Division used radio and leaflet propaganda to undermine German soldiers morale with the bulk of the aerial propaganda leaflets being printed in the United Kingdom and a dedicated Special Leaflet Squadron of the US th Air Force disseminating the leaflets from its base in Cheddington south east England Tactical Combat propaganda teams were also attached to the Army Groups to produce leaflets in the field on mobile printing presses for shell firing over the front line and to conduct loudspeaker operations to talk enemy soldiers into surrendering PWD operated the Voice of SHAEF radio station as well as taking over Radio Luxembourg br Black propaganda continued to be controlled by the Political Warfare Executive s Sefton Delmer br br br Historical context br br br History of psychological warfare in WWII br On July the Office of the Coordinator of Information COI was created in Washington under Roosevelt with Colonel William J Donovan as the first director This office was later separated into the Office of Strategic Services OSS and the Overseas Branch and the Office of War Information OWI These two offices were the first attempt at the establishment of an organized effort to promote espionage propaganda subversion and any related activities under a centralized agency br On the British side the most coordinated effort for psychological warfare was the Political Intelligence Department PID In Fall of after the COI was split into OSS and OWI the PID agreed to issue a Joint Psychological Warfare Directive to combine efforts of the psychological warfare agencies in Britain and America This Joint Directive remained the most prominent policy of the PWD until the end of its operations in July br In November the Psychological Warfare Branch AFHQ was created as a joint military civilian Anglo American psychological warfare unit under the order of then General Dwight D Eisenhower attached to the Allied Force Headquarters after the Allied forces landed in French North Africa After much trial and error with the structure and organization of the branch it was transformed into the more coherent and larger structure of the Psychological Warfare Division Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force PWD SHAEF in February br br br PWD SHAEF br SHAEF remained the headquarters of the Commander of Allied Forces in northwest Europe from late until the end of World War II on September under the command of General Dwight D Eisenhower The goals of the PWD were to br br Wage psychological warfare against the enemy br Use various media to sustain the morale of people of friendly nations occupied by the enemy br Conduct propaganda directed toward a military force and designed to ensure compliance with the instructions of the commander of the occupying force br Control information services in Allied occupied Germany br The Publicity and Psychological Warfare Division G under Brig Gen Robert A McClure was initiated by SHAEF in February McClure s original role was to coordinate all Allied press and psychological warfare agencies in northwest Europe However it ended up being split into two divisions just two months later Psychological Warfare moved under the auspices of General McClure and Public Relations was under Col Justus Baldwin Lawrence br There were two categories of propaganda used combat and strategic Combat propaganda was tactical propaganda conducted in forward areas and toward smaller populations immediately behind enemy lines Strategic propaganda sought to further more long term directed goals br br br Leaflet propaganda front br br Various kinds of leaflets were used throughout the operation The most common leaflet came in the form of single flyers promoting one specific message However airborne newspapers were considered the most effective propaganda The PID produced weekly newspapers COURRIER DE L AIR air courier soon followed by an American equivalent L AMERIQUE EN GUERRE America at war They each consisted of four leaflet units intended to keep the citizens of occupied France aware of the progress of the Allies Later other similar papers were produced for the people of other occupied countries including STERNENBANNER Stars and Stripes which was disseminated in Germany br Propaganda was separated into three categories White propaganda had its source clearly indicated such as was the case with the L AMERIQUE EN GUERRE Black propaganda was used to cause the audience to believe the source was something other than what it really was Finally gray propaganda did not cite who was endorsing the message this was the case in the daily paper NACHRICHTEN F R DIE TRUPPE news for the troops produced for German garrisons along the Atlantic Wall br SAFE conduct passes were also created by the PWD These passes display Eisenhower s signature and provided instructions for German soldiers on how to surrender Oftentimes the other side of the leaflet contained more immediate news or a tactical message br Overall the leaflets aimed to reach two main audiences The news directed toward the people of friendly occupied countries came across in newspapers such as the COURIER DE L AIR and L AMERIQUE EN GUERRE In addition leaflets were disseminated to inform citizens of how to react to dire circumstances such as the invasion of Normandy There were also leaflets produced for enemies including German troops and civilians and as time went on foreign workers and prisoners of war in Germany A four language newspaper was distributed each night by SHAEF and transmitted the Supreme Commander s instructions to the various displaced persons in Germany According to the PWD SHAEF the leaflets were not argumentative but instead were created to be objective and factual br Leaflet writing was done by the OWI and PID in consultation with the PWD deputies members of the Plans and Directives Section members of the Leaflet Section and the PWD G and G liaison officers Leaflets were written keeping in mind the ever changing military situation the morale of the intended audience production schedules and distribution Yet the overall goal of the leaflets was to provide the hard news of the military situation and the wishes of the supreme commander The agency of the special leaflet squadron was used to disseminate leaflets Between and the Eighth Air Force distributed percent of all leaflets in the areas of the Anglo American armies Ten percent was disseminated by the Royal Air Force percent by fighter bombers of the tactical air forces and percent by artillery field guns and howitzers br The nd Bomb Squadron of the Eighth Air Force originally released leaflets from large boxes of a Boeing B Flying Fortress flying at feet They took into account the mph winds e g releasing leaflets over Brussels in order for them to land near Paris The boxes used for this mission were converted luggage carriers obtained from the Air Transport Command The smallest quantity of leaflets that could be released at one time using this method was about Though this method of dissemination was large scale it did not facilitate accuracy of where the leaflets would land br br br Leaflet bombs br On February the first leaflet bomb was tested The bombs were created with cardboard M containers equipped with mechanical time fuses Each container contained approximately leaflets and they were released from feet This method of dissemination was deemed a vast improvement from previous and was generally implemented thereafter Future directives of the United States Strategic Air Forces required the depot in Bedfordshire England to produce bombs per month and that aircraft be loaded with leaflets to be dispatched with each mission conducted over Germany br br br Leaflet shells br Leaflets were rolled and inserted into shells to be launched via artillery specifically howitzer guns The mm shell carried leaflets while the mm shell carried leaflets br br br Filming br The director Alexander Mackendrick who later went on to enjoy considerable success at Ealing Studios had some of his earliest experience of working in film with the division John Huston and Eric Ambler as a token British representative also made a film for the PWD about civilian Italy under its new conquerors The Italian Swiss documentary Giorni di gloria co directed by Giuseppe De Santis Luchino Visconti Marcello Pagliero and film editor Mario Serandrei was also made with collaboration of the PWD Film
