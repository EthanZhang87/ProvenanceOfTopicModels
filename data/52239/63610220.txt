id: 63610220
The tobacco industry playbook tobacco strategy or simply disinformation playbook describes a strategy devised by the tobacco industry in the s to protect revenues in the face of mounting evidence of links between tobacco smoke and serious illnesses primarily cancer Much of the playbook is known from industry documents made public by whistleblowers or as a result of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement These documents are now curated by the UCSF Truth Tobacco Industry Documents project and are a primary source for much commentary on both the tobacco playbook and its similarities to the tactics used by other industries notably the fossil fuel industry It is possible that the playbook may even have originated with the oil industry br A R J Reynolds internal memorandum noted Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the mind of the general public br In Merchants of Doubt Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway documented the way that tobacco companies had campaigned over several decades to cast doubt on the scientific evidence of harm caused by their products and noted the same techniques being used by other industries whose harmful products were targets of regulatory and environmental efforts This is often linked to climate change denialism promoted by the fossil fuel industry the same tactics were employed by fossil fuel groups such as the American Petroleum Institute to cast doubt on climate science from the s and some of the same PR firms and individuals engaged to claim that tobacco smoking was safe were later recruited to attack climate science br br br History br The strategy was initiated at a crisis meeting between US tobacco executives and John Hill of public relations company Hill Knowlton at the New York Plaza Hotel in following the Reader s Digest s pr cis of an article from the Christian Herald titled Cancer by the Carton highlighting the emergent findings of epidemiologists including Richard Doll and Austin Bradford Hill It led to the publication of A Frank Statement an advertisement designed to cast doubt on the science showing serious health effects from smoking br Tactics included br br Fear uncertainty and doubt including funding studies designed to undermine scientific consensus on the health effects of tobacco and characterising findings of harm as junk science br Astroturfing br Attacking and intimidating opponents br Lobbying and political talking points br Emphasising industry self regulation and personal responsibility br Documents such as Bad Science A Resource Book were used to promulgate talking points intended to cast doubt on scientific independence and political interference br br br Influence br br The playbook has been adopted by the fossil fuel industry in its efforts to stave off global action on climate change and by those seeking to undermine the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA more generally The manufacture and promotion of uncertainty especially has been identified as inspired directly by the tobacco industry br Recognising that it had little or no credibility with the public and concerned about mounting pressure to act on environmental tobacco smoke ETS the tobacco industry actively recruited fellow enemies of the EPA setting up the Advancement of Sound Science Coalition TASSC a fake grassroots group Its first director was Steve Milloy previously of APCO the consultancy firm employed by Philip Morris to set up TASSC Milloy subsequently set up junkscience com a website which equates environmentalists with Nazis and now promotes climate change denial Many of the consultants who worked for the tobacco industry have also worked for fossil fuel companies against action on climate change TASSC hired Frederick Seitz and Fred Singer both now prominent in climate change denial Greg Zimmerman found a presentation titled Survival Is Victory Lessons From the Tobacco Wars by Richard Reavey of Cloud Peak Energy and formerly of Philip Morris in which Reavey explicitly acknowledged the parallels and urged fellow coal executives to accept the facts of climate change and work with regulators on solutions that would preserve the industry Both Fred Singer and Frederick Seitz are prominent figures in climate change denial who previously worked for the tobacco industry br Environmentalist George Monbiot identifies many groups that were funded by tobacco firms and subsequently by Exxon and other fossil fuel companies and now actively take part in climate change denial including the Competitive Enterprise Institute the Cato Institute The Heritage Foundation the Hudson Institute the Frontiers of Freedom Institute the Reason Foundation the Independent Institute and George Mason University s Law and Economics Centre br Opponents of vaping also identify elements of the tobacco playbook in the e cigarette industry s response to health concerns Tobacco companies took stakes in soft drinks companies and used the same tactics around colours and flavours that they had used to target young potential smokers The soft drinks industry s attempts to avoid sugary beverage taxes and other government action to reduce obesity draws upon elements of the tobacco playbook including use of Corporate Social Responsibility CSR programs as a PR strategy Research contracts issued as part of CSR programmes allow soft drinks manufacturers to bury inconvenient results br A article in the Emory Law Journal made parallels to attempts by the National Football League to downplay the issue of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in American football with the New York Times noting a number of tobacco figures involved in the NFL s defence br The World Health Organization has subsequently published a tobacco control playbook br The public relations strategies of Big Tech companies have often been compared with the tobacco industry playbook br br br See also br Health effects of tobacco
