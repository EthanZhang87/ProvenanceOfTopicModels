Email spoofing is the creation of email messages with a forged sender address The term applies to email purporting to be from an address which is not actually the sender s mail sent in reply to that address may bounce or be delivered to an unrelated party whose identity has been faked Disposable email address or masked email is a different topic providing a masked email address that is not the user s normal address which is not disclosed for example so that it cannot be harvested but forwards mail sent to it to the user s real address br The original transmission protocols used for email do not have built in authentication methods this deficiency allows spam and phishing emails to use spoofing in order to mislead the recipient More recent countermeasures have made such spoofing from internet sources more difficult but they have not eliminated it completely few internal networks have defences against a spoof email from a colleague s compromised computer on that network Individuals and businesses deceived by spoof emails may suffer significant financial losses in particular spoofed emails are often used to infect computers with ransomware br br br Technical details br When a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP email is sent the initial connection provides two pieces of address information br br MAIL FROM generally presented to the recipient as the Return path header but not normally visible to the end user and by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address br RCPT TO specifies which email address the email is delivered to is not normally visible to the end user but may be present in the headers as part of the Received header br Together these are sometimes referred to as the envelope addressing an analogy to a traditional paper envelope Unless the receiving mail server signals that it has problems with either of these items the sending system sends the DATA command and typically sends several header items including br br From Joe Q Doe joeqdoe example com the address visible to the recipient but again by default no checks are done that the sending system is authorized to send on behalf of that address br Reply to Jane Roe Jane Roe example mil similarly not checked br Sender Jin Jo jin jo example jp also not checked br The result is that the email recipient sees the email as having come from the address in the From header They may sometimes be able to find the MAIL FROM address and if they reply to the email it will go to either the address presented in the From or Reply to header but none of these addresses are typically reliable so automated bounce messages may generate backscatter br Although email spoofing is effective in forging the email address the IP address of the computer sending the mail can generally be identified from the Received lines in the email header In malicious cases however this is likely to be the computer of an innocent third party infected by malware that is sending the email without the owner s knowledge br br br Malicious use of spoofing br Phishing and business email compromise scams generally involve an element of email spoofing br Email spoofing has been responsible for public incidents with serious business and financial consequences This was the case in an October email to a news agency which was spoofed to look as if it was from the Swedish company Fingerprint Cards The email stated that Samsung offered to purchase the company The news spread and the stock exchange rate surged by br Malware such as Klez and Sober among many more modern examples often search for email addresses within the computer they have infected and they use those addresses both as targets for email and also to create credible forged From fields in the emails that they send This is to ensure that the emails are more likely to be opened For example br br Alice is sent an infected email which she opens running the worm code br The worm code searches Alice s email address book and finds the addresses of Bob and Charlie br From Alice s computer the worm sends an infected email to Bob but is forged to appear as if it was sent by Charlie br In this case even if Bob s system detects the incoming mail as containing malware he sees the source as being Charlie even though it really came from Alice s computer Meanwhile Alice may remain unaware that her computer has been infected and Charlie does not know anything about it at all unless he receives an error message from Bob br br br The effect on mail servers br Traditionally mail servers could accept a mail item then later send a Non Delivery Report or bounce message if it could not be delivered or had been quarantined for any reason These would be sent to the MAIL FROM a k a Return Path address With the massive rise in forged addresses best practice is now to not generate NDRs for detected spam viruses etc but to reject the email during the SMTP transaction When mail administrators fail to take this approach their systems are guilty of sending backscatter emails to innocent parties in itself a form of spam or being used to perform Joe job attacks br br br Countermeasures br The SSL TLS system used to encrypt server to server email traffic can also be used to enforce authentication but in practice it is seldom used and a range of other potential solutions have also failed to gain traction br A number of defensive systems have come into wide use including br br Sender Policy Framework SPF an email authentication method designed to detect forging sender addresses during the delivery of the email br DomainKeys Identified Mail DKIM an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in email email spoofing a technique often used in phishing and email spam br Domain based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance DMARC an email authentication protocol It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use commonly known as email spoofing The purpose and primary outcome of implementing DMARC is to protect a domain from being used in business email compromise attacks phishing emails email scams and other cyber threat activities br To effectively stop forged email being delivered the sending domains their mail servers and the receiving system all need to be configured correctly for these higher standards of authentication Although their use is increasing estimates vary widely as to what percentage of emails have no form of domain authentication from to almost half For this reason receiving mail systems typically have a range of settings to configure how they treat poorly configured domains or email br While there has been research into improving email security little emphasis has been placed on informing users whose email addresses have been used for spoofing Currently only the email recipient can identify a fake email and users whose addresses are spoofed remain unaware unless the recipient manually scrutinizes the message br br br Business email br Business email compromise attacks are a class of cyber crime which use email fraud to attack organizations Examples include invoice scams and spear phishing attacks which are designed to gather data for other criminal activities A business deceived by an email spoof can suffer additional financial business continuity and reputational damage Fake emails can also be used to spread malware br Typically an attack targets specific employee roles within an organization by sending spoof emails which fraudulently represent a senior colleague trusted customer or supplier This type of attack is known as spear phishing The email will issue instructions such as approving payments or releasing client data The emails often use social engineering to trick the victim into making money transfers to the bank account of the fraudster br The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation recorded billion of US and international losses associated with BEC attacks between June and July More recent figures estimate losses of over billion from to br br br Incidents br Dublin Zoo lost in such a scam in a total of was taken though most was recovered br The Austrian aerospace firm FACC AG was defrauded of million million through an attack in February and subsequently fired
