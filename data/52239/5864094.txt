title: Mohamed Atta's alleged Prague connection
id: 5864094
A connection between Iraq and al Qaeda came through an alleged meeting between September hijacker Mohamed Atta and Iraqi consulate in April This alleged connection is notable because it was a key claim used by the Bush administration to justify the U S led invasion of Iraq The Czech counterintelligence service claimed that Mohamed Atta el Sayed a September hijacker met with Ahmad Samir al Ani the consul at the Iraqi Embassy in Prague in a caf in Prague This claim sometimes known as the Prague connection is generally considered to be false and has been said to be unsubstantiated by the Senate Intelligence Committee in the United States br br br Allegations br In an interview with NBC s Meet the Press on December then Vice President Dick Cheney said It s been pretty well confirmed that Atta did go to Prague and he did meet with a senior official of the Iraqi intelligence service in the Czech Republic last April several months before the attack br Cheney repeated the allegation as the nation prepared for war with Iraq br The source for the claim came from a contact the Czech intelligence had within the Iraqi embassy described in The Boston Globe as a single informant from Prague s Arab community who saw Atta s picture in the news after the September attacks and who later told his handlers that he had seen him meeting with Ani Some officials have called the source unreliable br The story was first leaked to the Reuters news service on September Without naming Prague Reuters reported that r ecent intelligence information received by the United States showed Atta had met with a representative of Iraqi intelligence this year The report cited U S government sources On October the story was leaked to Czech newspapers The story was confirmed by the State Department On October The New York Times published a story by John Tagliabue saying Czech officials denied the meeting ever occurred br On October Czech Republic Interior Minister Stanislav Gross responded by calling a press conference at which he confirmed that Atta did make contact with an officer of the Iraqi intelligence in Prague namely al Ani who was later expelled from the country br On October The New York Times published a story refuting its earlier story Later The New York Times reported that Czech officials later backed off of the claim first privately and then later publicly after the paper conducted extensive interviews with leading Czech figures br When rumors of the Czech officials privately backing away from the claims first appeared in the Western media according to The Prague Post Hynek Kmon ek the Czech envoy to the UN stated The meeting took place One senior Czech official who requested anonymity speculated that the media reports dismissing the meeting were the result of a guided leak On March David Ignatius wrote in The Washington Post br br Even the Czechs who initially put out the reports about Atta s meeting with al Ani have gradually backed away The Czech interior minister Stanislav Gross said in October that the two had met in April That version was altered slightly by Czech Prime Minister Milo Zeman when he told CNN in November Atta contacted some Iraqi agent not to prepare the terrorist attack on the twin towers but to prepare a terrorist attack on just the building of Radio Free Europe in Prague Then in December Czech President V clav Havel retreated further saying there was only a percent chance Atta met with al Ani br But Havel later moved to quash the report once and for all by making the statement publicly to the White House as reported in The New York Times According to the Times report Czech officials also say they have no hard evidence that Mr Ani was involved in terrorist activities although the government did order his ouster in late April The New York Times report was described as a fabrication by a Ladislav pa ek a spokesman for Czech president V clav Havel But pa ek also said Mr Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr Atta met an Iraqi diplomat The Times story was a potential embarrassment to Czech prime minister Milo Zeman after extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report br br br Investigations br Several official organizations conducted investigations into the possibility that such a meeting occurred and they all concluded that the evidence did not support the likelihood of such a meeting br br br CIA br Shortly after September Vice President Dick Cheney asked Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet to look into the claim that Atta had met an Iraqi intelligence agent Tenet put the Directorate of Operations Jim Pavitt on the case who reported back to Tenet On September Tenet told the President Our Prague office is skeptical about the report It just doesn t add up Tenet also indicated that other evidence the CIA was able to find including credit card and telephone records made such a meeting highly unlikely br According to columnist Robert Novak Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld confirmed published reports that there is no evidence placing the presumed leader of the terrorist attacks in the Czech capital According to the January CIA report Iraqi Support for Terrorism the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility that such a meeting occurred Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released the most complete public assessment by the agency on the issue in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in July stating Although we cannot rule it out we are increasingly skeptical that such a meeting occurred br John E McLaughlin who at the time was the Deputy Director of the CIA described the extent of the Agency s investigation into the claim Well on something like the Atta meeting in Prague we went over that every which way from Sunday We looked at it from every conceivable angle We peeled open the source examined the chain of acquisition We looked at photographs We looked at timetables We looked at who was where and when It is wrong to say that we didn t look at it In fact we looked at it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity br br br FBI br A senior administration official told Walter Pincus of The Washington Post that the FBI had concluded that there was no evidence Atta left or returned to the U S at the time he was supposed to be in Prague FBI Director Robert S Mueller III outlined the extent of their investigation into the hijacker s whereabouts in a speech in April We ran down literally hundreds of thousands of leads and checked every record we could get our hands on from flight reservations to car rentals to bank accounts There are no known travel records showing Atta leaving or entering the US at that time and everything known about Atta s whereabouts suggests that he was in Florida at that time br br br Czech police and intelligence br The Czech police chief Ji Kol said there were no documents showing that Atta visited Prague at any time in br In August Czech foreign intelligence chief Franti ek Bublan publicly backed away from the claim that Atta met al Ani saying that rumors of such meetings have not been verified or proven The Prague Post reported that Bublan said that promoting a so called Prague connection between Atta and al Ani might have been a ploy by U S policymakers seeking justifications for a new military action against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein br According to an article in The Washington Post more recently the Czechs backed away from the claim After months of further investigation Czech officials determined last year that they could no longer confirm that a meeting took place telling the Bush administration that al Ani might have met with someone other than Atta This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al Ani s who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta The associate said I have sat with the two of them at least twice The double is an Iraqi who has met with the consul If someone saw a photo of Atta he might easily mistake the two br In Ji R ek the former head of Czech intelligence agency BIS published his memoirs Here he claims that the USA tried to push Czech prime minister Milo Zeman to announce that attack was planned with the help of Iraq in Prague All blame for the false cause of conflict would then fall on Czech authorities br br br Commission br The Commission also addressed the question of an alleged Prague connection and listed many of the reasons above that such a meeting could not have taken place The report notes that the FBI has gathered intelligence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on April as evidenced by a bank surveillance camera photo and in Coral Springs Florida on April where he and Shehhi leased an apartment On April and Atta s cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments in Florida from cell sites within Florida We cannot confirm that he placed those calls But there are no U S records indicating that Atta departed the country during this period Combining FBI and Czech intelligence investigations n o evidence has been found that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April The Commission assessed that There was no reason for such a meeting especially considering the risk it would pose to the operation By April all four pilots had completed most of their training and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States The available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta Ani meeting br In the final analysis the Commission Report makes this statement These findings cannot absolutely rule out the possibility that Atta was in Prague on April He could have used an alias to travel and a passport under that alias but this would be an exception to his practice of using his true name while traveling as he did in January and would in July when he took his next overseas trip p br br br Two different Attas br Until late many believed that Atta traveled to Prague for one day on May Nobody claimed he had met al Ani at that time but conservative columnist Andrew C McCarthy wrote in the National Review that his trip was considered suspicious Atta was apparently detained because he did not have a travel visa but was not picked up on airport surveillance br However the Chicago Tribune reported in August that it was a different Atta who traveled to Prague in May a Pakistani businessman also named Mohamed Atta who spells his name differently from the hijacker and was turned away because he lacked a visa The hijacker Mohamed Atta whose travel papers were in order went to the Prague airport a couple days later on his way to Newark creating confusion for some br br On June the hijacker Mohamed Atta who had a visa arrived in Prague by bus from Cologne Germany and flew to Newark the next day Video surveillance cameras at a Prague bus terminal showed him playing slot machines at the station s Happy Days Casino before disappearing br The confusion over the two different Attas had serious consequences according to Czech reporter Brian Kenety as it laid the groundwork for spurious claims by Czech authorities of a secret meeting in Prague between Atta the hijacker and an Iraqi intelligence agent br The Chicago Tribune on September also reported that a man from Pakistan named Mohamed Atta spelling his name with two m s rather than one flew to the Czech Republic in confusing the intelligence agency who thought it was the same Mohamed Atta In September Ji R ek the former head of the BIS told the Czech newspaper Mlad fronta Dnes This information was verified and it was confirmed that it was a case of the same name That is all that I recall of it September br Opposition leaders in the Czech Republic have publicly called this a failure on the part of Czech intelligence In hopes of resolving the issue Czech officials hoped to be given access to information from the U S investigation but that cooperation was not forthcoming In May the Czech newspaper Pr vo speculated that the source of the information behind the rumored meeting was actually the discredited INC chief Ahmed Chalabi br br br Forged letter br br According to Con Coughlin executive foreign editor of The Daily Telegraph Mohamed Atta is mentioned in a handwritten letter from the former chief of the Iraqi Intelligence Service Gen Tahir Jalil Habbush al Tikriti to Saddam Hussein Coughlin said he received the document from a senior member of the Iraqi interim government though this person declined to reveal where and how they obtained it br Habbush s July letter is labeled Intelligence Items and is addressed To the President of the Ba ath Revolution Party and President of the Republic may God protect you It continues br br Mohamed Atta an Egyptian national came with Abu Ammer the real name behind this Arabic alias remains a mystery and we hosted him in Abu Nidal s house at al Dora under our direct supervision We arranged a work program for him for three days with a team dedicated to working with him He displayed extraordinary effort and showed a firm commitment to lead the team which will be responsible for attacking the targets that we have agreed to destroy br Coughlin quoted Ayad Allawi giving personal assurance over the document s authenticity We are uncovering evidence all the time of Saddam s involvement with al Qaeda But this is the most compelling piece of evidence that we have found so far It shows that not only did Saddam have contacts with al Qaeda he had contact with those responsible for the September attacks br The letter is now widely recognized as a forgery Newsweek noted U S officials and a leading Iraqi document expert tell NEWSWEEK that the document is most likely a forgery part of a thriving new trade in dubious Iraqi documents that has cropped up in the wake of the collapse of Saddam s regime According to the newsmagazine The Telegraph story was apparently written with a political purpose to bolster Bush administration claims of a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam s regime br In the book The Way of the World author Ron Suskind claims that the Bush administration itself was behind the forgery br br br Additional evidence br Even further doubt was cast on rumors of such a meeting in December when Al Ani who is in U S custody reportedly denied having ever met Atta According to Newsweek it was a denial that officials tend to believe given that they have not unearthed a scintilla of evidence that Atta was even in Prague at the time of the alleged rendezvous br Atta s own religious and political convictions made him violently opposed to the Saddam regime according to the Commission Report In his interactions with other students Atta voiced virulently anti Semitic and anti American opinions ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media to polemics against governments of the Arab world To him Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East br br br Cheney s position changes br Vice President Dick Cheney who was a proponent of the theory that Atta had met al Ani in Prague acknowledged in an interview on March We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker Mohamed Atta had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague Czechoslovakia And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of confidence in it and so forth has been pretty well knocked down now at this stage that that meeting ever took place br On September Cheney responded to questions from Tim Russert about Atta in Prague on Meet the Press br br MR RUSSERT Any suggestion there was a meeting with Mohamed Atta one of the hijackers with Iraqi officials br VICE PRES CHENEY No The sequence Tim was when you and I talked that morning we had not received any reporting with respect to Mohamed Atta going to Prague Just a few days after you and I did that show the CIA CIA produced an intelligence report from the Czech Intelligence Service that said Mohammad Atta leader of the hijackers had been in Prague in April of and had met with the senior Iraqi intelligence official in Prague That was the first report we had that he d been to Prague and met with Iraqis Later on some period of time after that the CIA produced another report based on a photographer on a photograph that was taken in Prague of a man they claim percent probability was Mohammad Atta on another occasion This was the reporting we received from the CIA when I responded to your question and said it had been pretty well confirmed that he d been in Prague The later on they were unable to confirm it Later on they backed off of it br But what I told you was exactly what we were receiving at the time It never said and I don t believe I ever said specifically that it linked the Iraqis to It specifically said he had been in Prague Mohamed Atta had been in Prague and we didn t know br MR RUSSERT And the meeting with Atta did not occur br VICE PRES CHENEY We don t know I mean we ve never been able to to to link it and the FBI and CIA have worked it aggressively I would say at this point nobody has been able to confirm br br br Senate Report of Pre war Intelligence on Iraq br On September the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released Phase II of its report on prewar intelligence on Iraq In the report the following is stated regarding Atta in Prague br br Postwar findings support CIA s January assessment which judged that the most reliable reporting casts doubt on an alleged meeting between Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague and confirm that no such meeting occurred Prewar assessments described reporting on the Atta lead as contradictory and unverified In September CIA assessed that some evidence asserted that the two met and some cast doubt on the possibility By January CIA assessed that they were increasingly skeptical that Atta traveled to Prague in or met with IIS officer al Ani Postwar debriefings of al Ani indicate that he had never seen or heard of Atta until after September when Atta s face appeared on the news br The report also contains a full page of information with regards to Atta in Prague that was redacted Newsweek reports that the blacked out portion of the Report involved a CIA cable that lays out the controversy According to Newsweek Democrats charged in a written statement that intelligence officials had failed to demonstrate that disclosing the cable would reveal sources and methods or otherwise harm national security The Democrats also complained that officials refusal to declassify the cable represents an improper use of classification authority by the intelligence community to shield the White House Newsweek goes on to report br br According to two sources familiar with the blacked out portions of the Senate report that discuss the CIA cable s contents the document indicates that White House officials had proposed mentioning the supposed Atta Prague meeting in a Bush speech scheduled for March According to one of the sources familiar with the Senate report s censored portions who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject the tone of the CIA cable was strident and expressed dismay that the White House was trying to shoehorn the Atta anecdote into the Bush speech to be delivered only days before the U S invasion of Iraq The source said the cable also suggested that policymakers had tried to insert the same anecdote into other speeches by top administration officials A second source familiar with the Senate report however maintained that it could be read as routine give and take between policymakers asking legitimate questions about intelligence reporting and field operatives giving respectful responses Both sources familiar with the report acknowledge that there is no proof the White House saw the cable and thus it is unclear whether the CIA document had any bearing on the fact that Bush never mentioned the Atta anecdote in a speech br CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano asserted that the classification had nothing to do with protecting the Bush Administration When CIA did not agree to a specific public release its case was based on current intelligence equities and a desire to preserve the candor essential to good internal discussion of complex issues It s simply wrong to suggest the goal was to protect the White House br br br See also br Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda link allegations br br br br br br External links br The Prewar Evidence or Lack
