id: 7746391
In the psychology of human behavior denialism is a person s choice to deny reality as a way to avoid believing in a psychologically uncomfortable truth Denialism is an essentially irrational action that withholds the validation of a historical experience or event when a person refuses to accept an empirically verifiable reality br In the sciences denialism is the rejection of basic facts and concepts that are undisputed well supported parts of the scientific consensus on a subject in favor of ideas that are radical controversial or fabricated The terms Holocaust denial and AIDS denialism describe the denial of the facts and the reality of the subject matters and the term climate change denial describes denial of the scientific consensus that the climate change of planet Earth is a real and occurring event primarily caused in geologically recent times by human activity The forms of denialism present the common feature of the person rejecting overwhelming evidence and trying to generate political controversy in attempts to deny the existence of consensus br The motivations and causes of denialism include religion self interest economic political or financial and defence mechanisms meant to protect the psyche of the denialist against mentally disturbing facts and ideas such disturbance is called cognitive dissonance in psychology terms br br br Definition and tactics br Anthropologist Didier Fassin distinguishes between denial defined as the empirical observation that reality and truth are being denied and denialism which he defines as an ideological position whereby one systematically reacts by refusing reality and truth Persons and social groups who reject propositions on which there exists a mainstream and scientific consensus engage in denialism when they use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of argument and legitimate debate when there is none It is a process that operates by employing one or more of the following five tactics to maintain the appearance of legitimate controversy br br Conspiracy theories Dismissing the data or observation by suggesting opponents are involved in a conspiracy to suppress the truth br Cherry picking Selecting an anomalous critical paper supporting their idea or using outdated flawed and discredited papers to make their opponents look as though they base their ideas on weak research Diethelm and McKee note Denialists are usually not deterred by the extreme isolation of their theories but rather see it as an indication of their intellectual courage against the dominant orthodoxy and the accompanying political correctness br False experts Paying an expert in the field or another field to lend supporting evidence or credibility This goes hand in hand with the marginalization of real experts and researchers br Moving the goalposts Dismissing evidence presented in response to a specific claim by continually demanding some other often unfulfillable piece of evidence aka Shifting baseline br Other logical fallacies Usually one or more of false analogy appeal to consequences straw man or red herring br Common tactics to different types of denialism include misrepresenting evidence false equivalence half truths and outright fabrication South African judge Edwin Cameron notes that a common tactic used by denialists is to make great play of the inescapable indeterminacy of figures and statistics Historian Taner Ak am states that denialism is commonly believed to be negation of facts but in fact it is in that nebulous territory between facts and truth where such denialism germinates Denialism marshals its own facts and it has its own truth br Focusing on the rhetorical tactics through which denialism is achieved in language in Alex Gillespie of the London School of Economics has reviewed the linguistic and practical defensive tactics for denying disruptive information These tactics are conceptualized in terms of three layers of defence br br Avoiding The first line of defence against disruptive information is to avoid it br Delegitimizing The second line of defence is to attack the messenger by undermining the credibility of the source br Limiting The final line of defence if disruptive information cannot be avoided or delegitimized is to rationalize and limit the impact of the disruptive ideas br In author Michael Specter defined group denialism as when an entire segment of society often struggling with the trauma of change turns away from reality in favor of a more comfortable lie br br br Prescriptive and polemic perspectives br If one party to a debate accuses the other of denialism they are framing the debate This is because an accusation of denialism is both prescriptive and polemic prescriptive because it carries implications that there is truth to the denied claim polemic since the accuser implies that continued denial in the light of presented evidence raises questions about the other s motives Edward Skidelsky a lecturer in philosophy at Exeter University writes that An accusation of denial is serious suggesting either deliberate dishonesty or self deception The thing being denied is by implication so obviously true that the denier must be driven by perversity malice or wilful blindness He suggests that by the introduction of the word denier into further areas of historical and scientific debate One of the great achievements of The Enlightenment the liberation of historical and scientific enquiry from dogma is quietly being reversed br Some people have suggested that because denial of the Holocaust is well known advocates who use the term denialist in other areas of debate may intentionally or unintentionally imply that their opponents are little better than Holocaust deniers However Robert Gallo et al defended this latter comparison stating that AIDS denialism is similar to Holocaust denial since it is a form of pseudoscience that contradicts an immense body of research br br br Politics and science br br br Climate change br br br HIV AIDS br br AIDS denialism is the denial that the human immunodeficiency virus HIV is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS AIDS denialism has been described as being among the most vocal anti science denial movements Some denialists reject the existence of HIV while others accept that the virus exists but say that it is a harmless passenger virus and not the cause of AIDS Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease they attribute it to some combination of recreational drug use malnutrition poor sanitation and side effects of antiretroviral medication rather than infection with HIV However the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive and the scientific community rejects and ignores AIDS denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning cherry picking and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community AIDS denialist material is now spread mainly through the Internet br Thabo Mbeki former president of South Africa embraced AIDS denialism proclaiming that AIDS was primarily caused by poverty About people died from AIDS during his presidency it is estimated that around premature deaths could have been prevented if proper treatment had been available br br br COVID br br The term COVID denialism or merely COVID denialism refers to the thinking of those who deny the reality of the COVID pandemic at least to the extent of denying the scientifically recognized COVID mortality data of the World Health Organization The claims that the COVID pandemic has been faked exaggerated or mischaracterized are pseudoscience Some famous people who have engaged in COVID denialism include Elon Musk former U S President Donald Trump and former Brazilian President Bolsonaro br br br Evolution br br Religious beliefs may prompt an individual to deny the validity of the scientific theory of evolution Evolution is considered an undisputed fact within the scientific community and in academia where the level of support for evolution is essentially universal yet this view is often met with opposition by biblical literalists The alternative view is often presented as a literal interpretation of the Book of Genesis s creation myth Many fundamentalist Christians teach creationism as if it were fact under the banners of creation science and intelligent design Beliefs that typically coincide with creationism include the belief in the global flood myth geocentrism and the belief that the Earth is only years old These beliefs are viewed as pseudoscience in the scientific community and are widely regarded as erroneous br br br Flat Earth br br The superseded belief that the Earth is flat and denial of all of the overwhelming evidence that supports an approximately spherical Earth that rotates around its axis and orbits the Sun persists into the st century Modern proponents of flat Earth cosmology or flat Earthers refuse to accept any kind of contrary evidence dismissing all spaceflights and images from space as hoaxes and accusing all organizations and even private citizens of conspiring to hide the truth They also claim that no actual satellites are orbiting the Earth that the International Space Station is fake and that these are lies from all governments involved in this grand cover up Some even believe other planets and stars are hoaxes br Adherents of the modern flat earth model propose that a dome shaped firmament encloses a disk shaped Earth They may also claim after Samuel Rowbotham that the Sun is only miles km above the Earth and that the Moon and the Sun orbit above the Earth rather than around it Modern flat earthers believe that Antarctica is not a continent but a massive ice floe with a wall feet m or higher which circles the perimeter of the Earth and keeps everything including all the oceans water from falling off the edge br Flat Earthers also assert that no one is allowed to fly over or explore Antarctica despite contrary evidence According to them all photos and videos of ships sinking under the horizon and of the bottoms of city skylines and clouds below the horizon revealing the curvature of the Earth have been manipulated computer generated or somehow faked Therefore regardless of any scientific or empirical evidence provided flat Earthers conclude that it is fabricated or altered in some way br When linked to other observed phenomena such as gravity sunsets tides eclipses distances and other measurements that challenge the flat earth model claimants replace commonly accepted explanations with piecemeal models that distort or over simplify how perspective mass buoyancy light or other physical systems work These piecemeal replacements rarely conform with each other finally leaving many flat Earth claimants to agree that such phenomena remain mysteries and more investigation is to be done In this conclusion adherents remain open to all explanations except the commonly accepted globular Earth model shifting the debate from ignorance to denialism br br br Genetically modified foods br br There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from genetically modified crops GM poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case by case basis before introduction Nonetheless members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country with some nations banning or restricting them and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation br Psychological analyses indicate that over of GM food opponents in the US are absolute in their opposition experience disgust at the thought of eating GM foods and are evidence insensitive br br br Statins br Statin denialism is a rejection of the medical worth of statins a class of cholesterol lowering drugs Cardiologist Steven Nissen at Cleveland Clinic has commented We are losing the battle for the hearts and minds of our patients to Web sites promoting unproven medical therapies Harriet Hall sees a spectrum of statin denialism ranging from pseudoscientific claims to the understatement of benefits and overstatement of side effects all of which is contrary to the scientific evidence br br br Mental illness denial br br Mental illness denial or mental disorder denial is where a person denies the existence of mental disorders Both serious analysts as well as pseudoscientific movements question the existence of certain disorders A minority of professional researchers see disorders such as depression from a sociocultural perspective and argue that the solution to it is fixing a dysfunction in society not in the person s brain Some people may also deny that they have a mental illness after being diagnosed certain analysts argue this denialism is usually fueled by narcissistic injury Anti psychiatry movements such as Scientology promote mental illness denial by having alternative practices to psychiatry br br br Election denial br br Election denial is false dismissal of the outcome of a fair election Stacey Abrams denied the election for governor in Georgia was a free and fair election and spent million in largely unsuccessful litigation In the United States since the presidential election there has been an ongoing stolen election conspiracy theory about the presidential election br br br Historiography br br Historical negationism the denialism of widely accepted historical facts is a major source of concern among historians and it is frequently used to falsify or distort accepted historical events In attempting to revise the past negationists are distinguished by the use of techniques inadmissible in proper historical discourse such as presenting known forged documents as genuine inventing ingenious but implausible reasons for distrusting genuine documents attributing conclusions to books and sources that report the opposite manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view and deliberately mistranslating texts br Some countries such as Germany have criminalized the negationist revision of certain historical events while other countries take a more cautious position for various reasons such as the protection of free speech Others mandate negationist views such as California where schoolchildren have been explicitly prevented from learning about the California genocide br br br Armenian genocide denialism br br br Holocaust denialism br br Holocaust denial refers to the denial of the murder of to million Jews by the Nazis in Europe during World War In this context the term is a subset of genocide denial which is a form of politically motivated denialism br br br Nakba denialism br br Nakba denial refers to attempts to downgrade deny and misdescribe the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians during the Nakba in which four fifths of all Palestinians were driven off their lands and into exile br br br Srebrenica massacre denialism br br Sonja Biserko president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and Edina Be irevi the Faculty of Criminalistics Criminology and Security Studies of the University of Sarajevo have pointed to a culture of denial of the Srebrenica massacre in Serbian society taking many forms and present in particular in political discourse the media the law and the educational system br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br
