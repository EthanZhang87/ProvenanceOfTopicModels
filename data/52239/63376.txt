Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh October April was an English writer of novels biographies and travel books he was also a prolific journalist and book reviewer His most famous works include the early satires Decline and Fall and A Handful of Dust the novel Brideshead Revisited and the Second World War trilogy Sword of Honour He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the th century br Waugh was the son of a publisher educated at Lancing College and then at Hertford College Oxford He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full time writer As a young man he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for country house society br He travelled extensively in the s often as a special newspaper correspondent he reported from Abyssinia at the time of the Italian invasion Waugh served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction generally to humorous effect Waugh s detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early s br Waugh converted to Catholicism in after his first marriage failed His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church and the changes by the Second Vatican Council greatly disturbed his sensibilities especially the introduction of the vernacular Mass That blow to his religious traditionalism his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health all darkened his final years but he continued to write He displayed to the world a mask of indifference but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends After his death in he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited br br Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh was born on October to Arthur Waugh and Catherine Charlotte Raban into a family with English Scottish Welsh Irish and Huguenot origins Distinguished relatives included Lord Cockburn a leading Scottish advocate and judge William Morgan a pioneer of actuarial science who served The Equitable Life Assurance Society for years and Philip Henry Gosse a natural scientist who became notorious through his depiction as a religious fanatic in his son Edmund s memoir Father and Son Among ancestors bearing the Waugh name the Rev Alexander Waugh was a minister in the Secession Church of Scotland who helped found the London Missionary Society and was one of the leading Nonconformist preachers of his day His grandson Alexander Waugh was a country medical practitioner who bullied his wife and children and became known in the Waugh family as the Brute The elder of Alexander s two sons born in was Evelyn s father Arthur Waugh br After attending Sherborne School and New College Oxford Arthur Waugh began a career in publishing and as a literary critic In he became managing director of Chapman and Hall publishers of the works of Charles Dickens He had married Catherine Raban in their first son Alexander Raban Waugh always known as Alec was born on July Alec Waugh later became a novelist of note At the time of his birth the family were living in North London at Hillfield Road West Hampstead where on October the couple s second son was born in great haste before Dr Andrews could arrive Catherine recorded On January the boy was christened Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh but was known in the family and in the wider world as Evelyn br br In the Waugh family left Hillfield Road for Underhill a house which Arthur had built in North End Road Hampstead close to Golders Green then a semi rural area of dairy farms market gardens and bluebell woods Evelyn received his first school lessons at home from his mother with whom he formed a particularly close relationship his father Arthur Waugh was a more distant figure whose close bond with his elder son Alec was such that Evelyn often felt excluded In September Evelyn began as a day pupil at Heath Mount preparatory school By then he was a lively boy of many interests who already had written and completed The Curse of the Horse Race his first story A positive influence on his writing was a schoolmaster Aubrey Ensor Waugh spent six relatively contented years at Heath Mount on his own assertion he was quite a clever little boy who was seldom distressed or overawed by his lessons Physically pugnacious Evelyn was inclined to bully weaker boys among his victims was the future society photographer Cecil Beaton who never forgot the experience br Outside school he and other neighbourhood children performed plays usually written by Waugh On the basis of the xenophobia fostered by the genre books of Invasion literature that the Germans were about to invade Britain Waugh organised his friends into the Pistol Troop who built a fort went on man uvres and paraded in makeshift uniforms In after the First World War began Waugh and other boys from the Boy Scout Troop of Heath Mount School were sometimes employed as messengers at the War Office Evelyn loitered about the War Office in hope of glimpsing Lord Kitchener but never did br Family holidays usually were spent with the Waugh aunts at Midsomer Norton in Somerset in a house lit with oil lamps a time that Waugh recalled with delight many years later At Midsomer Norton Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life and he served as an altar boy at the local Anglican church During his last year at Heath Mount Waugh established and edited The Cynic school magazine br br Like his father before him Alec Waugh went to school at Sherborne It was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow but in the school asked Evelyn s older brother Alec to leave after a homosexual relationship came to light Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer and while awaiting confirmation of his commission wrote The Loom of Youth a novel of school life which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne The public sensation caused by Alec s novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there In May much to his annoyance he was sent to Lancing College in his opinion a decidedly inferior school br Waugh soon overcame his initial aversion to Lancing settled in and established his reputation as an aesthete In November his essay In Defence of Cubism was accepted by and published in the arts magazine Drawing and Design it was his first published article Within the school he became mildly subversive mocking the school s cadet corps and founding the Corpse Club for those who were bored stiff The end of the war saw the return to the school of younger masters such as J F Roxburgh who encouraged Waugh to write and predicted a great future for him Another mentor Francis Crease taught Waugh the arts of calligraphy and decorative design some of the boy s work was good enough to be used by Chapman and Hall on book jackets br In his later years at Lancing Waugh achieved success as a house captain editor of the school magazine and president of the debating society and won numerous art and literature prizes He also shed most of his religious beliefs He started a novel of school life untitled but abandoned the effort after writing around words He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College Oxford and left Lancing in December br br Waugh arrived in Oxford in January He was soon writing to old friends at Lancing about the pleasures of his new life he informed Tom Driberg I do no work here and never go to Chapel During his first two terms he generally followed convention he smoked a pipe bought a bicycle and gave his maiden speech at the Oxford Union opposing the motion that This House would welcome Prohibition Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines Cherwell and Isis and he acted as a film critic for Isis He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society an onerous but not honorific post he told Driberg Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship as a reward for past efforts rather than a stepping stone to future academic success he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his History Previous an essential preliminary examination br The arrival in Oxford in October of the sophisticated Etonians Harold Acton and Brian Howard changed Waugh s Oxford life Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an avant garde circle known as the Hypocrites Club Waugh was the secretary of the club whose artistic social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically he later wrote It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life He began drinking heavily and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships the most lasting of which were with Hugh Lygon Richard Pares and Alastair Graham potentially the inspiration for the fictional character Lord Sebastian Flyte in the novel Brideshead Revisited though this is rather disputed and was most likely a blend of numerous individuals including Stephen Tennant br He continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist but formal study largely ceased This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor C R M F Cruttwell dean and later principal of Hertford College When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways Waugh responded in a manner which he admitted later was fatuously haughty from then on relations between the two descended into mutual hatred Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell s name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous ignominious or odious minor characters br Waugh s dissipated lifestyle continued into his final Oxford year A letter written that year to a Lancing friend Dudley Carew hints at severe emotional pressures I have been living very intensely these last three weeks For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of with a third class However as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the academic year Waugh had completed only eight terms residence when he sat his finals rather than the nine required under the university s statutes His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term so he left without his degree br Back at home Waugh began a novel The Temple at Thatch and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film The Scarlet Woman which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham after Graham departed for Kenya Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school Heatherley s br br Waugh began at Heatherley s in late September but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job Almost at once he secured a post at Arnold House a boys preparatory school in North Wales beginning in January He took with him the notes for his novel The Temple at Thatch intending to work on it in his spare time Despite the gloomy ambience of the school Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation br In the summer of Waugh s outlook briefly improved with the prospect of a job in Pisa Italy as secretary to the Scottish writer C K Scott Moncrieff who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust s works Believing that the job was his Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism Acton s reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript shortly afterwards before he left North Wales he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide He records that he went down to a nearby beach and leaving a note with his clothes walked out to sea An attack by jellyfish changed his mind and he returned quickly to the shore br During the following two years Waugh taught at schools in Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron and Notting Hill in London He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet making and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write A short story The Balance written in an experimental modernist style became his first commercially published fiction when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a anthology Georgian Stories An extended essay on the Pre Raphaelite Brotherhood was printed privately by Alastair Graham using by agreement the press of the Shakespeare Head Press in Stratford upon Avon where he was undergoing training as a printer This led to a contract from the publishers Duckworths for a full length biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti which Waugh wrote during He also began working on a comic novel after several temporary working titles this became Decline and Fall Having given up teaching he had no regular employment except for a short unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the Daily Express in April May That year he met possibly through his brother Alec and fell in love with Evelyn Gardner the daughter of Lord and Lady Burghclere br br In December Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company Among their friends they quickly became known as He Evelyn and She Evelyn Waugh was at this time dependent on a a week allowance equivalent to in from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April J C Squire in The Observer praised the book s elegance and wit Acton gave cautious approval and the novelist Rebecca West wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book Less pleasing to Waugh were the Times Literary Supplement s references to him as Miss Waugh br When Decline and Fall was completed Duckworths objected to its obscenity but Chapman Hall agreed to publish it This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans They were married in St Paul s Church Portman Square on June with only Acton Robert Byron Alec Waugh and the bride s friend Pansy Pakenham present The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square Islington The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money and by Gardner s poor health which persisted into the autumn br In September Decline and Fall was published to almost unanimous praise By December the book was into its third printing and the American publishing rights were sold for In the afterglow of his success Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free Mediterranean cruise which he and Gardner began in February as an extended delayed honeymoon The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said The couple returned home in June after her recovery A month later without warning Gardner confessed that their mutual friend John Heygate had become her lover After an attempted reconciliation failed a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on September The couple apparently met again only once during the process for the annulment of their marriage a few years later br br Waugh s first biographer Christopher Sykes records that after the divorce friends saw or believed they saw a new hardness and bitterness in Waugh s outlook Nevertheless despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live he soon resumed his professional and social life He finished his second novel Vile Bodies and wrote articles including ironically he thought one for the Daily Mail on the meaning of the marriage ceremony During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends he was to have no settled home for the next eight years br Vile Bodies a satire on the Bright Young People of the s was published on January and was Waugh s first major commercial success Despite its quasi biblical title the book is dark bitter a manifesto of disillusionment according to biographer Martin Stannard As a best selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism Amid regular work for The Graphic Town and Country and Harper s Bazaar he quickly wrote Labels a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She Evelyn br br On September Waugh was received into the Catholic Church This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends but he had contemplated the step for some time He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford but there are references in his diaries from the mid s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing On December Waugh wrote Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until in the morning arguing about the Roman Church The entry for February includes I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson Throughout the period Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket Greene who had converted in and of whom Waugh later wrote She bullied me into the Church It was she who led him to Father Martin D Arcy a Jesuit who persuaded Waugh on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion that the Christian revelation was genuine In Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was unintelligible and unendurable without God br br On October Waugh representing several newspapers departed for Abyssinia to cover the coronation of Haile Selassie He reported the event as an elaborate propaganda effort to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means A subsequent journey through the British East Africa colonies and the Belgian Congo formed the basis of two books the travelogue Remote People and the comic novel Black Mischief Waugh s next extended trip in the winter of was to British Guiana now Guyana in South America possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite Teresa Jungman On arrival in Georgetown Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior He travelled on via several staging posts to Boa Vista in Brazil and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books his travel account Ninety two Days and the novel A Handful of Dust both published in br Back from South America Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and blasphemy from the Catholic journal The Tablet which objected to passages in Black Mischief He defended himself in an open letter to the Archbishop of Westminster Cardinal Francis Bourne which remained unpublished until In the summer of he went on an expedition to Spitsbergen in the Arctic an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use On his return determined to write a major Catholic biography he selected the Jesuit martyr Edmund Campion as his subject The book published in caused controversy by its forthright pro Catholic anti Protestant stance but brought its writer the Hawthornden Prize He returned to Abyssinia in August to report the opening stages of the Second Italo Abyssinian War for the Daily Mail Waugh on the basis of his earlier visit considered Abyssinia a savage place which Mussolini was doing well to tame according to his fellow reporter William Deedes Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent Deedes remarks on the older writer s snobbery None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home However in the face of imminent Italian air attacks Deedes found Waugh s courage deeply reassuring Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book Waugh in Abyssinia which Rose Macaulay dismissed as a fascist tract on account of its pro Italian tone A better known account is his novel Scoop in which the protagonist William Boot is loosely based on Deedes br Among Waugh s growing circle of friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness dedicatees of Vile Bodies Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper Nancy Mitford who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner s and the Lygon sisters Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford now he was introduced to the girls and their country house Madresfield Court which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering In on a Greek islands cruise he was introduced by Father D Arcy to Gabriel Herbert eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family s villa in Portofino where he first met Gabriel s year old sister Laura br br On his conversion Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive However he wanted a wife and children and in October he began proceedings for the annulment of the marriage on the grounds of lack of real consent The case was heard by an ecclesiastical tribunal in London but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until July In the meantime following their initial encounter in Portofino Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert He proposed marriage by letter in spring There were initial misgivings from the Herberts an aristocratic Catholic family as a further complication Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on April at the Church of the Assumption in Warwick Street London br As a wedding present the bride s grandmother bought the couple Piers Court a country house near Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire The couple had seven children one of whom died in infancy Their first child a daughter Maria Teresa was born on March and a son Auberon Alexander on November Between these events Scoop was published in May to wide critical acclaim In August Waugh with Laura made a three month trip to Mexico after which he wrote Robbery Under Law based on his experiences there In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo he later described the book as dealing little with travel and much with political questions br br Waugh left Piers Court on September at the outbreak of the Second World War and moved his young family to Pixton Park in Somerset the Herbert family s country seat while he sought military employment He also began writing a novel in a new style using first person narration but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base He never completed the novel fragments were eventually published as Work Suspended and Other Stories br Waugh s daily training routine left him with so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen In April he was temporarily promoted to captain and given command of a company of marines but he proved an unpopular officer being haughty and curt with his men Even after the German invasion of the Low Countries May June his battalion was not called into action Waugh s inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command and he became the battalion s Intelligence Officer In that role he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the Battle of Dakar in West Africa September in August to support an attempt by the Free French Forces to overthrow the Vichy French colonial government and install General Charles de Gaulle Operation Menace failed hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town s defences and the British forces withdrew on September Waugh s comment on the affair was this Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour br In November Waugh was posted to a commando unit and after further training became a member of Layforce under Colonel later Brigadier Robert Laycock In February the unit sailed to the Mediterranean where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Bardia on the Libyan coast In May Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of Crete Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and as he saw it the cowardice of the departing troops In July during the roundabout journey home by troop ship he wrote Put Out More Flags a novel of the war s early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the s Back in Britain more training and waiting followed until in May he was transferred to the Royal Horse Guards on Laycock s recommendation On June Laura gave birth to Margaret the couple s fourth child br br Waugh s elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service The death of his father on June and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of Operation Husky July August the Allied invasion of Sicily Despite his undoubted courage his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in Windsor Waugh began parachute training at Tatton Park Cheshire but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a fibula Recovering at Windsor he applied for three months unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind His request was granted and on January he departed for Chagford Devon where he could work in seclusion The result was Brideshead Revisited The Sacred Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer Douglas Lane Patey commented that it was the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation br Waugh managed to extend his leave until June Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by Randolph Churchill to serve in the Maclean Mission to Yugoslavia and early in July flew with Churchill from Bari Italy to the Croatian island of Vis There they met Marshal Tito the Communist leader of the Partisans who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission but their aeroplane crash landed both men were injured and their mission was delayed for a month br The mission eventually arrived at Topusko where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse The group s liaison duties between the British Army and the Communist Partisans were light Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist led Partisans and despised Tito His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia which he believed had suffered at the hands of the Serbian Orthodox Church and would fare worse when the Communists took control He expressed those thoughts in a long report Church and State in Liberated Croatia After spells in Dubrovnik and Rome Waugh returned to London on March to present his report which the Foreign Office suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito now the leader of communist Yugoslavia br br Brideshead Revisited was published in London in May Waugh had been convinced of the book s qualities my first novel rather than my last It was a tremendous success bringing its author fame fortune and literary status Happy though he was with this outcome Waugh s principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics betrayed as he saw it into the hands of Stalin s Soviet Union by the Allies He now saw little difference in morality between the war s combatants and later described it as a sweaty tug of war between teams of indistinguishable louts Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the general election he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new Dark Age br br In September after he was released by the army he returned to Piers Court with his family another daughter Harriet had been born at Pixton in but spent much of the next seven years either in London or travelling In March he visited the Nuremberg trials and later that year he was in Spain for a celebration of the th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria said to be the founder of international law Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella Scott King s Modern Europe In February he made the first of several trips to the United States in the first instance to discuss filming of Brideshead The project collapsed but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death The Loved One In he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer Christopher Sykes and in he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the th century Jesuit missionary priest Francis Xavier br In between his journeys Waugh worked intermittently on Helena a long planned novel about the discoverer of the True Cross that was by far the best book I have ever written or ever will write Its success with the public was limited but it was his daughter Harriet later said the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud br In Waugh published Men at Arms the first of his semi autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war Other books published during this period included When The Going Was Good an anthology of his pre war travel writing The Holy Places published by the Ian Fleming managed Queen Anne Press and Love Among the Ruins a dystopian tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world Nearing Waugh was old for his years selectively deaf rheumatic irascible and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression Two more children James born and Septimus born completed his family br From onwards Waugh became an avid collector of objects particularly Victorian paintings and furniture He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions often from London s Portobello Market and from house clearance sales His diary entry for August records a visit to Gloucester where he bought a lion of wood finely carved for also a bookcase a charming Chinese painting a Regency easel Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient he paid for Rossetti s Spirit of the Rainbow to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value Waugh also began from to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting br br By Waugh s popularity as a writer was declining He was perceived as out of step with the Zeitgeist and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy Officers and Gentlemen had stalled Partly because of his dependency on drugs his health was steadily deteriorating Shortage of cash led him to agree in November to be interviewed on BBC radio where the panel took an aggressive line they tried to make a fool of me and I don t think they entirely succeeded Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford Peter Fleming in The Spectator likened the interview to the goading of a bull by matadors br Early in Waugh s doctors concerned by his physical deterioration advised a change of scene On January he took a ship bound for Ceylon hoping that he would be able to finish his novel Within a few days he was writing home complaining of other passengers whispering about me and of hearing voices including that of his recent BBC interlocutor Stephen Black He left the ship in Egypt and flew on to Colombo but he wrote to Laura the voices followed him Alarmed Laura sought help from her friend Frances Donaldson whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home In fact Waugh made his own way back now believing that he was suffering from demonic possession A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from bromide poisoning from his drugs regimen When his medication was changed the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared Waugh was delighted informing all of his friends that he had been mad Clean off my onion The experience was fictionalised a few years later in The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold br In Edwin Newman made a short film about Waugh In the course of it Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication refused to drive or use the telephone and wrote with an old fashioned dip pen He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of whisky and that every American had been divorced at least once br br Restored to health Waugh returned to work and finished Officers and Gentlemen In June the Daily Express journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain accompanied by her friend Lord Noel Buxton arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for The Spectator but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court I felt it was polluted he told Nancy Mitford Late in the family moved to Combe Florey House in the Somerset village of Combe Florey In January Waugh avenged the Spain Noel Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the Express and Spain The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh s books were much lower than they were and that his worth as a journalist was low br Gilbert Pinfold was published in the summer of my barmy book Waugh called it The extent to which the story is self mockery rather than true autobiography became a subject of critical debate Waugh s next major book was a biography of his longtime friend Ronald Knox the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work delaying the third volume of his war trilogy In June his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in Cyprus Waugh remained detached he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter s return to Britain The critic and literary biographer David Wykes called Waugh s sang froid astonishing and the family s apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so br Although most of Waugh s books had sold well and he had been well rewarded for his journalism his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life In as a means of tax avoidance he had set up a trust fund for his children he termed it the Save the Children Fund after the well established charity of that name into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin paperback editions of his books He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it Nonetheless by shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television in the Face to Face series conducted by John Freeman The interview was broadcast on June according to his biographer Selina Hastings Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman assuming what she describes as a pose of world weary boredom br In Waugh was offered the honour of a CBE but declined believing that he should have been given the superior status of a knighthood In September he produced his final travel book A Tourist in Africa based on a visit made in January March He enjoyed the trip but despised the book The critic Cyril Connolly called it the thinnest piece of book making that Mr Waugh has undertaken The book done he worked on the last of the war trilogy which was published in as Unconditional Surrender br br As he approached his sixties Waugh was in poor health prematurely aged fat deaf short of breath according to Patey His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink In Waugh began work on his autobiography and that same year wrote his final fiction the long short story Basil Seal Rides Again This revival of the protagonist of Black Mischief and Put Out More Flags was published in the Times Literary Supplement called it a nasty little book However that same year he was awarded with the title Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature its highest honour When the first volume of autobiography A Little Learning was published in Waugh s often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared br Waugh had welcomed the accession in of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope s death in However he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council which was convened by Pope John in October and continued under his successor Pope Paul VI until Waugh a staunch opponent of Church reform was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal Latin Mass with the vernacular In a Spectator article of November he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as sharp edged reasonableness He wrote to Nancy Mitford that the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me We write letters to the paper A fat lot of good that does br In a new financial crisis arose from an apparent flaw in the terms of the Save the Children trust and a large sum of back tax was being demanded Waugh s agent A D Peters negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount but in his concern to generate funds Waugh signed contracts to write several books including a history of the papacy an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography Waugh s physical and mental deterioration prevented any work on these projects and the contracts were cancelled He described himself as toothless deaf melancholic shaky on my pins unable to eat full of dope quite idle and expressed the belief that all fates were worse than death His only significant literary activity in was the editing of the three war novels into a single volume published as Sword of Honour br On Easter Day April after attending a Latin Mass in a neighbouring village with members of his family Waugh died of heart failure at his Combe Florey home aged He was buried by special arrangement in a consecrated plot outside the Anglican churchyard of the Church of St Peter St Paul Combe Florey A Requiem Mass in Latin was celebrated in Westminster Cathedral on April br br In the course of his lifetime Waugh made enemies and offended many people writer James Lees Milne said that Waugh was the nastiest tempered man in England Waugh s son Auberon said that the force of his father s personality was such that despite his lack of height generals and chancellors of the exchequer six foot six and exuding self importance from every pore quail ed in front of him br In the biographic Mad World Paula Byrne said that the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a snobbish misanthrope is a caricature she asks Why would a man who was so unpleasant be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends His generosity to individual persons and causes especially Catholic causes extended to small gestures after his libel court victory over Nancy Spain he sent her a bottle of champagne Hastings said that Waugh s outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity Besides mocking others Waugh mocked himself the elderly buffer crusty colonel image which he presented in later life was a comic impersonation and not his true self br br As an instinctive conservative Waugh believed that class divisions with inequalities of wealth and position were natural and that no form of government was ordained by God as being better than any other In the post war Age of the Common Man he attacked socialism the Cripps Attlee terror and complained after Churchill s election in that the Conservative Party have never put the clock back a single second Waugh never voted in elections in he expressed a hope that the Conservatives would win the election which they did but would not vote for them saying I should feel I was morally inculpated in their follies and added I do not aspire to advise my sovereign in her choice of servants br Waugh s Catholicism was fundamental The Church is the normal state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves He believed that the Catholic Church was the last great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the welfare state and the spreading of working class culture Strictly observant Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men When Nancy Mitford asked him how he reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian Waugh replied that were he not a Christian he would be even more horrible br Waugh s conservatism was aesthetic as well as political and religious Although he praised younger writers such as Angus Wilson Muriel Spark and V S Naipaul he was scornful of the s writers group known as The Movement He said that the literary world was sinking into black disaster and that literature might die within thirty years As a schoolboy Waugh had praised Cubism but he soon abandoned his interest in artistic Modernism In Waugh said that Pablo Picasso s artistic standing was the result of a mesmeric trick and that his paintings could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised masters In in a radio interview he named Augustus Egg as a painter for whom he had particular esteem Despite their political differences Waugh came to admire George Orwell because of their shared patriotism and sense of morality Orwell in turn commented that Waugh was about as good a novelist as one can be while holding untenable opinions br Waugh has been criticised for expressing racial and anti semitic prejudices Wykes describes Waugh s anti semitism as his most persistently noticeable nastiness and his assumptions of white superiority as an illogical extension of his views on the naturalness and rightness of hierarchy as the principle of social organization br br Wykes observes that Waugh s novels reprise and fictionalise the principal events of his life although in an early essay Waugh wrote Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to assume that he is incapable of anything but the mere transcription of what he observes The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters Nevertheless in the Introduction to the Complete Short Stories Ann Pasternak Slater said that the delineation of social prejudices and the language in which they are expressed is part of Waugh s meticulous observation of his contemporary world br The critic Clive James said of Waugh Nobody ever wrote a more unaffectedly elegant English its hundreds of years of steady development culminate in him As his talent developed and matured he maintained what literary critic Andrew Michael Roberts called an exquisite sense of the ludicrous and a fine aptitude for exposing false attitudes In the first stages of his year writing career before his conversion to Catholicism in Waugh was the novelist of the Bright Young People generation His first two novels Decline and Fall and Vile Bodies comically reflect a futile society populated by two dimensional basically unbelievable characters in circumstances too fantastic to evoke the reader s emotions A typical Waugh trademark evident in the early novels is rapid unattributed dialogue in which the participants can be readily identified At the same time Waugh was writing serious essays such as The War and the Younger Generation in which he castigates his own generation as crazy and sterile people br Waugh s conversion to Catholicism did not noticeably change the nature of his next two novels Black Mischief and A Handful of Dust but in the latter novel the elements of farce are subdued and the protagonist Tony Last is recognisably a person rather than a comic cipher Waugh s first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story Out of Depth about the immutability of the Mass From the mid s onwards Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with Scoop a novel about journalism journalists and unsavoury journalistic practices br In Work Suspended and Other Stories Waugh introduced real characters and a first person narrator signalling the literary style he would adopt in Brideshead Revisited a few years later Brideshead which questions the meaning of human existence without God is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views In the Life magazine article Fan Fare Waugh said that you can only leave God out of fiction by making your characters pure abstractions and that his future novels shall be the attempt to represent man more fully which to me means only one thing man in his relation to God As such the novel Helena is Evelyn Waugh s most philosophically Christian book br In Brideshead the proletarian junior officer Hooper illustrates a theme that persists in Waugh s postwar fiction the rise of mediocrity in the Age of the Common Man In the trilogy Sword of Honour Men at Arms Officers and Gentlemen Unconditional Surrender the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi comical character Trimmer a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance In the novella Scott King s Modern Europe Waugh s pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster s admonition I think it would be very wicked indeed to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world Likewise such cynicism pervades the novel Love Among the Ruins set in a dystopian welfare state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought after of the government s social services Of the postwar novels Patey says that The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold stands out a kind of mock novel a sly invitation to a game Waugh s final work of fiction Basil Seal Rides Again features characters from the prewar novels Waugh admitted that the work was a senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story The Balance of with a fusillade of unattributed dialogue br br Of Waugh s early books Decline and Fall was hailed by Arnold Bennett in the Evening Standard as an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire The critical reception of Vile Bodies two years later was even more enthusiastic with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was destined to be the dazzling figure of his age However A Handful of Dust later widely regarded as a masterpiece received a more muted welcome from critics despite the author s own high estimation of the work Chapter VI Du C t de Chez Todd of A Handful of Dust with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor was thought by the critic Henry Yorke to reduce an otherwise believable book to phantasy Cyril Connolly s first reaction to the book was that Waugh s powers were failing an opinion that he later revised br In the later s Waugh s inclination to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his standing with the general reading public The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be so rigidly biased that it has no claims to make as history The pro fascist tone in parts of Waugh in Abyssinia offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America There was general relief among critics when Scoop in indicated a return to Waugh s earlier comic style Critics had begun to think that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda br Waugh maintained his reputation in with Put Out More Flags which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing Its public reception however did not compare with that accorded to Brideshead Revisited three years later on both sides of the Atlantic Brideshead s selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain which was affected by paper shortages Despite the public s enthusiasm critical opinion was split Brideshead s Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh s earlier novels with warm praise Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by among others Conor Cruise O Brien who in the Irish literary magazine The Bell wrote of Waugh s almost mystical veneration for the upper classes Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh s genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right wing partisan alter ego and that he had lost his detachment In art so naturally ironic and detached as his this is a serious loss Conversely the book was praised by Yorke Graham Greene and in glowing terms by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of s Oxford In at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book br In Fan Fare Waugh forecasts that his future books will be unpopular because of their religious theme On publication in Helena was received indifferently by the public and by critics who disparaged the awkward mixing of th century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose Otherwise Waugh s prediction proved unfounded all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy During his successful lawsuit against the Daily Express Waugh s counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books two thirds in Britain and the rest in America Men at Arms the first volume of his war trilogy won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in initial critical comment was lukewarm with Connolly likening Men at Arms to beer rather than champagne Connolly changed his view later calling the completed trilogy the finest novel to come out of the war Of Waugh s other major postwar works the Knox biography was admired within Waugh s close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy The book did not sell well like warm cakes according to Waugh Pinfold surprised the critics by its originality Its plainly autobiographical content Hastings suggests gave the public a fixed image of Waugh stout splenetic red faced and reactionary a figure from burlesque complete with cigar bowler hat and loud checked suit br br In Waugh s diaries were serialised in The Observer prior to publication in book form in The revelations about his private life thoughts and attitudes created controversy Although Waugh had removed embarrassing entries relating to his Oxford years and his first marriage there was sufficient left on the record to enable enemies to project a negative image of the writer as intolerant snobbish and sadistic with pronounced fascist leanings Some of this picture it was maintained by Waugh s supporters arose from poor editing of the diaries and a desire to transform Waugh from a writer to a character Nevertheless a popular conception developed of Waugh as a monster When in a selection of his letters was published his reputation became the subject of further discussion Philip Larkin reviewing the collection in The Guardian thought that it demonstrated Waugh s elitism to receive a letter from him it seemed one would have to have a nursery nickname and be a member of White s a Roman Catholic a high born lady or an Old Etonian novelist br br The publication of the diaries and letters promoted increased interest in Waugh and his works and caused publication of much new material Christopher Sykes s biography had appeared in between and three more full biographies were issued and other biographical and critical studies have continued to be produced A collection of Waugh s journalism and reviews was published in revealing a fuller range of his ideas and beliefs The new material provided further grounds for debate between Waugh s supporters and detractors br The Granada Television adaptation of Brideshead Revisited introduced a new generation to Waugh s works in Britain and in America There had been earlier television treatment of Waugh s fiction as Sword of Honour had been serialised by the BBC in but the impact of Granada s Brideshead was much wider Its nostalgic depiction of a vanished form of Englishness appealed to the American mass market Time magazine s TV critic described the series as a novel made into a poem and listed it among the Best TV Shows of All Time There have been further cinematic Waugh adaptations A Handful of Dust in Vile Bodies filmed as Bright Young Things in and Brideshead Revisited again in These popular treatments have maintained the public s appetite for Waugh s novels all of which remain in print and continue to sell Several have been listed among various compiled lists of the world s greatest novels br Stannard concludes that beneath his public mask Waugh was a dedicated artist and a man of earnest faith struggling against the dryness of his soul Graham Greene in a letter to The Times shortly after Waugh s death acknowledged him as the greatest novelist of my generation while Time magazine s obituarist called him the grand old mandarin of modern British prose and asserted that his novels will continue to survive as long as there are readers who can savor what critic V S Pritchett calls the beauty of his malice Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes Everything
