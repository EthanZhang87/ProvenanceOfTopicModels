id: 31064369
Informatized warfare of China is the implementation of information warfare IW within the People s Liberation Army PLA and other organizations affiliated or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party CCP Laid out in the Chinese Defence White Paper of informatized warfare includes the utilization of information based weapons and forces including battlefield management systems precision strike capabilities and technology assisted command and control C ISR However some media and analyst reports also uses the term to describe propaganda and influence operations efforts of the Chinese state br br br Definitions br The People s Liberation Army PLA defines the term informatization to describe the implementation of information technology in the digital age and as an evaluation criteria of its military modernization effort The Central Military Commission aims to transform PLA from conducting people s war to engage in warfare conditions of informatization which includes moving the military doctrine from weapon platform centric to cyber centric The indicated characteristic of the cyber centric force is the utilization of network linkages data link among platforms br Eric C Anderson and Jeffrey G Engstrom define informationization and informatized warfare in Chinese military doctrine as follows A t the operational level appears focused on providing an integrated platform for joint war zone command control communications computer intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance C ISR connectivity and for peacetime command and control C within the PLA s Military Regions br The United States Defense Intelligence Agency DIA defines China s informatized warfare as similar to U S military s concept of net centric capability which means the military s capability to use advanced information technology and communications systems to gain operational advantage over an adversary br In the father of Chinese information warfare Major General Wang Pufeng wrote Information war is a crucial stage of high tech war At its heart are information technologies fusing intelligence war strategic war electronic war guided missile war a war of motorization jidong zhan a war of firepower huoli a total war It is a new type of warfare br In two articles in the People s Liberation Army Daily of and June Senior Colonel Wang Baocun and Li Fei of the Academy of Military Science noted several definitions They concluded br br We hold that information warfare has both narrow and broad meanings Information warfare in the narrow sense refers to the U S military s so called battlefield information warfare the crux of which is command and control warfare It is defined as the comprehensive use with intelligence support of military deception operational secrecy psychological warfare electronic warfare and substantive destruction to assault the enemy s whole information system including personnel and to disrupt the enemy s information flow in order to impact weaken and destroy the enemy s command and control capability while keeping one s own command and control capability from being affected by similar enemy actions br They went on to state br br The essential substance of information warfare in the narrow sense is made up of five major elements and two general areas br The five major elements are br br Substantive destruction the use of hard weapons to destroy enemy headquarters command posts and command and control C information centers br Electronic warfare the use of electronic means of jamming or the use of antiradiation electromagnetic weapons to attack enemy information and intelligence collection systems such as communications and radar br Military deception the use of operations such as tactical feints simulated attacks to shield or deceive enemy intelligence collection systems br Operational secrecy the use of all means to maintain secrecy and keep the enemy from collecting intelligence on our operations br Psychological warfare the use of TV radio and leaflets to undermine the enemy s military morale br The two general areas are information protection defense and information attack offense br br Information defense means preventing the destruction of one s own information systems ensuring that these systems can perform their normal functions In future wars key information and information systems will become combat priorities the key targets of enemy attack br Information offense means attacking enemy information systems Its aims are destroying or jamming enemy information sources to undermine or weaken enemy C C capability and cutting off the enemy s whole operational system The key targets of information offense are the enemy s combat command control and coordination intelligence and global information systems A successful information offensive requires three prerequisites br the capability to understand the enemy s information systems and the establishment of a corresponding database system br diverse and effective means of attack and br the capability to make battle damage assessments BDA of attacked targets br A July conference held in San Diego sponsored jointly by the RAND Center for Asia Pacific Policy and the Taiwan based Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies brought together Chinese military experts to discuss the non hardware side of the People s Liberation Army s modernization In his presentation James C Mulvenon stated Chinese writings clearly suggest that IW is a solely military subject and as such they draw inspiration primarily from U S military writings The net result of this borrowing is that many PLA authors definitions of IW and IW concepts sound eerily familiar br In December Xie Guang the then Vice Minister of Science Technology and Industry for National Defence defined IW as br br IW in military sense means overall use of various types of information technologies equipment and systems particularly his command systems to shake determination of enemy s policy makers and at the same time the use of all the means possible to ensure that that one s own systems are not damaged or disturbed br In a strategic analysis paper for the Indian Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses written in Vinod Anand examines the definitions of Chinese Information Warfare He notes that although Chinese understanding of IW was initially based on western concepts it has increasingly moved towards evolving its own orientation br br br Background and characteristics br br China s interest in information warfare began after the United States victory in the first Gulf War U S success was the result of information technologies and the total dominance it was able to provide in the battle space From that point forward the PLA began to seriously invest in and develop its own concepts of information warfare and what they mean to China br As a result of technological advancement China has now entered an era where informationization can be applied to military domains br China s White Paper on National Defense outlines the importance of informationization br br The PLA aiming at building an informationalised force and winning an information war deepens its reforms dedicates itself to innovation improves its quality and actively pushes forward the RMA with Chinese characteristics with informationalization at its core br The U S Department of Defense s Annual Report to Congress on Military Power of the br People s Republic of China defines local wars under conditions of informationization as high intensity and short duration fighting against high technology adversaries capable of fighting and winning short duration high intensity conflicts along its periphery against high tech adversaries Additionally local war under informationization is an effort which seeks to fully develop and link land air sea space and the electromagnetic spectrum into one system China s military strategy is focused on fighting and winning informationized local wars br China s leadership has continuously stressed using asymmetric techniques to counter more powerful nations such as the United States and information warfare is a tool that the PLA uses to achieve their goals In a paper in the U S Military Review T L Thomas examines the writings of Major General Dai Qingmin Director of the PLA s Communications Department of the General Staff responsible for IW and IO Senior Colonel Wang Baocun of the PLA s Academy of Military Sciences and others on the ways that China is employing Electronic Strategies to realise the benefits of asymmetric warfare Thomas also summarises the April issue of the Chinese journal China Military Science which contains three articles on information warfare subjects The only article written in English The Current Revolution in Military Affairs and its Impact on Asia Pacific Security by Senior Colonel Wang Baocun presents a quite different approach to an article Wang Baocun wrote only three years previously where he presented a description of IW which contained the elements of Soviet Russian military science br In the article On Information Warfare Strategies by Major General Niu Li Colonel Li Jiangzhou and Major Xu Dehui of the Communications and Command Institute the authors define IW stratagems as schemes and methods devised and used by commanders and commanding bodies to seize and maintain information supremacy on the basis of using clever methods to prevail at a relatively small cost in information warfare br In the CCP approved the three warfares strategy for the PLA which involves using public opinion or media warfare psychological warfare and legal warfare lawfare br While China has adopted the idea of information dominance its method for going about information dominance differs using ancient political warfare methods such as the Thirty Six Stratagems The PLA has also increasingly stressed an operational concept called cognitive domain operations br On the defensive side China employs a combination of legal policies and information technology for censorship and surveillance of dissenters in a program called Golden Shield This is often referred to as the Great Firewall of China China promotes the idea of national cyber sovereignty which Xi Jinping has described as the avoidance of cyber hegemony and the idea that countries should respect each other s national security in cyberspace br br br Information operations br Pro China disinformation campaigns in showed greater sophistication compared to It has been difficult to attribute with certainty whether Chinese state actors are behind these actions br br br COVID br br Disinformation campaigns sought to downplay the emergence of COVID in China and manipulate information about its spread around the world In January Google stated that it shut down more than accounts promoting disinformation about COVID Taiwan and U S politics The campaign is believed to be linked to Chinese public relations firm Shanghai Haixun Technology Co Haixun has planted pro Beijing stories in dozens of American news outlets online br br br Taiwan br br The PRC seeks unification with Taiwan and uses information operations sometimes referred to as information war as an important part of that work Despite the large resource outlay the Chinese have been relatively ineffective in influencing the Taiwanese public According to James C Mulvenon rather than risk failure of a militarily forced unification which could lead to international recognition of the independence of Taiwan PRC leadership could potentially use computer network operations to undermine the will of Taiwan by attacking Taiwanese infrastructure br In Taiwan s Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau revealed that it had identified more than social media accounts being used to push disinformation to Taiwanese citizens as part of Chinese content farms In the Investigation Bureau announced that it was monitoring for money laundering undertaken in an effort to finance election interference in Taiwan br During the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan Taiwanese officials accused the PLA of engaging in information warfare with claims of military exercises close to Penghu br br br United States br br The Chinese Communist Party CCP has been carrying out propaganda against the West since the s spreading its ideology and creating division among the population Its foreign directed propaganda has been known to back far left political activists and radical feminism br Using a variety of methods the PRC has recruited American agents of influence to advocate for Chinese interests in the United States While many of these agents of influence serve China unwittingly they can be very effective A Congressional report found that the Chinese Government continues to seek influence in Congress through various means including inviting Congressional members to visit the PRC lobbying ethnic Chinese voters and prominent U S citizens and engaging U S business interests to weigh in on issues of mutual concern br China also uses its vast market as leverage in order to persuade American companies to lobby for Chinese interests This is especially true of companies that deal in high technology or dual use technology as there are significant export controls placed on such technology According to the Cox Report Executives wishing to do business in the PRC share a mutual commercial interest with the PRC in minimizing export controls on dual use and military related technologies The PRC has displayed a willingness to exploit this mutuality of interest in several notoriously public cases by inducing VIPs from large U S companies to lobby on behalf of initiatives such as export liberalization on which they are aligned with the PRC br Chinese government information operations have also attempted to co opt local NIMBY sentiment to drive opposition against perceived economic threats such as the development projects that compete with the rare earth industry in China br In Network Contagion reported that several member organizations of the pro Palestinian movement Shut It Down for Palestine SID P are linked to what it calls the Singham Network under Neville Roy Singham who has close ties to the CCP according to Network Contagion The report accuses the Singham Network of stoking unrest at the grassroot level and amplifying the voice of SID P and says that at least one member of SID P has ties to extremist groups with anti American anti Israel and anti Jewish agendas br br br U S elections br Through its agents in America the PRC has financed a number of political candidates Katrina Leung a Chinese spy contributed to the campaign of Richard Riordan the former mayor of Los Angeles When he lost his primary to Bill Simon Jr Leung contributed to Simon s campaign At the direction of her Chinese handlers Leung also contributed to the campaign of George H W Bush It is estimated that Leung donated around to politicians in the s on behalf of the PRC br A report by the Government Accountability Institute cites other examples It was discovered that officers from the Chinese Embassy in Washington D C sought to direct contributions from foreign sources to the Democratic National Committee before the presidential campaign While these allegations have been denied by the PRC Secret communications between Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington establish that the influence buying plan was government sanctioned br In People s Liberation Army intelligence officer Gen Ji Shengde provided Johnny Chung a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee with to donate towards President Bill Clinton s reelection Chung visited the White House over fifty times during the presidential campaign and was responsible for over of contributions to the DNC br In September Meta Platforms removed fake accounts linked to a China based influence operation ahead of the United States elections In the run up to the United States elections the Ministry of Public Security s Spamouflage influence operation was identified as having used fake social media accounts in an attempt to amplify divisions in US society br br br Russian invasion of Ukraine br br During the Russian invasion of Ukraine state news agency Xinhua and other Chinese state media outlets paid for digital ads on Facebook amplifying pro Kremlin disinformation and propaganda after Meta Platforms banned Russian state media advertisement buys In March China Global Television Network repeated unsubstantiated Russian claims of biological weapons labs in Ukraine The CCP owned tabloid Global Times also echoed Russian state media claims that the Bucha massacre was staged br br br Other regions br The Times of India reported that during the Doklam standoff China used information operations against India br In Facebook took down a network of inauthentic accounts that according to Graphika were attributed to individuals in China The information campaign focused on politics in Southeast Asia and was dubbed Operation Naval Gazing by security researchers br br br Other platforms br In June Twitter shut down primary accounts and approximately booster accounts which were being used by China to conduct an information operation aimed at boosting China s global position during the COVID outbreak as well as attacking traditional targets such as Hong Kong pro democracy activists Guo Wengui and Taiwan Twitter said that the accounts had pushed deceptive narratives and spread propaganda br In Google removed over YouTube accounts linked to China Most of them uploaded spam like content unrelated to politics but a subset posted content primarily in Chinese about COVID and racial protests in the United States br br br See also br Chinese intelligence
