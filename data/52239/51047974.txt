title: Post-truth politics
id: 51047974
Post truth politics also described as post factual politics or post reality politics amidst varying academic and dictionary definitions of the term refer to a recent historical period where political culture is marked by public anxiety about what claims can be publicly accepted facts br It suggests that the public not scientific or philosophical distinction between truth and falsity as well as honesty and lying have become a focal concern of public life and are viewed by popular commentators and academic researchers alike as having a consequential role in how politics operates in the early st century It is regarded as especially being influenced by the arrival of new communication and media technologies Popularized as a term in news media and a dictionary definition post truth has developed from a short hand label for the abundance and influence of misleading or false political claims into a concept empirically studied and theorized by academic research Oxford Dictionaries declared that its international word of the year in was post truth citing a fold increase in usage compared to and noted that it was commonly associated with the noun post truth politics br Since post truth politics are primarily known through public statements in specific media contexts such as commentary on major broadcasting networks podcasts YouTube videos and social media it is especially studied as a media and communication studies phenomenon with particular forms of truth telling including intentional rumors lies conspiracy theories and fake news In the context of media and politics it often involves the manipulation of information or the spread of misinformation to shape public perceptions and advance political agendas Deceptive communication d isinformation rumor bombs and fake news have mass communication era antecedents in both war and security gray propaganda and commercial communication advertising and public relations All can be said to be forms of strategic communication and not mere accidental or innocent misstatements of facts Deceptive political communication is timeless br However distrust in major social institutions political parties government news media and social media along with the fact that anyone today can create and circulate content that has generic characteristics of news fake news creates the conditions for post truth politics Distrust is also politically polarized where those identifying with one political party dislike and don t trust those of another Distrust becomes the bearer of post truth politics since citizens cannot at first hand verify claims about things happening in the world and don t usually have expert knowledge about subjects being reported factually they are faced with the choice of trusting news providers and other public truth tellers For this reason some scholars have argued that post truth does not at all refer to a sense that facts are irrelevant but to a public anxiety about the status of publicly accepted facts on which democracy can function br As of political commentators and academic researchers have identified post truth politics as ascendant in many nations notably Australia Brazil India Ghana Russia the United Kingdom and the United States among others br br br History of terminology br The term post truth politics appears to have developed from other adjectival uses of post truth such as post truth political environment post truth world post truth era post truth society and very close cousins such as post fact society and post truth presidency According to Oxford Dictionaries the Serbian American playwright Steve Tesich may have been the first to use the term post truth in a essay in The Nation Tesich writes that following the shameful truth of Watergate more assuaging coverage of the Iran Contra scandal and Persian Gulf War demonstrates that we as a free people have freely decided that we want to live in some post truth world However as Harsin notes the term was in academic circulation in the s The media studies scholar John Hartley used the term post truth as the title of a chapter Journalism in a Post truth Society in his book The Politics of Pictures br In Ralph Keyes used the term post truth era in his book by that title In it he argued that deception is becoming more prevalent in the current media driven world According to Keyes lies stopped being treated as something inexcusable and started being viewed as something acceptable in certain situations which supposedly led to the beginning of the post truth era The same year American journalist Eric Alterman spoke of a post truth political environment and coined the term the post truth presidency in his analysis of the misleading statements made by the Bush administration after in More specifically the American academic Moustafa Bayoumi argued that it was the Iraq War that ushered in the post truth era and that the United States is to blame Bayoumi believes that there existed differences compared to the times for example of the Spanish American War and of the Gulf of Tonkin incident Starting from through the formation of the Office of Special Plans and supported by the neocons noble lie ideology the greatest difference from previous time periods of all existed and the apparatus of lying became institutionalized In his book Post democracy Colin Crouch used the term post democracy to mean a model of politics where elections certainly exist and can change governments but public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams Crouch directly attributes the advertising industry model of political communication to the crisis of trust and accusations of dishonesty that a few years later others have associated with post truth politics More recently scholars have followed Crouch in demonstrating the role of professional political communication s contribution to distrust and wrong beliefs where strategic use of emotion is becoming key to gaining trust for truth statements br The term post truth politics may have originally been coined by the blogger David Roberts in a blog post for Grist on April Roberts defined it as a political culture in which politics public opinion and media narratives have become almost entirely disconnected from policy the substance of legislation Post truth was used by philosopher Joseph Heath to describe the Ontario election The term became widespread during the campaigns for the presidential election in the United States and for the Brexit referendum on membership in the European Union in the United Kingdom br br br Concepts br Information disorder has been proposed as an umbrella term for the wide variety of poor or false information being used for political purposes in post truth politics br br br Post truth br Scholars and popular commentators disagree about whether post truth is a label that is newly generated but can be applied to phenomena such as lying in any historical period or whether it is historically specific with empirically more recent observable causes especially new social and political relations enabled by new digital communication technologies and is only simplistically reduced to the age old phenomenon of political lying Scholars and popular commentators also disagree about the degree to which emotion should be emphasized in theories of post truth despite the emphasis on emotion in the Oxford Dictionary s original definition of the word While the term post truth had no dictionary entry before Oxford Dictionaries entry in the Oxford entry was inspired by the outcomes of the Brexit referendum and the U S presidential campaign it was thus already implicitly referring to politics Further in the original Oxford Dictionaries entry s even today more of a press release than traditional dictionary entry justification for their choice they say that it is often used in noun form of post truth politics Thus post truth is often used interchangeably with post truth politics br Post truth politics is a subset of the broader term post truth whose use precedes the recent focus on political events While Oxford Dictionaries influentially named post truth its word of the year current academic development of post truth as a concept does not entirely reflect their original emphasis on circumstances where appeals to objective facts fail to influence as much as appeals to emotion and personal belief see Drivers section below The use of post truth communication as a major tool in political campaigns such as the Brexit debate in the UK and the Trump campaign in the United States resulted in intense scholarly and journalistic interest in it as an aspect of politics The existence of post truth politics as a concept that makes sense and as a problem in the political life of liberal democracies is sometimes denied by critics br Some uses of the concept are more general referring not to historical conditions of widely empirically documented distrust or a context of promotional capitalism easily accessible and hard to control amateur mass communication of social media but to the presence of lying and distrust in politics and bias in journalism and commentators opinions that people of the day were distrustful or that political lying was common Reducing the concept of post truth to dishonest political communication and different styles thereof some scholars argue that what one identifies as post truth politics today is really a return of previous periods of politics Some argue that what is being called post truth is a return to th and th century political and media practices in the United States followed by a period in the th century where the media was relatively balanced and political rhetoric was toned down Such a view nonetheless also conflicts with those in other countries at other times For example in scientist Kathleen Lonsdale remarked in the British context that for many people truthfulness in politics has now become a mockery Anyone who listens to the radio in a mixed company of thinking people knows how deep seated is this cynicism Similarly New Scientist characterised the pamphlet wars that arose with the growth of printing and literacy beginning in the s as an early form of post truth politics Slanderous and vitriolic pamphlets were cheaply printed and widely disseminated and the dissent that they fomented contributed to starting wars and revolutions such as the English Civil War and much later the American Revolution br br br Drivers br Communication and media scholars and philosophers tend to view the definition origins and causes of post truth slightly differently Media and communication scholars emphasize the historical revolution in communication technologies which has fundamentally altered social life including ways of knowing socially social epistemology shared authorities and trust in institutions Some also do not see post truth as primarily a problem of knowledge but rather of confusion disorientation and distrust Philosophers tend to cite media and communications changes but claim that academic movements themselves such as postmodernism have influenced society resulting in a situation where feeling and belief create an epistemic crisis for politics Scholars in the field of science and technology studies STS have studied post truth as part of the evolution of knowledge society and as shifts to long standing roles of scientific truth telling in public and political arenas br The circumstances surrounding post truth politics noted by the original Oxford Dictionaries definition have been expanded to denote a historical period defined by the convergence of numerous empirically documented shifts As opposed to early commentators who described it as a long standing part of political life that was less notable before the advent of the Internet and related social changes several scholars point to a host of empirical changes that are contemporary and are the core of the concept For these scholars post truth differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of facts in public life by pointing to a cultural and historical convergence of several developments br br An abundance of competing truth claims partly due to accessible technologies of communication production personal websites videos micro blogging and chat groups br A lack of shared authorities for adjudicating truth claims especially with the demise of traditional journalism as a gatekeeper of issues and public truth claims br A fragmented public space facilitated by algorithms where truth claims appear unchallenged or unexamined by a larger public in attendance to them sometimes associated with false knowledge effects of echo chambers and filter bubbles br A well resourced influence or persuasive industry in public relations marketing advertising and big data analytics whose goals are especially to influence not inform or educate br A cultural backdrop of promotional culture characterized by self promoting self branding user generated content about image as much as truth br A resorting to emotion and cognitive bias as a means to practically deal with the competition and confusion br A far reaching context of social distrust to which post truth political communication contribute and are affected by br Communication technologies corresponding to a culture of acceleration distraction and hot cognition and perhaps changing historical ethics about how much misleading or spin is acceptable br Before post truth entered the Oxford Dictionary in regime of post truth entered the academic conceptual vocabulary Regime of post truth instead of merely post truth politics refers to a way of governing with professional pan partisan political communication manipulating the communication competitively in a context where institutions and discourses such as science and news media were formerly interdependent on one another to stabilize the public circulation of truth The concept refers to a convergent set of historical developments that have created the conditions of post truth society and its politics the political communication informed by cognitive science which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like microtargeting which includes the strategic use of rumors and falsehoods the fragmentation of modern more centralized mass news media gatekeepers which have largely repeated one another s scoops and their reports the attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration user generated content and fewer society wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies accurate and inaccurate the algorithms which govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings based on what users want per algorithm and not on what is factual and news media which have been marred by scandals of plagiarism hoaxes propaganda and changing news values These developments have occurred on the background of economic crises downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditional tabloid stories and styles of reporting known as tabloidization and infotainment In this view post truth cannot be understood without regard for the revolution in communication technologies and social life their effects on cognition the way people are disposed to think online in a backdrop of social acceleration In terms of entertainment some scholars argue that citizens orientations towards politics are dispositions formed first as audiences in relation to entertainment forms such as reality television which can be shown to be transposable to their evaluation of political communication The concept of regime of post truth has been expanded by other scholars to a geo political level analyzing political communication cases in the non Western as well as Western world br While some of these phenomena such as a more tabloidesque press may suggest a return to the past the effect of the convergences is a socio political phenomenon which exceeds earlier forms of journalism in deliberate distortion error and cultural confusion Fact checking and rumor busting sites abound but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences attention wise and their respective trustful distrustfulness br Other scholars such as the philosopher Lee McIntyre who focuses on post truth generally and not politics specifically argue that rising social distrust of scientific expertise and postmodern academic discourse allegedly promoting a devaluing of or disregard for truth have combined with cognitive biases to produce conditions where feeling triumphs over facts While several of these scholars cite distrust as an agent of post truth social and political effects the origin of the distrust is less clear McIntyre sees public relations efforts to undermine scientific truths on for example the effects of tobacco as important factors in addition to the alleged influence of academic postmodernism on conservative politics though this link is not empirically established As another specific example of corporate interests undermining truths for which there exists scientific consensus McIntyre cites previous donations of BP to organizations which deny climate change However public relations is just one part of a larger culture of promotionalism consumer capitalism where truth has long been the last concern in strategies to influence people to feel positively or negatively towards brands as businesses countries products parties and politicians Furthermore the scandals in journalism around plagiarism and cheerleading for the U S invasion of Iraq combine with promotional culture ethically questionable professional strategic political communication potential viral mediascapes algorithmically customized presentation of information among other factors to reproduce various forms of specific and generalized distrust trust being crucial for recognition of legitimate public truth tellers br While many popular treatments of post truth sometimes used interchangeably with fake news claim or imply a growth in political lying several scholars see lying as only one feature of post truth which cannot historically distinguish it as new instead focusing on problems of distinguishing true and false common authorities for inducing belief being scarcer or on disorientation confusion misperception and distraction Here post truth is not synonymous with lying fake news or other deception but is about a public anxiety that there is no confident way to secure publicly accepted facts in political culture The appeals to scientific expertise though minority views in their fields as with anti vaccine supporters demonstrates that across the board people do in fact respect scientific experts or the idea thereof But science and expertise have been politicized making it harder for the unknowing to identify legitimate authorities all of whom may hold advanced degrees Furthermore it may not be so much that post truth is manifest trust in one s emotions before truth claims as one s identification of emotional truth tellers as authentic honest and therefore trustworthy br br br Misinformation br Misinformation is inadvertently false or misleading information used in political discourse The term is also used as an umbrella term for any type of misinformation disinformation or fake news br br br Disinformation br Disinformation is purposely and intentionally misleading information for example in propaganda br br br Fake news br Fake news is fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent br br br Conspiracy theories br Conspiracy theories are elaborate packages of interconnected assertions with respect to powerful conspirators which are typically characterized by improbability however actual political conspiracies such as the Watergate breakin and coverup do exist br br br Rumor bombs br Across an interdisciplinary body of research the core of rumor definitions is a statement that is not verifiably true or false The militaristic metaphor rumor bomb refers to a rumor that is strategically dropped to cause confusion doubt or dis mis belief br br br Vulnerability br There are two aspects of vulnerability to misinformation gullibility with respect to poorer information and distrust and skepticism with respect to better information that might correct it br br br Manufactured controversy br Political operatives in the post truth space may fabricate controversies for economic or political advantage or as in gaslighting to disorient and confuse the public br br br Description br br In modern professionalization of political communication tied to marketing and advertising research a defining trait of post truth politics is that campaigners continue to repeat their talking points even when media outlets experts in the field in question and others provide proof that contradicts these talking points For example during campaigning for the British EU referendum campaign Vote Leave made repeated use of the claim that EU membership cost million a week although later began to use the figure as a net amount of money sent directly to the EU This figure which ignored the UK rebate and other factors was described as potentially misleading by the UK Statistics Authority as not sensible by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and was rejected in fact checks by BBC News Channel News and Full Fact Vote Leave nevertheless continued to use the figure as a centrepiece of their campaign until the day of the referendum after which point they downplayed the pledge as having been an example pointing out that it was only ever suggested as a possible alternative use of the net funds sent to the EU Tory MP and Leave campaigner Sarah Wollaston who left the group in protest during its campaign criticised its post truth politics The justice secretary Michael Gove controversially claimed in an interview that the British people Had had enough of experts br Michael Deacon parliamentary sketchwriter for The Daily Telegraph summarised the core message of post truth politics as Facts are negative Facts are pessimistic Facts are unpatriotic He added that post truth politics can also include a claimed rejection of partisanship and negative campaigning In this context campaigners can push a utopian positive campaign to which rebuttals can be dismissed as smears and scaremongering and opposition as partisan br In its most extreme mode post truth politics can make use of conspiracism In this form of post truth politics false rumors such as the birther or Muslim conspiracy theories about Barack Obama become major news topics In the case of the pizzagate conspiracy this resulted in a man entering the Comet Ping Pong pizzeria and firing an AR rifle br In contrast to simply telling untruths writers such as Jack Holmes of Esquire describe the process as something different with Holmes putting it as So if you don t know what s true you can say whatever you want and it s not a lie Finally scholars have argued that post truth is not simply about clear cut true false statements and people s failure to distinguish between them but about strategically ambiguous statements that may be true in some ways from some perspectives and interpretations and false in others This was the case around the disinformation campaigns of the UK and US in promoting the US invasion of Iraq Saddam Hussein Al Qaeda ties or links and Weapons of Mass Destruction which have been described as watershed moments of the post truth era br br br Major news outlets br br Several trends in the media landscape have been blamed for the perceived rise of post truth politics One contributing factor has been the proliferation of state funded news agencies like CCTV News and RT and Voice of America in the US which allow states to influence Western audiences According to Peter Pomerantsev a British Russian journalist who worked for TNT in Moscow one of their prime objectives has been to de legitimize Western institutions including the structures of government democracy and human rights br As of trust in the mainstream media in the US had reached historical lows br It has been suggested that under these conditions fact checking by news outlets struggles to gain traction among the wider public and that politicians resort to increasingly drastic messaging br Many news outlets desire to appear to be or have a policy of being impartial Many writers have noted that in some cases this leads to false balance the practice of giving equal emphasis to unsupported or discredited claims without challenging their factual basis The hour news cycle also means that news channels repeatedly draw on the same public figures which benefits PR savvy politicians and means that presentation and personality can have a larger impact on the audience than facts while the process of claim and counter claim can provide grist for days of news coverage at the expense of deeper analysis of the case br br br Social media and the Internet br General availability of vast amounts of information on the internet bypassed established media that were generally reliable due to editorial process and professional journalistic and academic discipline which acted as gatekeepers which filtered out misinformation Now misinformation that might have been filtered out is often published in popular globally accessible forums which enter the marketplace of ideas liberal democracies depend on for informing their electorate br Social media adds an additional dimension as user networks can become echo chambers possibly emphasised by the filter bubble where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails allowing a parallel media ecosystem of websites publishers and news channels to develop which can repeat post truth claims without rebuttal br In this environment post truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss them as being motivated by bias The Guardian editor in chief Katherine Viner laid some of the blame on the rise of clickbait articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline and which are designed to be widely shared saying that chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity undermines the value of journalism and truth In David Mikkelson co founder of the fact checking and debunking site Snopes com described the introduction of social media and fake news sites as a turning point saying I m not sure I d call it a post truth age but there s been an opening of the sluice gate and everything is pouring through The bilge keeps coming faster than you can pump br The digital culture allows anybody with a computer and access to the internet to post their opinions online and mark them as fact which may become legitimized through echo chambers and other users validating one another Content may be judged based on how many views a post gets creating an atmosphere that appeals to emotion audience biases or headline appeal instead of researched fact Content which gets more views is continually filtered around different internet circles regardless of its legitimacy Some also argue that the abundance of fact available at any time on the internet leads to an attitude focused on knowing basic claims to information instead of an underlying truth or formulating carefully thought out opinions The Internet allows people to choose where they get their information often facilitating them to reinforce their own opinions br Researchers have developed prototypical falsity scores for over contemporary elites on Twitter and associated exposure scores Various similar countermeasures that are largely based on technical changes or extensions to common platforms and software have been proposed see below br In a rise in national protests sparked against the United States presidential election and the victory of Donald Trump attributed to the fake news stories posted and shared by millions of users on Facebook Following this incident the spread of misinformation was given the word post truth a term coined from Oxford Dictionaries as the word of the year br br br Polarized political culture br The rise of post truth politics coincides with polarized political beliefs A Pew Research Center study of American adults found that those with the most consistent ideological views on the left and right have information streams that are distinct from those of individuals with more mixed political views and very distinct from each other Data is becoming increasingly accessible as new technologies are introduced to the everyday lives of citizens An obsession for data and statistics also filters into the political scene and political debates and speeches become filled with snippets of information that may be misconstrued false or not contain the whole picture Sensationalized television news emphasizes grand statements and further publicizes politicians This shaping from the media influences how the public views political issues and candidates br br br Origin br Post truth politics has its origins in the reaction of sectors of the public to widespread adoption of neoliberalism and other proposed global solutions to problems such as climate change and the COVID pandemic by global economic and political elites br In Six Faces of Globalization Who Wins Who Loses and Why It Matters a book by Anthea Roberts and Nicolas Lamp two Australian scholars the establishment neoliberal narrative and major reactions to it such as the left wing populist narrative the corporate power narrative the right wing populist narrative the geoeconomic narrative and a number of global threats narratives are compared and contrasted br The establishment narrative supported by consensus of democratic political parties and institutions such as the World Bank the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Trade Organization WTO is based on international negotiation of agreements allowing the economic principles of competition and comparative advantage to operate maximizing gross domestic product GDP in each country The principles employed are well established and work producing expanded global economic production but also result in gains for some sectors of the international economy and losses for others br br br Dissenting views br Unlike some academic treatments of post truth that see it as historically specific and closely associated with shifts in journalism social trust and new media and communication technologies several popular commentators pundits and journalists equating post truth with lying or sensational news have proposed that post truth is an imprecise or misleading term and or should be abandoned In an editorial New Scientist suggested a cynic might wonder if politicians are actually any more dishonest than they used to be and hypothesized that fibs once whispered into select ears are now overheard by everyone David Helfand argues following Edward M Harris that public prevarication is nothing new and that it is the knowledge of the audience and the limits of plausibility within a technology saturated environment that have changed We are rather in an age of misinformation where such limits of plausibility have vanished and where everyone feels equally qualified to make claims that are easily shared and propagated The writer George Gillett has suggested that the term post truth mistakenly conflates empirical and ethical judgements writing that the supposedly post truth movement is in fact a rebellion against expert economic opinion becoming a surrogate for values based political judgements br Toby Young writing for The Spectator called the term a clich used selectively primarily by left wing commentators to attack what are actually universal ideological biases contending that w e are all post truthers and probably always have been The Economist has called this argument complacent however identifying a qualitative difference between political scandals of previous generations such as those surrounding the Suez Crisis and the Iran Contra affair which involved attempting to cover up the truth and contemporary ones in which public facts are simply ignored Similarly Alexios Mantzarlis of the Poynter Institute said that political lies were not new and identified several political campaigns in history which would now be described as post truth For Mantzarlis the post truth label was to some extent a coping mechanism for commentators reacting to attacks on not just any facts but on those central to their belief system but also noted that had been an acrimonious year for politics on both sides of the Atlantic Mantzarlis also noted that interest in fact checking had never been higher suggesting that at least some reject post truth politics br In addition The Guardian s Kathryn Viner notes that while false news and propaganda are rampant social media is a double edged sword While it has helped some untruths to spread it has also restrained others as an example she said The Sun s false The Truth story following the Hillsborough disaster and the associated police cover up would be hard to imagine in the social media age br br br By country br Post truth politics has been applied as a political buzzword to a wide range of political cultures one article in The Economist identified post truth politics in Austria Germany North Korea Poland Russia Turkey the United Kingdom and the United States br br br Australia br The repeal of carbon pricing by the government of Tony Abbott was described as the nadir of post truth politics by The Age br br br Germany br In December postfaktisch post factual was named word of the year by the Gesellschaft f r deutsche Sprache German language society also in connection with a rise of right wing populism from on Since the s post democracy was used in sociology more and more br br br Ghana br In Ghana Coker and Afriyie delved into the prevalence of post truth politics in the Ghanaian context with a specific focus on publications in print newspapers affiliated with the country s major political parties the New Patriotic Party and the National Democratic Congress The authors highlighted that post truth practices have become ingrained in the fabric of election campaigns and political discourse in sub Saharan Africa including Ghana Their research aimed to dissect the post truth strategies employed by Ghanaian politicians affiliated with these two prominent parties as manifested in their respective politically aligned newspapers namely The Daily Statesman and The Enquirer Coker and Afriyie identified three distinct strategies within this context which they labeled as kairos disinformation misinformation and the deliberate transmission of strategic falsehoods These strategies were found to be actively shaping political narratives and public perceptions br br br India br Amulya Gopalakrishnan columnist for The Times of India identified similarities between the Trump and Brexit campaigns on the one hand and hot button issues in India such as the Ishrat Jahan case and the ongoing case against Teesta Setalvad on the other where accusations of forged evidence and historical revisionism have resulted in an ideological impasse br br br Indonesia br Post truth politics have been discussed in Indonesia since at least In September the incumbent governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama during a speech to citizens of Thousand Islands said that some citizens were being deceived using Verse of Al Maidah and other things referring to a verse of the Quran used by his political opponents The video was later edited to omit a single word misrepresenting his statement and instigating a political scandal that resulted in a blasphemy charge and two year imprisonment Since this event post truth politics have played a more significant role in political campaigns as well as interactions between Indonesian voters Yoseph Wihartono researcher in crimonology at the University of Indonesia identified social media outlets and internet mobbing as sources of post truth dynamics that have potentially opened wide the opportunity for religious populism to expand br br br South Africa br Health care and education in South Africa was substantially compromised during the presidency of Thabo Mbeki due to his HIV AIDS denialism br br br United Kingdom br An early use of the phrase in British politics was in March by Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray in criticising the difference between Scottish National Party s claims and official statistics Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy also described an undercurrent of post truth politics in which people cheerfully shot the messenger when presented with facts that did not support their viewpoint seeing it among pro independence campaigners in the Scottish independence referendum and Leave campaigners in the then upcoming EU membership referendum br Post truth politics has been retroactively identified in the lead up to the Iraq War particularly after the Chilcot Report published in July concluded that Tony Blair misrepresented military intelligence to support his view that Iraq s chemical weapons program was advanced br The phrase became widely used during the UK EU membership referendum to describe the Leave campaign Faisal Islam political editor for Sky News said that Michael Gove used post fact politics that were imported from the Trump campaign in particular Gove s comment in an interview that I think people in this country have had enough of experts was singled out as illustrative of a post truth trend although this is only part of a longer statement Similarly Arron Banks the founder of the unofficial Leave EU campaign said that facts don t work You ve got to connect with people emotionally It s the Trump success Andrea Leadsom a prominent campaigner for Leave in the EU referendum and one of the two final candidates in the Conservative leadership election has been singled out as a post truth politician especially after she denied having disparaged rival Theresa May s childlessness in an interview with The Times in spite of transcript evidence br br br United States br br In conjunction with the rise of new media and communication technologies especially the Internet and blogging and the professionalization of political communication political consulting scholars have viewed the periods following and the George W Bush administration s strategic communication as a seminal moment in the emergence of what has subsequently been called post truth politics before the term and concept exploded in public visibility in The Bush administration s talking points about links or ties between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda repeated in parallel by the Tony Blair government and Hussein s alleged possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction both highly contested by experts at the time or later disproven and shown to be misleading were viewed by some scholars as part of a historical shift Despite age old precedents of political and government lying such as the systematic lying by the U S government documented in The Pentagon Papers these propaganda efforts were seen as more sophisticated in their organization and execution in a new media age part of a complicated new public communication culture between a wide number of cable and satellite TV online and legacy news media sources In the U S the distrust and deception identified with strategic communication of Karl Rove George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld among others were a close historical precedent to controversies around truth as accuracy and or honesty that entered the media agenda of U S public life drawing significant news and new media attention and producing measurable confusion and false belief The most spectacular examples studied by scholars include the presidential candidacy of John Kerry in accusations by the Republican consultant directed Swift boat Veterans for Truth that he lied about his war record and then several years later prior to the U S presidential campaign that then candidate Barack Obama was a Muslim despite his declaration that he was Christian and was using a fake birth certificate allegedly born in Kenya br In its original formulation the phrase post truth politics was used to describe the paradoxical situation in the United States where the Republican Party which enforced stricter party discipline than the Democratic Party was nevertheless able to present itself as more bipartisan since individual Democrats were more likely to support Republican policies than vice versa The term was used by Paul Krugman in The New York Times to describe Mitt Romney s presidential campaign in which certain claims such as that Barack Obama had cut defense spending and that he had embarked on an apology tour continued to be repeated long after they had been debunked Other forms of scientific denialism in modern US politics include the anti vaxxer movement and the belief that existing genetically modified foods are harmful despite a strong scientific consensus that no currently marketed GMO foods have any negative health effects The health freedom movement in the US resulted in the passage of the bipartisan Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of which allows the sale of dietary supplements without any evidence that they are safe or effective for the purposes consumers expect though the FDA has begun regulation of homeopathic products br In a review for the Harvard Gazette Christopher Robichaud a lecturer in ethics and public policy at Harvard Kennedy School described conspiracy theories about the legitimacy of elections and politicians such as the birther idea that Barack Obama is not a natural born US citizen as one side effect of post truth politics Robichaud also contrasted the behavior of the candidates with that following the contested result of the election in which Al Gore conceded and encouraged his supporters to accept the result of Bush v Gore Similarly Rob Boston writing for The Humanist saw a rise in conspiracy theories across US public life including Birtherism climate change denialism and rejecting evolution which he identified as a result of post truth politics noting that the existence of extensive and widely available evidence against these conspiracy theories had not slowed their growth br In the post truth label was especially widely used to describe the presidential campaign of Donald Trump including by Professor Daniel W Drezner in The Washington Post Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian Chris Cillizza in The Independent Jeet Heer in The New Republic and James Kirchick in the Los Angeles Times and by several professors of government and history at Harvard In The New York Times The Washington Post and others began to point out lies or falsehoods in Trump s statements after the election Former president Barack Obama stated that the new media ecosystem means everything is true and nothing is true br br br Political facts br Newt Gingrich a prominent American politician and Trump supporter in an interview with CNN reporter Alisyn Camerota aired July explained that facts based on the feelings of the electorate were more important in a political campaign than the statistics collected by a reliable government agency are br br CAMEROTA They feel it yes but the facts don t support it br GINGRICH As a political candidate I ll go with how people feel and I ll let you go with the theoreticians br Supporters of those who are publishing or asserting things that are not true do not necessarily believe them but have accepted that that is how the game is played br br br Environmental politics br Although the consensus among scientists is that human activities contribute to global warming several political parties around the world have made climate change denial a basis of their policies These parties have been accused of using post truth techniques to attack environmental measures meant to combat climate changes to benefit industry donors In the wake of the election the United States saw numerous climate change deniers rise to power such as new Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt replacing Barack Obama s appointee Gina McCarthy br br br Solutions br br Political scientists Alfred Moore University of York Carlo Invernizzi Accetti City University of New York Elizabeth Markovits Mount Holyoke College and Zeynep Pamuk St John s College evaluated American historian Sophia A Rosenfeld s book Democracy and Truth A Short History and its potential solutions for dealing with post truth politics in what Invernizzi Accetti calls remedies for the growing split between populism and technocracy in contemporary democratic regimes Rosenfeld highlights seven potential solutions to the problem of post truth politics an ethical commitment to truth telling and fact checking in public a proscription against reopening settled debates a crackdown on disinformation by social media companies a shift away from free speech absolutism protecting the integrity of political institutions improving information literacy with education and the support of nonviolent protest against lying and corruption Invernizzi Accetti criticizes Rosenfeld s solutions as he does not see the value of truth in politics Truth functions politically as a justification of authority writes Invernizzi Accetti whereas self government is predicated on its exclusion from the political domain it follows that any attempt to construe democracy as a regime of truth is ultimately bound to contradict itself In response Rosenfeld writes truth is bound always to be a problematic intrusion into any democracy and that skepticism is indeed intrinsic to democracy Alfred Moore responds to Rosenfeld s proposal noting that solutions will not come from the better organization and communication of knowledge whether popular or expert nor from institutions and practices of competition and interaction between them but from the generation of substantive relations of common interest and mutual
