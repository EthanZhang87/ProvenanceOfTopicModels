id: 106402
Genocide denial is the attempt to deny or minimize the scale and severity of an instance of genocide Denial is an integral part of genocide and includes the secret planning of genocide propaganda while the genocide is going on and destruction of evidence of mass killings According to genocide researcher Gregory Stanton denial is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres br Some scholars define denial as the final stage of a genocidal process Richard G Hovannisian states Complete annihilation of a people requires the banishment of recollection and suffocation of remembrance Falsification deception and half truths reduce what was to what might have been or perhaps what was not at all br Examples include Armenian genocide denial denial of genocides of Indigenous peoples Holocaust denial Cambodian genocide denial Bosnian genocide denial and Rwandan genocide denial The distinction between respectable academic historians and illegitimate historical negationists and revisionists including genocide deniers rests upon the techniques which are used in the writing of such histories Historical revisionists and negationists rewrite history in order to support an agenda which is usually political or ideological by using falsification and rhetorical fallacies in order to obtain their desired results Exposure of genocide denial and revisionism surged in the early st century facilitated by the propagation of conspiracy theories and hate speech on social media br br br Analysis br According to Taner Ak am the practice of denialism in regard to mass atrocities is usually thought of as a simple denial of the facts but this is not true Rather it is in that nebulous territory between facts and truth where such denialism germinates br David Tolbert president of the International Center for Transitional Justice states br br Denial is the final fortress of those who commit genocide and other mass crimes Perpetrators hide the truth to avoid accountability and protect the political and economic advantages they sought to gain by mass killings and theft of the victims property and to cement the new reality by manufacturing an alternative history Recent studies have established that such denial not only damages the victims and their destroyed communities it promises a future based on lies sowing the seeds of future conflict repression and suffering br br br Motives and strategies br Some of the main reasons for denying genocide are to evade moral or even criminal responsibility and to protect the perpetrators reputation br Gregory Stanton outlines the tactics of genocide denial including questioning the statistics denial of intent definitional debates and blaming the victims Genocide scholar Israel Charny outlines five psychological characteristics of denials of genocide br Genocide scholar Adam Jones proposed a framework for genocide denial that consists of several strategies including minimizing fatalities blaming fatalities on unrelated natural causes denying intent to destroy a group and claiming self defense in preemptive or disproportionate attacks br br Hardly anybody died When the genocides lie far in the past denial is easier br It wasn t intentional Disease and famine causing conditions such as forced labor concentration camps and slavery even though they may be manufactured by the perpetrator may be blamed for casualties br There weren t that many people to begin with Minimizing the casualties of the victims while the criminals destroy or hide the evidence br It was self defense The killing of civilians especially able bodied males is rationalized in preemptive attack as they are accused of plotting against the perpetrators The perpetrator may exterminate witnesses and relatives of the victims br There was no central direction Perpetrators can use militias paramilitaries mercenaries or death squads to avoid being seen as directly participating br It wasn t or isn t genocide because They may enter definitional or rhetorical argumentation br We would never do that Self image cannot be questioned the perpetrator sees itself as benevolent by definition Evidence doesn t matter br We are the real victims They deflect attention to their own casualties losses without historical context br br br By individuals and non governmental organizations br In his book The Other Side The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas argued that only a few hundred thousand Jews were murdered in the Holocaust the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves because of their behavior and Zionists had collaborated with the Nazis in an attempt to send more Jews to Israel In a interview without retracting these specific claims he stated The Holocaust was a terrible unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind br In February David Irving was imprisoned in Austria for Holocaust denial he served months in prison before being released on probation br David Campbell has written of the now defunct British magazine Living Marxism that LM s intentions are clear from the way they have sought to publicize accounts of contemporary atrocities which suggest they were certainly not genocidal as in the case of Rwanda and perhaps did not even occur as in the case of the murder of nearly at Srebrenica Chris McGreal writing in The Guardian on March stated that Fiona Fox writing under a pseudonym had contributed an article to Living Marxism which was part of a campaign by Living Marxism that denied that the event which occurred in Rwanda was a genocide br Scott Jaschik has stated that Justin McCarthy is one of two scholars most active on promoting the view that no Armenian genocide took place He was one of four scholars who participated in a controversial debate hosted by PBS about the genocide br Darko Trifunovic is the author of the Report about Case Srebrenica which was commissioned by the government of the Republika Srpska The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ICTY reviewed the report and concluded that it represented one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to the mass executions of Bosniaks committed in Srebrenica in July After the report was published on September it provoked outrage and condemnation by a wide variety of Balkans and international figures individuals and organizations br Patrick Karuretwa stated in the Harvard Law Record that in the Canadian politician Robin Philpot attracted intense media attention for repeatedly denying the genocide of the Tutsis br On April a full page ad appeared in The Wall Street Journal and Chicago Tribune that directed readers to Fact Check Armenia a genocide denial website sponsored by the Turkish lobby in the US When confronted about the ad a Wall Street Journal spokesperson stated We accept a wide range of advertisements including those with provocative viewpoints While we review ad copy for issues of taste the varied and divergent views expressed belong to the advertisers br American philosopher Stephen T Katz has argued that the Holocaust is the only genocide that has occurred in history br br br By governments br br br Croatia br br br Japan br br In Japan interpretation of the Nanjing Massacre is reflected upon the notions of pride honor and shame Takashi Yoshida describes the Japanese debate over the Nanjing Massacre as crystalliz ing a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation Japan as a nation acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings or stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression In some nationalist circles in Japan speaking of a large scale massacre at Nanjing is regarded as Japan bashing in the case of foreigners or self flagellation in the case of Japanese This means that most Japanese youth are oblivious of the massacre because this dark history is not taught in Japanese schools and the continued worship of Japanese war criminals enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine by mainstream politicians in Japan br br br Pakistan br The government of Pakistan continues to deny that any Bangladeshi genocide took place during the Bangladesh Liberation War of They typically accuse Pakistani reporters such as Anthony Mascarenhas who reported on the genocide of being enemy agents According to Donald W Beachler professor of political science at Ithaca College br br The government of Pakistan explicitly denied that there was genocide By their refusal to characterise the mass killings as genocide or to condemn and restrain the Pakistani government the US and Chinese governments implied that they did not consider it so br Similarly in the wake of the Shahbag protests against war criminals who were complicit in the genocide English journalist Philip Hensher wrote br br The genocide is still too little known about in the West It is moreover the subject of shocking degrees of denial among partisan polemicists and manipulative historians br br br Russia br br br Serbia br br According to Sonja Biserko president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia and Edina Becirevic the faculty of criminology and security studies of the University of Sarajevo br br Denial of the Srebrenica genocide takes many forms in Serbia The methods range from the brutal to the deceitful Denial is present most strongly in political discourse in the media in the sphere of law and in the educational system br br br Turkey br br The government of the Republic of Turkey has long denied that the Armenian genocide was a genocide According to Ak am Turkish denialism of the genocide is perhaps the most successful example of how the well organised deliberate and systematic spreading of falsehoods can play an important role in the field of public debate and that fact based truths have been discredited and relegated to the status of mere opinion Turkey acknowledges that many Armenians residing in the Ottoman Empire were killed in conflicts with Ottoman forces during World War One but disputes the statistics and claims that the killings were systematic and amounted to genocide Measures recognising the Armenian genocide have languished in the US Congress for decades and US presidents have refrained from labelling it such due to worries about relations with Turkey and intensive lobbying by Ankara br br br United States br br The government of the United States has been accused of denial of the genocide of its Indigenous peoples by academics such as Benjamin Madley David Stannard and Noam Chomsky br br br Law br The European Commission proposed a European Union wide anti racism law in which included an offence of genocide denial but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression After six years of debating a watered down compromise was reached in which gave EU states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit br In the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect issued a policy paper associating genocide denial with hate speech specifically when directed to specific identifiable groups The report gives policy recommendations for states and UN officials in the matter of denial br br br Effects br br Genocide denial has an impact on both victim and perpetrator groups Denial of a genocide affects relations between the victim and perpetrator groups or their respective countries prevents personal victims of the genocide from seeking closure and adversely affects political decisions on both sides It can cause fear in the victims to express their cultural identity retaliation from both parties and hamper the democratic development of societies br Effects on personal victims of the genocide br While confrontation of the committed atrocities can be a tough process in which the victim feels humiliated again by reliving the traumatic past it still has a benign therapeutic effect helping both victim and perpetrator groups to come to terms with the past From a therapeutic point of view letting the victim confront the past atrocity and its related painful memories is one way to reach a closure and to understand that the harm has occurred in the past This also helps the memories to enter the shared narrative of the society thereby becoming a common ground on which the society can make future decisions on in political and cultural matters br Denying recognition in contrast has a negative effect further victimising the victim which will feel not only wronged by the perpetrator but also by being denied recognition of the occurred wrongdoing Denial also has a pivotal role in shaping the norms of a society since the omission of any committed errors and thereby the lack of condemnation and punishment of the committed wrongs risks normalising similar actions increasing the society s tolerance for future occurrences of similar errors br According to sociologist Daniel Feierstein the genocide perpetrator implements a process of transforming the identity of any survivors and erasing the memory of the existence of the victim group br Societal effects of genocide denial br Bhargava notes that m ost calls to forget disguise the attempt to prevent victims from publicly remembering in the fear that there is a dragon living on the patio and we better not provoke it In other words while societally forgetting an atrocity can on the surface be beneficial to the harmony of society it further victimizes the target group for fear of future similar action and is directly detrimental to the sociocultural development of the victim group br On the other hand there are cases where forgetting atrocities is the most politically expedient or stable option This is found in some states which have recently come out of minority rule where the perpetrator group still controls most strategic resources and institutions such as South Africa This was among others one of the main reasons for granting amnesty in exchange for confessing to committed errors during the transitional period in South Africa However the society at large and the victims in particular will perceive this kind of trade offs as morally suspect and may question its sustainability Thus a common refrain in regard to the Final Report by South Africa s Truth and Reconciliation Commission was We ve heard the truth There is even talk about reconciliation But where s the justice br Effects on democratic development br The denial has thereby a direct negative impact on the development of a society often by undermining its laws and the issue of justice but also the level of democracy itself If democracy is meant to be built on the rule of law and justice upheld and safeguarded by state institutions then surely the omission of legal consequences and justice would potentially undermine the democracy What is more dangerous from a historical point of view is that such a default would imply the subsequent loss of the meaning of these events to future generations a loss which is resembled to losing a moral compass The society becomes susceptible to similar wrongdoings in the absence of proper handling of preceding occasions Nonetheless denial especially immediately after the committed wrongdoings is rather the rule than the exception and naturally almost exclusively done by the perpetrator to escape responsibility br Implicit denial of genocide br While some societies or governments openly deny genocide in some other cases e g in the case of the Comfort women and the role of the Japanese State the denial is more implicit This was evident in how an overwhelmingly majority of the surviving victims refused to accept a monetary compensation since the Japanese government still refused to admit its own responsibility the monetary compensation was paid through a private fund rather than by the state a decision perceived by the victims about state s refusal to assume any direct responsibility This can have the same effects on societies as outright denial For example atrocity denial and self victimisation in Japanese historical textbooks has caused much diplomatic tension between Japan and neighbouring victim states such as Korea and China and bolstered domestic conservative or nationalist forces br Turkey and Armenian genocide denial br br The Turkish state s Armenian genocide denial has had far reaching effects on the Turkish society throughout its history in regard to both ethnic minorities especially the Kurds but political opposition in general The denial also affects Turks in that there is a lack of recognition of Turks and Ottoman officials who attempted to stop the genocide This lack of recognition of the various actors at play in Turkey could result in a rather homogeneous perception of the nation in question thus making Armenians but also third parties project the perpetrating role onto the entire Turkish society and nation causing further racial strife and aggravating the prospects of future reconciliation For example Armenian terrorist groups e g ASALA and JCAG committed terrorist acts during s and s as a direct result of the Turkish state denial of the genocide br br br Prevention br Denial may be reduced by works of history preservation of archives documentation of records investigation panels search for missing persons commemorations official state apologies development of truth commissions educational programs monuments and museums According to Johnathan Sisson the society has the right to know the truth about historical events and facts and the circumstances that led to massive or systematic human rights violations He says that the state has the obligation to secure records and other evidence to prevent revisionist arguments Genocide scholar Gregory Stanton suggests that prosecution can be a deterrent br br br See also br Outline of genocide
