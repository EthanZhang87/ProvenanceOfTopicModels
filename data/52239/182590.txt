Voluntary Agency Network of Korea said the organization has corrected hundreds of mistaken statements by foreign governments about South Korea VANK also raises awareness for Japanese war crimes and promotes the banning and removal of symbolism they associate with Imperial Japan br In VANK launched a campaign against the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games The campaign included a letter to the International Olympic Committee IOC opposing the games because Japan has no remorse for war crimes the letter was also sent to major foreign media such as CNN and the New York Times On January a poster was put on a temporary fence on the site of the new Japanese embassy in Jong Chiyo Road Nono District In the posters the Tokyo Games are contaminated by nuclear radiation in one scene the

several complaints and criticisms VANK posted an online petition titled Stop China s cyber chauvinism which lynched a Korean celebrity It justified the petition on the basis We oppose the chauvinistic

Education Science and Technology of South Korea along with multiple corporate donors The amount paid by the government has decreased from million won in W in around to million won in W in around br br br Political position br br VANK does not represent an official political position but the organization is believed to be politically closer to a liberal to progressive camp than to a conservative camp one br In South Korea liberals and leftists tend to show more anti imperialist and left wing nationalist based diplomatic views than conservatives in diplomacy involving powerful countries including China and Japan Because of this tendency conservatives support reducing VANK s government subsidies while liberals and leftists support increasing VANK s government subsidies br br br Criticism br VANK organizes young Korean students as cyber diplomats to lobby foreign organizations and webmasters about what it perceives as errors in matters related to Korea The Government of Korea endorses such cyber vigilantism subsidising a competition in which participants try to censor foreign websites for incorrect content about Korea Park Jung yul an official of The Korean Information Service KOIS said KOIS is resolved to monitor the contents of Korea related Web sites and provide correct information on the Net in order to help generate an accurate image of the country In Asia Times Online it was reported that the South Korean government is offering rewards to students who participate in the activities of VANK most of which are centered on the issues of the Sea of Japan br VANK lists current targets for correction on its website for members to send a form letter of protest Some of its requests for correction are justifiable such as referring to a simple mistake mixing up North and South Korea However in relation to more highly contentious issues it does not accept any non Korean interpretations In a Foreign Policy article VANK was described as being seen as self styled cyber fact checkers to those favourable to their cause but for others they are seen as hyper nationalistic spammers br Although official foreign government agencies tend to endure its cyber harassment numerous private organisations and websites surrender to silence VANK s clamour An About com spokesman relating his company s decision to use the name East Sea to refer to the body of water otherwise known as the Sea of Japan stated that they chose to use the name not necessarily because it agreed with the South Korean geography activists but because the e mail bombardment was annoying In the About com case it received more than e mails per day for more than a year before it finally changed the name Likewise the National Geographic Society and other websites have changed their naming policies as a result of similar e mail and letter writing campaigns br VANK has been accused of promoting Korea while attacking Japan Critics claim that VANK has attempted to bully and discount Japan and Japanese culture manipulate history during and after World War II and have other countries believe in distorted perspectives related to Japanese Korean history that have a bias favoring Korea VANK has also been accused of attacking China and Chinese culture br br br Awards br Hong Jin Ki Creator Award br br br See also br Anti Japaneseism br Internet nationalism br Liberalism in
