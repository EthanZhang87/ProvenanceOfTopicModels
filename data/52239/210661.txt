disinformation and propaganda techniques and often involve the suppression of information or points of view by crowding them out by inducing other people or groups of people to stop listening to certain arguments or by simply diverting attention elsewhere In Propaganda The Formation of Men s Attitudes Jacques Ellul writes that public opinion can only express itself through channels which are provided by the mass media of communication without which there could be no propaganda br It is used within public relations propaganda marketing etc While the objective for each context is quite different the broad techniques are often similar br As illustrated below many of the more modern mass media manipulation methods are types of distraction on the assumption that the public has a limited attention span br br Activism is the practice or doctrine that has an emphasis on direct vigorous action especially supporting or opposing one side of a controversial matter It is quite simply starting a movement to affect or change social views It is frequently started by influential individuals but is done collectively through social movements with large masses These social movements can be done through public rallies strikes street marches and even rants on social media br br Advertising is a form of promotion that seeks to persuade a certain audience to purchase a good or service One of the first types of marketing it aims to persuade its target market to either buy sell or carry out a particular action This tends to be done by businesses who wish to sell their product by paying media outlets to show their products or services on television breaks banners on websites and mobile applications br These advertisements are not only done by businesses but can also be done by certain groups Non commercial advertisers are those who spend money on advertising in a hope to raise awareness for a cause or promote specific ideas These include groups such as interest groups political parties government organizations and religious movements Most of these organizations intend to spread a message or sway public opinion instead of trying to sell products or services Advertising can not only be found on social media but it is also evident on billboards newspapers magazines and even word of mouth br br A hoax is something intended to deceive or defraud Misleading public stunts scientific frauds false bomb threats and business scams are examples of hoaxes br br Propagandizing is a form of communication that is aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position by presenting only one side of an argument Propaganda is commonly created by governments but some forms of mass communication created by other powerful organizations can be considered propaganda as well As opposed to impartially providing information propaganda in its most basic sense presents information primarily to influence an audience Propaganda is usually repeated and dispersed over a wide variety of media in order to create the chosen result in audience attitudes While the term propaganda has justifiably acquired a strongly negative connotation by association with its most manipulative and jingoistic examples e g Nazi propaganda used to justify the Holocaust propaganda in its original sense was neutral and could refer to uses that were generally benign or innocuous such as public health recommendations signs encouraging citizens to participate in a census or election or messages encouraging persons to report crimes to the police among others br Propaganda uses societal norms and myths that people hear and believe Because people respond to understand and remember more simple ideas this is what is used to influence people s beliefs attitudes and values br br Psychological warfare is sometimes considered synonymous with propaganda The principal distinction being that propaganda normally occurs within a nation whereas psychological warfare normally takes place between nations often during war or cold war Various techniques are used to influence a target s values beliefs emotions motives reasoning or behavior Target audiences can be governments organizations groups and individuals br This tactic has been used in multiple wars throughout history During World War II the western Allies expected that the Soviet Union would drop leaflets on the US and England During the conflict with Iraq American and English forces dropped leaflets with many of the leaflets telling the people how to surrender In the Korean War both sides would use loud speakers from the front lines In people in Israel in the Gaza war received text messages on their cell phones threatening them with rocket attacks The Palestinian people were getting phone calls and leaflets warning them that they were going to drop rockets on them These phone calls and leaflets were not always accurate br br Public relations PR is the management of the flow of information between an individual or an organization and the public Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment PR is generally created by specialized individuals or firms at the behest of already public individuals or organizations as a way of managing their public profile br br Astroturfing is when there is an intent and attempt to create the illusion of support for a particular cause person or stance While this is mainly connected to and seen on the internet it has also happened in newspapers during times of political elections Corporations and political parties try to imitate grassroots movements in order to sway the public to believing something that isn t true br br Clickbait refers to headlines of online news articles that are sensationalized or sometimes completely fake It uses people s natural curiosity to get people to click In some cases clickbait is simply used to generate income more clicks means more money made with advertisers But these headlines and articles can also be used to influence a group of people on social media They are constructed to appeal to the interest group s pre existing biases and thus to be shared within filter bubbles br br Propaganda laundering is a method of using a less trusted or less popular platform to publish a story of dubious origin or veracity for the purposes of reporting on that report rather than the story itself This technique serves to insulate the secondary more established media from having to issue a retraction if the report is false Generally secondary reports will report that the original report is reporting without verifying or making the report themselves br br In search engine marketing websites use market research from past searches and other sources to increase their visibility in search engine results pages This allows them to guide search results along the lines they desire and thereby influence searchers br Business have many tactics to lure customers into their websites and to generate revenue such as banner ads search engine optimization and pay per click marketing tools They all serve a different purpose and use different tools that appeal to multiple types of users Banner ads appear on sites that then redirect to other sites that are similar Search engine optimization is changing a page to seem more reliable or applicable than other similar pages Pay per click involves certain words being highlighted because they were bought by advertisers to then redirect to a page containing information or selling whatever that word pertained to By using the internet users are susceptible to these type of advertisements without a clear advertising campaign being viewed br br Commonly known as smoke screen this technique consists of making the public focus its attention on a topic that is more convenient for the propagandist This particular type of media manipulation has been referenced many times in popular culture Some examples are br br The movie Wag the Dog which illustrates the public being deceitfully distracted from an important topic by presenting another that whose only quality is that of being more attractive br In the U S TV series House of Cards when protagonist Frank Underwood finds himself trapped in a media rampage he addresses the viewer and says From the lion s den or a pack of wolves When you re fresh meat kill and throw them something fresher br Politicians distract the public by showing them shiny object issues through the use of TV and other media Sometimes they can be as simple as a politician with a reality show like Sarah Palin had for a short time back in which aired on TLC br br This is a mere variation of the traditional arguments known in logic as ad hominem and ad populum but applied to countries instead of individuals This technique consists on refuting arguments by appealing to nationalism or by inspiring fear and hate towards a foreign country or to all the foreigners It has the potential of being important since it gives the propagandists the power to discredit any information coming from other countries br Some examples are br Q What do you think about Khokara s politic on X matter A I think they ve been wrong about everything for the last years or so br Q Your idea is quite similar to the one proposed in Falala A Are you suggesting Falala is a better country than ours br br An informal fallacy The straw man consists of appearing to refute the opponent s argument while actually attacking another topic For it to work properly the topic that was actually refuted and the one that should have been refuted need to be similar br br This is a combination of the straw man fallacy and the ad hominem argument It is often used to incriminate someone in order to argument the innocence of someone else br br Visual media can be transformed through photo manipulation commonly called photoshopping This can make a product person or idea seem more appealing This is done by highlighting certain features on the product and using certain editing tools to enlarge the photo to attract and persuade the public br br Video manipulation is a new variant of media manipulation that targets digital video using a combination of traditional video processing and video editing techniques and auxiliary methods from artificial intelligence like face recognition In typical video manipulation the facial structure body movements and voice of the subject are replicated in order to create a fabricated recording of the subject The applications of these methods range from educational videos to videos aimed at mass manipulation and propaganda a straightforward extension of the long standing possibilities of photo manipulation This form of computer generated misinformation has contributed to fake news and there have been instances when this technology was used during political campaigns br br A compliance professional is an expert that utilizes and perfects means of gaining media influence Though the means of gaining
