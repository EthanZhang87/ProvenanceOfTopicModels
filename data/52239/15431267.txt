id: 15431267
The K battleship was rumoured to be a type of advanced battleship produced by the Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War Soviet intelligence agencies actively encouraged the circulation of rumours about the type which were reprinted by several Western journals including Jane s Fighting Ships br br br History br Accounts of the new Soviet battleships appeared in journals in France Germany and the US in the late s and early s The rumours were unclear about the specifications of the ships The main point of agreement between different descriptions was that the type carried guided missiles mounted in distinctive domed turrets in addition to a conventional heavy gun armament The ships were often said to have been laid down in Siberian shipyards br The displacement stated varied between and tonnes and long tons and their speed was said to be anything between and knots The main armament was normally said to be twelve millimetre in guns though sometimes nine millimetre in guns were alleged br The names assigned to the class were said to be Strana Sovetov Sovetskaya Byelorussia Krasnaya Bessarabiya Krasnaya Sibir Sovietskaya Konstitutsia Lenin and Sovetsky Soyuz Many of the names were re used from units of the authentic but never completed Sovetsky Soyuz class which were under construction when World War II broke out br The Soviet Union actively perpetrated the hoax class of warships A Soviet fleet recognition manual planted in the West seemed to confirm the existence and general features of the K Heavy Fleet Unit Sovetskaya Byelorussia and that she was in commission from November The accompanying drawings showing two missile domes six heavy guns and a cluster of lighter armament gave a further veneer of accuracy to the document In fact the drawings were a direct copy of the edition of Jane s Fighting Ships br In reality the USSR was like other naval powers retiring or scrapping its existing battleships which had been rendered obsolete by the aircraft carrier The United States Navy considered creating a missile battleship out of the unfinished USS Kentucky which would have had some similarities to the fictional K class however this plan never went ahead br br br
