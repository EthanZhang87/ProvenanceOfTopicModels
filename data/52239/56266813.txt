s Culture Select Committee and Intelligence and Security Committee and the United States Senate The Russia Report published by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament in July did not

parliamentarians have launched investigations into different aspects of possible Russian government meddling br March Channel broadcast its investigative documentary on Cambridge Analytica br June The

influence in the Brexit referendum included the promotion of misinformation through both fake social media accounts and state sponsored media outlets such as RT and Sputnik In addition to interference in the U S presidential election Russian trolls have previously been documented promoting fake claims of election fraud after the Scottish independence referendum and attempting to amplify the public impact of terrorist attacks with Prime Minister Theresa May accusing the Russian government of deploying its state run media organisations to plant fake stories and photo shopped images in an attempt to sow discord in the West and undermine our institutions br br br RT br According to a US senate report Russian state media channel RT covered the referendum campaign extensively and offered systematically one sided coverage A parliamentary inquiry into disinformation and fake news cited research estimating the value of anti EU Russian state media during the EU referendum campaign at between and million br br br Twitter bots br Data released by Twitter in identified accounts of Russian origin affiliated with the Internet Research Agency as well as potentially from Iran which collectively sent over million Tweets in an effort to spread disinformation and discord according to The Telegraph with a day long blitz on the day of the referendum One study with a sample of million tweets containing hashtags relating to the referendum found that almost a third of all tweets had been generated by just of the sampled accounts They found that both pro Leave and pro Remain bots existed but that the family of hashtags associated with the argument for leaving the EU dominates with pro Leave bots tweeting more than three times as often br In November The Times reported that researchers from Swansea University and UC Berkeley had identified around accounts with links to Russia that tweeted about Brexit in the run up to the referendum Others at City University of London had previously documented a network of accounts that tweeted about the referendum of which could be located geographically only of these were based in the UK rather fewer than the accounts designated as deactivated removed blocked set to private or whose username was altered after the referendum A working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research claims the influence of Twitter bots may have been significant enough to impact the result roughly calculating that automated accounts may have ultimately been responsible for around percentage points of the Leave vote share br An analysis by cybersecurity firm F Secure indicated that suspicious activity relating to Brexit related posts on Twitter has continued after the referendum and into with Professor Jason Reifler of the University of Exeter commenting that the observed patterns of activity are consistent with tactics used by Russian troll farms br br br Questions about Arron Banks funding br British Journalist Isabel Oakeshott stated in an article for the Times As part of my research I uncovered controversial information about links between Arron Banks and his associate Andy Wigmore and the Russian embassy in London The relationship began in autumn when Banks was gearing up for the Brexit campaign and continued throughout the referendum and beyond The Kremlin was simply doing what it does so well identifying individuals who might be useful to President Vladimir Putin s geopolitical aims and seeing what might come of it br In Banks and Wigmore it literally struck gold In due course Banks would become the single biggest donor to the Brexit campaign putting him at the heart of British politics Banks and Wigmore genuinely sympathised and continue to sympathise with some of Putin s political views Banks after all is married to a Russian My analysis is that Banks and Wigmore were shamelessly used by the Russians br Arron Banks was the largest donor to the Brexit campaign Prior to the donations Southern Rock Banks underwriting company was technically insolvent and needed to find m to meet regulations It was saved by a m cash injection mostly in September from another company ICS Risk Solutions According to openDemocracy when questioned by MP Rebecca Pow Banks implied that this was simply him shuffling money between two companies he owns They have also reported that while Banks has stated that he owns per cent of the company he appears to actually own between and according to filings from a subsidiary suggest ing there may be an undeclared shareholder br At the time Louise Kentish of a company called STM joined the board The day after the referendum her husband Alan Kentish CEO of STM and two other STM people joined as well STM specialises in opaque wealth management using trusts and similar br Around the same time September Banks along with Andy Wigmore started having multiple meetings with Russian officials posted at the Russian embassy in London br Also according to his South African business partner Christopher Kimber Banks had been in Russia trying to raise funds around that time I was finally made aware in October that in truth Banks had been dealing with Russians who contemplated investing in the mines I was informed by Banks that he had travelled to Russia and discussed with them the diamond opportunities as well as gold mining opportunities in Russia He further indicated that he would be meeting with the Russians again during November br Months after the cash injection Banks started making large donations to political causes including the m to the Brexit campaigns The UK s Electoral Commission stated we have reasonable grounds to suspect that Mr Banks was not the true source of the m reported as loans leading to the criminal investigation of Banks br Banks states there was no Russian money and sent financial statements to the BBC s Newsnight programme to prove it but an email attached to the statements included the text Redact the reference for Ural Properties and any references which include sensitive info e g the account numbers the money was sent from Newsnight featured a story about this on November It remains to be seen which accounts these are or what Ural Properties a Gibraltar based company does br On September the Metropolitan Police concluded that while it is clear that whilst some technical breaches of electoral law were committed by Leave EU in respect of the spending return submitted for their campaign there is insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal investigation and on September the National Crime Agency said it had found no evidence of criminality in respect of the issues raised by the Electoral Commission and that no further action would be taken This left investigations of Banks closed br br br Russia report br On October the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament delivered to the Government The Russia report into allegations of Russian interference in British politics including alleged Russian interference in the referendum The government led by Prime Minister Boris Johnson which formally has authority to control the timing of its release to the public refused to do so before the United Kingdom general election in December A number of legal actions tried to force the government to publish it In November the Bureau of Investigative Journalism started a crowdfunding exercise to raise funds for legal action to force the British government to release the report In July the report was released by the ISC led by chairman Julian Lewis MP br The report said the government had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes and an official UK government response said We have seen no evidence of successful interference in the EU referendum br The report also stated that the government had made minimal effort to investigate potential Russian interference into the Brexit referendum other than consulting open source commentary The report discussed more broadly Russian interference in British politics including an extensive laundromat of Russian investment into the United Kingdom often connected to the Russian state and the Putin linked elite It discussed the likely effect on politics and that many members of the House of Lords have business interests in Russia The report stated that no government ministry took significant interest or specific responsibility in investigation and that the British intelligence community believed election integrity was not a major focus It stated the presence of Russian intelligence in the UK is significant and poses a risk to Russian expatriates who criticise Putin br The report describes the United Kingdom as one of Russia s top targets and said it is seen as central to the Western anti Russian lobby br In September the Electoral Commission raised concerns about Russia linked donations to the Tories that occurred prior to the Brexit referendum In October the Pandora Papers revealed more information about the potentially Kremlin linked donations and multiple others br br br See also br Carole Cadwalladr
