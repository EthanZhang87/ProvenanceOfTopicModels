id: 66252
In public relations and politics spin is a form of propaganda achieved through knowingly br providing a biased interpretation of an event or campaigning to influence public opinion about some organization or public figure While traditional public relations and advertising may manage their presentation of facts spin often implies the use of disingenuous deceptive and manipulative tactics br Because of the frequent association between spin and press conferences especially government press conferences the room in which these conferences take place is sometimes described as a spin room Public relations advisors pollsters and media consultants who develop deceptive or misleading messages may be referred to as spin doctors or spinmeisters br A standard tactic used in spinning is to reframe or modify the perception of an issue or event to reduce any negative impact it might have on public opinion For example a company whose top selling product is found to have a significant safety problem may reframe the issue by criticizing the safety of its main competitor s products or by highlighting the risk associated with the entire product category This might be done using a catchy slogan or sound bite that can help to persuade the public of the company s biased point of view This tactic could enable the company to refocus the public s attention away from the negative aspects of its product br Spinning is typically a service provided by paid media advisors and media consultants The largest and most powerful companies may have in house employees and sophisticated units with expertise in spinning issues While spin is often considered to be a private sector tactic in the s and s some politicians and political staff were accused of using deceptive spin tactics to manipulate or deceive the public Spin may include burying potentially negative new information by releasing it at the end of the workday on the last day before a long weekend selectively cherry picking quotes from previous speeches made by their employer or an opposing politician to give the impression that they advocate a certain position or purposely leaking misinformation about an opposing politician or candidate that casts them in a negative light br br br History br br br Rise of political spin br Edward Bernays has been called the Father of Public Relations Bernays helped tobacco and alcohol companies make consumption of their products more socially acceptable and he was proud of his work as a propagandist Throughout the s the use of spin by politicians and parties accelerated especially in the United Kingdom the emergence of hour news increased pressures placed upon journalists to provide nonstop content which was further intensified by the competitive nature of British broadcasters and newspapers and content quality declined due to hour news and political parties techniques for handling the increased demand This led to journalists relying more heavily on the public relations industry as a source for stories and advertising revenue as a profit source making them more susceptible to spin br Spin in the United Kingdom began to break down with the high profile resignations of the architects of spin within the New Labour government with Charlie Whelan resigning as Gordon Brown s spokesman in and Alastair Campbell resigning as Tony Blair s Press Secretary in As information technology has increased since the end of the th century commentators like Joe Trippi have advanced the theory that modern Internet activism spells the end for political spin in that the Internet may reduce the effectiveness of spin by providing immediate counterpoints br br br Examples of spin doctors br Spin doctors can either command media attention or remain anonymous Examples from the UK include Jamie Shea during his time as NATO s press secretary throughout the Kosovo War Charlie Whelan and Alastair Campbell br Campbell previously a journalist before becoming Tony Blair s Press Secretary was the driving force behind a government that was able to produce the message it wanted in the media He played a key role in important decisions with advisors viewing him as a Deputy Prime Minister inseparable from Blair Campbell identifies how he was able to spin Rupert Murdoch during a meeting in July into positively reporting an up incoming Blair speech gathering the support from The Sun and The Times popular British newspapers Campbell later acknowledged that his and the government s spinning had contributed to the electorate s growing distrust of politicians and he asserted that spin must cease br Spin doctors such as Shea praised and respected Campbell s work In during the beginning of NATO s intervention in Kosovo Shea s media strategy was non existent before the arrival of Campbell and his team Campbell taught Shea how to organise his team to deliver what he wanted to be in the media which led to Shea being appreciated for his work by President Bill Clinton br br br Techniques br Some spin techniques include br br Selectively presenting facts and quotes that support one s position cherry picking For example a pharmaceutical company could choose only two trials where their product shows a positive effect and ignore hundreds of unsuccessful trials or a politician s staff could handpick short speech quotations from past years which appear to show their candidate s support for a certain position br Non denial denial br Non apology apology br Mistakes were made is an example of distancing language commonly used as a rhetorical device whereby a speaker acknowledges that a situation was managed inappropriately but evades any direct responsibility The expression focuses on the action omitting any actor via the passive voice and mistakes are framed in an indirect sense that does not imply intent A less evasive active voice construction would focus on the actor such as I made mistakes or John Doe made mistakes br Speaking in a way that assumes unproven claims or avoids the question br Burying bad news announcing unpopular things when the media is expected to be focusing on other news In some cases governments have released potentially controversial reports on summer long weekends Sometimes other news is deliberately supplied br Misdirection and diversion This is when a government leaks a story to the news to limit the coverage of a more damaging story that has been circulating New Labour used this tactic to reduce the coverage of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook s affair This was achieved by leaking a story that a previous Governor of Hong Kong was under investigation by MI br Limited hangout br Rewarding like minded or amenable journalists with stories During the Rhodesia crisis of Harold Wilson formulated a list of journalists that he trusted to write stories that aligned with the government s opinion br Preventing access to journalists or broadcasters that are reporting to the disliking of the spin doctor An example is the World at One being ignored by New Labour in the build up to the General election due to an interview they held with Blair that asked difficult questions leading to interviews being handed to other stations br For years businesses have used fake or misleading customer testimonials by editing spinning customers to reflect a much more satisfied experience than was actually the case In the Federal Trade Commission updated their laws to include measures to prohibit this type of spinning and have been enforcing these laws as of late br br br Impact on elections br The extent of the impact of spin doctors is contested though their presence is still recognized in the political environment The General election in the United Kingdom saw a landslide victory for New Labour with a swing from Conservative to Labour with help from newspapers such as The Sun towards which Campbell focused his spinning tactics as he greatly valued their support The famous newspaper headline The Sun Backs Blair was a key turning point in the campaign which provided New Labour with a lot of confidence and hope of increased electoral support The change in political alignment had an impact on the electorate with the number of individuals voting for Labour that read switching newspapers rising by compared to only by those that did not read switching newspapers a study conducted by
