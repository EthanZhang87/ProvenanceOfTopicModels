title: Cognitive bias
id: 47278
A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment Individuals create their own subjective reality from their perception of the input An individual s construction of reality not the objective input may dictate their behavior in the world Thus cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion inaccurate judgment illogical interpretation and irrationality br While cognitive biases may initially appear to be negative some are adaptive They may lead to more effective actions in a given context Furthermore allowing cognitive biases enables faster decisions which can be desirable when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy as illustrated in heuristics Other cognitive biases are a by product of human processing limitations resulting from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms bounded rationality the impact of an individual s constitution and biological state see embodied cognition or simply from a limited capacity for information processing Research suggests that cognitive biases can make individuals more inclined to endorsing pseudoscientific beliefs by requiring less evidence for claims that confirm their preconceptions This can potentially distort their perceptions and lead to inaccurate judgments br A continually evolving list of cognitive biases has been identified over the last six decades of research on human judgment and decision making in cognitive science social psychology and behavioral economics The study of cognitive biases has practical implications for areas including clinical judgment entrepreneurship finance and management br br The notion of cognitive biases was introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in and grew out of their experience of people s innumeracy or inability to reason intuitively with the greater orders of magnitude Tversky Kahneman and colleagues demonstrated several replicable ways in which human judgments and decisions differ from rational choice theory Tversky and Kahneman explained human differences in judgment and decision making in terms of heuristics Heuristics involve mental shortcuts which provide swift estimates about the possibility of uncertain occurrences Heuristics are simple for the brain to compute but sometimes introduce severe and systematic errors For example the representativeness heuristic is defined as The tendency to judge the frequency or likelihood of an occurrence by the extent of which the event resembles the typical case br The Linda Problem illustrates the representativeness heuristic Tversky Kahneman Participants were given a description of Linda that suggests Linda might well be a feminist e g she is said to be concerned about discrimination and social justice issues They were then asked whether they thought Linda was more likely to be a a bank teller or b a bank teller and active in the feminist movement A majority chose answer b Independent of the information given about Linda though the more restrictive answer b is under any circumstance statistically less likely than answer a This is an example of the conjunction fallacy Tversky and Kahneman argued that respondents chose b because it seemed more representative or typical of persons who might fit the description of Linda The representativeness heuristic may lead to errors such as activating stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of others Haselton et al p br Critics of Kahneman and Tversky such as Gerd Gigerenzer alternatively argued that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases They should rather conceive rationality as an adaptive tool not identical to the rules of formal logic or the probability calculus Nevertheless experiments such as the Linda problem grew into heuristics and biases research programs which spread beyond academic psychology into other disciplines including medicine and political science br br Biases can be distinguished on a number of dimensions Examples of cognitive biases include br br Biases specific to groups such as the risky shift versus biases at the individual level br Biases that affect decision making where the desirability of options has to be considered e g sunk costs fallacy br Biases such as illusory correlation that affect judgment of how likely something is or whether one thing is the cause of another br Biases that affect memory such as consistency bias remembering one s past attitudes and behavior as more similar to one s present attitudes br Biases that reflect a subject s motivation for example the desire for a positive self image leading to egocentric bias and the avoidance of unpleasant cognitive dissonance br Other biases are due to the particular way the brain perceives forms memories and makes judgments This distinction is sometimes described as hot cognition versus cold cognition as motivated reasoning can involve a state of arousal Among the cold biases br br some are due to ignoring relevant information e g neglect of probability br some involve a decision or judgment being affected by irrelevant information for example the framing effect where the same problem receives different responses depending on how it is described or the distinction bias where choices presented together have different outcomes than those presented separately and br others give excessive weight to an unimportant but salient feature of the problem e g anchoring br As some biases reflect motivation specifically the motivation to have positive attitudes to oneself It accounts for the fact that many biases are self motivated or self directed e g illusion of asymmetric insight self serving bias There are also biases in how subjects evaluate in groups or out groups evaluating in groups as more diverse and better in many respects even when those groups are arbitrarily defined ingroup bias outgroup homogeneity bias br Some cognitive biases belong to the subgroup of attentional biases which refers to paying increased attention to certain stimuli It has been shown for example that people addicted to alcohol and other drugs pay more attention to drug related stimuli Common psychological tests to measure those biases are the Stroop task and the dot probe task br Individuals susceptibility to some types of cognitive biases can be measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test CRT developed by Shane Frederick br br The following is a list of the more commonly studied cognitive biases br br Many social institutions rely on individuals to make rational judgments br The securities regulation regime largely assumes that all investors act as perfectly rational persons In truth actual investors face cognitive limitations from biases heuristics and framing effects br A fair jury trial for example requires that the jury ignore irrelevant features of the case weigh the relevant features appropriately consider different possibilities open mindedly and resist fallacies such as appeal to emotion The various biases demonstrated in these psychological experiments suggest that people will frequently fail to do all these things However they fail to do so in systematic directional ways that are predictable br In some academic disciplines the study of bias is very popular For instance bias is a wide spread and well studied phenomenon because most decisions that concern the minds and hearts of entrepreneurs are computationally intractable br Cognitive biases can create other issues that arise in everyday life One study showed the connection between cognitive bias specifically approach bias and inhibitory control on how much unhealthy snack food a person would eat They found that the participants who ate more of the unhealthy snack food tended to have less inhibitory control and more reliance on approach bias Others have also hypothesized that cognitive biases could be linked to various eating disorders and how people view their bodies and their body image br It has also been argued that cognitive biases can be used in destructive ways Some believe that there are people in authority who use cognitive biases and heuristics in order to manipulate others so that they can reach their end goals Some medications and other health care treatments rely on cognitive biases in order to persuade others who are susceptible to cognitive biases to use their products Many see this as taking advantage of one s natural struggle of judgement and decision making They also believe that it is the government s responsibility to regulate these misleading ads br Cognitive biases also seem to play a role in property sale price and value Participants in the experiment were shown a residential property Afterwards they were shown another property that was completely unrelated to the first property They were asked to say what they believed the value and the sale price of the second property would be They found that showing the participants an unrelated property did have an effect on how they valued the second property br Cognitive biases can be used in non destructive ways In team science and collective problem solving the superiority bias can be beneficial It leads to a diversity of solutions within a group especially in complex problems by preventing premature consensus on suboptimal solutions This example demonstrates how a cognitive bias typically seen as a hindrance can enhance collective decision making by encouraging a wider exploration of possibilities br br Because they cause systematic errors cognitive biases cannot be compensated for using a wisdom of the crowd technique of averaging answers from several people Debiasing is the reduction of biases in judgment and decision making through incentives nudges and training Cognitive bias mitigation and cognitive bias modification are forms of debiasing specifically applicable to cognitive biases and their effects Reference class forecasting is a method for systematically debiasing estimates and decisions based on what Daniel Kahneman has dubbed the outside view br Similar to Gigerenzer Haselton et al state the content and direction of cognitive biases are not arbitrary p Moreover cognitive biases can be controlled One debiasing technique aims to decrease biases by encouraging individuals to use controlled processing compared to automatic processing In relation to reducing the FAE monetary incentives and informing participants they will be held accountable for their attributions have been linked to the increase of accurate attributions Training has also shown to reduce cognitive bias Carey K Morewedge and colleagues found that research participants exposed to one shot training interventions such as educational videos and debiasing games that taught mitigating strategies exhibited significant reductions in their commission of six cognitive biases immediately and up to months later br Cognitive bias modification refers to the process of modifying cognitive biases in healthy people and also refers to a growing area of psychological non pharmaceutical therapies for anxiety depression and addiction called cognitive bias modification therapy CBMT CBMT is sub group of therapies within a growing area of psychological therapies based on modifying cognitive processes with or without accompanying medication and talk therapy sometimes referred to as applied cognitive processing therapies ACPT Although cognitive bias modification can refer to modifying cognitive processes in healthy individuals CBMT is a growing area of evidence based psychological therapy in which cognitive processes are modified to relieve suffering from serious depression anxiety and addiction CBMT techniques are technology assisted therapies that are delivered via a computer with or without clinician support CBM combines evidence and theory from the cognitive model of anxiety cognitive neuroscience and attentional models br Cognitive bias modification has also been used to help those with obsessive compulsive beliefs and obsessive compulsive disorder This therapy has shown that it decreases the obsessive compulsive beliefs and behaviors br br Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish These include br br Bounded rationality limits on optimization and rationality br Prospect theory br Evolutionary psychology Remnants from evolutionary adaptive mental functions br Mental accounting br Adaptive bias basing decisions on limited information and biasing them based on the costs of being wrong br Attribute substitution making a complex difficult judgment by unconsciously replacing it with an easier judgment br Attribution theory br Salience br Na ve realism br Cognitive dissonance and related br Impression management br Self perception theory br Information processing shortcuts heuristics including br Availability heuristic estimating what is more likely by what is more available in memory which is biased toward vivid unusual or emotionally charged examples br Representativeness heuristic judging probabilities based on resemblance br Affect heuristic basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation of risks and benefits br Emotional and moral motivations deriving for example from br The two factor theory of emotion br The somatic markers hypothesis br Introspection illusion br Misinterpretations or misuse of statistics innumeracy br Social influence br The brain s limited information processing capacity br Noisy information processing distortions during storage in and retrieval from memory For example a Psychological Bulletin article suggests that at least eight seemingly unrelated biases can be produced by the same information theoretic generative mechanism The article shows that noisy deviations in the memory based information processes that convert objective evidence observations into subjective estimates decisions can produce regressive conservatism the belief revision Bayesian conservatism illusory correlations illusory superiority better than average effect and worse than average effect subadditivity effect exaggerated expectation overconfidence and the hard easy effect br br People do appear to have stable individual differences in their susceptibility to decision biases such as overconfidence temporal discounting and bias blind spot That said these stable levels of bias within individuals are possible to change Participants in experiments who watched training videos and played debiasing games showed medium to large reductions both immediately and up to three months later in the extent to which they exhibited susceptibility to six cognitive biases anchoring bias blind spot confirmation bias fundamental attribution error projection bias and representativeness br Individual differences in cognitive bias have also been linked to varying levels of cognitive abilities and functions The Cognitive Reflection Test CRT has been used to help understand the connection between cognitive biases and cognitive ability There have been inconclusive results when using the Cognitive Reflection Test to understand ability However there does seem to be a correlation those who gain a higher score on the Cognitive Reflection Test have higher cognitive ability and rational thinking skills This in turn helps predict the performance on cognitive bias and heuristic tests Those with higher CRT scores tend to be able to answer more correctly on different heuristic and cognitive bias tests and tasks br Age is another individual difference that has an effect on one s ability to be susceptible to cognitive bias Older individuals tend to be more susceptible to cognitive biases and have less cognitive flexibility However older individuals were able to decrease their susceptibility to cognitive biases throughout ongoing trials These experiments had both young and older adults complete a framing task Younger adults had more cognitive flexibility than older adults Cognitive flexibility is linked to helping overcome pre existing biases br br Cognitive bias theory loses the sight of any distinction between reason and bias If every bias can be seen as a reason and every reason can be seen as a bias then the distinction is lost br Criticism against theories of cognitive biases is usually founded in the fact that both sides of a debate often claim the other s thoughts to be subject to human nature and the result of cognitive bias while claiming their own point of view to be above the cognitive bias and the correct way to overcome the issue This rift ties to a more fundamental issue that stems from a lack of consensus in the field thereby creating arguments that can be non falsifiably used to validate any contradicting viewpoint br Gerd Gigerenzer is one of the main opponents to cognitive biases and heuristics Gigerenzer believes that cognitive biases are not biases but rules of thumb or as he would put it gut feelings that can actually help us make accurate decisions in our lives His view shines a much more positive light on cognitive biases than many other researchers Many view cognitive biases and heuristics as irrational ways of making decisions and judgements br br Media related to Cognitive biases at Wikimedia
