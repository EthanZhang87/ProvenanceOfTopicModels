Thomas Ady fl th century was an English physician and humanist who was the author of two sceptical books on witchcraft and witch hunting br His first and best known work br A Candle in the Dark Or A Treatise Concerning the Nature of Witches Witchcraft was used unsuccessfully by George Burroughs formerly the Puritan minister of the parish in his defense during the Salem witch trials Ady s second publication published in was a reprint of his first with a new title A Perfect Discovery of Witches The work could have been re named in honour of Reginald Scot s Discoverie of Witchcraft the first book of its kind in the English language But pamphlets about cases of witchcraft tended to use Discovery in their titles The most strange and admirable discouerie of the three witches of Warboys The vvonderfull discouerie of witches in the countie of Lancaster etc Ady s point is that he discovers what witches really are despite all the accusations innocent His third publication was The Doctrine of Devils proved to be the grand apostacy of these later times An essay tending to rectifie those undue notions and apprehensions men have about daemons and evil spirits br br br A Candle in the Dark br br In A Candle in the Dark Ady attacked current ideas of witchcraft by arguing directly about what the Bible actually says Ady has the intellectual firepower to dispute the significance of words translated simply as witch in the King James Bible deploring the competence of the translators Exodus he explains as meaning that a juggler a fraud who deploys false Miracles to delude and seduce the people to Idolatry should not be suffered to live not witch or sorceress In the first of the book s three parts Ady argues that the well known prohibition against witches in Deuteronomy br br There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch Or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer Authorized King James Version br should be read to define witches as the popish Catholic rout the contrivers of charms to delude the people emphasis in original br He questions why contemporary proofs of witchcraft do not have biblical support see page image br br Where is it written in all the Old and New Testaments that a witch is a murderer or hath power to kill by witchcraft or to afflict with any disease or infirmity Where is it written that witches have biggs nipples for imps to suck on that the devil setteth privy marks upon witches that witches can hurt corn or cattle or can fly in the air Where do we read of a he devil or she devil called incubus or succubus that useth generation or copulation br Ady s anti Catholicism is ferocious If he earnestly wants to end one persecution he is willing to start another br br He that will be zealous for God in obeying the command given in Exod Suffer not a Witch to live must leave his fond ignorant course of teaching people to hang up poor and widows and aged and lame helpless people and must bend his devotion against that Whore of Rome as all the world ought to do as also against the Mahometan Witches among the Turks Therefore it were a good Law in England if duly kept That no Jesuite or Popish Priest should be suffered to live in any part of these Dominions because these Witches are they that bewitch the people where they be tollerated by their several deluding impostures leading the people to Idolatry and also to the undermining of Governments br Ady s view is that the Civil War was God punishing the English for shedding innocent blood in witchcraft persecutions He expresses particular disgust for the techniques of sleep deprivation by which Matthew Hopkins coerced confessions and is indignant about the execution in of an octogenarian minister Master Lewis on the basis of wild stories and purported teats on the old man s body haemorrhoids says Ady br Ady points to both Scotland and Germany as places where the misguided attempt to deflect God s wrath by action against witches has in practice drawn down that very wrath on each nation br In dealing with apparently voluntary confessions Ady takes an enlightened view that those who confess are just melancholics mentally disturbed who have been given by demonology a template to which they conform themselves in their delusions br br Truly if such Doctrins had not been taught to such people formerly their melancholly distempers had not had any such objects to work upon but who shall at last answer for their confession but they that have infected the mindes of common people with such devillish doctrins br This insight anticipates psychological study of those who are acting under a description in the analysis offered by Ian Hacking br Ady writes like a typical th century intellectual a contemporary reader can feel intellectually bludgeoned as his arguments mount up he really does reach as far as a sixteenthly br The third part attacks contemporary writers on witchcraft and demonology Ady suggests the book Daemonologie attributed to King James was ghostwritten by the Bishop of Winchester He also disagrees strongly with Thomas Cooper a bloody persecutor of the poor author of the book The Mystery of Witchcraft and with William Perkins s Discourse of the Damned Art of Witchcraft calling it a collection of mingled notions from Jean Bodin Bartolommeo Spina and other popish blood suckers who wrote great volumes of horrible lies and impossibilities Perkins was a very distinguished puritan divine Ady ingeniously suggests that this posthumously published work by the great man was erroneously put into print and was actually Perkins notes for a refutation of witchcraft belief Ady also corrects John Gaule author of Select Cases of Conscience touching Witches and Witchcrafts making a personal exhortation to the cleric to renounce his errors and Mysmatia the Mag astromancer George Gifford author of A Discourse of the Subtle Practices of Devils by Witches and Sorcerers and A Dialogue Concerning Witches and Witchcrafts is more gently treated as having more spirit of truth in him than many of his clerical profession br The scholar and Police manGeorge Lincoln Burr called A Candle in the Dark one of the bravest and most rational of the early protests br br br Quotes br I will speak of one man that went about in King James his time who called himself the Kings Majesties most excellent Hocus Pocus and so was called because that at the playing of every Trick he used to say Hocus pocus tontus tabantus vade celeriter jubeo a dark composure of words to blinde the eyes of the beholders to make his Trick pass the more currently without discovery Thomas Ady A Candle in the Dark br br This quote from A Candle in the Dark was used an epigraph to Dan Chapman s novel Closed Circuit br br br The Doctrine of Devils br Ady s third publication on witchcraft was published anonymously in It is a powerful rhetorical performance To express his scorn for demonology Ady deploys an informal style developed from Scot s use of ridicule Ady writes in a confrontational way br br This doctrine of the unlimited power of Devils in naturals thus by Christians entertained is the highest and most abominable Apostacy that ever was or can be in respect of Christ Chapter V br I Will not absolutely positively and definitively say it of Demonologers That they worship the Devil directly Let Demonologers look out abroad round but let them look home inward and to themselves too I fear they may find those abominable Idolators nearer home than where they look for them They are not simple or gross Idolators such as worship wood and stone a finer purer neater sprucer sort of Christians Protestants or Papists Angelicks as they would be thought may take themselves by the Nose and say we are the Men Is there any reason ground motive or hint to fasten this to any but them One Apostle saith In the latter times some will obstinately worship Devils That will be the great villany in the latter age The other saith They will give heed to the doctrine of Devils Put both together and this is the result They that give heed to the doctrine of Devils are the great Apostates and obstinate worshippers of the Devil which is the worst and most abominable Idolatry of the latter times or ever was in any time Chapter XIX br Ady is indignant that demonology makes Satan a greater Miracler in To the Reader than Christ He argues flatly against demonic possession passages in the New Testament where Christ drives out devils from possessed people are represented by Ady as the way the gospel writers described Christ healing the mad Nor will he have the hypostatical union of godhead and human nature easily reproduced by devils combining their nature with that of a human being br For Ady the witch hunt is br br Bloody Barbarous Cruel and Murtherous Opinion an Opinion that Butchers up Men and Women without Fear or Wit Sense or Reason Care or Conscience by droves So many in Somerset so many in Lancashire so many in another County Ten Twenty Thirty at a clap Chapter XXIV br Ady insists on the fictiveness of demonology this Babel of Confusion is built merely upon the Sandy Foundation of Tales and Fables Chapter XXVIII It is a product of Demonologistical Winter Tales and Witchcraftical Legendaries Chapter XXX a demonologist would needs prove by Tale upon Tale XXXI br Impatient scornful accusatory by turns Ady s last book shows no diminishing of his anger br br br Influences br Thomas Ady s works are directly influenced by Reginald Scot and his Discoverie of Witchcraft He called Scot the Chief and First Anti demonologist of this Nation at least in his The Doctrine of Devils They are also influenced by works such as Hocus Pocus Junior on juggling and stage magic Works of the period sometimes used specific examples of illusionist tricks to reveal superstition br Ady s works resemble other works on freedom of conscience written at that time particularly Roger Williams s well known The Bloudy Tenant of Persecution for the Cause of Conscience written in Like Ady Williams makes extensive use of scripture to show why religious persecution is wrong br br br Influenced br Ady s Candle in the Dark contains the first record of the nursery rhyme Mathew Mark Luke and John br His book also is one of the earliest references to the origin of the word hocus pocus as a Latin like phrase used by a conjurer to distract his audience from his sleight of hand which also relates to where the word hoax comes from See the articles Hocus Pocus magic and hoax on Wikipedia for more information as well as the etymologies for hoax and hocus pocus br An extract from his book A Candle in the Dark Or A Treatise Concerning the Nature of Witches Witchcraft was used by George Burroughs formerly the minister in the parish in his own defense during the Salem witch trials Cotton Mather comments in hostile fashion in his Wonders of the Invisible World he gave in a paper to the Jury wherein altho he had many times before granted not only that there are Witches but also that the present sufferings of the Countrey are the Effect of horrible Witchcrafts yet he now goes to evince it That there neither are nor ever were Witches that having made a compact with the Divel Can send a Divel to Torment other people at a distance This paper was transcribed out of Ady which the Court presently knew as soon as they heard it But he said he had taken none of it out of any Book for which his evasion afterwards was that a Gentleman gave him the discourse in a manuscript from whence he Transcribed it The Jury brought him in guilty But when he came to die he utterly deny d the Fact whereof he had been thus convicted It is remarkable if it is true that the Court in Salem were so quick to identify an extract from such a witchcraft sceptical text br Ady s books here or Reginald Scot s and Roger Williams works cited earlier resemble books on conscience that came later that also use the Bible notably those of the Christian Abolitionist Movement For instance A Condensed Anti Slavery Bible Argument by George Bourne and God Against Slavery by George B Cheever br br br Life br There is no Oxford Dictionary of National Biography life of Ady and this is a surprising omission Some biographical information about Ady is independent of his writings On June Thomas Ady or Adye of Weathersfield A famous Dr of Physick
