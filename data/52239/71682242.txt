outlets fact checking websites and academic researchers have debunked such claims and officials from every school named by those promoting the hoax have verified that the accusations are false The claims have been described as internet trolling fearmongering and anti transgender rhetoric br The hoax was reported in Prince Edward Island Canada in October and initially thought to be a joke but had to be formally disavowed as misinformation circulated on social media Rumors spread to other Canadian provinces and schools In the United States popular media coverage of the hoax originally revolved around a school in Michigan in December but spread to schools in several other states Ahead of the elections several prominent American politicians and media personalities spread the hoax

boxes for students to defecate or urinate in or planning to do so br br br Background br br Furries are a subculture interested in anthropomorphic animal characters with fandom members frequently often interacting with others through online roleplay art conventions and cosplay Many view the fandom solely as a hobby and do not identify as or perceive themselves to be animals While the fandom is popularly perceived as such it is not innately sexual or fetishistic LGBTQIA identity is substantially over represented among furries compared to the general population br According to Lynn McNeill a folklorist at Utah State University false rumors of furries using litter boxes date back to at least the early s as satire and became a recurring urban legend Sharon Roberts a faculty member at Renison University College and co founder of a furry research group called Furscience had not in a decade of researching furry conventions encountered any instances of furries using litter boxes br School boards in the late s and early s saw heightened controversy described by some as a moral panic or culture war surrounding accommodations for transgender non binary and otherwise gender variant students such as unisex restrooms and allowing students to use bathrooms and participate on sports teams corresponding to their gender identities High rates of suicide and suicidal ideation among transgender youth were also cause for concern In parents and advocacy groups across the U S made a concerted push to ban books from libraries predominantly those discussing race sexuality and gender br In American radio show host Michael L Brown wrote an opinion piece in The Christian Post opposing to transgender accommodations and gender affirming procedures stating if we don t stop this
