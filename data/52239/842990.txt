The Great Moon Hoax also known as the Great Moon Hoax of was a series of six articles published in The Sun a New York newspaper beginning on August about the supposed discovery of life and civilization on the Moon The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir John Herschel and his fictitious companion Andrew Grant br The story was advertised on August as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from The Edinburgh Courant The first in a series of six was published four days later on August These articles were never retracted however on September The Sun admitted the articles were in fact fabricated br br br Hoax br br The headline read br br The articles described animals on the Moon including bison single horned goats mini zebras unicorns bipedal tail less beavers and bat like winged humanoids Vespertilio homo who built temples There were trees oceans and beaches These discoveries were supposedly made with an immense telescope of an entirely new principle The telescope transported to South Africa from New England was said to be many times larger than any other telescope in the world The lens measured feet in diameter and tons in weight br Vespertilio homo can be translated from Latin as man bat bat man or man bats br A reprinted edition of added a second type named the Vespertiliones or the bat men The author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr Andrew Grant the travelling companion and amanuensis of Sir John Herschel but Grant was fictitious br Eventually the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope by means of the Sun causing the lens to act as a burning glass setting fire to the observatory br br br Authorship br br The writer of the article was at first not known to the public Initially authorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke a reporter who in August was working for The Sun Eventually Locke publicly admitted to being the author in in a letter to the weekly paper New World Despite Locke s claims rumours persisted that others were involved in the articles creation br Two other men have been noted in connection with the hoax Jean Nicolas Nicollet a French astronomer travelling in America at the time though he was in Mississippi not New York when the Moon hoax issues appeared and Lewis Gaylord Clark editor of The Knickerbocker a literary magazine However there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax br Assuming that Richard A Locke was the author his intentions were probably first to create a sensational story which would increase sales of The Sun and second to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published Locke had meant for the hoax to act of a satire to show how science can be and is influenced by the thoughts of religion For instance in Franz von Paula Gruithuisen professor of astronomy at Munich University had published a paper titled Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings One theory is that this paper is responsible for inspiring the articles written by Locke br In his paper Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones He also observed lines and geometrical shapes which he felt indicated the existence of walls roads fortifications and cities However a more direct object of Locke s satire was Rev Thomas Dick who was known as The Christian Philosopher after the title of his first book Dick had computed that the Solar System contained trillion inhabitants In fact the Moon alone by his count would contain inhabitants His writings were very popular in America intellectual Ralph Waldo Emerson was one of his fans br br br Reactions br br According to legend The Sun s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before thereby establishing The Sun as a successful paper It brought the journal to international fame and the hoax resembled crime reports that allowed the readers to play detective trying to discover the truth br However the degree to which the hoax increased the paper s circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and even then the newspaper did not issue a retraction br Herschel was initially amused by the hoax noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting He later became annoyed when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious br Edgar Allan Poe claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall and Hans Phaall A Tale published in the Southern Literary Messenger His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke He later published The Balloon Hoax in the same newspaper As well as The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall The story was reprinted in the New York Transcript on September under the headline Lunar Discoveries Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall br Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a balloon in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to Earth The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder In Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series The Literati of New York City which appeared in Godey s Lady s Book br br br Context br The sensational reports of Richard Adams Locke were not out of place in the context of the mass proliferation of penny press newspapers such as the New York Sun which received much of their income from advertisements a business practice made sustainable by large numbers of viewers The Sun was a pioneer when it came to producing shocking and often sensationalist journalism being the first New York newspaper to report on murders suicides personal events and divorces and it was because of stories such as these that the Sun thrived in attracting viewers to their articles and advertisements br The success of such sensational stories as the Great Moon Hoax can be partly attributed to the influence of contemporary speculative science Figures like the Reverend Thomas Dick who claimed that the moon was inhabited by billions of beings had captured the public s imagination in the early th century Locke s hoax played on these popular beliefs presenting them as the latest scientific findings from the well respected astronomer Sir John Herschel which lent the story credibility br br br Legacy br br The
