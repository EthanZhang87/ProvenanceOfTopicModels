The Cent Party also known as the Cent Army or wumao from Chinese lit five dimes are Internet commentators who are paid by the authorities of the People s Republic of China to spread the propaganda of the governing Chinese Communist Party CCP It was created during the early phases of the Internet s rollout to the wider public in China br The name is derived from the fact that such commentators are reportedly paid RMB for every post These commentators create comments or articles on popular Chinese social media networks that are intended to derail discussions which are critical of the CCP promoting narratives that serve the government s interests and insulting or spreading misinformation about political opponents of the Chinese government both domestic and abroad Some of these commentators have labeled themselves ziganwu Chinese short for z d i g nli ng de w m o lit wumao who bring their own dry rations claiming they are not paid by authorities and express their support for the Chinese government out of their own volition br Authors of a paper published in in the American Political Science Review estimate that the Chinese government fabricates million social media posts per year In contrast to common assumptions the Cent Party consists mostly of paid bureaucrats who respond to government directives and rarely defend their government from criticism or engage in direct arguments because the goal of this massive secretive operation is instead to distract the public and change the subject Around percent of the analysed posts involve pro China cheerleading with inspirational slogans and percent involve general praise and suggestions on governmental policies Despite the common allegation of the commentators getting paid for their posts the paper suggested there was no evidence that they are paid anything for their posts instead being required to do so as a part of their official party duties br Research by professors at Harvard Stanford and UC San Diego indicated a massive secretive operation to fill China s Internet with propaganda and has resulted in some million posts written by fake social media accounts representing about percent of the billion posts generated on Chinese social media To maximize their influence such pro government comments are made largely during times of intense online debate and when online protests have a possibility of transforming into real life actions The colloquial term wumao has also been used by some English speakers outside of China as an insult against people with perceived pro CCP bias br br
