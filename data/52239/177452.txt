The Drummer of Tedworth is the case of an alleged poltergeist manifestation in the West Country of England recorded by Joseph Glanvill in his book Saducismus Triumphatus br br br History br Early accounts reported that in a local landowner John Mompesson owner of a house in the town of Tedworth now called Tidworth in Wiltshire had brought a lawsuit against an unlicensed vagrant drummer William Drury whom he accused of collecting money by false pretences After he had won judgment against the drummer the drum was turned over to Mompesson by the local bailiff Mompesson then found his house plagued by nocturnal drumming noises It was alleged that the drummer had brought these plagues of noise upon Mompesson s head by witchcraft Drury was said to have been associated with a band of gypsies br Glanvill who visited the house in had claimed to have heard strange scratching noises under a bed in the children s room br On Christmas Day Samuel Pepys in his diary records his wife Elizabeth reading the story to him He found it to be a strange story of spirits and worth reading indeed br In Glanvill published one of the earlier versions of Saducismus Triumphatus his A Blow at Modern Sadducism To which is added The Relation of the Fam d Disturbance by the Drummer in the House of Mr John Mompesson br br Reverent John Wesley made reference to the Drummer at Tedworth in his journal The famous instance of this which has been spread far and wide was the drumming in Mr Mompesson s house at Tedworth who it was said acknowledged It was all a trick and that he had found out the whole contrivance Not so my eldest brother then at Christ Church Oxon inquired of Mr Mompesson his fellow collegian Whether his father had acknowledged this or not He answered The resort of gentlemen to my father s house was so great he could not bear the expense He therefore took no pains to confute the report that he had found out the cheat although he and I and all the family knew the account which was published to be punctually true br br br Critical reception br In the Whig writer and politician Joseph Addison wrote a play The Drummer inspired by events at Tedworth However he updated the story to the recent War of the Spanish Succession and gave a rational explanation for the ghostly drumming a returning veteran thought killed in action does it to scare off two suitors from his now wealthy widow br Charles Mackay in his Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds considered the phenomena to be undoubtedly fraudulent produced by confederates of the drummer and suggested Mompesson was easily deceived br Amos Norton Craft also suggested that the phenomena were the result of trickery br br We are to remember also that the house of Mr Mompesson contained several servants who doubtless possessed a good degree of human nature Mr Mompesson had caused the arrest and imprisonment of a member of a band of gypsies who were intensely enraged at him on that account that the disturbance ceased as soon as the gypsy was transported beyond the sea and his associates had no farther hope of his release that these manifestations began again as soon as the gypsy returned from transportation that the gypsy professed to be the cause of the disturbance and that the excited imagination would naturally add to the manifestations which the enraged trickster really produced br Addington Bruce has argued that the phenomenon was fraudulently manufactured by Mompesson s own children especially his oldest daughter a girl of ten Bruce wrote that the noises and movement of objects were reminiscent of pranks and often occurred in the children s bedroom Bruce noted that Glanvill passed only one night in the haunted house and of his several experiences there is none that cannot be set down to fraud plus imagination with the children the active agents br Andrew Lang of the Society for Psychical Research wrote that the Drummer was suspected but consciously or not the children were probably the agents br br br See also br Cock Lane ghost br Old Rectory Epworth br br br br br br Further reading br P T Barnum The Humbugs of the World An Account of Humbugs Delusions Impositions Quackeries Deceits and Deceivers Generally in All Ages New York Carleton br Addington Bruce Historic Ghosts and Ghost Hunters New York Moffat Yard Company
