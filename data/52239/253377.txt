of intensive work to expand his publication into a fully comprehensive dictionary An American Dictionary of the English Language To help him trace the etymology of words Webster learned languages Webster hoped to standardize American speech since Americans in different parts of the country used somewhat different vocabularies and spelled pronounced and used words differently br Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in in Paris and at the University of Cambridge His s book contained words of which about had never appeared in a dictionary before As a spelling reformer Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex so his dictionary introduced American English spellings replacing colour with color waggon with wagon and centre with center He also added American words including skunk and squash that did not appear in British dictionaries At the age of in Webster published his dictionary it sold poorly with only copies and put him in debt However in he published the second edition in two volumes with much greater success br br br Merriam as publisher br br In after Webster s death George Merriam and Charles Merriam secured publishing and revision rights to the edition of the dictionary They published a revision in which did not change any of the main text but merely added new sections and a second update with illustrations in In Merriam published a greatly expanded edition which was the first version to change Webster s text largely overhauling his work yet retaining many of his definitions and the title An American Dictionary This began a series of revisions that were described as being unabridged in content In it contained words more than any other English dictionary br With the edition of the dictionary was retitled Webster s International The vocabulary was vastly expanded in Webster s New International editions of and totaling over half a million words with the edition retrospectively called Webster s Second International or simply The Second Edition of the New International br br The Collegiate Dictionary was introduced in and the series is now in its eleventh edition Following the publication of Webster s International in two Collegiate editions were issued as abridgments of each of their Unabridged editions Merriam overhauled the dictionary again with the Webster s Third New International under the direction of Philip B Gove making changes that sparked public controversy Many of these changes were in formatting omitting needless punctuation or avoiding complete sentences when a phrase was sufficient Others more controversial signaled a shift from linguistic prescriptivism and towards describing American English as it was used at that time br With the ninth edition Webster s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary WNNCD published in the Collegiate adopted changes which distinguish it as a separate entity rather than merely an abridgment of the Third New International the main text of which has remained virtually unrevised since Some proper names were returned to the word list including names of Knights of the Round Table The most notable change was the inclusion of the date of the first known citation of each word to document its entry into the English language The eleventh edition published in includes more than definitions and more than entries A CD ROM of the text is sometimes included This dictionary is preferred as a source for general matters of spelling by the influential The Chicago Manual of Style which is followed by many book publishers and magazines in the United States The Chicago Manual states that it normally opts for the first spelling listed br The G C Merriam Company lost its right to exclusive use of the name Webster after a series of lawsuits placed that name in public domain Its name was changed to Merriam Webster Incorporated with the publication of Webster s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary in Previous
