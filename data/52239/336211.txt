The Ern Malley hoax also called the Ern Malley affair is Australia s most famous literary hoax Its name derives from Ernest Lalor Ern Malley a fictitious poet whose biography and body of work were created in one day in by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax the Angry Penguins a modernist art and literary movement centred around a journal of the same name co edited by poet Max Harris and art patron John Reed of Heide Melbourne br Imitating the modernist poetry they despised the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and mailed sixteen poems to Harris under the guise of Ethel Ern Malley s surviving sister Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax and enraptured by the poetry devoted the next issue of Angry Penguins to Malley hailing him as a genius The hoax was revealed soon after resulting in a cause c l bre and the humiliation of Harris who was put on trial convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content Angry Penguins folded in br In the decades that followed the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia Since the s however the Ern Malley poems though known to be a hoax became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right lauded by poets and critics such as John Ashbery Kenneth Koch and Robert Hughes The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists such as Peter Carey and Sidney Nolan American poet and anthologist David Lehman called Ern Malley the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century br br br Background br In James McAuley and Harold Stewart were in the Army Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs Before the war they had been part of Sydney s Bohemian arts world McAuley had acted and sung in left wing revues at Sydney University br Harris was a year old avant garde poet and critic in Adelaide who in at the age of had started Angry Penguins br br br Creating the hoax br br McAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and Angry Penguins by submitting nonsensical poetry to the magazine under the guise of a fictional poet They created a fictional biography for the poet whom they christened Ernest Lalor Malley The name is a highly Australian sounding handle Malley is a pun on the word mallee denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird the native malleefowl Lalor recalls Peter Lalor leader of the Eureka Rebellion The biography stated that Malley had died the year before at the age of The entire body of work attributed to Malley poems none longer than a page and intended to be read in sequence under the title The Darkening Ecliptic was written in a single afternoon The works submitted captured they felt the worst of modernist tendencies br Their writing process as they described it was to write down the first thing that came into their heads lifting words and phrases from the Concise Oxford Dictionary a Collected Shakespeare and a Dictionary of Quotations We opened books at random choosing a word or phrase haphazardly We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences We misquoted and made false allusions We deliberately perpetrated bad verse and selected awkward rhymes from a Ripman s Rhyming Dictionary They also included many bits of their own poetry though in a deliberately disjointed manner br The first poem in the sequence Durer Innsbruck was an unpublished serious effort by McAuley edited to appeal to Harris br br David Brooks theorises in his book The Sons of Clovis Ern Malley Ador Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry that the Ern Malley hoax was modelled on the satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement Les D liquescences d Ador Floupette by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire Stewart claimed to have never heard of Floupette at the time of the Ern Malley hoax and while there is no evidence McAuley had his Masters thesis titled Symbolism an essay in poetics included a study of French Symboliste poetry and poetics br br br Biography of Ern Malley br br According to his inventors fictitious biography Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool England on March His father died in and Malley s mother migrated to Petersham a suburb of Sydney Australia with her two children Ern and his older sister Ethel After his mother s death in August Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic Shortly after his seventeenth birthday he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman and later as a watch repairman Diagnosed with Graves disease sometime in the early s Malley refused treatment He returned to Sydney moving in with his sister in March where he became increasingly ill as well as temperamental and difficult until his death at the age of on July of that same year br Malley s life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings These poems featured a brief preface which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry but showed the poems to a friend who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them Max Harris of Angry Penguins was to be that someone br br br Carrying out the hoax br McAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter purported to be from Ethel containing the poems and asking for his opinion of her late brother s work br Harris read the poems with as he later recalled a mounting sense of excitement Ern Malley he thought was a poet in the same class as W H Auden or Dylan Thomas He showed them to his circle of literary friends who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia He decided to rush out a special edition of Angry Penguins and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan based on the poems for the cover br The Autumn edition of Angry Penguins appeared in June owing to wartime printing delays Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected An article appeared in the University of Adelaide student newspaper On Dit ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax br br br The hoax revealed br br On June the Adelaide Daily Mail raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer Alarmed Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so but by then the Australian national press was on the trail The next week the Sydney Sunday Sun which had been conducting some investigative reporting ran a front page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart br The South Australian police impounded the issue of Angry Penguins devoted to The Darkening Ecliptic on the grounds that Malley s poems were obscene br After the hoax was revealed McAuley and Stewart wrote br br Mr Max Harris and other Angry Penguins writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America The distinctive feature of the fashion it seemed to us was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination Our feeling was that by processes of critical self delusion and mutual admiration the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would be intellectuals and Bohemians both here and abroad as great poetry However it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment It was after all fair enough If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems then the tables would have been turned br br br Immediate impact br The South Australian police prosecuted Harris for publishing immoral and obscene material The only prosecution witness was a police detective whose evidence included the statement I don t know what incestuous means but I think there is a suggestion of indecency about it Despite this and several distinguished expert witnesses arguing for Harris he was found guilty and fined Angry Penguins soon folded br Most people including most educated people with an interest in the arts were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart s experiment The two had deliberately written bad poetry passed it off under a plausible alias to the country s most prominent publisher of modernist poetry and completely taken him in Harris they said could not tell real poetry from fake good from bad br For services to Australian literature Ern Malley was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science in Oxometry by the Sydney University Oxometrical Society br br The Ern Malley hoax had long lasting repercussions To quote the Oxford Companion to Australian Literature More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the Angry Penguins group received a severe setback and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened br br In a interview with Earle Hackett Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first Ned Kelly series saying It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object br br br McAuley Stewart and Harris in later years br McAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and with Richard Krygier founded the literary and cultural journal Quadrant From he was professor of English at the University of Tasmania He died in br Stewart settled permanently in Japan in and published two volumes of haiku poetry translations which became popular in Australia He died in br Harris however once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax made the best of his notoriety From to he published another literary magazine which he called Ern Malley s Journal In as a gesture of defiance he re published the Ern Malley poems maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had intended to do they had in fact produced some memorable poems Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist Harris died in br br br Subsequent re appreciation br The fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity The poems are regularly re published and quoted There have been at least publications of the Darkening Ecliptic either complete or partial It has reappeared not only in Australia but in London Paris Lyons Kyoto New York and Los Angeles with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet br Some literary critics take the view that McAuley and Stewart outsmarted themselves in their concoction of the Ern Malley poems Sometimes the myth is greater than its creators Max Harris wrote Harris of course had a vested interest in Malley but others have agreed with his assessment Robert Hughes wrote br br The basic case made by Ern s defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures that in letting down their guard opening themselves to free association and chance McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side door of parody and though this can t be argued on behalf of all the poems some of which are partly or wholly gibberish it contains a ponderable truth The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value and that is why he continues to haunt our culture br In the Individual Notes on Works and Authors in the Special Collaborations Issue of Locus Solus Kenneth Koch wrote Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley was if one can use that word here I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley s poetry br The American poet John Ashbery said of Ern Malley in a interview in the magazine Jacket br br I think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry which I d never been able to lay my hands on very much until then and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry of which there really wasn t very much in English in America at the time and this poet suited me very well I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course at Brooklyn College NY which I m always rather hard put to do since we haven t really studied anything The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them after first demanding them And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading And anyway they shouldn t have to pass an examination because they re poets who are writing poetry and I don t like the idea of grading poems So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges and one of them is to use one of Malley s poems and another forbiddingly modern poem frequently one of Geoffrey Hill s Mercian Hymns And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet and which one is a put on intended to ridicule modern poetry and what are their reasons And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time identifying the fraud the fraudulent poem br Two exhibitions by major Australian galleries have been based on Ern Malley In the Art Gallery of South Australia s Adelaide Festival Exhibitions included the Sidney Nolan exhibition Ern Malley and Paradise Garden The exhibition Ern Malley The Hoax and Beyond at Heide Museum of Modern Art was the first exhibition to thoroughly investigate the genesis reception and aftermath of the hoax br It has been suggested that Malley is better known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart br In The Washington Post David Lehman wrote br br The Ern Malley affair was the century s greatest literary hoax not because it completely hookwinked sic Harris and not because it triggered off a story so rich in ironies and reversals It was the greatest hoax because the creation of Ern Malley escaped the control of his creators and enjoyed an autonomous existence beyond and at odds with the critical and satirical intentions of McAuley and Stewart They succeeded better than they had known or wished Malley s poems hold up to this day eclipsing anything produced by any of the story s main protagonists in propria persona br br br References to Ern Malley and the hoax br br Sumner Locke Elliott wrote a American television play based on the hoax Daisy Daisy br The Australian historian Humphrey McQueen alluded to the poems in calling his history of modernism in Australia The Black Swan of Trespass br Several works of fiction attribute the poems to a third party who actually wrote them they then fall into the hands of McAuley and Stewart In in Overland Barbara Ker Wilson wrote a short story Black Swan of Trespass in which she has Davydd Davis who presents as an antipodean Dylan Thomas writing the poems Malarky Dry by Ian Kennedy Williams was published in and tells of a sickly insipid Ern who writes a manual of motorcycle maintenance while a boring bureaucrat
