Fear uncertainty and doubt FUD is a manipulative propaganda tactic used in sales marketing public relations politics polling and cults FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and dubious or false information and is a manifestation of the appeal to fear br br br Definition br The term fear uncertainty and doubt appeared as far back as the s whereas the similar formulation doubts fears and uncertainties reaches back to By the term was appearing abbreviated as FUD in marketing and sales contexts as well as in public relations br br One of the messages dealt with is FUD the fear uncertainty and doubt on the part of customer and sales person alike that stifles the approach and greeting br The abbreviation FUD is also alternatively rendered as fear uncertainty and disinformation br FUD was first used with its common current technology related meaning by Gene Amdahl in after he left IBM to found his own company Amdahl Corp br br FUD is the fear uncertainty and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering Amdahl products br This usage of FUD to describe disinformation in the computer hardware industry is said to have led to subsequent popularization of the term br As Eric S Raymond wrote br br The idea of course was to persuade buyers to go with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors equipment This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with IBM but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors equipment or software After the term has become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a competitive weapon br By spreading questionable information about the drawbacks of less well known products an established company can discourage decision makers from choosing those products over its own regardless of the relative technical merits This is a recognized phenomenon epitomized by the traditional axiom of purchasing agents that nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment The aim is to have IT departments buy software they know to be technically inferior because upper management is more likely to recognize the brand br br br Examples br br br Tobacco Industry br br The strategy of deliberately sowing doubts about scientific findings was used by the tobacco industry br br br Software producers br br br Microsoft br From the s onward the term became most often associated with Microsoft Roger Irwin said br br Microsoft soon picked up the art of FUD from IBM and throughout the s used FUD as a primary marketing tool much as IBM had in the previous decade They ended up out FUD ing IBM themselves during the OS vs Win years br In Caldera Inc accused Microsoft of several anti competitive practices including issuing vaporware announcements creating FUD and excluding competitors from participating in beta test programs in order to destroy competition in the DOS market br One of the claims was related to having modified Windows so that it would not run on DR DOS although there were no technical reasons for it not to work This was caused by the so called AARD code some encrypted piece of code which had been found in a number of Microsoft programs The code would fake nonsensical error messages if run on DR DOS like br br Non Fatal error detected error Please contact Windows beta supportPress ENTER to exit or C to continue br If the user chose to press C Windows would continue to run on DR DOS without problems There was speculation that the purpose of this code was to create doubts about DR DOS s compatibility and thereby destroy the product s reputation internal Microsoft memos published as part of the United States v Microsoft antitrust case later confirmed this At one point Microsoft CEO Bill Gates sent a memo to a number of employees reading br br You never sent me a response on the question of what things an app would do that would make it run with MS DOS and not run with DR DOS Is there a feature they have that might get in our way Microsoft Senior Vice President Brad Silverberg later sent another memo stating br What the user is supposed to do is feel uncomfortable and when he has bugs suspect that the problem is DR DOS and then go out to buy MS DOS In Microsoft settled the lawsuit out of court for an undisclosed sum which in was revealed to be million br At around the same time the leaked internal Microsoft Halloween documents stated OSS Open Source Software is long term credible therefore FUD tactics cannot be used to combat it br Open source software and the Linux community in particular are widely perceived as frequent targets of Microsoft s FUD br br Statements about the viral nature of the GNU General Public License GPL br Statements that FOSS Free and open source software infringes on no fewer than Microsoft patents before software patent law precedents were even established br Statements that Windows Server has lower total cost of ownership TCO than Linux in Microsoft s Get The Facts campaign It turned out that they were comparing Linux on a very expensive IBM mainframe to Windows Server on an Intel Xeon based server br A video claimed that OpenOffice org had a higher long term cost of ownership as well as poor interoperability with Microsoft s own office suite The video featured statements such as If an open source freeware solution breaks who s gonna fix it br br br SCO v IBM br br The SCO Group s lawsuit against IBM funded by Microsoft claiming billion in intellectual property infringements by the free software community is an example of FUD according to IBM which argued in its counterclaim that SCO was spreading fear uncertainty and doubt br Magistrate Judge Brooke C Wells wrote and Judge Dale Albert Kimball concurred in her order limiting SCO s claims The court finds SCO s arguments unpersuasive SCO s arguments are akin to SCO telling IBM sorry we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because you already know SCO was required to disclose in detail what it feels IBM misappropriated the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is not placing all the details on the table Certainly if an individual were stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of Neiman Marcus they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that you know what you stole I m not telling Or to simply hand the accused individual a catalog of Neiman Marcus entire inventory and say it s in there somewhere you figure it out br Regarding the matter Darl Charles McBride President and CEO of SCO made the following statements br br IBM has taken our valuable trade secrets and given them away to Linux br We re finding cases where there is line by line code in the Linux kernel that is matching up to our UnixWare code br unless more companies start licensing SCO s property SCO may also sue Linus Torvalds for patent infringement br Both companies IBM and Red Hat have shifted liability to the customer and then taunted us to sue them br We have the ability to go to users with lawsuits and we will if we have to It would be within SCO Group s rights to order every copy of AIX IBM s proprietary UNIX destroyed br As of Friday June we will be done trying to talk to IBM and we will be talking directly to its customers and going in and auditing them IBM no longer has the authority to sell or distribute IBM AIX and customers no longer have the right to use AIX software br If you just drag this out in a typical litigation path where it takes years and years to settle anything and in the meantime you have all this uncertainty clouding over the market br Users are running systems that have basically pirated software inside or stolen software inside of their systems they have liability br SCO stock skyrocketed from under US a share to over US in a matter of weeks in It later dropped to around US then crashed to under cents on August in the aftermath of a ruling that Novell owns the UNIX copyrights br br br Apple br Apple s claim that iPhone jailbreaking could potentially allow hackers to crash cell phone towers was described by Fred von Lohmann a representative of the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF as a kind of theoretical threat more FUD than truth br br br Security industry br br FUD is widely recognized as a tactic to promote the sale or implementation of security products and measures It is possible to find pages describing purely artificial problems Such pages frequently contain links to the demonstrating source code that does not point to any valid location and sometimes even links that will execute malicious code on your machine regardless of current security software leading to pages without any executable code br The drawback to the FUD tactic in this context is that when the stated or implied threats fail to materialize over time the customer or decision maker frequently reacts by withdrawing budgeting or support from future security initiatives br FUD has also been utilized in technical support scams which may use fake error messages to scare unwitting computer users especially the elderly or computer illiterate into paying for a supposed fix for a non existent problem to avoid being framed for criminal charges such as unpaid taxes or in extreme cases false accusations of illegal acts such as child pornography br br br Caltex br The FUD tactic was used by Caltex Australia in According to an internal memo which was subsequently leaked they wished to use FUD to destabilize franchisee confidence and thus get a better deal for Caltex This memo was used as an example of unconscionable behaviour in a Senate inquiry Senior management claimed that it was contrary to and did not reflect company principles br br br Clorox br In Clorox was the subject of both consumer and industry criticism for advertising its Green Works line of allegedly environmentally friendly cleaning products using the slogan Finally Green Works The slogan implied both that green products manufactured by other companies which had been available to consumers prior to the introduction of Clorox s GreenWorks line had all been ineffective and also that the new GreenWorks line was at least as effective as Clorox s existing product lines The intention of this slogan and the associated advertising campaign has been interpreted as appealing to consumers fears that products from companies with less brand recognition are less trustworthy or effective Critics also pointed out that despite its representation of GreenWorks products as green in the sense of being less harmful to the environment and or consumers using them the products contain a number of ingredients advocates of natural products have long campaigned against the use of in household products due to toxicity to humans or their environment All three implicit claims have been disputed and some of their elements disproven by environmental groups consumer protection groups and the industry self regulatory Better Business Bureau br br br See also br br br br
