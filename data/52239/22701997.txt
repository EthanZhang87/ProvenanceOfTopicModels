title: Circular reporting
id: 22701997
Circular reporting or false confirmation is a situation in source criticism where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources but in reality comes from only one source In many cases the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy reporting or intelligence gathering However the situation can also be intentionally contrived by the source or reporter as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information br This problem occurs in a variety of fields including intelligence gathering journalism and scholarly research It is of particular concern in military intelligence because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation and because the chain of reporting is more prone to being obscured It is also a problem in journalism and the development of conspiracy theories in which the primary goal of a source spreading unlikely or hard to believe information is to make it appear to be widely known br The case of the Niger uranium forgeries was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies br br Author Alex Haley grew up hearing the oral history that his family s first ancestor to enter the United States was a young man named Kunta Kinte who lived near the Kamby Bolongo or Gambia River and was kidnapped into slavery when out gathering wood As an adult Haley researched his family genealogy for what would become the novel Roots The Saga of an American Family and he traveled to the Gambia in an attempt to confirm the family history of Kinte Haley told the story of Kinte to a seminar of Gambian tribal experts who searched for a griot an oral historian who might be able to confirm the story Ultimately Haley met a man named Kebba Fofana in the town of Juffure who was able to relate a story of Kunta Kinte that was strikingly similar to Haley s lifelong family history an apparent confirmation that grounded Haley s novel as well as the landmark miniseries adapted from the novel After publication however it was discovered that griot oral histories were not reliable for dates before the th century that Fofana was not a true griot and that Fofana s confirmation of Haley s history was ultimately a retelling of the story Haley himself told Gambian experts br br In the Niger uranium forgeries documents initially released by SISMI the former military intelligence agency of Italy seemed to depict an attempt made by Saddam Hussein in Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium powder from Niger during the Iraq disarmament crisis They were referenced by other intelligence agencies to convince their governments or public that such a purchase had taken place br In the Chairman of the US Senate Report on Pre war Intelligence on Iraq told NBC s Tim Russert that a single informant Curveball had really provided percent of the assessment as to whether or not the Iraqis had a biological weapon This was despite the fact that nobody inside the U S government had ever actually spoken to the informant except for a single Pentagon analyst who concluded the man was an alcoholic and utterly useless as a source br br In early a TV Tropes user named Tunafish claimed that a bug existed in Civilization that caused Gandhi to be much more aggressive Tunafish did not provide any proof The repetition of this false information led to the Nuclear Gandhi internet meme br In Shehroze Chaudhry was identified as an active member of the Islamic State who participated in the killing of several individuals through reporting involving a New York Times podcast among others The podcast and other outlets referenced blog posts authored by Chaudhry starting in The podcast was taken by government officials and others as evidence of the crime however the original posts were unverified and later renounced by the author br br Wikipedia is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting particularly a variant where an unsourced claim in a Wikipedia article is repeated by a reliable source often without citing the article which is then added as a source to the claim on Wikipedia br br The first recorded use of the term citogenesis to describe this phenomenon was in November when Randall Munroe used it in an xkcd comic strip The neologism is attributed as being a homophonic wordplay on cytogenesis the formation development and variation of biological cells br An article in the magazine Slate referenced the four step process described in the comic to raise awareness about citogenesis as facilitated by Wikipedia This type of circular reporting has been described as particularly hard to catch because of the speed of revisions of modern webpages and the lack of as of timestamps in citations and last updated timestamps on pages online br Inspired by the comic Wikipedia editors have since maintained an internal list of citogenesis incidents to monitor its prevalence br Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to be wary of and generally avoid using Wikipedia as a direct source and to focus instead on verifiable information found in an article s cited references Researchers and Wikipedians alike are advised to note the retrieved on date of any web citation to support identification of the earliest source of a claim br br Prominent examples of false claims that were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting br br Wikipedia and The Independent propagated the false information that comedian Sacha Baron Cohen had worked at Goldman Sachs br A student arbitrarily added also known as Brazilian Aardvarks to the article on the coati leading to subsequent commentary on the mammal that mentioned this nickname Outlets repeating the nickname included The Independent the Daily Express the Metro The Daily Telegraph the Daily Mail a book published by the University of Chicago and a scholarly work published by the University of Cambridge br The middle name Wilhelm was falsely added into Karl Theodor zu Guttenberg s name This was propagated by a raft of publications including German and international press br An incorrect release year of was added to the Wikipedia article of the Casio F W watch The BBC repeated this in a article Communication with primary sources repeatedly confirmed a release year but as a reliable secondary source the BBC s use of made the misinformation difficult to remove In KSNV cited this incident as another example of citogenesis The correct year was only restored after that review with the KSNV article becoming cited in the article to support restoring the release date br A statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian Dave Gorman stating that he had taken a career break for a sponsored hitchhike around the Pacific Rim countries When this was questioned an article published at a later date September in The Northern Echo a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence Gorman repudiated the claim in an episode of his UK television show Modern Life Is Goodish first broadcast November br A hoax article about Alan MacMasters purported inventor of the toaster was discovered to have been picked up in news media later used as citations br br Circular reasoning Logical fallacy in which the conclusion provides the premise br Circular reference Series of references where the last object references the first br Don t repeat yourself Principle of software development br Fake news False or misleading information presented as real br Ghost word Word created by error in a dictionary or other authoritative work br Hoax Widespread deliberate fabrication presented as truth br Media echo chamber Situation that reinforces beliefs by repetition inside a closed system br Reliability of
