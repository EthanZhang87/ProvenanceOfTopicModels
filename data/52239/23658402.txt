title: CIA Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory
id: 23658402
The CIA Kennedy assassination is a prominent John F Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory According to ABC News the Central Intelligence Agency CIA is represented in nearly every theory that involves American conspirators The secretive nature of the CIA and the conjecture surrounding the high profile political assassinations in the United States during the s has made the CIA a plausible suspect for some who believe in a conspiracy Conspiracy theorists have ascribed various motives for CIA involvement in the assassination of President Kennedy including Kennedy s firing of CIA director Allen Dulles Kennedy s refusal to provide air support to the Bay of Pigs invasion Kennedy s plan to cut the agency s budget by percent and the belief that the president was weak on communism In the House Select Committee on Assassinations HSCA concluded that the CIA was not involved in the assassination of Kennedy br br John F Kennedy the th President of the United States was assassinated in Dallas Texas on November at around pm In the aftermath several government agencies and panels investigated the circumstances surrounding the assassination and all concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the assassin Oswald was murdered by Mafia associated nightclub owner Jack Ruby before he could be tried in a court of law br The discrepancies between the official investigations and the extraordinary nature of the assassination have led to a variety of theories about how and why Kennedy was assassinated as well as the possibility of a conspiracy br In the House Select Committee on Assassinations HSCA concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy but that a second gunman besides Oswald probably also fired at Kennedy and that a conspiracy was probable The committee s conclusion of a conspiracy was based almost entirely on the results of a forensic analysis of a police dictabelt recording which was later disputed br br In New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison began an investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy Garrison s investigation led him to conclude that a group of right wing extremists were involved with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy Garrison also came to believe that businessman Clay Shaw head of the International Trade Mart in New Orleans was part of the conspiracy On March Garrison arrested and charged Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy br Three days after Shaw s arrest the Italian left wing newspaper Paese Sera published an article alleging that Shaw was linked to the CIA through his involvement in the Centro Mondiale Commerciale CMC a subsidiary of the trade organization Permindex in which Shaw was a board member According to Paese Sera the CMC had been a front organization developed by the CIA for transferring funds to Italy for illegal political espionage activities Paese Sera also reported that the CMC had attempted to depose French President Charles de Gaulle in the early s The newspaper printed other allegations about individuals it said were connected to Permindex including Louis Bloomfield whom it described as an American agent who now plays the role of a businessman from Canada who established secret ties in Rome with Deputies of the Christian Democrats and neo Fascist parties br The allegations were reprinted in various newspapers associated with the Communist parties in Italy l Unit France L Humanit and the Soviet Union Pravda as well as leftist newspapers in Canada and Greece prior to reaching the American press eight weeks later American journalist Max Holland wrote that the KGB planted the original story in Paese Sera citing archives released by Vasili Mitrokhin thereby influencing both Garrison s subsequent accusations against the CIA and Oliver Stone s film JFK On January Shaw was brought to trial on charges of conspiring to assassinate Kennedy and the jury found him not guilty br br Jim Garrison alleged that anti Communist and anti Castro extremists in the CIA plotted the assassination of Kennedy to maintain tension with the Soviet Union and Cuba and to prevent a United States withdrawal from Vietnam James Douglass wrote in JFK and the Unspeakable that the CIA acting upon the orders of conspirators with the military industrial complex killed Kennedy and in the process set up Lee Harvey Oswald as a fall guy Like Garrison Douglass stated that Kennedy was killed because he was turning away from the Cold War and pursuing paths of nuclear disarmament rapprochement with Fidel Castro and withdrawal from the war in Vietnam br Mark Lane author of Rush to Judgment and Plausible Denial and the attorney who defended Liberty Lobby against a defamation suit brought by former CIA agent E Howard Hunt has been described as a leading proponent of the theory that the CIA was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy Others who believe the CIA was involved include authors Anthony Summers and John M Newman br In the FBI released files pertaining to the assassination of Kennedy including an April memorandum from Deputy Director Cartha DeLoach to Associate Director Clyde Tolson that was written less than a month after President Johnson learned from J Edgar Hoover about CIA plots to kill Fidel Castro According to DeLoach LBJ aide Marvin Watson stated that the President had told him in an off moment that he was now convinced there was a plot in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy Watson stated the President felt that the CIA had had something to do with this plot When questioned in during the Church Committee hearings DeLoach told Senator Richard Schweiker that he felt that Watson s statement was sheer speculation br br Gaeton Fonzi was hired as a researcher in by the Church Committee and by the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations HSCA in At the HSCA Fonzi focused on the anti Castro Cuban exile groups and the links that these groups had with the CIA and the Mafia Fonzi obtained testimony from Cuban exile Antonio Veciana that Veciana had once witnessed his CIA contact who Fonzi would later come to believe was David Atlee Phillips conferring with Lee Harvey Oswald Through his research Fonzi became convinced that Phillips had played a key role in the assassination of President Kennedy Fonzi also concluded that as part of the assassination plot Phillips had actively worked to embellish Oswald s image as a communist sympathizer He further concluded that the presence of a possible Oswald impersonator in Mexico City during the period that Oswald himself was in Mexico City may have been orchestrated by Phillips br This evidence first surfaced in testimony given to the HSCA in and through the investigative work of independent journalist Anthony Summers in Summers spoke with a man named Oscar Contreras a law student at National University in Mexico City who said that someone calling himself Lee Harvey Oswald struck up a conversation with him inside a university cafeteria in the fall of The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald had taken a bus trip from Houston to Mexico City and back during September October Contreras described Oswald as over thirty light haired and fairly short a description that did not fit the real Oswald To Fonzi it seemed improbable that the real Oswald would at random start a conversation regarding his difficulties in obtaining a Cuban visa with Contreras a man who belonged to a pro Castro student group and had contacts in the Cuban embassy in Mexico City br Fonzi theorized that there was an Oswald impersonator in Mexico City directed by Phillips during the period that the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald himself had visited the city Fonzi s belief was strengthened by statements from other witnesses On September and again a week later a man identifying himself as Oswald visited the Cuban embassy in Mexico City Consular Eusebio Azcue told Anthony Summers that the real Oswald in no way resembled the Oswald to whom he had spoken to at length Embassy employee Sylvia Duran also told Summers that the real Oswald she eventually saw on film is not like the man I saw here in Mexico City br On October the CIA recorded two tapped telephone calls to the Soviet embassy by a man identified as Oswald The CIA transcriber noted that Oswald spoke in broken Russian The real Oswald was quite fluent in Russian On October the CIA issued a teletype to the FBI the State Department and the Navy regarding Oswald s visits to Mexico City The teletype was accompanied by a photo of a man identified as Oswald who in fact looked nothing like him br On November the day after the assassination of President Kennedy FBI Director J Edgar Hoover s preliminary analysis of the assassination included the following br br The Central Intelligence Agency advised that on October st an extremely sensitive source had reported that an individual identifying himself as Lee Oswald contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City inquiring as to any messages Special agents of this Bureau who have conversed with Oswald in Dallas Texas have observed photographs of the individual referred to above and have listened to a recording of his voice These special agents are of the opinion that the referred to individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald br That same day Hoover had this conversation with the new president Lyndon Johnson br br JOHNSON Have you established any more about the Oswald visit to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico in September br br HOOVER No there s one angle that s very confusing for this reason We have up here the tape and the photograph of the man at the Soviet Embassy using Oswald s name That picture and the tape do not correspond to this man s voice nor to his appearance In other words it appears that there was a second person who was at the Soviet Embassy br Fonzi concluded it was unlikely that the CIA would legitimately not be able to produce a single photograph of the real Oswald as part of the documentation of his trip to Mexico City given that Oswald had made five separate visits to the Soviet and Cuban embassies according to the Warren Commission where the CIA maintained surveillance cameras br br br The three tramps are three men photographed by several Dallas newspapers under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy The men were detained and questioned briefly by the Dallas police They have been the subject of various conspiracy theories including some that allege the three men to be known CIA agents Some of these allegations are listed below br E Howard Hunt is alleged by some to be the oldest of the tramps Hunt was a CIA station chief in Mexico City and was involved in the Bay of Pigs Invasion Hunt later worked as one of President Richard Nixon s White House Plumbers Others believe that the oldest tramp is Chauncey Holt Holt claimed to have been a double agent for the CIA and the Mafia and claimed that his assignment in Dallas was to provide fake Secret Service credentials to people in the vicinity Witness reports state that there were one or more unidentified men in the area claiming to be Secret Service agents Both Dallas police officer Joe Smith and Army veteran Gordon Arnold have claimed to have met a man on or near the grassy knoll who showed them credentials identifying him as a Secret Service agent br br Frank Sturgis is thought by some to be the tall tramp Like E Howard Hunt Sturgis was involved both in the Bay of Pigs invasion and in the Watergate burglary In Sturgis became involved with Marita Lorenz Lorenz would later claim that Sturgis told her that he had participated in a JFK assassination plot In response to her allegations Sturgis denied being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the New York Post Sturgis said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him br The House Select Committee on Assassinations had forensic anthropologists study the photographic evidence The committee claimed that its analysis ruled out E Howard Hunt Frank Sturgis Dan Carswell Fred Lee Chapman and other suspects The Rockefeller Commission concluded that neither Hunt nor Frank Sturgis were in Dallas on the day of the assassination Records released by the Dallas Police Department in identified the three men as Gus Abrams Harold Doyle and John Gedney br br Several conspiracy theorists have named former CIA agent and Watergate figure E Howard Hunt as a possible participant in the Kennedy assassination and some as noted before have alleged that Hunt is one of the three tramps Hunt has taken various magazines to court over accusations with regard to the assassination br In Hunt testified before the United States President s Commission on CIA Activities within the United States that he was in Washington D C on the day of the assassination This testimony was confirmed by Hunt s family and a home employee of the Hunts br In a magazine called The Spotlight ran an article accusing Hunt of being in Dallas on November and of having a role in the assassination Hunt won a libel judgment against the magazine in but this verdict was overturned on appeal The magazine was found not liable when the case was retried in In Hunt was in court again in a libel suit against Liberty Lobby During the trial defense attorney Mark Lane was successful in creating doubt among the jury as to Hunt s location on the day of the Kennedy assassination through depositions from David Atlee Phillips Richard Helms G Gordon Liddy Stansfield Turner and Marita Lorenz as well as through his cross examination of Hunt br In August while in failing health Hunt allegedly confessed to his son of his knowledge of a conspiracy in the JFK assassination However Hunt s health improved and he went on to live four more years Shortly before Hunt s death in he authored an autobiography which implicated Lyndon B Johnson in the assassination suggesting that Johnson had orchestrated the killing with the help of CIA agents who had been angered by Kennedy s actions as president After Hunt s death his sons Saint John Hunt and David Hunt stated that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy br In the April issue of Rolling Stone Saint John Hunt detailed a number of individuals purported to be implicated by his father including Lyndon B Johnson Cord Meyer David Phillips Frank Sturgis David Morales Antonio Veciana William Harvey and an assassin he termed French gunman grassy knoll who some presume was Lucien Sarti The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs to avoid possible perjury charges According to Hunt s widow and other children the two sons took advantage of Hunt s loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain The Los Angeles Times said they examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be inconclusive br br Some researchers among them Gaeton Fonzi Larry Hancock Noel Twyman and John Simkin believe that CIA operative David Morales was involved in the Kennedy assassination Morales friend Ruben Carbajal claimed that in Morales opened up about his involvement with the Bay of Pigs Invasion operation and stated that Kennedy had been responsible for him having to watch all the men he recruited and trained get wiped out Carbajal claimed that Morales said Well we took care of that SOB didn t we br Morales is alleged to have once told friends I was in Dallas when we got the son of a bitch and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little bastard presumably referring to the assassination of President Kennedy in Dallas Texas and to the later assassination of Senator Robert F Kennedy in Los Angeles California on June Morales is alleged to have expressed deep anger toward the Kennedys for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of Pigs Invasion br br In an article published in the South Florida Sun Sentinel on December James Buchanan a former reporter for the Sun Sentinel claimed that Frank Sturgis had met Lee Harvey Oswald in Miami Florida shortly before Kennedy s assassination Buchanan claimed that Oswald had tried to infiltrate the International Anti Communist Brigade When he was questioned by the FBI about this story Sturgis claimed that Buchanan had misquoted him regarding his comments about Oswald br According to a memo sent by L Patrick Gray acting FBI Director to H R Haldeman on June s ources in Miami say he Sturgis is now associated with organized crime activities In his book Assassination of JFK published in Bernard Fensterwald claims that Sturgis was heavily involved with the Mafia particularly with Santo Trafficante s and Meyer Lansky s activities in Florida br br After returning from the Soviet Union Lee Harvey Oswald became friends with Dallas resident and petroleum geologist George de Mohrenschildt Mohrenschildt would later write an extensive memoir in which he discussed his friendship with Oswald Mohrenschildt s wife would later give the House Select Committee on Assassinations a photograph that showed Oswald in his Dallas backyard holding two Marxist newspapers and a Carcano rifle with a pistol on his hip Thirteen years after the JFK assassination in September the CIA requested that the FBI locate Mohrenschildt in response to a letter Mohrenschildt had written to his friend CIA Director George H W Bush appealing to Bush to stop the agency from taking action against him br Several Warren Commission critics including Jesse Ventura have alleged that Mohrenschildt was one of Oswald s CIA handlers but have offered little evidence Jim Garrison referred to Mohrenschildt as one of Oswald s unwitting baby sitters assigned to protect or otherwise see to the general welfare of Oswald On March Mohrenschildt stated during an interview with author Edward Jay Epstein that he had been asked by CIA operative J Walton Moore to meet with Oswald something Mohrenschildt had also told the Warren Commission thirteen years earlier When interviewed in by the House Select Committee on Assassinations J Walton Moore said that while he had periodic contact with Mohrenschildt he had no recollection of any conversation with him concerning Oswald br Mohrenschildt told Epstein that he would not have contacted Oswald had he not been asked to do so Mohrenschildt met with Oswald several times from the summer of to April The same day that Mohrenschildt was interviewed by Epstein Mohrenschildt was informed by his daughter that a representative of the House Select Committee on Assassinations had stopped by and left his calling card intending to return that evening Mohrenschildt then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head shortly thereafter Mohrenschildt s wife later told sheriff s office investigators that her husband had been hospitalized for depression and paranoia in late and had tried to kill himself four times that year br br In the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated President Kennedy and that Oswald acted alone and that there is no evidence that Oswald was involved in any conspiracy directed to the assassination of the President The Commission came to this conclusion after examining Oswald s Marxist and pro Communist background including his defection to Russia the New Orleans branch of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee he had organized and the various public and private statements made by him espousing Marxism br Some conspiracy theorists have argued that Oswald s pro Communist behavior may have been a carefully planned ruse a part of an effort by U S intelligence agencies to infiltrate left wing organizations in the United States and to conduct counterintelligence operations Others have speculated that Oswald was an agent or informant of the U S government and was manipulated by his U S intelligence handlers to incriminate himself while being set up as a scapegoat br Oswald claimed to be innocent denying all charges and even declaring to reporters that he was just a patsy He also insisted that the photos of him with a rifle had been faked an assertion contradicted by statements made by his wife Marina who claimed to have taken the photos and the analysis of FBI photographic experts Some researchers have suggested that Oswald was an active agent of the Central Intelligence Agency pointing to the fact that Oswald attempted to defect to Russia but was nonetheless able to return without difficulty even receiving a repatriation loan from the State Department as evidence of such Oswald s mother Marguerite often insisted that her son was recruited by an agency of the U S Government and sent to Russia New Orleans District Attorney and later judge Jim Garrison who in brought Clay Shaw to trial for the assassination of President Kennedy also held the opinion that Oswald was most likely a CIA agent who had been drawn into the plot to be used as a scapegoat even going as far as to say that Oswald genuinely was probably a hero br Senator Richard Schweiker a member of the U S Senate Select Committee on Intelligence remarked that everywhere you look with Oswald there re fingerprints of intelligence Schweiker also told author David Talbot that Oswald was the product of a fake defector program run by the CIA Richard Sprague interim staff director and chief counsel to the U S House Select Committee on Assassinations stated that if he had to do it over again he would have investigated the Kennedy assassination by probing Oswald s ties to the Central Intelligence Agency br In James Wilcott a former CIA finance officer testified before the HSCA that shortly after the assassination of President Kennedy he was advised by fellow employees at a CIA post abroad that Oswald was a CIA agent who had received financial disbursements under an assigned cryptonym Wilcott was unable to identify the specific case officer who had initially informed him of Oswald s agency relationship nor was he able to recall the name of the cryptonym but he named several employees of the post abroad with whom he believed he had subsequently discussed the allegations Later that year Wilcott and his wife Elsie also a former employee of the CIA repeated those claims in an article in the San Francisco Chronicle The HSCA investigated Wilcott s claims including interviews with the chief and deputy chief of station as well as officers in finance registry the Soviet Branch and counterintelligence and concluded in their report they were not worthy of belief br Despite its official policy of neither confirming nor denying the status of agents both the CIA itself and many officers working in the region at the time including David Atlee Phillips have unofficially dismissed the plausibility of any CIA ties to Oswald Robert Blakey staff director and chief counsel for the U S House Select Committee on Assassinations supported that assessment in his conclusions as well The House Select Committee on Assassinations found no evidence of any relationship between Oswald and the CIA br br Some conspiracy theorists have alleged a plot involving elements of the Mafia the CIA and the anti Castro Cubans including author Anthony Summers and journalist Ruben Castaneda They cite U S government documents which show that beginning in these groups had worked together in assassination attempts against Cuban leader Fidel Castro Ruben Castaneda wrote Based on the evidence it is likely that JFK was killed by a coalition of anti Castro Cubans the Mob and elements of the CIA In his book They Killed Our President former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura also concluded John F Kennedy was murdered by a conspiracy involving disgruntled CIA agents anti Castro Cubans and members of the Mafia all of whom were extremely angry at what they viewed as Kennedy s appeasement policies toward Communist Cuba and the Soviet Union br Jack Van Lanningham a prison cellmate of Mafia boss Carlos Marcello claimed that Marcello confessed to him in to having organized Kennedy s assassination Lanningham also claimed that the FBI covered up the taped confession which he said the FBI had in its possession Robert Blakey who was chief counsel for the House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded in his book The Plot to Kill the President that Marcello was likely part of a Mafia conspiracy behind the assassination and that the Mafia had the means motive and opportunity required to carry it out
