The Ethiopian Empire also formerly known by the exonym Abyssinia or simply known as Ethiopia was a sovereign state that historically encompasses the geographical area of present day Ethiopia and Eritrea from the establishment of the Solomonic dynasty by Yekuno Amlak approximately in until the coup d etat by the Derg which dethroned Emperor Haile Selassie By the empire incorporated other regions such as Hararghe Gurage and Wolayita and saw its largest expansion with the federation of Eritrea in Throughout much of its existence it was surrounded by hostile forces in the African Horn however it managed to develop and preserve a kingdom based on its ancient form of Christianity br Founded in by Yekuno Amlak who claimed to descend from the last Aksumite king and ultimately King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba it replaced the Agaw kingdom of the Zagwe While initially a rather small and politically unstable entity the Empire managed to expand significantly under the crusades of Amda Seyon I and Dawit I temporarily becoming the dominant force in the Horn of Africa The Ethiopian Empire would reach its peak during the long reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob He consolidated the conquests of his predecessors built numerous churches and monasteries encouraged literature and art centralized imperial authority by substituting regional warlords with administrative officials and significantly expanded his hegemony over adjacent Islamic territories br The neighboring Muslim Adal Sultanate began to threaten the empire by repeatedly attempting to invade it finally succeeding under Imam Mahfuz Mahfuz s ambush and defeat by Emperor Lebna Dengel brought about the early th century jihad of the Ottoman supported Adalite Imam Ahmed Gran who was defeated in with the help of the Portuguese Greatly weakened much of the Empire s southern territory and vassals were lost due to the Oromo migrations In the north in what is now Eritrea Ethiopia managed to repulse Ottoman invasion attempts although losing its access to the Red Sea to them Reacting to these challenges in the s Emperor Fasilides founded the new capital of Gondar marking the start of a new golden age known as the Gondarine period It saw relative peace the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture With the deaths of Emperor Iyasu II and Iyoas I the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization known as the Zemene Mesafint where regional warlords fought for power with the emperor being a mere puppet br Emperor Tewodros II r put an end to the Zemene Mesafint reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the British Expedition to Abyssinia His successor Yohannes IV engaged primarily in war and successfully fought the Egyptians and Mahdists before dying against the latter in Emperor Menelik II now residing in Addis Ababa subjugated many peoples and kingdoms in what is now western southern and eastern Ethiopia like Kaffa Welayta Harar and other kingdoms Thus by Ethiopia expanded into its modern territorial boundaries In the northern region he confronted Italy s expansion Through a resounding victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in utilizing modern imported weaponry Menelik ensured Ethiopia s independence and confined Italy to Eritrea br Later after the Second Italo Ethiopian War Benito Mussolini s Italian Empire occupied Ethiopia and established Italian East Africa merging it with neighboring Eritrea and the Italian Somaliland colonies to the south east During World War II the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia with the help of the British army The Emperor returned from exile and the country became one of the founding members of the United Nations However the Wollo famine and domestic discontent led to the fall of the Empire in and the rise of the Derg br br br History br br br Background br br After the fall of the Kingdom of Aksum in the th century AD the Ethiopian Highlands would fall under the rule of the Zagwe Dynasty The new rulers were Agaws that had come from the Lasta region later ecclesiastical texts accused this dynasty of not having pure Solomonic stock and derided their achievements Even at the zenith of their power most Christians would consider them to be usurpers However the architecture of the Zagwe shows a connotation of earlier Aksumite traditions among those can be seen in Lalibela the building of rock hewn churches first appeared in the late Aksumite era and reached its peak under the Zagwe br The Zagwe were not able to stop squabbling over the throne diverting men energy and resources that could have been used to affirm the dynasty s authority By the late th century a young Amhara nobleman named Yekuno Amlak rose to power in Bete Amhara He was strongly supported by the Orthodox Church as he promised to make the church a semi independent institution he had also enjoyed support from the neighboring Muslim Makhzumi dynasty Yekuno Amlak then rebelled against the Zagwe king and defeated him at the Battle of Ansata Taddesse Tamrat argued that this king was Yetbarak but due to a local form of damnatio memoriae his name was removed from the official records A more recent chronicler of Wollo history Getatchew Mekonnen Hasen states that the last Zagwe king deposed by Yekuno Amlak was Na akueto La ab br br br Early Solomonic Period br br Yekuno Amlak would rise to the throne by AD He was allegedly a descendant of the last king of Aksum Dil Na od and hence the royal kings of Aksum Through the Aksumite royal lineage it was also claimed that Yekuno Amlak was a descendant of the biblical king Solomon The canonical form of the claim was set out in legends recorded in the Kebra Nagast a th century text According to this the Queen of Sheba who supposedly came from Aksum visited Jerusalem where she conceived a son with King Solomon On her return to her homeland of Ethiopia she gave birth to the child Menelik I He and his descendants which included the Aksumite royal house ruled Ethiopia until overthrown by the Zagwe usurpers Yekuno Amlak as a supposed direct descendant of Menelik I was therefore claimed to have restored the Solomonic line br Throughout Yekuno Amlak s reign he would enjoy friendly relations with the Muslims He not only had established close ties with the neighboring Makhzumi dynasty but had also made contact with the Rasulids in Yemen and the Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate In a letter sent to the Mamluke Sultan Baybars he would state his intention of friendly cooperation with the Muslims of Arabia and described himself as being a protector of all Muslims in Abyssinia A devout Christian he would order the construction of the church of Genneta Maryam commemorating his work with an inscription that reads By the grace of God I king Yekuno Amlak after I had come to the throne by the will of God built this church br In Yekuno Amlak was succeeded by his son Yagbe u Seyon who wrote a letter the Mamluke Sultan Qalawun asking him to allow the patriarch of Alexandria to send an abuna or metropolitan for the Ethiopian Orthodox Church but also protesting the Sultan s treatment of his Christian subjects in Egypt stating that he was a protector of his own Muslim subjects in Ethiopia Towards the end of his reign Yagbe u refused to appoint one of his sons to be his successors and instead decreed that each of them should rule for one year he was succeeded by his sons in but this agreement immediately broke down by one of his sons Wedem Arad seized the throne Wedem Arad seems to have been in conflict with the neighbouring Sultanate of Ifat who were trying to expand in eastern Shewa br br br Amda Seyon s Conquests br br Wedem Arad was succeeded by his son Amda Seyon I whose reign witnessed the composition of a very detailed and seemingly accurate account of the monarch s various campaigns against his Muslim enemies This was the first of a series of royal chronicles which were written for the Ethiopian Emperors until modern times These royal chronicles provided an unbroken chronological record of the entire medieval period in the Horn of Africa A no less important work produced during his reign was the Fetha Nagast or Law of the Kings which served as the country s legal code Largely based on biblical principles it codified the legal and social ideas of the time and remained in use until the early th century br The warlike emperor of Amda Seyon I conducted many campaigns in Gojjam Damot and Eritrea but his most important campaigns were against his Muslim enemies to the east which shifted the balance of power in favour of the Christians for the next two centuries Around Sultan an Nasir Muhammad of the Mamluk Sultanate based in Cairo began persecuting Copts and destroying their churches Amda Seyon then threatened to divert the flow of the Nile if the sultan did not stop his persecution Haqq ad Din I sultan of Ifat seized and imprisoned an Ethiopian envoy on his way back from Cairo Amda Seyon responded by invading the Sultanate of Ifat killing the sultan sacking the capital and ravaging the Muslim territories taking livestock killing many inhabitants destroying towns and mosques and taking slaves br The Ifat sultan was succeeded by Sabr ad Din I who rallied the Muslims and waged a rebellion against the Ethiopian occupation Amda Seyon responded by launching another campaign against his Muslim adversaries to the east killing the Sultan and campaigning as far as Adal Dawaro and Bali in present day eastern Ethiopia Amda Seyon s conquests significantly expanded the territory of the Ethiopian Empire more than doubling it by size and establishing complete hegemony over the region Relations between the Muslims of the Horn and the Ethiopian Empire seems to have broken down completely around this era with the chronicler referring to the Muslims in the east and along the coast as liars hyenas dogs children of evil who deny the son of Christ br br br Golden age of Solomonic Rule br br Following Amda Seyon s campaigns to the east Most of the Muslims in the Horn would become tributaries to the Ethiopian Empire among them being the Ifat Sultanate Amda Seyon was succeeded by his son Newaya Krestos in Newaya Krestos would put down several Muslim revolts in Adal and Mora Towards the end of his reign he aggressively helped the Patriarch of Alexandria Mark IV who had been imprisoned by As Salih Salih the Sultan of Egypt One step Newaya Krestos took was to imprison the Egyptian merchants in his kingdom the Sultan was forced to back down br In Dawit I succeeded the son of Newaya Krestos Newaya Maryam as Emperor of Ethiopia The tributary state of the Ifat Sultanate had begun to resist Ethiopian hegemony and assert their independence under Sultan Sa ad ad Din II Sultan Sa ad as Din would then raid the Ethiopian frontier provinces capturing much loot and slaves this resulted in Emperor Dawit I declaring all the Muslims of the surrounding region to be enemies of the Lord and invading the Ifat Sultanate After a battle between Sa ad ad Din and the Emperor in which the Ifat army was defeated and no less than elders each of whom carried an iron bar as his insignia of office were killed Sa ad ad Din with his remaining supporters were chased to as far as Zeila on the coast of Somaliland There the Ethiopian army besieged Zeila finally capturing the city and killing Sultan Sa ad ad Din ending the Ifat Sultanate After Sa ad ad Din s death the strength of the Muslims was abated as Egyptian historian al Maqrizi states and then the Amhara settled in the Muslim territories and from the ravaged mosques and they made churches The followers of Islam were said to have been harassed for over twenty years Following this victory Ethiopian power would reach its zenith and this era would become legendary as a golden age of peace and stability for the Ethiopian Empire br However the remaining Walashma returned from their exile in and established the Adal Sultanate centred around the Harar region The Muslims then began to harass Christian held territories in the east prompting Emperor Yeshaq I to dedicate much of his time to defending his eastern peripheral territories he seems to have employed several Egyptian Christian advisors to drill his army and teach them how to make Greek fire These advances were not enough to keep the Muslims at bay and Emperor Yeshaq was soon killed fighting the Adalites in Yeshaq s death was followed by several years of dynastic confusion during which emperors succeeded each other in years However in Zara Yaqob of Ethiopia would establish himself on the throne br During his first years on the throne Zara Yaqob launched a strong campaign against survivals of pagan worship and un Christian practices within the church He also took measures to greatly centralize the administration of the country bringing regions under much tighter imperial control After hearing about the demolition of the Egyptian Debre Mitmaq monastery he ordered a period of national mourning and built a church of the same name in Tegulet He then sent envoys to Egyptian Sultan Sayf ad Din Jaqmaq strongly protesting against the persecution of Egyptian Copts and threaten to divert the flow of the Nile The Sultan would then encourage the Adal Sultanate to invade the province of Dawaro to distract the Emperor however this invasion was repulsed by the Emperor at the Battle of Gomit The Egyptian sultan then had the Patraich of Alexandria severely beaten and threaten to execute him Emperor Zara Yaqob decided to back down and did not move in to Adal territory Zara Yaqob persecuted many idolaters who admitted to worshipping pagan gods these idolators were decapitated in public Zara Yaqob later founded Debre Berhan after seeing a miraculous light that in the sky Believing this was a sign from God showing his approval for his persecution of pagans the emperor ordered a church built on the site and later constructed an extensive palace nearby and a second church dedicated to Saint Cyriacus br Zara Yaqob was succeeded by Baeda Maryam I Emperor Baeda Maryam would give the title of the Queen Mother to Eleni of Ethiopia one of his father s wives She was proved to be an effective member of the royal family and Paul B Henze comments that she was practically co monarch during his reign After the death of Baeda Maryam in he was succeeded by his year old son Eskender to whom Eleni would serve as his regent She would attempt to establish peace with the Adal Sultan Muhammad but could not prevent the Emir of Harar Mahfuz from making raids into Ethiopian territory When Eskender was of age he invaded Adal and sacked its capital Dakkar but was killed in an ambush returning home His successor Emperor Na od was eventually killed defending Ethiopian territory from Adalite raids In Mahfuz invaded the Ethiopian province of Fatager but was killed and ambushed by Emperor Dawit II Lebna Dengel His chronicles state that the Muslim threat was finished and the Emperor return to the highlands as a hero br br br Adal Sultanate Invasion br br In a young imam by the name of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al Ghazi would rise to power in Adal after years of internal strife The Adal Sultanate would stockpile on imported firearms cannons and other advanced weaponry from Arabia and the Ottoman Empire He invaded Ethiopia in and inflicted a heavy defeat on Emperor Dawit II but later withdrew He returned two years later to begin a definite invasion of the empire burning churches forcibly converting Christians and massacring the inhabitants According to the chroniclers everywhere he went his men slew every adult Christian they found and carried off the youths and the maidens and sold them as slaves By the mid s most of Ethiopia was under Adalite occupation and Lebna Dengel fled from mountain fortress to mountain fortress until he finally died of natural causes in Debre Damo br The Emperor was succeeded by his year old son Gelawdewos who faced a desperate situation but rallied his soldiers and people to resist the Muslim invasion By Gelawdewos led a small force of around men resisting in the highlands of Shewa However in four hundred well armed Portuguese musketeers had arrived in Massawa where they were reinforced by small contingents of Ethiopian warriors this modest force made their way across Tigray where they would defeat much larger contingents of Adalite men Alarmed by the success of the Portuguese Gragn would send a petition to the Ottoman Empire and would receive musket armed reinforcements Together with his Turkish allies Gragn would attack the Portuguese camp at Wofla killing of their rank and file including their commander Crist v o da Gama br After the catastrophe at Wofla the surviving Portuguese were able to meet up with Gelawdewos and his army in the Semien Mountains The Emperor did not hesitate to take the offensive and won a major victory at the Battle of Wayna Daga when the fate of Abyssinia was decided by the death of the Imam and the flight of his army The invasion force collapsed and all the Abyssinians who had been cowed by the invaders returned to their former allegiance the reconquest of Christian territories proceeded without encountering any effective opposition br In Gelawdewos was killed attempting to invade Adal Sultanate at the Battle of Fatagar and his severed head was paraded in Adal s capital Harar br br br Early modern period br br The Ottoman Empire occupied parts of Ethiopia from establishing Habesh Eyalet the province of Abyssinia by conquering Massawa the Empire s main port and seizing Suakin from the allied Funj Sultanate in what is now Sudan In the Adal Sultanate attempted to invade Ethiopia again however Sarsa Dengel successfully defended the Ethiopian frontier at the Battle of Webi River br The Ottomans were checked by Emperor Sarsa Dengel s victory and sacking of Arqiqo in thus containing them on a narrow coastline strip The Afar Sultanate maintained the remaining Ethiopian port on the Red Sea at Baylul Oromo migrations through the same period occurred with the movement of a large pastoral population from the southeastern provinces of the Empire A contemporary account was recorded by the monk Abba Bahrey from the Gamo region Subsequently the empire organization changed progressively with faraway provinces taking more independence A remote province such as Bale is last recorded paying tribute to the imperial throne during Yaqob reign br In Emperor Fasilides founded Gondar as a permanent capital which became a highly stable prosperous commercial center This period saw profound achievements in Ethiopian art architecture and innovations such as the construction of the royal complex Fasil Ghebbi and churches that were established around Lake Tana In the arts the Gondarine period saw the creation of diptychs and triptychs murals and illuminated manuscripts mostly with religious motifs The reign of Iyasu the Great was a major period of consolidation It also saw the dispatching of embassies to Louis XIV s France and to Dutch India The Early Modern period was one of intense cultural and artistic creation Notable philosophers from that area are Zera Yacob and Walda Heywat After the death of Iyasu I the empire fell into a period of political turmoil br br br Modern era br br From to the Ethiopian empire passed through a period known as the Princes Era in Amharic Zemene Mesafint This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various Ras equivalent to the English dukes and the Emperor who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of Gondar Both the development of society and culture stagnated in this period Religious conflict both within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and between them and the Muslims were often used as a pretext for mutual strife The Princes Era ended with the reign of Emperor Tewodros II br In following the imprisonment of several missionaries and representatives of the British government the British engaged in the punitive Expedition to Abyssinia against Emperor Tewodros With the backing of most nobles in Ethiopia the campaign was a success for Britain and the Ethiopian Emperor committed suicide rather than surrender br From to the Empire expanded into Eritrea under Yohannes IV King of Tembien whose forces led by Ras Alula won the Ethiopian Egyptian War decisively beating the Egyptian forces at the Battle of Gundet in Hamasien In Menelik king of Shewa invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of Chelenqo In Menelik s general Gobana Dacche also defeated the Hadiya leader Hassan Enjamo and annexed Hadiya territory br The s were marked by the Scramble for Africa Italy seeking a colonial presence in Africa was awarded Eritrea by Britain which led to the Italo Ethiopian War of and the scramble for Eritrea s coastal regions between King Yohannes IV of Tembien and Italy After the death of Emperor Yohannes IV Italy signed a treaty with Shewa an autonomous kingdom within the empire creating the protectorate of Abyssinia br Due to significant differences between the Italian and Amharic translations of the treaty Italy believed they had subsumed Ethiopia as a protectorate while Menelik II of Shewa repudiated the protectorate status in Insulted Italy declared war on Ethiopia in The First Italo Ethiopian War resulted in the Battle of Adwa in which Italy was decisively defeated by the numerically superior Ethiopians As a result the Treaty of Addis Ababa was signed in October which strictly delineated the borders of Eritrea and forced Italy to recognize the independence of Ethiopia Due to the Entoto Reforms which provided the Ethiopian Military with modern rifles many Italian Commanders expressed shock when seeing that some Ethiopians had more advanced rifles than the average Italian Infantryman br Beginning in the s under the reign of the Emperor Menelik II the empire s forces set off from the central province of Shewa to incorporate through conquest inhabited lands to the west east and south of its realm The territories that were annexed included those of the western Oromo non Shoan Oromo Sidama Gurage Wolayta and Dizi Among the imperial troops was Ras Gobena s Shewan Oromo militia Many of the lands that they annexed had never been under the empire s rule with the newly incorporated territories resulting in the modern borders of Ethiopia br Delegations from the United Kingdom and France European powers whose colonial possessions lay next to Ethiopia soon arrived in the Ethiopian capital to negotiate their own treaties with this newly proven power br br br Italian invasion and World War II br br In Italian soldiers commanded by Marshal Emilio De Bono invaded Ethiopia in what is known as the Second Italo Ethiopian War The war lasted seven months before an Italian victory was declared The Ethiopian Empire was occupied into the Italian colony of Italian East Africa The invasion was condemned by the League of Nations though not much was done to end the hostility br During the conflict both Ethiopian and Italian troops committed war crimes Ethiopian troops are known to have made use of Dum Dum bullets in violation of the Hague Conventions and mutilated captured soldiers often with castration Italian troops used sulfur mustard in chemical warfare ignoring the Geneva Protocol that it had signed seven years earlier The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground chemical casualties were reported mostly from mustard gas In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia uniting it with Italy s other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa and Victor Emmanuel III of Italy adopted the title Emperor of Abyssinia br On June Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France as France was in the process of being conquered by Nazi Germany at the time and Benito Mussolini wished to expand Italy s colonial holdings The Italian conquest of British Somaliland in August was successful but the war turned against Italy afterward Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance The British began their own invasion in January with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November ending Italian rule br br br Post War Ethiopia br br On August Haile Selassie abolished the legal basis of slavery throughout the empire and imposed severe penalties including death for slave trading After World War II Ethiopia became a charter member of the United Nations In the Ogaden a region disputed with Somalia was granted to Ethiopia On December the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution V establishing the federation of Eritrea the former Italian colony into Ethiopia Eritrea was to have its own constitution which would provide for ethnic linguistic and cultural balance while Ethiopia was to manage its finances defense and foreign policy br Despite his centralization policies that had been made before World War II Haile Selassie still found himself unable to push for all the programs he wanted In he attempted to institute a progressive tax scheme but this failed due to opposition from the nobility and only a flat tax was passed in he agreed to reduce this as well Ethiopia was still semi feudal and the emperor s attempts to alter its social and economic form by reforming its modes of taxation met with resistance from the nobility and clergy which were eager to resume their privileges in the postwar era Where Haile Selassie actually did succeed in effecting new land taxes the burdens were often passed by the landowners to the peasants Despite his wishes the tax burden remained primarily on the peasants br Between and Haile Selassie worked to establish the autocephaly of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church The Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been headed by the abuna a bishop who answered to the Patriarchate in Egypt Haile Selassie applied to Egypt s Holy Synod in and to establish the independence of Ethiopian bishops and when his appeals were denied he threatened to sever relations with the See of St Mark Finally in Pope Kyrillos VI elevated the Abuna to Patriarch Catholicos The Ethiopian Church remained affiliated with the Alexandrian Church In addition to these efforts Haile Selassie changed the Ethiopian church state relationship by introducing taxation of church lands and by restricting the legal privileges of the clergy who had formerly been tried in their own courts for civil offenses br During the celebrations of his Silver Jubilee in November Haile Selassie introduced a revised constitution whereby he retained effective power while extending political participation to the people by allowing the lower house of parliament to become an elected body Party politics were not provided for Modern educational methods were more widely spread throughout the Empire and the country embarked on a development scheme and plans for modernization tempered by Ethiopian traditions and within the framework of the ancient monarchical structure of the state Haile Selassie compromised when practical with the traditionalists in the nobility and church He also tried to improve relations between the state and ethnic groups and granted autonomy to Afar lands that were difficult to control Still his reforms to end feudalism were slow and weakened by the compromises he made with the entrenched aristocracy The Revised Constitution of has been criticized for reasserting the indisputable power of the monarch and maintaining the relative powerlessness of the peasants br On December while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil his Imperial Guard forces staged an unsuccessful coup briefly proclaiming Haile Selassie s eldest son Asfa Wossen as emperor The coup d tat was crushed by the regular army and police forces The coup attempt lacked broad popular support was denounced by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and was unpopular with the army air force and police Nonetheless the effort to depose the emperor had support among students and the educated classes The coup attempt has been characterized as a pivotal moment in Ethiopian history the point at which Ethiopians for the first time questioned the power of the king to rule without the people s consent Student populations began to empathize with the peasantry and poor and to advocate on their behalf The coup spurred Haile Selassie to accelerate reform which was manifested in the form of land grants to military and police officials br The emperor continued to be a staunch ally of the West while pursuing a firm policy of decolonization in Africa which was still largely under European colonial rule The United Nations conducted a lengthy inquiry regarding the status of Eritrea with the superpowers each vying for a stake in the state s future Britain the administrator at the time suggested the partition of Eritrea between Sudan and Ethiopia separating Christians and Muslims A UN plebiscite voted to to have Eritrea be federated with Ethiopia which was later stipulated on December in resolution V Eritrea would have its own parliament and administration and would be represented in what had been the Ethiopian parliament and would become the federal parliament However Haile Selassie would have none of European attempts to draft a separate Constitution under which Eritrea would be governed and wanted his own Constitution to apply in both Ethiopia and Eritrea In tensions between independence minded Eritreans and Ethiopian forces culminated in the Eritrean War of Independence The emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in br In Haile Selassie presided over the formation of the Organisation of African Unity OAU the precursor of the continent wide African Union AU The new organization would establish its headquarters in Addis Ababa In May of that year Haile Selassie was elected as the OAU s first official chairperson a rotating seat Along with Modibo Ke ta of Mali the Ethiopian leader would later help successfully negotiate the Bamako Accords which brought an end to the border conflict between Morocco and Algeria In Haile Selassie would initiate the concept of the United States of Africa a proposition later taken up by Muammar Gaddafi br Student unrest became a regular feature of Ethiopian life in the s and s Marxism took root in large segments of the Ethiopian intelligentsia particularly among those who had studied abroad and had thus been exposed to radical and left wing sentiments that were becoming popular in other parts of the globe Resistance by conservative elements at the Imperial Court and Parliament and by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church made Haile Selassie s land reform proposals difficult to implement and also damaged the standing of the government costing Haile Selassie much of the goodwill he had once enjoyed This bred resentment among the peasant population Efforts to weaken unions also hurt his image As these issues began to pile up Haile Selassie left much of domestic governance to his Prime Minister Aklilu Habte Wold and concentrated more on foreign affairs br br br Fall of monarchy br br The government s failure to adequately respond to the Wollo famine the growing discontent of urban interest groups and high fuel prices due to the oil crisis led to a revolt in February by the army and civilian populace In June a group of military officers formed the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces Police and Territorial Army also known as the Derg to maintain law and order due to the powerlessness of the civilian government following the widespread mutiny br In July Emperor Haile Selassie gave the Derg key concessions to arrest military and government officials at every level Soon both former Prime Ministers Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte Wold and Endelkachew Makonnen along with most of their cabinets most regional governors many senior military officers and officials of the Imperial court were imprisoned In August after a proposed constitution creating a constitutional monarchy was presented to the Emperor the Derg began a program of dismantling the imperial government to forestall further developments in that direction The Derg deposed and imprisoned the Emperor on September and chose Lieutenant General Aman Andom a popular military leader and a Sandhurst graduate to be acting head of state This was pending the return of Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen from medical treatment in Europe when he would assume the throne as a constitutional monarch However General Aman Andom quarrelled with the radical elements in the Derg over the issue of a new military offensive in Eritrea and their proposal to execute the high officials of Selassie s former government After eliminating units loyal to him the Engineers the Imperial Bodyguard and the Air Force the Derg removed General Aman from power and executed him on November along with some of his supporters and officials of the previous Imperial government br Brigadier General Tafari Benti became the new chairman of the Derg and the head of state The monarchy was formally abolished in March and Marxism Leninism was proclaimed the new ideology of the state Emperor Haile Selassie died under mysterious circumstances on August while his personal physician was absent It is commonly believed that Mengistu Haile Mariam killed him either by ordering it done or by his own hand although the former is more likely br br br Society br According to Bahrey there were ten social groups in the feudal Ethiopia of his time i e at the end of the th century These social groups consisted of the monks the debtera lay officials including judges men at arms giving personal protection to the wives of dignitaries and to princesses the shimaglle who were the lords and hereditary landowners their farm labourers or serfs traders artisans wandering singers and the soldiers who were called chewa According to modern thinking some of these categories are not true classes But at least the shimaglle the serfs the chewa the artisans and the traders constitute definite classes Power was vested in the Emperor and those aristocrats he appointed to execute his power and the power enforcing instrument consisted of a class of soldiers the chewa br br br Military br br From the reign of Amde Tseyon Chewa regiments or legions formed the backbone of the Empire military forces The Ge ez term for these regiments is ewa while the Amharic term is wa The normal size of a regiment was several thousand men Each regiment was allocated a fief Gult to ensure its upkeep ensured by the land revenue br In following the Battle of Gomit the chronicles record that Emperor Zara Yaqob started garrisoning the provinces with Chewa regiments br br Major divisions of the military were br br Regiments at the court under high court officials br Regiments in the provinces under regional Rases or other officials br Regiments in border regions or more autonomous provinces such as Hadiya Bahir Negash Bale under azma who were military officials appointed by the king br One of the Chewa regiments known as the Abe Lahm in Geez or the Weregenu in Oromo lasted and participated to the Battle of Adwa only to be phased out in the s br The modern army was created under Ras Tafari Makonnen in with the formation of the Kebur Zabagna the imperial guard br br br Economy br br The economy consisted of centuries old barter system with primitive money and currency of various kinds until the th century in the framework of feudal system Peasants worked to produce and fixated their activities to taxation marketing infrastructure and agrarian production br In Menelik II established the first bank Bank of Abyssinia following concession from British occupied National Bank of Egypt in December that used to monopolize all government public funds loans print banknotes mint coins and other privileges It expanded branches to Harar Dire Dawa Gore and Dembidolo and agencies in Gambela and transit office in Djibouti In it was renamed as Bank of Ethiopia following paid compensation by Emperor Haile Selassie To promote industrial and manufacturing expansion Haile Selassie with assistance of National Economic Council embarked development plan encompassing three Five Years Master Plan from to Between and Ethiopia enjoyed an annual growth rate in per capita and gross domestic product GDP There was an increase of manufacturing growth rate from in to in with wholesale retail trade transportation and communication sectors increased from to Ethiopia exported around bushels of wheat mainly to the Kingdom of Egypt The Dutch East Indies and Greece The GDP of Ethiopia around was billion before dropping drastically due to the Second Italo Ethiopian War br br br Currency br The most common currency of the earlier periods of Ethiopian history were essential items such as amole salt bars pieces of cloth or iron and later cartridges It s only in the th century that the Maria Theresa Thaler had become the medium of exchange for large transactions until Menelik finally started minting local currency around the turn of the century br br br Government br br As feudalism became the central tenet in the Ethiopian Empire it developed into an authoritarian system with institutionalized social inequality As land became the prime commodity its acquisition became the main driving force behind imperialism especially from the reign of Menelik II onwards br As part of Emperor Haile Selassie s modernization efforts the traditional monarchical regime was reformed through the introduction of the and constitutions which introduced a unitary parliamentary system with two legislative bodies the Chamber of Senate Yeheggue Mewossegna Meker Beth and Chamber of Deputies Yeheggue Memeriya Meker Beth Under the constitution Article no one can be simultaneously a member of both chambers who meet at the beginning or ending of each session br In the parliamentary structure the Chamber of Deputies consisted of members elected every four years whereas the Senate consisted of one half of the Deputies and were appointed by the Emperor in every six years br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br Adejumobi Saheed
