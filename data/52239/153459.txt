An elegy is a poem of serious reflection and in English literature usually a lament for the dead However according to The Oxford Handbook of the Elegy for all of its pervasiveness the elegy remains remarkably ill defined sometimes used as a catch all to denominate texts of a somber or pessimistic tone sometimes as a marker for textual monumentalizing and sometimes strictly as a sign of a lament for the dead br br br History br br The Greek term elege from legos lament originally referred to any verse written in elegiac couplets and covering a wide range of subject matter death love war The term also included epitaphs sad and mournful songs and commemorative verses The Latin elegy of ancient Roman literature was most often erotic or mythological in nature Because of its structural potential for rhetorical effects the elegiac couplet was also used by both Greek and Roman poets for witty humorous and satirical subject matter br Other than epitaphs examples of ancient elegy as a poem of mourning include Catullus s Carmen on his dead brother and elegies by Propertius on his dead mistress Cynthia and a matriarch of the prominent Cornelian family Ovid wrote elegies bemoaning his exile which he likened to a death br br br Literature br br br English br In English literature the more modern and restricted meaning of a lament for a departed beloved or tragic event has been current only since the sixteenth century the broader concept was still employed by John Donne for his elegies written in the early seventeenth century That looser concept is especially evident in the Old English Exeter Book c CE which contains serious meditative and well known poems such as The Wanderer The Seafarer and The Wife s Lament In those elegies the narrators use the lyrical I to describe their own personal and mournful experiences They tell the story of the individual rather than the collective lore of his or her people as epic poetry seeks to tell By the time of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and others the term had come to mean serious meditative poem br br Elegy is a form of poetry natural to the reflective mind It may treat of any subject but it must treat of no subject for itself but always and exclusively with reference to the poet As he will feel regret for the past or desire for the future so sorrow and love became the principal themes of the elegy Elegy presents every thing as lost and gone or absent and future br A famous example of elegy is Thomas Gray s Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard br br br Other languages br In French perhaps the most famous elegy is Le Lac by Alphonse de Lamartine br In Germany the most famous example is Duino Elegies by Rainer Maria Rilke br In the Islamic world namely Shia Islam the most famous examples are elegies written by Sachay Bhai on the Battle of Karbala Elegies written on Husayn ibn Ali and his followers are very common and produced even today br In Spain one of the capital works in Spanish is Coplas por la Muerte de su Padre Stanzas About the Death of His Father written between and by Jorge Manrique br br br Music br Elegy French l gie may denote a type of musical work usually of a sad or somber nature A well known example is the l gie Op by Jules Massenet This was originally written for piano as a student work then he set it as a song and finally it appeared as the Invocation for cello and orchestra a section of his incidental music to Leconte de Lisle s Les rinnyes Other examples include Gabriel Faur s Elegy in C minor op for cello and piano the Elegy Op of Edward Elgar the Elegy for Strings of Benjamin Britten and the first movement Elegy of P teris Vasks s String Quartet No Though not specifically designated an elegy Samuel Barber s Adagio for Strings has an elegiac character br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Casey Brian Genres and Styles in Funeral Music Genres With a Stylistic Topical Lexicon and Transcriptions for a Variety of Instrumental Ensembles University Press Inc br Cavitch Max American Elegy The Poetry of Mourning from the Puritans to Whitman University of Minnesota Press ISBN br Ramazani Jahan Poetry of Mourning The Modern Elegy from Hardy to Heaney University of Chicago Press ISBN br Sacks Peter M The English Elegy Studies in the Genre from Spenser to Yeats Johns Hopkins University Press ISBN br br br External links br Media related to Elegies at Wikimedia Commons br The dictionary definition of elegy at Wiktionary
