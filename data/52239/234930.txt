An International Standard Serial Number ISSN is an eight digit serial number used to uniquely identify a serial publication periodical such as a magazine The ISSN is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title ISSNs are used in ordering cataloging interlibrary loans and other practices in connection with serial literature br The ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization ISO international standard in and published as ISO in ISO subcommittee TC SC is responsible for maintaining the standard br When a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type a different ISSN is assigned to each media type For example many serials are published both in print and electronic media The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN p ISSN and electronic ISSN e ISSN Consequently as defined in ISO every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN ISSN L typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium br br An ISSN is an eight digit code divided by a hyphen into two four digit numbers The last digit which may be zero through nine or an X is a check digit so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits Formally the general form of the ISSN also named ISSN structure or ISSN syntax can be expressed as follows br br where N is in the set a decimal digit character and C is in X or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions PCRE regular expression br br For example the ISSN of the journal Hearing Research is where the final is the check digit that is C To calculate the check digit the following algorithm may be used br br br To confirm the check digit calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number counting from the right If the check digit is X add to the sum The remainder of the sum modulo must be There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN based on the above algorithm br br ISSNs can be encoded in EAN bar codes with a country code compare the country code bookland for ISBNs followed by the main digits of the ISSN the check digit is not included followed by publisher defined digits followed by the EAN check digit which need not match the ISSN check digit br br ISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre based in Paris The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government br br ISSN L is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media As defined by ISO the linking ISSN ISSN L provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource The ISSN L is one of a serial s existing ISSNs so does not change the use or assignment of ordinary ISSNs it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the ISSN L br With ISSN L is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title The use of ISSN L facilitates search retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like OpenURL library catalogues search engines or knowledge bases br br The International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide the ISDS Register International Serials Data System otherwise known as the ISSN Register At the end of the ISSN Register contained records for items The Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web but is available by subscription br br The print version of a serial typically will include the ISSN code as part of the publication information br Most serial websites contain ISSN code information br Derivative lists of publications will often contain ISSN codes these can be found through on line searches with the ISSN code itself or serial title br WorldCat permits searching its catalog by ISSN by entering issn before the code in the query field One can also go directly to an ISSN s record by appending it to https www worldcat org ISSN e g n Search Results This does not query the ISSN Register itself but rather shows whether any WorldCat library holds an item with the given ISSN br br ISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept where ISBNs are assigned to individual books An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole An ISSN unlike the ISBN code is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title containing no information as to the publisher or its location For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change br br Since the ISSN applies to an entire serial other identifiers have been built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes articles or other identifiable components like the table of contents the Publisher Item Identifier PII and the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier SICI br br Separate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media except reproduction microforms Thus the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs and CD ROM versions and web versions require different ISSNs However the same ISSN can be used for different file formats e g PDF and HTML of the same online serial br This media oriented identification of serials made sense in the s In the s and onward with personal computers better screens and the Web it makes sense to consider only content independent of media This content oriented identification of serials was a repressed demand during a decade but no ISSN update or initiative occurred A natural extension for ISSN the unique identification of the articles in the serials was the main demand application An alternative serials contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application the digital object identifier DOI an ISSN independent initiative consolidated in the s br Only later in ISSN L was defined in the new ISSN standard ISO as an ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media br br An ISSN can be encoded as a uniform resource name URN by prefixing it with urn ISSN For example Rail could be referred to as urn ISSN URN namespaces are case sensitive and the ISSN namespace is all caps If the checksum digit is X then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN br br The URNs are content oriented but ISSN is media oriented br br ISSN is not unique when the concept is a journal is a set of contents generally copyrighted content the same journal same contents and same copyrights may have two or more ISSN codes A URN needs to point to unique content a unique journal as a set of contents reference br Example Nature has an ISSN for print and another for the same content on the Web only the oldest is used as a unique identifier As the ISSN is not unique the U S National Library of Medicine needed to create prior to the NLM Unique ID JID br ISSN does not offer resolution mechanisms like a digital object identifier DOI or a URN does so the DOI is used as a URN for articles with for historical reasons no need for an ISSN s existence br Example the DOI name nature can be represented as an HTTP string by https doi org nature and is redirected resolved to the current article s page but there is no ISSN online service like http dx issn org to resolve the ISSN of the journal in this sample br A unique URN for serials simplifies the search recovery and delivery of data for various services including in particular search systems and knowledge databases ISSN L see Linking ISSN above was created to fill this gap br br The two standard categories of media in which serials are most available are print and electronic In metadata contexts e g JATS these may have standard labels br br p ISSN is a standard label for Print ISSN the ISSN for the print media paper version of a serial Usually it is the default media and so the default ISSN br br e ISSN or eISSN is a standard label for Electronic ISSN the ISSN for the electronic media online version of a serial br br ROAD Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources est produced by the ISSN
