WJZ TV channel is a television station in Baltimore Maryland United States serving as the market s CBS outlet It is owned and operated by the network s CBS News and Stations division and maintains studios and offices on Television Hill in the Woodberry section of Baltimore adjacent to the transmission tower it shares with several other Baltimore broadcast outlets br br The station first signed on the air on November as WAAM becoming the third television station in Baltimore behind WBAL TV channel and WMAR TV channel all within just over a year The station was originally owned by Radio Television of Baltimore Inc whose principals were Baltimore businessmen and brothers Ben and Herman Cohen Channel was originally an ABC affiliate the network s fifth outlet to be located on the East Coast It carried a secondary affiliation with the DuMont Television Network until its closure in Both affiliations moved from WMAR TV which became an exclusive CBS affiliate br On the station s second day of operations WAAM broadcast the presidential election returns and various entertainment shows remaining on the air for consecutive hours Channel has been housed in the same studio facility located near Druid Hill Park on what was then known as Malden Hill now known as Television Hill since the station s inception the building was the first in Baltimore specifically designed for television production and broadcasting As a DuMont affiliate WAAM originated many Baltimore Colts games for the network s National Football League coverage br br The Westinghouse Electric Corporation purchased WAAM from the Cohen brothers in May Westinghouse then took control of the station in August of that year and the following month the station changed its callsign to WJZ TV The WJZ call letters had previously resided on ABC s flagship radio television combination in New York City which changed its calls to WABC AM FM TV in However Westinghouse s history with that set of call letters went back even further as it was the original owner of WJZ radio the flagship station of NBC s Blue Network which would eventually become ABC br All of Baltimore s television stations at the time had fairly short transmission towers in the medium s early years channel s original tower was located next to the station s studios In WJZ TV collaborated with WBAL TV and WMAR TV to form a joint venture to build the world s first three pronged candelabra tower Constructed behind the WJZ TV studios and opposite the original channel tower it was the tallest free standing television antenna in the United States at the time of its completion The new tower significantly improved channel s signal coverage in central Maryland and also added new viewers in Pennsylvania Delaware Washington D C and Virginia br WJZ TV nearly lost its ABC affiliation in when the network briefly pursued WBAL TV just as ABC became the most watched broadcast network in prime time in the United States for the first time However WBAL TV declined the ABC affiliation offer due to ABC s last place network evening newscast offerings of the time a situation that would improve in ensuing years keeping ABC on channel br br In June ABC agreed to an affiliation deal with the broadcasting division of the E W Scripps Company which resulted in three of Scripps television stations WMAR TV in Baltimore WFTS TV in Tampa and KNXV TV in Phoenix becoming ABC affiliates ABC agreed to the deal as a condition of keeping its affiliation on Scripps two biggest stations WXYZ TV in Detroit and WEWS in Cleveland Both stations had been heavily courted by CBS which was about to lose two of its longtime affiliates WJBK and WJW to Fox ABC was reluctant to include WMAR then an NBC affiliate in the deal it had been a ratings also ran for over years while WJZ TV was one of the strongest ABC affiliates in the nation However not wanting to be relegated to UHF in two markets with few viable choices for a new affiliate ABC opted to end its year affiliation with channel and move its affiliation to channel br Group W felt betrayed by ABC after so many years of loyalty as channel had been ABC s longest tenured affiliate at the time a distinction that now belongs to WJLA TV in Washington As a safeguard it began to shop for an affiliation deal of its own In the early summer of the station was approached by NBC to negotiate an affiliation agreement with the network to replace WMAR as its Baltimore affiliate Channel station management would later turn the offer down Instead one month later Westinghouse agreed to a long term affiliation contract with CBS resulting in WJZ TV as well as WBZ TV in Boston and KYW TV in Philadelphia switching to CBS Westinghouse s two other television stations KDKA TV in Pittsburgh and KPIX TV in San Francisco were already CBS affiliates The affiliation switch the second in Baltimore television history occurred early on the morning of January Though ABC s affiliation contract with channel did not expire until January starting in all CBS programs preempted by WBAL TV would air on WJZ TV The last ABC prime time program to air on channel was the made for TV movie A Dangerous Affair which was broadcast at p m Eastern Time on January and the final overall ABC program to air on channel was the January edition of ABC World News Now As a result channel became the third station in Baltimore to affiliate with CBS The network had originally affiliated with WMAR TV in before moving to WBAL TV in Almost by default the switches saw the NBC affiliation return to WBAL TV after a year absence br CBS move to WJZ immediately resolved several scheduling issues the network had with WBAL TV The station had picked up half of its Saturday morning programming as well as an hour of daytime programming WJZ TV also picked up the Late Show with David Letterman which had aired on WNUV channel after WBAL passed on it one of the few CBS affiliates to do so Westinghouse then bought CBS on November making WJZ TV a CBS owned and operated station Notably this marked the first time that CBS had wholly owned a television station in the Baltimore Washington corridor it had been minority owner of WTOP TV in Washington now WUSA from to br br WJZ TV used a stylized logo using a font face exclusive to Group W from to It was the last remaining Group W Westinghouse station to utilize the typeface In the CBS eye was added and in the station switched to a silver and gold colored version resembling logo styles used by its sister stations with the WJZ call letters displayed below in squares br CBS extended its usage of the WJZ call sign to radio on November when CBS Radio changed the call signs of two of its Baltimore stations WHFS FM and WJFK AM to WJZ FM and WJZ in reflection of their connection to WJZ TV the changes coincided with the move of WJFK s local sports radio programming including a program co hosted by WJZ TV sports anchor Mark Viviano to WJZ FM On February CBS Radio announced that it would spin off from CBS Corporation and merge with Entercom now Audacy Inc effectively separating WJZ TV from the WJZ radio stations the transaction closed on November br br WJZ TV was the Baltimore area affiliate of the It s Academic high school quiz competition currently on hiatus looking for a TV station in Baltimore since its long time sponsor backed out br Over the years WJZ TV frequently preempted ABC programming in favor of locally produced programs and syndicated content from Westinghouse s broadcasting division Group W such as The Mike Douglas Show and the original version of The Merv Griffin Show notably the former ABC daytime soap opera Dark Shadows was preempted during the mid s From to WJZ TV dropped General Hospital The Newlywed Game and The Dating Game to make room for The Mike Douglas Show the three shows were seen instead on now defunct WMET TV and not telecast in color By WJZ TV re added The Newlywed Game to their schedule During the mid s WJZ TV re added General Hospital and stayed on the station until the switch to WMAR TV in WJZ TV aired The Edge of Night in pattern from its December relocation from CBS to ABC until September the following Monday the soap opera was moved to a one day delay time slot of am where it remained until the series took a two week hiatus in favor of ABC s coverage of the Summer Olympics Despite the preemptions and delays ABC was more than satisfied with channel which was one of its strongest affiliates Additionally Baltimore viewers could watch ABC programs on Washington s WMAL TV WJLA TV channel whose signal decently covers most of the Baltimore area br From to one of the station s highest rated programs was The Buddy Deane Show an in studio teen dance show similar to ABC s American Bandstand which WJZ TV also preempted in favor of the Deane program Deane s program was the inspiration for the John Waters motion picture Hairspray and its subsequent Broadway musical version which in turn has been made into a film br Since becoming a CBS affiliate WJZ TV has carried the network s lineup in pattern with virtually no preemptions except for breaking news emergencies and Orioles baseball games as per an agreement between Group W and CBS Prior to September WJZ TV aired the CBS Evening News on a half hour tape delay due to an hour long p m newscast br br WJZ TV has been the de facto broadcaster for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League airing a majority of the team s contests since CBS acquired rights to the American Football Conference in including their Super Bowl XXXV and XLVII
