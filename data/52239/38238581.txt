id: 38238581
The Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting occurred on December in Newtown Connecticut The perpetrator Adam Lanza fatally shot his mother before murdering students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School and later committed suicide A number of fringe figures have promoted conspiracy theories that doubt or dispute what occurred at Sandy Hook Various conspiracy theorists have claimed for example that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U S government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws br The more common conspiracy theory adopted initially by James Fetzer James Tracy and others and further popularized by Alex Jones denied that the massacre actually occurred asserting that it was faked The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement the news media and crisis actors which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus an Iowa school shooting drill that was canceled in amid threats and public outcry Jones described the shooting incident as synthetic completely fake with actors in my view manufactured it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors br No evidence supports the conspiracy theories which make a number of implausible claims Moreover many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists In the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation accusing them of engaging in a campaign of false cruel and dangerous assertions In Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real br br Some conspiracy theorists claim that the shooting was a hoax and a false flag operation staged by the United States government Others say the attack is being used by politicians to push through new gun control legislation or to otherwise persecute gun owners br Lawyer and dentist Orly Taitz best known for her promotion of Barack Obama citizenship birther conspiracy theories was quoted as asking Was Adam Lanza drugged and hypnotized by his handlers to make him into a killing machine as an excuse as the regime is itching to take all means of self defense from the populace before the economic collapse br Talk show host Clyde Lewis wrote Don t you find it at all interesting that Adam Lanza the alleged shooter at Sandy Hook woke up one day and decided to shoot up a school and kill children at about the same time that Barack Obama told the U N that he would sign the small arms treaty br According to Live Science No one regardless of what side of the gun control issue they are on can deny that guns played a key role in the Sandy Hook killings So the conspiracy theorists must instead challenge the claim that the attack even occurred They believe it s all a hoax to scare people into supporting more gun control and a step toward an outright repeal of the Second Amendment They also found that the vast majority of evidence used by conspiracy theorists to support the concept that Sandy Hook was a hoax is contradictory Snopes com also debunked several claims of alleged United States government involvement in the shootings br br Fetzer Tracy and others have claimed the shooting was a classified training exercise modeled on Operation Closed Campus a full spectrum school shooting drill involving the Department of Homeland Security Iowa emergency management agencies state and local police prosecuting attorneys emergency radio operators emergency medical personnel moulage local doctors and hospitals the Red Cross medical examiners news media reporters and crisis actors that was canceled in amid threats and public outcry br br Press TV the official state media outlet of Iran has promoted various antisemitic conspiracy theories blaming Israeli death squads for the shooting Press TV interviewed Veterans Today website writer Gordon Duff who quoted Michael Harris a former Republican candidate for governor of Arizona who made the Israeli death squads claim Harris has publicly associated with neo Nazi groups in the past and has previously claimed that Israel was responsible for the Norway attacks Duff asserted that the attacks were an act of revenge for the perceived cooling of Israel United States relations under President Obama especially as a response to Obama s decision to nominate former senator Chuck Hagel a perceived critic of Israel for the position of United States Secretary of Defense In another broadcast by Press TV Holocaust denier James H Fetzer claimed that the massacre appears to have been a psy op intended to strike fear in the hearts of Americans that was conducted by agents of Israel br The Washington Post reported that claims broadcast on Press TV contain a large number of obvious logical fallacies typical of Iranian propaganda which has a well earned reputation for incendiary anti Israel stories and for wild conspiracy theories The Atlantic wrote that the story obviously plays on the worst fears of those who believe in secret Jewish cabals that run the world but it s a pretty pathetic attempt at slander even for Iran br br Ben Swann a Cincinnati news anchor for Fox affiliate WXIX TV has suggested on his personal YouTube channel that Adam Lanza was accompanied by another shooter he has made similar claims about the Aurora shooting and the Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting from earlier in Other conspiracy theorists have claimed that as many as four shooters were present br There is no credible evidence that any additional shooters were present at the event Some such reports may have been influenced by confused early news reports of the events br br Other conspiracy theories have focused on the claim that Adam Lanza s father was an executive with GE Energy Financial Services According to these theories Lanza s father was supposed to testify before the Senate Banking Committee with information about the Libor scandal However no such hearings were scheduled Similar claims had been made about the father of James Holmes the convicted perpetrator of the Aurora Colorado shooting br br Conspiracy theories have claimed that various timestamps for creation dates whois records and Google caches of various memorial websites fundraising sites and Facebook were created before or immediately after the date and time of the shooting and are therefore evidence of a conspiracy or cover up However timestamps are frequently incorrect particularly on search engines Some timestamps are initially created and assigned to URLs that are then repurposed meaning that a URL linked to a current event can have a much older date br br In September conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who runs the website InfoWars which had previously claimed that the murders were a false flag attack perpetrated by the government made a new conspiracy claim that no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary School because the Uniform Crime Reports showed no murders in Newtown for and that the victims were child actors This claim is false and misrepresents the FBI report In reality because the Connecticut State Police was the lead investigator after the attack the Sandy Hook victims were included in Connecticut s statewide records under State Police Misc rather than under the Newtown statistics br In November Erica L Lafferty daughter of Dawn Lafferty Hochsprung the school principal who was shot and killed at Sandy Hook School wrote open letters to then President elect Donald Trump published in Medium and USA Today calling upon him to denounce Jones after Trump had appeared on InfoWars during his presidential campaign and lavished praise on its presenter saying that the conspiracy theorist had an amazing reputation and pledging not to let him down On February the Newtown School Board wrote to President Trump and urged him to recognize the murders of people at Sandy Hook and to remove your support from anyone who continues to insist that the tragedy was staged or not real Trump did not respond to the letter br On April parents of two victims of the shooting sued Jones in Travis County Texas where Jones media company is based for million each The trial was expected to be scheduled by the end of br On May six families of victims of the shooting as well as an FBI agent who responded to the attack filed a defamation lawsuit in Bridgeport Superior Court in Connecticut against Jones for his role in spreading conspiracy theories about the shooting br In a deposition in the last week of March Jones acknowledged the deaths were real stating he had almost like a form of psychosis where he basically thought everything was staged br By Jones did not provide information to support his claims defaulting in favor of the plaintiffs br br James Tracy a former professor at Florida Atlantic University FAU who taught a course on conspiracy theories has suggested the shooting either did not actually occur or occurred very differently than accounted in mainstream reports claiming political motives for the coverup FAU president Mary Jane Saunders issued a statement that Tracy s views were not shared by the university In response to his comments the university opened an investigation of Tracy who had tenure br In December after the family of Noah Pozner one of the children murdered at Sandy Hook claimed that Tracy had harassed them FAU moved to fire Tracy Chan Lowe of the Sun Sentinel speculated that the comments were a publicity stunt by Tracy Tracy later declined an appearance on CNN with Anderson Cooper suggesting that Cooper wanted to bring him and his family members harm by identifying him in a prior broadcast The university fired Tracy on January citing his refusal to file required paperwork related to outside employment for several years br br In James Fetzer and Mike Palacek published the book Nobody Died at Sandy Hook which claimed that the event was a classified Federal Emergency Management Agency drill involving federal and local law enforcement and the media and that the government had created false death certificates to claim there were victims Fetzer stated that the parents displayed old photos of their real children and made up new names for the photo subjects thereby creating non existent younger siblings Fetzer also claimed that several of these older age real children who were unnamed and billed as Newtown s Children sang America the Beautiful at the Super Bowl with Jennifer Hudson arguing there were strong facial similarities with the victims Lenny Pozner father of victim Noah Pozner filed a defamation lawsuit against Fetzer and Palacek Pozner won a summary judgement from the court in June The book s publisher Moon Rock Books apologized to the Pozner family and agreed to take the book out of circulation at the end of June On October a jury awarded Leonard Pozner for defamation by James Fetzer Fetzer announced his intention to appeal against the decision A video similarly questioning official accounts of the shooting received several million views on YouTube within a week of its posting although the video has since been modified to display a disclaimer explaining that its creators in no way claim this shooting never took place or that people did not lose their lives br br Other sources have continued to claim that the entire event was a hoax On September during a political debate Colorado Republican Party candidate Tom Ready who was running for Pueblo County Commission was accused by his opponent Sal Pace of posting an article on his Facebook page claiming the Sandy Hook shootings never happened Ready responded Well there is some question of whether it happened Sal This was followed by more statements of the same tenor prompting outraged yells from the audience After allegedly receiving a death threat the next day Ready reportedly apologized for his remarks br Other conspiracy theorists have tried to connect the shooting to references in popular culture Prison Planet a website owned by British conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson mentioned that Newtown based author Suzanne Collins wrote The Hunger Games books in which children are ritualistically killed while children were killed in the shooting Some conspiracy theorists have referred to this as predictive programming Others pointed out that Sandy Hook can be seen on a map of Gotham City in the Batman film The Dark Knight Rises the New Jersey peninsula just south of New York Harbor is named Sandy Hook br Several conspiracy theorists have also claimed a six year old victim of the shooting subsequently appeared in a photograph with President Barack Obama In fact the child in the photograph is actually the victim s sister wearing her deceased sister s dress br br Writing about the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories Benjamin Radford argued that most conspiracy theorists who allege contradictions in official accounts ignore contradictions in their own accounts citing research from the University of Kent that conspiracy theorists selectively focus on or ignore particular details in order to fit their preferred narrative The conspiracy theories have also been called evidence of the need for a national debate on mental illness br The debunking website Snopes ran an editorial debunking the Sandy Hook Exposed video explaining how many of the theories make little sense and answered many questions conspiracy theorists wanted answers to br br Gene Rosen a Newtown resident who was reported to have sheltered six Sandy Hook students and a bus driver in his home during the shooting has been subject to harassment online alleging he was complicit in a government coverup among other things Some journalists have cited such incidents as part of a Sandy Hook Truther Movement analogous to the Truth movement A writer for the Calgary Herald reported that the movement self identifies as Operation Terror br In May Andrew David Truelove stole a memorial sign from playgrounds dedicated to victims Grace McDonnell and Chase Kowalski He then went on to call the parents of Grace McDonnell proclaiming that he stole the sign and that he believed their deaths were a hoax He was arrested on May and the signs were found in his home Truelove was convicted of the theft and sentenced to one year in prison br After doing a CNN interview on the day after the shooting Robbie Parker the father of victim Emilie Parker became the target of conspiracy theorists who claimed the interview was staged Parker has been attacked by theorists who believe he is a crisis actor and was getting into character before going on CNN to grieve over the loss of his child br In April Matthew Mills a man from Brooklyn accepted a plea agreement with prosecutors on one count of interfering with police arising from an incident in November when Mills angrily approached the sister of murdered teacher Victoria Soto who is regarded as a heroine for her attempt to protect her students from the shooter in the Sandy Hook attack shoved a photograph in her face and began angrily charging that not only did the Sandy Hook tragedy not take place but that Victoria Soto never existed Mills entered an Alford plea and was thus found guilty he was given a suspended sentence of one year in jail and two years probation br In December Lucy Richards a woman from Tampa was charged with four counts of transmitting threats in interstate commerce for sending death threats to Lenny Pozner whose son Noah was the youngest of children murdered Pozner has been particularly targeted by Internet trolls and conspiracy theorists because he has vocally fought back against them Richards had been expected to plead guilty to one count of transmitting threats with both the prosecution and defense to recommend a sentence of probation and house arrest However in March Richards who was free on bond failed to show up to court for a change of plea hearing and sentencing An arrest warrant was issued Richards bond was revoked and she was soon apprehended On June Richards was sentenced to five months imprisonment br Lenny Pozner the father of Sandy Hook victim Noah Pozner founded an organization called the HONR Network which takes legal action against harassers of Sandy Hook survivors and families br Wolfgang Halbig a past contributor to InfoWars was arrested in January for unauthorized possession of personal information of Lenny Pozner Halbig had illegally obtained Pozner s private information and attempted to dox Pozner by sending those to a long list of recipients Under Florida law unauthorized possession of such information carries a maximum prison term of one year br br Gun politics in the United States br List of conspiracy theories br Reactions to the Sandy Hook Elementary School
