party purposes alone went abroad and had no doubt considerable influence on the conduct of foreign nations br br br Electioneering br The Argus of Western America Frankfort Kentucky related on November that br br The practice of giving false news for electioneering purposes in this country originated with the National Intelligencer Its servile co workers abroad of the Henry Clay school of politics have adopted it and the confident tone in which they now utter falsehoods proves that the opposition rest their hopes of success upon the gullibility of their readers Those Siamese twins the

appearance of truth br br br Civil War through Gilded Age br br br Telegraphers br An editorial in the Memphis Daily Avalanche of Tennessee recommended legislating a penal offense to send false news over the telegraph line The editorial noted however that it would be unjust to reproach the telegraph company or agents for the telegraph is a simple agent for the conveyance of news and is no more

the suspicion that some pretty high parties have been attempted to operate in the gold market Italics in the original Correspondents here endeavored in vain yesterday to telegraph to their friends

conspirators on Wall Street Financier Gould was principal owner of the Tribune According to the Philadelphia Times the New York Evening Post however did the cause of honest journalism a good service in unearthing a statute which seems to fit the case of Gould exactly The law forbade anybody from circulating false intelligence with the intent of depreciating or advancing the market price of stocks bonds merchandise or commodity The penalty was set at a fine of not exceeding five thousand dollars and imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years or either br The Philadelphia Times continued br br It would be well for Gould to paste this law in his hat His enormous profits on his last speculation through the dissemination of false news would enable him to pay the fine without pain to his pocket but the imprisonment would give him some discomfort and the country some satisfaction br br br Presidential election results br Five years later the New York Tribune was accused by The Journal of Commerce with willful and deliberate forgery in printing false news concerning New York State s results in the Presidential election The New York Times urged that the State legislature

reported that br br Hong Kong is the headquarters of fake news from the Philippines just as Shanghai is the source of most of the fake news about Pekin and Chinese massacres There is a vicious and industrious Filipino junta at Hong Kong with a malicious Englishman at the head of it which manufactures the sensational news regarding American atrocities in Luzon and sends them out for the benefit of anti expansionists and Democratic organs in this country the United States br br br Treasury Secretary Shaw br A headline writer for the Washington D C Times labeled a story about Secretary of the Treasury L M Shaw a Good Example of Fake News over a July article reporting that Shaw had specifically stated on several occasions his belief that all officers of the Treasury should be limited in
