Magic which encompasses the subgenres of illusion stage magic and close up magic among others is a performing art in which audiences are entertained by tricks effects or illusions of seemingly impossible feats using natural means It is to be distinguished from paranormal magic which are effects claimed to be created through supernatural means It is one of the oldest performing arts in the world br Modern entertainment magic as pioneered by th century magician Jean Eug ne Robert Houdin has become a popular theatrical art form In the late th and early th centuries magicians such as John Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant Howard Thurston Harry Kellar and Harry Houdini achieved widespread commercial success during what has become known as the Golden Age of Magic a period in which performance magic became a staple of Broadway theatre vaudeville and music halls Meanwhile magicians such as Georges M li s Gaston Velle Walter R Booth and Orson Welles introduced pioneering filmmaking techniques informed by their knowledge of magic br Magic has retained its popularity into the st century by adapting to the mediums of television and the internet with magicians such as David Copperfield Penn Teller Paul Daniels Criss Angel David Blaine Derren Brown and Shin Lim modernizing the art form Through the use of social media magicians can now reach a wider audience than ever before br Magicians are known for closely guarding the methods they use to achieve their effects although they often share their techniques through both formal and informal training within the magic community Magicians use a variety of techniques including sleight of hand misdirection optical and auditory illusions and specially constructed props as well as verbal and nonverbal psychological techniques such as suggestion hypnosis and priming br br br History br br The term magic etymologically derives from the Greek word mageia In ancient times Greeks and Persians had been at war for centuries and the Persian priests called magosh in Persian came to be known as magoi in Greek Ritual acts of Persian priests came to be known as mageia and then magika which eventually came to mean any foreign unorthodox or illegitimate ritual practice To the general public successful acts of illusion could be perceived as if it were similar to a feat of magic supposed to have been able to be performed by the ancient magoi The performance of tricks of illusion or magical illusion and the apparent workings and effects of such acts have often been referred to as magic and particularly as magic tricks br One of the earliest known books to explain magic secrets The Discoverie of Witchcraft was published in It was created by Reginald Scot to stop people from being killed for witchcraft During the th century many books were published that described magic tricks Until the th century magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs The Father of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eug ne Robert Houdin who had a magic theatre in Paris in John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London in the s Towards the end of the th century large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm As a form of entertainment magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television magic specials br Performances that modern observers would recognize as conjuring have been practiced throughout history For example a trick with three cups and balls has been performed since BC and is still performed today on stage and in street magic shows For many recorded centuries magicians were associated with the devil and the occult During the th and th centuries many stage magicians even capitalized on this notion in their advertisements The same level of ingenuity that was used to produce famous ancient deceptions such as the Trojan Horse would also have been used for entertainment or at least for cheating in money games They were also used by the practitioners of various religions and cults from ancient times onwards to frighten uneducated people into obedience or turn them into adherents However the profession of the illusionist gained strength only in the th century and has enjoyed several popular vogues since br br br Magic tricks br br Opinions vary among magicians on how to categorize a given effect but a number of categories have been developed Magicians may pull a rabbit from an empty hat make something seem to disappear or transform a red silk handkerchief into a green silk handkerchief Magicians may also destroy something like cutting a head off and then restore it make something appear to move from one place to another or they may escape from a restraining device Other illusions include making something appear to defy gravity making a solid object appear to pass through another object or appearing to predict the choice of a spectator Many magic routines use combinations of effects br br Among the earliest books on the subject is Gantziony s work of Natural and Unnatural Magic which describes and explains old time tricks In Englishman Reginald Scot published The Discoverie of Witchcraft part of which was devoted to debunking the claims that magicians used supernatural methods and showing how their magic tricks were in reality accomplished Among the tricks discussed were sleight of hand manipulations with rope paper and coins At the time fear and belief in witchcraft was widespread and the book tried to demonstrate that these fears were misplaced Popular belief held that all obtainable copies were burned on the accession of James I in br During the th century many similar books were published that described in detail the methods of a number of magic tricks including The Art of Conjuring and The Anatomy of Legerdemain The Art of Juggling c br br Until the th century magic shows were a common source of entertainment at fairs where itinerant performers would entertain the public with magic tricks as well as the more traditional spectacles of sword swallowing juggling and fire breathing In the early th century as belief in witchcraft was waning the art became increasingly respectable and shows would be put on for rich private patrons A notable figure in this transition was the English showman Isaac Fawkes who began to promote his act in advertisements from the s he even claimed to have performed for King George II One of Fawkes advertisements described his routine in some detail br br He takes an empty bag lays it on the Table and turns it several times inside out then commands Eggs out of it and several showers of real Gold and silver then the Bag beginning to swell several sorts of wild fowl run out of it upon the Table He throws up a Pack of Cards and causes them to be living birds flying about the room He causes living Beasts Birds and other Creatures to appear upon the Table He blows the spots of the Cards off and on and changes them to any pictures br From to Jacob Philadelphia performed feats of magic sometimes under the guise of scientific exhibitions throughout Europe and in Russia br br br Modern stage magic br br The Father of modern entertainment magic was Jean Eug ne Robert Houdin originally a clockmaker who opened a magic theatre in Paris in He transformed his art from one performed at fairs to a performance that the public paid to see at the theatre His speciality was constructing mechanical automata that appeared to move and act as if alive Many of Robert Houdin s mechanisms for illusion were pirated by his assistant and ended up in the performances of his rivals John Henry Anderson and Alexander Herrmann br John Henry Anderson was pioneering the same transition in London In he opened the New Strand Theatre where he performed as The Great Wizard of the North His success came from advertising his shows and captivating his audience with expert showmanship He became one of the earliest magicians to attain a high level of world renown He opened a second theatre in Glasgow in br br Towards the end of the century large magic shows permanently staged at big theatre venues became the norm The British performer J N Maskelyne and his partner Cooke were established at the Egyptian Hall in London s Piccadilly in by their manager William Morton and continued there for years The show incorporated stage illusions and reinvented traditional tricks with exotic often Oriental imagery The potential of the stage was exploited for hidden mechanisms and assistants and the control it offers over the audience s point of view br Maskelyne and Cooke invented many of the illusions still performed today one of his best known being levitation br The model for the look of a typical magician a man with wavy hair a top hat a goatee and a tailcoat was Alexander Herrmann also known as Herrmann the Great Herrmann was a French magician and was part of the Herrmann family name that is the first family of magic br The escapologist and magician Harry Houdini took his stage name from Robert Houdin and developed a range of stage magic tricks many of them based on what became known after his death as escapology Houdini was genuinely skilled in techniques such as lockpicking and escaping straitjackets but also made full use of the range of conjuring techniques including fake equipment and collusion with individuals in the audience Houdini s show business savvy was as great as his performance skill There is a Houdini Museum dedicated to him in Scranton Pennsylvania br The Magic Circle was formed in London in to promote and advance the art of stage magic br As a form of entertainment magic easily moved from theatrical venues to television specials which opened up new opportunities for deceptions and brought stage magic to huge audiences Famous magicians of the th century included Okito David Devant Harry Blackstone Sr Harry Blackstone Jr Howard Thurston Theodore Annemann Cardini Joseph Dunninger Dai Vernon Fred Culpitt Tommy Wonder Siegfried Roy and Doug Henning Popular th and st century magicians include David Copperfield Lance Burton James Randi Penn and Teller David Blaine Criss Angel Derren Brown Dynamo Shin Lim Jay Joss and Hans Klok Well known women magicians include Dell O Dell and Dorothy Dietrich Most television magicians perform before a live audience who provide the remote viewer with a reassurance that the illusions are not obtained with post production visual effects br Many of the principles of stage magic are old There is an expression it s all done with smoke and mirrors used to explain something baffling but effects seldom use mirrors today due to the amount of installation work and transport difficulties For example the famous Pepper s Ghost a stage illusion first used in th century London required a specially built theatre Modern performers have vanished objects as large as the Taj Mahal the Statue of Liberty and a space shuttle using other kinds of optical deceptions br br br Types of magic performance br br Magic is often described according to various specialties or genres br br br Stage illusions br Stage illusions are performed for large audiences typically within a theatre or auditorium This type of magic is distinguished by large scale props the use of assistants and often exotic animals such as elephants and tigers Famous stage illusionists past and present include Harry Blackstone Sr Howard Thurston Chung Ling Soo David Copperfield Lance Burton Silvan Siegfried Roy and Harry Blackstone Jr br br br Parlor magic br Parlor magic is done for larger audiences than close up magic which is for a few people or even one person and for smaller audiences than stage magic In parlor magic the performer is usually standing and on the same level as the audience which may be seated on chairs or even on the floor According to the Encyclopedia of Magic and Magicians by T A Waters The phrase parlor magic is often used as a pejorative to imply that an effect under discussion is not suitable for professional performance Also many magicians consider the term parlor old fashioned and limiting since this type of magic is often done in rooms much larger than the traditional parlor or even outdoors A better term for this branch of magic may be platform club or cabaret Examples of such magicians include Jeff McBride David Abbott Channing Pollock Black Herman and Fred Kaps br br br Close up magic br Close up magic or table magic is performed with the audience close to the magician sometimes even one on one It usually makes use of everyday items as props such as cards see Card manipulation coins see Coin magic and seemingly impromptu effects This may be called table magic

on a stage in a cabaret setting before small close up groups or even for one spectator Well known pickpockets include James Freedman David Avadon Bob Arno and Apollo Robbins br br br Mentalism br Mentalism creates the impression in the minds of the audience that the performer possesses special powers to read thoughts predict events control other minds and similar feats It can be presented on a stage in a cabaret setting before small close up groups or even for one spectator Well known mentalists of the past and present include Alexander The Zancigs Axel Hellstrom Dunninger Kreskin Deddy Corbuzier Derren Brown Rich Ferguson Guy Bavli Banachek Max Maven and Alain Nu br br br S ances br Theatrical s ances simulate spiritualistic or mediumistic phenomena for theatrical effect This genre of stage magic has been misused at times by charlatans pretending to actually be in contact with spirits or supernatural forces For this reason some well known magicians such as James Randi AKA The Amazing Randi have made it their goal to debunk such paranormal phenomena and illustrate that any such effects may be achieved by natural or human means Randi was the foremost skeptic in this regard in the United States br br br Children s magic br br Children s magic is performed for an audience primarily composed of children It is typically performed at birthday parties preschools elementary schools Sunday schools or libraries This type of magic is usually comedic in nature and involves audience interaction as well as volunteer assistants br br br Online magic br Online magic tricks were designed to function on a computer screen The computer screen affords ways to incorporate magic from the magician s wand to the computer mouse The use of computing technologies in performance can be traced back to a presentation by David Copperfield who used a Commodore to create a magic show for his audience More recently virtual performers have been experimenting with captivating digital animations and illusions that blur the lines between magic tricks and reality In some cases the computer essentially replaces the online magician br In a TED Talk Penn Jillette discussed how technology will continue to play a role in magic by influencing media and communication According to Jillette magicians continue to innovate in not only digital communication but also live performances that utilize digital effects The COVID lockdowns ushered onto the world stage a surge of online magic shows These shows are performed via video conferencing platforms such as Zoom br Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation while others like Plato s Cursed Triangle are based on mathematical geometrical and or optical illusions One such online magic trick called Esmeralda s Crystal Ball became a viral phenomenon that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers that the fact checking website Snopes dedicated a page to debunking the trick br German magician Wittus Witt performed interactive magic tricks live on TV from to Viewers were able to call Wittus Witt live in the television studio and perform a magic trick with him directly In total Witt performed this special magic times every other week br br br Theatre Magic Art br Theatre Magic describes a dramaturgically well thought out performance that has been specially designed for the theater and theater like situations It is not about individual tricks that are strung together but about logical connections of tricks

modern street magic performers include Jeff Sheridan Gazzo and Wittus Witt Since the first David Blaine TV special Street Magic aired in the term street magic has also come to describe a style of guerilla performance in which magicians approach and perform for unsuspecting members of the public on the street Unlike traditional street magic this style is almost purely designed for TV and gains its impact from the wild reactions of the public Magicians of this type include David Blaine and Cyril Takayama br br br Bizarre magic br Bizarre magic is a branch of stage magic that creates eerie

a style of magic that conveys feelings of elegance and skill akin to prominent magicians of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries br br br Mechanical magic br br Mechanical magic is a form of stage magic in which the magician uses a variety of mechanical devices to perform acts that appear to be physically impossible Examples include such things as a false bottomed mortar in which the magician places an audience member s watch only to later produce several feet away inside a wooden frame Mechanical magic requires a certain degree of sleight of hand and carefully functioning mechanisms and devices to be performed convincingly This form of magic was popular around the turn of the th century today many of the original mechanisms used for this magic have become antique collector s pieces and may require significant and careful restoration to function br br br Categories of effects br Magicians describe the type of tricks they perform in various ways Opinions vary as to how to categorize a given effect and disagreement as to what categories actually exist For instance some magicians consider penetrations a separate category while others consider penetrations a form of restoration or teleportation Some magicians today such as Guy Hollingworth and Tom Stone have begun to challenge the notion that all magic effects fit into a limited number of categories Among magicians who believe in a limited number of categories such as Dariel Fitzkee Harlan Tarbell S H Sharpe there has been disagreement as to how many different types of effects there are Some of these are listed below br br Production The magician produces something from nothing a rabbit from an empty hat a fan of cards from thin air a shower of coins from an empty bucket a dove from a pan or the magician himself or herself appearing in a puff of smoke on an empty stage all of these effects are productions br Vanish The magician makes something disappear a coin a cage of doves milk from a newspaper an assistant from a cabinet or even the Statue of Liberty A vanish being the reverse of a production may use a similar technique in reverse br Transformation The magician transforms something from one state into another a silk handkerchief changes color a lady turns into a tiger an indifferent card changes to the spectator s chosen card br Restoration The magician destroys an object a rope is cut a newspaper is torn a woman is cut in half a borrowed watch is smashed to pieces then restores it to its original state br Transposition A transposition involves two or more objects The magician will cause these objects to change places as many times as he pleases and in some cases ends with a kicker by transforming the objects into something else br Teleportation The magician causes something to move from one place to another a borrowed ring is found inside a ball of wool a canary inside a light bulb an assistant from a cabinet to the back of the theatre or a coin from one hand to the other When two objects exchange places it is called a transposition a simultaneous double transportation A transportation can be seen as a combination of a vanish and a production When performed by a mentalist it might be called teleportation br Escape The magician or less often an assistant is placed in a restraining device e g handcuffs or a straitjacket or a death trap and escapes to safety Examples include being put in a straitjacket and into an overflowing tank of water and being tied up and placed in a car being sent through a car crusher br Levitation The magician defies gravity either by making something float in the air or with the aid of another object suspension a silver ball floats around a cloth an assistant floats in mid air another is suspended from a broom a scarf dances in a sealed bottle the magician levitates his own body in midair There are many popular ways to create this illusion including Asrah levitation Balducci levitation invisible thread and King levitation The flying illusion has often been performed by David Copperfield Harry Blackstone floated a light bulb over the heads of the public br Penetration The magician makes a solid object pass through another a set of steel rings link and unlink a candle penetrates an arm swords pass through an assistant in a basket a salt shaker penetrates a tabletop or a man walks through a mirror Sometimes referred to as solid through solid br Prediction The magician accurately predicts the choice of a spectator or the outcome of an event a newspaper headline the total amount of loose change in the spectator s pocket a picture drawn on a slate under seemingly impossible circumstances br Many magic routines use combinations of effects For example in cups and balls a magician may use vanishes productions penetrations teleportation and transformations as part of the one presentation br The methodology behind magic is often referred to as a science often a branch of physics while the performance aspect is more of an art form br br br Learning magic br br Dedication to magic can teach confidence and creativity as well as the work ethic associated with regular practice and the responsibility that comes with devotion to an art br The teaching of performance magic was once a secretive practice Professional magicians were unwilling to share knowledge with anyone outside the profession to prevent the laity from learning their secrets This often made it difficult for an interested apprentice to learn anything but the basics of magic Some had strict rules against members discussing magic secrets with anyone but established magicians br From the publication of Reginald Scot s Discoverie of Witchcraft until the end of the th century only a few books were available for magicians to learn the craft whereas today mass market books offer a myriad titles Videos and DVDs are newer media but many of the methods found in this format are readily found in previously published books However they can serve as a visual demonstration br Persons interested in learning to perform magic can join magic clubs Here magicians both seasoned and novitiate can work together and help one another for mutual improvement to learn new techniques to discuss all aspects of magic to perform for each other sharing advice encouragement and criticism Before a magician can join one of these clubs they usually have to audition The purpose is to show to the membership they are a magician and not just someone off the street wanting to discover magic secrets br The world s largest magic organization is the International Brotherhood of Magicians it publishes a monthly journal The Linking Ring The oldest organization is the Society of American Magicians which publishes the monthly magazine M U M and of which Houdini was a member and president for several years In London England there is The Magic Circle which houses the largest magic library in Europe Also PSYCRETS The British Society of Mystery Entertainers caters specifically to mentalists bizarrists storytellers readers spiritualist performers and other mystery entertainers Davenport s Magic in London s The Strand was the world s oldest family run magic shop It is now closed The Magic Castle in Hollywood California is home to the Academy of Magical Arts br Traditionally magicians refuse to reveal the methods behind their tricks to the audience Membership in professional magicians organizations often requires a commitment never to reveal the secrets of magic to non magicians When Justin Flom in began disclosing how tricks worked in Facebook videos other magicians publicly and privately criticized and ostracized him br Magic performances tend to fall into a few specialties or genres Stage illusions use large scale props and even large animals Platform magic is performed for a medium to large audience Close up magic is performed with the audience close to the magician Escapology involves escapes from confinement or restraints Pickpocket magicians take audience members wallets wristwatches belts and ties br Mentalism creates the illusion that the magician can read minds Comedy magic is the use of magic combined with stand up comedy an example being Penn Teller Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception Others argue that they can claim that the effects are due to magic These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers Another issue is the use of deceptive practices for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance Examples include fraudulent mediums con men and grifters who use deception for cheating at card games br br br Misuse of the term magic br Some modern illusionists believe that it is unethical to give a performance that claims to be anything other than a clever and skillful deception Most of these performers therefore eschew the term magician which they view as making a claim to supernatural power in favor of illusionist and similar descriptions for example the performer Jamy Ian Swiss makes these points by billing himself as an honest liar Alternatively many performers say that magical acts as a form of theatre need no more of a disclaimer than any play or film this policy was advocated by the magician and mentalist Joseph Dunninger who stated For those who believe no explanation is necessary for those who do not believe no explanation will suffice br These apparently irreconcilable differences of opinion have led to some conflicts among performers For example more than thirty years after the illusionist Uri Geller made his first appearances on television in the s to exhibit his self proclaimed psychic ability to bend spoons his actions still provoke controversy among some magic performers because he claimed what he did was not an illusion On the other hand because Geller bent and continues to bend spoons within a performance context and has lectured at several magic conventions the Dunninger quote may be said to apply br In self proclaimed psychic The Amazing Kreskin was barred from sending fraudulent letters to solicit money from the elderly This settlement ends these efforts to cheat Iowa s most vulnerable people stated Attorney General Tom Miller The letters were shamelessly predatory and manipulative variously promising riches protection from ill health and even personal friendship to each recipient all to get the victim to send money br Less fraught with controversy however may be the use of deceptive practices by those who employ stage magic techniques for personal gain outside the venue of a magic performance br br Fraudulent mediums have long capitalized on the popular belief in paranormal phenomena to prey on the bereaved for financial gain From the s to the s during the greatest popularity of the spiritualism religious movement as well as public interest in s ances a number of fraudulent mediums used stage magic methods to perform illusions such as table knocking slate writing and telekinetic effects which they attributed to the actions of ghosts or other spirits The great escapologist and illusionist Harry Houdini devoted much of his time to exposing such fraudulent operators Magician James Randi magic duo Penn Teller and the mentalist Derren Brown have also devoted much time to investigating and debunking paranormal occult and supernatural claims br Fraudulent faith healers have also been shown to employ sleight of hand to give the appearance of removing chicken giblet tumors from patients abdomens br Con men and grifters too may use techniques of stage magic for fraudulent goals Cheating at card games is an obvious example and not a surprising one one of the most respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians The Expert at the Card Table by Erdnase was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps The card trick known as Find the Lady or Three card Monte is an old favourite of street hustlers who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition to identify after a seemingly easy to track mixing sequence which one of three face down cards is the Queen Another example is the shell game in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells then shuffled around the table or sidewalk so slowly as to make the pea s position seemingly obvious Although these are well known as frauds people still lose money on them a shell game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December br br br Researching magic br Because of the secretive nature of magic research can be a challenge Many magic resources are privately held and most libraries only have small populist collections of magicana However organizations exist to band together independent collectors writers and researchers of magic history including the Magic Collectors Association which publishes a quarterly magazine and hosts an annual convention and the Conjuring Arts Research Center which publishes a monthly newsletter and biannual magazine and offers its members use of a searchable database of rare books and periodicals br Performance magic is particularly notable as a key area of popular culture from the mid th to mid th centuries Many performances and performers can be followed through newspapers of the time br Many books have been written about magic tricks so many are written every year that at least one magic author has suggested that more books are written about magic than any other performing art Although the bulk of these books are not seen on the shelves of libraries or public bookstores the serious student can find many titles through specialized stores catering to the needs of magic performers br Several notable public research collections on magic are the WG Alma Conjuring Collection at the State Library of Victoria the R B Robbins Collection of Stage Magic and Conjuring at the State Library of NSW the H Adrian Smith Collection of Conjuring and Magicana at Brown University and the Carl W Jones Magic
