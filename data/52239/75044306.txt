id: 75044306
Misinformation involving the distribution of false inaccurate or otherwise misleading information has been a prominent and ubiquitous feature of the Israel Hamas war br Much of the content has been viral in nature with tens of millions of posts in circulation on social media A variety of sources including government officials media outlets and social media influencers across different countries have contributed to the spread of these inaccuracies br br br On Israel br br br Misrepresentation of photos and videos br The deputy head of Hamas s political bureau Saleh al Arouri claimed the Qassam Brigades had captured senior officers from the occupation army in the October attacks A rumour circulated on social media that one of these officers was Major General Nimrod Aloni the commander of the Israeli Depth Corps based on a photograph of a man who resembled him being detained by unidentified armed men A Persian language post by the Israel Defense Forces IDF quoted a post about his capture from Tasnim News Agency and wrote Tasnim Distributors of fake news of IRGC without either denying or confirming the capture of Aloni Aloni was subsequently seen on October attending a meeting of top Israeli military officials br Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting published images of the capture of commanders of Nagorno Karabakh by the Azerbaijani army in September as the capture of Israeli commanders by Hamas br A video of a CNN broadcast from near the Israel Gaza border with audio added to suggest the network had faked an attack went viral on social media br Social media accounts based in India have spread pro Israeli disinformation with influencers misrepresenting videos purported to show school girls taken as sex slaves or Hamas kidnapping a Jewish baby Fact checker Pratik Sinha said the Indian right wing has made India the disinformation capital of the world The trend forms part of a wider pattern of fake news in India with an Islamophobic slant including disinformation on Palestinians coming from the BJP IT Cell a vehicle of India s governing party the BJP br An Israeli boy and his sisters killed during Hamas s attack on Kibbutz Nir Oz on October have been falsely accused of being crisis actors br A photo shared by Israel showing the charred corpse of a baby was claimed by many on social media to have been AI generated based on AI detector AI or Not The claim was repeated by Al Jazeera Arabic The company behind AI or Not later said that the result was a false positive caused by the image s compression and blurred name tag several experts who looked at the photo found it to be genuine Other social media users claimed based on a chan post that the image had been altered from a similar photo of a dog though researcher Tina Nikoukhah found that the dog picture was likely falsified using generative methods br The community volunteer paramedic and rescue group ZAKA began collecting bodies immediately after the Hamas attacks while the IDF avoided assigning soldiers from Home Front Command with training to carefully retrieve and document human remains in post terrorism situations However as part of the effort to get media exposure ZAKA spread accounts of atrocities that never happened released sensitive and graphic photos and acted unprofessionally on the ground sometimes mixing remains from multiple victims in the same bag and creating little or no documentation about the remains br br br Allegations of beheading br In the aftermath of the initial Hamas assault witnesses from the Israeli soldiers the Israeli Forces and the first responder Israeli organization ZAKA said on French Israeli TV channel i news that they had seen the bodies of beheaded infants at the site of the Kfar Aza massacre During Antony Blinken s visit to Israel he said he was shown photos of the massacre by Hamas of Israeli civilians and soldiers and specifically that he saw beheaded IDF soldiers U S President Biden separately said that he had seen photographic evidence of terrorists beheading children but the White House later clarified that Biden was alluding to news reports of beheadings which have not contained or referred to photographic evidence NBC News called reports of beheaded babies unverified allegations adding that they appeared to have originated from Israeli soldiers and people affiliated with the Israel Defense Force and that an Israeli official told CNN the government had not confirmed claims of the beheadings The allegation mainly stemmed from a viral Israeli news broadcast clip and the main X Twitter accounts propagating the claims were i NEWS and Israel s official account even though Israeli Defense spokesperson Doron Spielman told NBC News that he could not confirm i NEWS s report As of October CNN had extensively reviewed online media content to verify Hamas related atrocities but found no evidence to support claims of decapitated children br br br Dead baby in oven claim br In a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on October Eli Beer founder of Israeli volunteer EMS group United Hatzalah claimed that Hamas had burned a baby alive in an oven He attributed the claim to a United Hatzalah volunteer one of them Asher Moskowitz also publicly made the claim It was repeated by journalist Dovid Efune commentator John Podhoretz and others in tweets seen over million times Israeli journalists and police found no evidence for the claim and a representative of ZAKA a first responder organization said the claim was false br br br Sexual violence br br On January the Hamas rape report titled Screams Without Words How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on Oct was removed from the scheduled The New York Times podcast channel The Daily Some relatives of Gal Abdush one of the victims mentioned in the story stated that there was no proof of rape and that The New York Times had interviewed them under false pretenses The article reportedly caused what The Intercept called a furious internal debate about the strength of its reporting and according to Jeremy Scahill was met by skepticism from other New York Times journalists The Times ultimately stood by its story calling it rigorously reported sourced and edited br br br On the United Nations br United Nations UN Director General Antonio Guterres has accused Israel of spreading misinformation about the war in Gaza in an attempt to lower the credibility of the UN I ve heard the same source many times saying that I never attacked Hamas that I never condemned Hamas that I am a supporter of Hamas I asked for a statistic to be made by our colleagues I have condemned Hamas times of them in formal speeches The others in different social platforms So I mean the truth in the end always wins United Nations Director General Antonio Guterres br br br On Gaza br br br Inaccurate information br Viral claims that the IDF had destroyed Gaza s Church of Saint Porphyrius on October were debunked by the church Subsequently an Israeli airstrike hit the premises of the church on October killing br In October disinformation experts uncovered an account on X that published false reports about Qatar threatening to cut off its gas exports if Israel continued to bombard the Gaza Strip br Pro Hamas accounts have misrepresented footage from the Syrian civil war as showing children being killed in Gaza br In February Israel s official X account posted a second video listing the humanitarian aid it claimed to have provided for Gaza The video included March footage of a camp in Moldova for Ukrainian refugees The same account later deleted the video and stated that the photo was for illustrative purposes and we should have stated that in the video br br br Impersonations br br Following the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion an X account claiming to be an Al Jazeera journalist said they had video of a Hamas missile landing in the hospital Al Jazeera subsequently clarified that they were not associated with the account and it was later removed Another X account that promoted pro Kremlin misinformation claimed The Wall Street Journal had reported that the explosion was caused by a Mark bomb The Wall Street Journal had not published such a report br In November a video appearing to show a nurse at the Al Shifa hospital went viral She claimed that she was unable to treat patients because Hamas had taken over the entire hospital and were stealing fuel and medicine with the video ending with her pleading for all Palestinians to leave Al Shifa Many were quick to point out the falsehood in the video as none of the documented doctors and nurses at the hospital recognize the woman depicted and a reported Israeli accent and inability to speak clear Arabic Additionally according to Esther Chan from RMIT FactLab CrossCheck an analysis by open source investigators had determined that the video was likely doctored to artificially include fake sounds of explosions The video was originally posted on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel s Arabic twitter account and it was boosted by Edward Ha m Cohen Halala who has reported ties to the Israeli government who has a popular social media presence with an Arabic following br br br Allegations of crisis acting br Videos of atrocities in Gaza have been dismissed as acting with people falsely accused of being crisis actors A derogatory and dismissive phrase Pallywood is often used the term is based on a fringe theory that Palestinians are falsifying evidence of suffering The fact checking organisation Logically found that mention of the term has increased since October particularly in Israel the United States and India Evidence that was falsely used to prove Palestinians were crisis actors include a video of body bags which appear to be moving which was instead a video of a protest in Egypt br Saleh Aljafarawi a Palestinian blogger and singer who lives in Gaza was falsely accused by several pro Israeli figures including the country s official Twitter account of being a crisis actor This included video of a Palestinian teenager wounded in a raid on Tulkarm in July who was falsely presented as Saleh in a hospital days before October br In November Israeli diplomat Ofir Gendelman circulated a clip from a Lebanese short film claiming that it was proof that Palestinians were faking videos and calling it an example of Pallywood According to The Daily Beast Gendelman is a repeat offender when it comes to peddling misinformation about Palestinians The previous week Gendelman peddled IDF training videos as war footage and in he was found by international media to have misrepresented footage from Syria as current footage from Gaza br br br Dead children as dolls br A video showing a Palestinian child killed during an October Israeli airstrike on Zeitoun has been falsely claimed to be staged using a doll The claim has been promoted by official Israeli government social media accounts including the X accounts of Israel s embassies in France and Austria as well as pro Israel and anti Hamas accounts br In early December The Jerusalem Post published an article falsely claiming that a dead month old Palestinian baby from Gaza was a doll The Jerusalem Post would later delete the article and remove any mention of it on their social media pages Though not mentioning the article directly they published a statement saying that The article in question did not meet our editorial standards and was thus removed br br br Sexual violence br On March Al Jazeera took down its video of a woman named Jamila al Hissi who said that Israeli soldiers had raped women kidnapped women executed women and pulled dead bodies from under the rubble to unleash their dogs on them at Al Shifa hospital in its latest siege Former managing director of Al Jazeera Yasser Abu Hilalah wrote on X Hamas investigations revealed that the story of the rape of women in Shifa Hospital was fabricated Abu Hilalah reported that al Hissi justified her exaggeration and incorrect talk by saying that the goal was to arouse the nation s fervor and brotherhood br br br Reliability of Israeli officials as sources br br Israel has released several pieces of incorrect or disputed information leading to questions about its credibility On claims linking Palestinian militants to sexual assaults on Oct The Times of London has remarked that investigations have been hampered by false and misleading information spread by senior Israeli political figures and government linked civil activists A UN report on these allegations has stated that Israeli authorities have been unable to produce the evidence politicians said existed br Writing for openDemocracy British academic Paul Rogers stated Israel must maintain the pretence of an orderly war with few civilians killed Netanyahu s government is lying but it would be naive to expect otherwise Lying is what many powerful states routinely do particularly in wartime In The Intercept investigative journalist Jeremy Scahill wrote At the center of Israel s information warfare campaign is a tactical mission to dehumanize Palestinians and to flood the public discourse with a stream of false unsubstantiated and unverifiable allegations br br br Misinformation br On multiple occasions analyses have found issues with IDF claims In October a Financial Times analysis on a bombing of Palestinians evacuating Gaza City found that most explanations aside from an Israeli strike could be ruled out though the IDF blamed the attack on Palestinian militants In November analysis by the BBC found that video released by the Israeli military following the Al Shifa Hospital siege had been edited despite IDF claims to the contrary br In December an analysis by The Washington Post confirmed reports by Human Rights Watch that Israel had used white phosphorus in an attack on Lebanon directly contradicting the IDF In January after an Israeli airstrike killed journalist Hamza Dahdouh the IDF called Dahdouh a suspect who was hit while driving with a terrorist however The Washington Post found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day br After reports spread that a mother and daughter were killed by Israeli snipers in December in a church where a number of Palestinian Christians sheltered the Israeli army denied targerting the compound but claimed instead there was Hamas activity in its vicinity and Israeli soldiers shot back Catholic officials and Member of British Parliament Layla Moran who maintained contact with refugees in the church stated on the contrary that no Palestinian belligerents were in the area and that the two women had been killed by the Israeli army who were the ones preventing the refugees from leaving br In November a video posted by the IDF showed Daniel Hagari inside the Al Rantisi Children s Hospital where he claimed that the IDF had found Hamas weapons and technology as well as a list of terrorist names in Arabic with the title Operation Al Aqsa Flood showing each agents rota guarding the hostages However a translation of the document showed that it contained no names but instead a calendar of the days of the week After the questioning of the veracity of the claim an Israeli spokesperson backtracked but CNN while removing the segment did not provide an editors note acknowledging the change or the dispute over the initial video br In regards to the March Flour massacre a CNN investigation said that Mark Regev the Israeli prime minister s special adviser initially told CNN that Israeli forces had not been involved However the IDF said soon after that soldiers had not fired directly on Palestinians seeking aid but rather fired warning shots in the air Al Jazeera reported evidence of a large number of gunshot wounds from a United Nations team medical professionals and witnesses The New York Times also reported that witness accounts differed from the Israeli military account who described extensive shooting after thousands massed around aid trucks IDF drone footage edits out the events causing the crowds to disperse and rejected a CNN request for the full unedited footage The CNN investigation cast doubt on other IDF claims such as the timing of shooting Several days after the attack a senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty stated There is concrete evidence that contradicts whatever statements are being made by the Israeli authorities br After bombing a tent camp in Rafah in an area that Israel had designated as a safe zone for civilians killing people Israeli officials initially told their American counterparts that they believed their airstrike ignited a nearby fuel tank creating a large fire In one video an unnamed Gazan narrator said the explosion was caused by a Hamas jeep loaded with weapons Later the IDF suggested that a militant warehouse containing ammunition or some other material in the area caused the fire It also released an Arabic phone call in which they clearly say that the Israeli missile was not responsible for the fire that the fire was caused by secondary explosions and the secondary explosions came from an ammunition warehouse However James Cavanaugh who worked at the ATF said the fire did not indicate some giant stash that exploded The New York Times viewed numerous videos and did not find evidence that a significant secondary explosion was ignited br The Israeli army also denied responsibility for the killing of year old Hind Rajab her family and the Palestine Red Crescent Society paramedics sent to rescue her saying that their forces were not in firing range on the day of the girl s death However both Al Jazeera and The Washington Post concluded based on investigation of satellite imagery that Israeli armored vehicles were indeed in the area at the time br br br Unverified information br In other instances Israeli forces claims have been questioned based on an apparent lack of evidence A November press conference where Israeli police promised to release evidence of systemic sexual assault carried out by Hamas and allied groups on October showed nothing of the kind In December Israel stated there was a Hamas tunnel network connected to the Al Shifa Hospital however a report by The Washington Post found There is no evidence that the tunnels could be accessed from inside hospital wards In January reporting by CNN found there was no evidence to IDF claims about tunnels under a cemetery in Khan Younis That same month Israel claimed UNRWA staff members had participated in the October attack on Israel however the Financial Times Sky News and Channel all stated that Israel s claims were not proven by the intelligence documents they reviewed In February the IDF claimed that Palestine Red Crescent Society PRCS paramedics had treated wounded Hamas fighters on October however the PRCS said that the video Israel released did not show a PRCS ambulance The same month the IDF stated Hamas was stealing humanitarian aid leading David M Satterfield a senior U S envoy to say there was no evidence to support Israel s claims br br br Disinformation br In October shortly after the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion Israeli sources published audio purporting to show two Hamas militants in a phone call claiming responsibility for the act and blaming it on a malfunctioning rocket Hamas claimed the recording was an obvious fabrication and the British Channel interviewed two independent Arab journalists who expressed similar views br On December Haaretz reported on Israeli claims about beheaded babies stating that these unverified stories had been disseminated by Israeli search and rescue groups army officers and even Sara Netanyahu Haaretz journalists Nir Hasson and Liza Rozovsky related the chronology of the news items about beheaded babies and hung babies and concluded this story is false They quoted Ishay Coen a journalist for the ultra Orthodox website Kikar Hashabbat who admitted he made a mistake by unquestioningly accepting the IDF s statements Why would an army officer invent such a horrifying story Hashabbat asked adding I was wrong br In the same month the IDF began publicly circulating videos apparently showing Hamas militants stripped off their clothes and surrendering their weapons to the Israeli army However media reports indicated that the men and boys shown in the videos had been removed by the Israeli army from UN schools where they had taken shelter with their families and several of them were identified as aid workers a journalist and other civilians by their acquaintances The Israeli soldiers instructions to surrender a weapon also suggests a performance for the camera br br br False flag conspiracy theories br br The October attack by Hamas on Israel has become the subject of various conspiracy theories These theories claim that the attack which resulted in approximately deaths in Israel was a false flag operation conducted by Israel itself despite the overwhelming evidence provided by multiple sources including smartphone and GoPro footage capturing the breach of the border by Hamas forces br This misinformation has been proliferating across various social media platforms where hashtags linking Israel to false flag operations have seen a significant increase in usage This spread of falsehoods was not limited to online spaces it has manifested in real world scenarios including city council meetings and public protests where individuals have publicly denied the facts of the attack br Researchers and Jewish community leaders have expressed concern about the ties these conspiracy theories have to Holocaust denial and other antisemitic beliefs with denial of the October attacks described as part of a broader pattern of misinformation that seeks to distort historical events and promote antisemitic narratives br Another unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that emerged following the October Hamas attack suggests that the Israeli government specifically Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had prior knowledge of the attack This theory which lacks any credible evidence also includes the claim that Netanyahu issued a stand down order to the Israeli military The genesis of this theory appears to be from Charlie Kirk a far right influencer and supporter of former U S President Donald Trump Kirk s comments on a podcast suggesting a need to question whether there was a stand down order fueled these claims However these assertions have no factual basis and hinge solely on Kirk s personal speculations br The claim rapidly gained traction on social media platforms like TikTok Facebook and X formerly known as Twitter particularly with the hashtag BibiKnew referencing Netanyahu Despite its popularity online there is no substantial evidence to support the notion that the Israeli government was aware of the Hamas attack in advance The lack of proof notwithstanding the theory has been influential in certain circles especially among those critical of Netanyahu s leadership and Israeli policies br br br Disinformation campaigns br A fake memo that purported to show Biden authorizing billion in aid to Israel circulated on social media and was cited in articles by Indian news outlets Firstpost and Oneindia br According to information security experts interviewed by the New York Times Iran Russia China Iran s proxies Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have been conducting massive online disinformation efforts focused on undercutting Israel while denigrating Israel s principal ally the United States Researchers have documented at least bots or fake social media accounts as well as strategic use of state controlled media outlets like RT Sputnik and Tasnim An analysis by Haaretz found that hundreds of fake accounts on social media were targeting Democratic Party lawmakers with spam messages repeating Israeli government accusations relating to UNRWA and Hamas br A Russian disinformation campaign known as Doppelganger has pushed false information about the war using fake websites that mimic the appearance of news sources such as Fox News Le Parisien and Der Spiegel br In February Volker Turk the UN human rights chief stated that the United Nations had been the subject of disinformation attacks saying The UN has become a lightning rod for manipulative propaganda and a scapegoat for policy failures br In June Israel s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs was revealed to have paid million to Israeli political consulting firm STOIC to conduct a social media campaign fueled by fake accounts and often employing misinformartion targeting American Congresspeople with a focus on Democratic and African American members of the House of Representatives Websites were also created to provide young progressive Americans with Gaza news with a pro Israel spin Among the objectives of the campaign was amplifying Israeli attacks on UNRWA staffers and driving a wedge between Palestinians and African Americans to prevent solidarity between the two groups The campaign also took aim at people in Canada who were exposed to Islamophobic content smearing Canadian Muslims and implying that pro Palestinian protesters aimed at imposing Sharia law Messages were also directed to people in the Gulf Arab countries arguing that humanitarian concern for Palestinians was a wasteful distraction from local affairs br br br Fake videos br Videos falsely linked to the war included a video of children in cages posted on October footage from of Iranian lawmakers chanting Death to America and in Egypt photos of the Cairo Tower appearing to be lit with the Palestinian flag spread on social media which turned out to be a modified version of the tower in Footage from video game Arma has been presented as war footage br On October a video supposedly of Hamas thanking Ukraine for supplying them was shared by an X account linked to the Wagner Group It was viewed over times and shared by American far right accounts The next day former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev tweeted Well Nato buddies you ve really got it haven t you The weapons handed to the Nazi regime in Ukraine are now being actively used against Israel br Social media users on both sides of the war shared behind the scenes footage of an actor lying in fake blood from a Palestinian short film alleging it was evidence that the other side was creating propaganda A video of Egyptian paratroopers flying over the Egyptian Military Academy that was falsely claimed to show Hamas militants infiltrating an Israeli music festival went viral on X in Indonesia br Indian Twitter accounts spread an out of context video claimed to represent dozens of young girls taken as sex slaves by a Palestinian fighter which was instead actually probably a school trip to Jerusalem Another clip primarily shared by Indian users was purported to depict a kidnapped baby however the video was taken a month earlier and had nothing to do with Gaza br An AI generated video of model Bella Hadid supposedly apologising for her past remarks and expressing support for Israel circulated on social media br br br Role of social media platforms br br Disinformation about the war has spread on social media platforms particularly X formerly known as Twitter The European Union warned Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg that X and Meta were hosting disinformation and illegal content about the war with potential fines of up to of the companies global revenue according to the Digital Services Act br In response to the reports X s CEO Linda Yaccarino told EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton that it had taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content and removed hundreds of accounts linked to Hamas br According to NewsGuard at least false claims related to the war garnered million views across X TikTok and Instagram within three days of the Hamas attack On October the EU opened an investigation into X about the spread of disinformation and terrorist content related to the war br On October Center for Countering Digital Hate CEO Imran Ahmed said his group was tracking a spike in efforts to push false information about the war adding that U S adversaries extremists Internet trolls and engagement farmers were exploiting the war for their own gain Graham Brookie senior director of the Atlantic Council s Digital Forensic Research Lab said that his team had witnessed a surge in terrorist propaganda graphic content false or misleading claims and hate speech with much of the content being circulated on Telegram Cyabra an Israel based company that analyses social media said that one in five accounts taking part in conversations about Hamas attacks were fake adding that they had found approximately such accounts on X and TikTok br According to the New York Times many images and videos that circulate on social media pretending to be from the Israel Hamas war are in fact from other conflicts such as the Syrian civil war and even of natural disasters such as a recent flood in Tajikistan br According to AP s David Klepper pictures from the Israel Hamas war have vividly and painfully illustrated AI s potential as a propaganda tool used to create lifelike images of carnage digitally altered ones spread on social media have been used to make false claims about responsibility for casualties or to deceive people about atrocities that never happened br br br X formerly Twitter br On October X said there were more than million posts on the platform about the conflict Musk recommended two accounts that previously promoted a false claim about an explosion near the Pentagon for updates about the war br On October researchers found that a network of X accounts was coordinating a campaign of pushing false information about the war br According to Wired the community fact checking system of X Community Notes has in some instances contributed to the spread of disinformation instead of correcting it Wired cited an incident where a video uploaded by Donald Trump Jr of Hamas shooting at Israelis was inaccurately tagged as a false video from several years ago as an example of the unreliability of Community Notes Fake accounts pretending to be a BBC journalist and The Jerusalem Post promoted false information about the war prior to X suspending them br On October the Technology Transparency Project reported that Hamas was using premium accounts on X to push propaganda X said it has banned Hamas and removed hundreds of accounts affiliated with Hamas br On October on The World radio program Rebecca Rosman reported that disinformation on X was being monetized by paid verified users with new content recommendation preference resulting in millions of views br According to a report by NewsGuard on October verified users on X were behind of the most engaged posts between and October that promoted false or unsubstantiated information about the war NewsGuard also found that only of the posts were flagged by Community Notes br On October commentator Jackson Hinkle posted on X that Haaretz had reported that the Israeli government inflated the death toll for the Hamas attack on Israel Haaretz stated that Hinkle s post contain ed blatant lies and was not substantiated by their reporting on the attack Hinkle also claimed that the image of a Jewish baby burned alive by Hamas on October was created by artificial intelligence He was subsequently deplatformed from YouTube br Syrian YouTuber Maram Susli claimed that footage showed Israeli military helicopters firing on Israelis escaping the October massacre at the supernova festival carried by Hamas However footage resulted to be from Israeli attacks on Hamas positions in Gaza three days later She also posted a photograph of a woman carrying a child s toy car down the stairs of a largely destroyed building suggesting it was Gaza after Israeli attacks The picture was actually an award winning photograph taken in Homs during the Syrian civil war br An investigation by ProPublica and Columbia University s Tow Center for Digital Journalism found that verified accounts promoting misinformation about the conflict saw their audience grow significantly during the first month of the conflict and that Community Notes had failed to scale sufficiently with of the debunked tweets reviewed not being clarified with a note br br br TikTok br On October the EU warned TikTok about illegal content and disinformation on its platform On October TikTok said it had taken action to remove violative content and accounts It also said it had established a command center for the conflict updated its automated detection systems to detect violent content and added moderators who speak Arabic and Hebrew A TikTok video promoting conspiracy theories that Hamas s attack had been orchestrated by the media was viewed over times br By mid November Republican U S Representative Mike Gallagher had claimed that TikTok was intentionally brainwashing American youth into supporting Hamas citing the spike in pro Palestinian content following the outbreak of hostilities between Israel and Hamas In response to criticism TikTok issued a press release on November asserting that younger Americans particularly Millennials and Generation Z tended to be more sympathetic to the Palestinians than to Israel citing Gallup polling data dating back to TikTok also claimed that its algorithm did not take sides but operated in a positive feedback loop based on user engagement The company also denied favouring one side of an issue over another or intentionally promoting pro Palestinian hashtags such as freepalestine which had attracted billion views by November By comparison standwithisrael had attracted million views TikTok s press release also stated that it had removed videos related to the conflict for violating community standards including promoting Hamas had hired moderators fluent in Arabic and Hebrew to parse content and begun removing fake accounts created in response to the Israel Hamas conflict br According to a TheMarker report neo Nazi propaganda antisemitic content and calls for the destruction of Israel were all circulating on TikTok throughout the war br br br Telegram br The Al Qassam Brigades Hamas s military wing had around followers on Telegram at the time of Hamas s attack According to the Digital Forensic Research Lab its following has tripled since then with its posts being viewed over times The Digital Forensic Research Lab found that Hamas relies on Telegram to send statements to its supporters br According to political analyst and researcher Arieh Kovler many Israelis follow official sounding Telegram channels that share out of context videos and unverified rumors br In a statement Telegram said it was evaluating the best approaches and soliciting input from a wide range of third parties and that it wished to be careful not to exacerbate the already dire situation by any rush actions br br br Impact br In October Arma developer Bohemia Interactive said in a statement With the tragic events currently unfolding in the Middle East we feel it is vital to share once again our statement concerning the use of Arma as a source of fake news footage It s disheartening for us to see the game we all love being used in this way While we have found ways to tackle this issue somewhat effectively by closely cooperating with leading fact checking agencies sadly we can t mitigate it entirely br In November Center for Countering Digital Hate CEO Imran Ahmed said that misinformation about the war was as difficult to track as COVID misinformation and misinformation about the United States presidential election br In January McDonald s CEO Chris Kempczinski said Several markets in the Middle East and some outside the region are experiencing a meaningful business impact due to the war and associated misinformation that is affecting brands like McDonald s The boycotts started after McDonald s Israel announced it had donated free meals to IDF soldiers involved in the war br In February Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins said I think the intensity of online discourse around Israel and Palestine is really kind of much worse than I ve seen in any of the conflicts People are not looking to establish the truth in many cases but basically just look for things to bash each other over the head online It s really just about people arguing their positions their opinions and not really establishing the exact truth around what s happening br Speaking about Israel s decision not to allow foreign journalists into Gaza UN secretary general Antonio Guterres stated Denying international journalists entry into Gaza is allowing disinformation and false narratives to flourish The technology director of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue stated The corrosion of the information landscape is undermining the ability of audiences to distinguish truth from falsehood on a terrible scale br br br See
