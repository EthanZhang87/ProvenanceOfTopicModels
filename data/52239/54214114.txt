incomplete or misleading information that is passed fed or confirmed to a targeted individual group or country br The book explains the covert groups within the Soviet Union tasked with disrupting government activities of the countries belonging to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U S through injection of Communist propaganda The authors place the Soviet policy of active measures within a broader strategy of Russian military deception in favor of domestic national security They focus their discussion on disinformation conducted by the Soviet intelligence between the period of br Shultz and Godson note that manipulated groups involve both official departments of the Soviet state as well as non governmental organizations which lack independence from the state control itself Specific goals exported by covert Soviet government channels and groups in the Western world were financed by Soviet intelligence operations These covert operations were coordinated so as to have maximum impact related to major international incidents br br As a case study of disinformation the authors describe journalist Pierre Charles Path whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda and had considerable impact on public opinion In another example the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U S Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests br The authors detail commonly used disinformation tactics by the Soviet intelligence agencies including forgery as covert operation in order to fool target dupes into believing such fabricated documents were real Additionally the writers explain how Soviet covert spies were able to bring agents of influence into their fold and do their bidding whether knowingly or through social influence as a useful idiot br Shultz and Godson note that after the Soviet term dezinformatsia became widely known in the s in the English language as disinformation native speakers of English broadened the term as any government

Dezinformatsia The Strategy of Soviet Disinformation br John C Campbell reviewed the book for the journal Foreign Affairs and wrote The Shultz Godson book is a useful survey of how the Soviet Union uses disinformation propaganda agents covert political techniques and front organizations to influence events in foreign countries and to further its strategic aims such as discrediting America and weakening NATO Campbell criticized the dry nature of some of the facts revealed in the book Parts of the presentation are novel but the revelations are not particularly sensational Campbell concluded stories in the book should not be taken at face value The author s KGB experience and background doubtless give him a special vantage point but most of this story can be taken with several grains of salt br Writing in Conflict Quarterly for The Journal of Conflict Studies David Charters questioned why the book did not present more of an analysis on the aggregate impact of all of the disinformation campaigns before noting such a task would be difficult to assess The reviewer asked why the book did not fully address questions including Did any of the forgeries described have a significant political impact on the intended target and on U S relations with the country concerned or were they merely of nuisance value Conflict Quarterly criticized such absence in the book and identified it as an academic deficiency writing Without answers to questions such as these it is difficult to accept at face value the authors conclusions Charters concluded the book was a useful introduction to a field of knowledge which is likely to continue to expand in importance for diplomats the intelligence community and scholars of international security affairs br Stephen Sloan reviewed the book for the journal Society writing Richard H Shultz and Roy Godson are to be credited for writing a highly readable and insightful book that can enable policy makers academics and concerned members of the public to understand a form of political warfare that until recently was only rarely recognized in the West He called the work ground breaking research Sloan concluded Shultz and Godson have provided an awareness of a threat that should be acted upon br Political Science Quarterly gave a more critical assessment of the book with reviewer Ellen Mickiewicz commenting In the second chapter the discussion of the organization of Soviet foreign propaganda activities is so fuzzy as to be confusing She criticized the rigor of the book s research methodology Mickiewicz concluded This book is not the successor to Frederic Barghoorn s Soviet Foreign Propaganda the topic is timely and interesting but it requires a more considered and informed analysis br br br See also
