Nat Tate An American Artist is a novel presented as a biography by the Scottish writer William Boyd Nat Tate was an imaginary person invented by Boyd and created as an abstract expressionist who destroyed of his work and leapt to his death from the Staten Island ferry His body was never found At the time of the novel s launch Boyd went some way to encourage the belief that Tate had really existed br br br Art hoax br Boyd published the book as a hoax presented as a real biography Gore Vidal John Richardson Picasso s biographer Karen Wright then editor of the influential Modern Painters magazine and David Bowie a board member of Modern Painters and co director with Karen Wright of Publishing which published the book were all participants in the hoax Nat Tate is a combination of the names of two London art galleries the National Gallery and the Tate Gallery Boyd and his conspirators set about convincing the New York glitterati social elites that the reputation of this influential abstract expressionist needed to be re evaluated br Bowie held a launch party on April Fool s Day eve and read extracts from the book while Richardson talked about Tate s friendships with both Picasso and Braque Vidal and Richardson supplied fake quotes to lend authenticity to the biography with both of them suggesting that Tate was a drunk br About a week later journalist David Lister who was at the New York launch reported in The Independent of London that some of the biggest names in the art world have been the victims of a literary hoax and the story was picked up by other newspapers including The New York Times He said that no one he spoke to claimed to know Tate well but no one claimed not to have heard of him He said he sniffed something fishy since he appeared to be the only person in the room who had never heard of Tate His suspicions were confirmed when he discovered that none of the galleries mentioned in the book actually existed By January Lister had become The Independent s Arts Editor br In reality it appears that few were fooled and most of the big names in the arts world including artists collectors art historian art dealers New York based writers like Paul Auster and editors of literary journals quickly realized that Nat Tate was a complete fake and that they had been the victims of an elaborate setup Some of the paintings featured in the book were reportedly painted by Boyd and the hoax was made more believable by Gore Vidal s endorsement on the book s dust cover Also the photographs of Nat Tate that feature in the biography are of unknown people from Boyd s own photographic collection br Karen Wright one of Bowie s co directors at Publishing said the hoax was not meant to be malicious Part of it was we were very amused that people kept saying Yes I ve heard of him There is a willingness not to appear foolish Critics are too proud for that Boyd the main perpetrator of the hoax agreed saying the doubts were meant to set in very quickly br br br Biography of Nat Tate br br According to his inventor s fictitious biography Nathwell Nat Tate was born probably in Union Beach New Jersey on March His father for whom he was named deserted the family before Tate s birth From the age of Tate an only child lived in Peconic Long Island New York with his mother Mary who worked as a kitchen maid for a wealthy family Mary was killed in a traffic accident in February shortly before Tate s eighth birthday and Tate was subsequently adopted by the family with whom he and his mother had been living br Always interested in painting and drawing Tate studied painting with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown Massachusetts from until and began showing his work in exhibitions of abstract art in New York City in His adoptive family supported Tate paying for his lessons and also buying much of his artwork Tate became a respected albeit minor figure in the New York art scene appreciated by his peers if somewhat obscure to the general public A recurring motif in his works was the representation of bridges which was partly inspired by his readings of the works of Hart Crane br An alcoholic Tate became increasingly irrational towards the end of the decade After a trip to Europe in he became overwhelmed by the quality of art he saw there especially that of Georges Braque whom Tate briefly visited On his return to America Tate insisted on borrowing or buying back his paintings from their owners so he could improve them Apparently unhappy with his work he then simply destroyed all of the paintings he reacquired about of his collected works according to one estimate Emulating the death of Hart Crane Tate committed suicide on January by jumping off the Staten Island Ferry br br br Later appearances br William Boyd included Nat Tate as a minor character in his novel Any Human Heart and in its TV adaptation br In a painting by Nat Tate entitled Bridge no was auctioned at Sotheby s in London The winning bid for the painting which was actually by William Boyd was well above the expected price with the purchaser later revealed to be English television personality Anthony McPartlin The money was given to the Artists General
