GNATS is the GNU project s issue tracking software br GNATS is a set of tools for tracking bugs reported by users to a central site It allows problem report management and communication with users via various means GNATS stores all the information about problem reports in its databases and provides tools for querying editing and maintenance of the databases br GNATS is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License br br br Usage br GNATS is used by GNU packages and NetBSD The Apache Software Foundation used the software from to and the Mutt project until It is also used or was used in the past by the FreeBSD Project OpenBSD Juniper Networks Nordic Optical Telescope CERN Green Bank Telescope NRAO AIPS European Software Institute and the BaBar Project at SLAC br In early June FreeBSD announced concrete plans to migrate from GNATS to Bugzilla claiming that Bugzilla supports finer granularity for categories and keywords Furthermore the announcement states that GNATS is missing many features that people expect from a modern bug tracker br It has been described as having been the cornerstone of free software bug tracking systems br br br History br GNATS was written by Heinz G Seidl of Cygnus Solutions inspired by BSD Unix s sendbug and filebug programs and had its first stable release in Initially its only interface was via email but multiple web and graphical interfaces were later added During the s other Cygnus employees rewrote it and a further major rewrite was done for release with other features contributed by users br Although GNATS is still in use development slowed since the release in Several changes lingered in the developers source code repository and a release was discussed in but no official release was made until some further development leading to release on February br br br Features br Built as a client server architecture GNATS works with many interfaces described below including email command line and web interfaces All GNATS databases and configuration can be stored in plain text files which helps in the modularity of GNATS Categorisation and recategorisation of bug reports is particularly simple br br br Interfaces br Four official interfaces exist for GNATS br br Gnatsweb br A Web interface to query and open tickets with GNATS running as a background process a daemon br Emacs GNATS mode br An extension a major mode for GNU Emacs and XEmacs allowing direct access to GNAT issue trackers br send pr edit pr query pr br The traditional command line interface to create edit and query Problem Reports br TkGnats br A cross platform application written in the Tcl Tk language br Apart from these custom ones can be developed such as OpenBSD s sendbug interface which collects system information and submits Problem Reports via email br br br See also br br Comparison of issue tracking systems br br br br br br External links br Official website br Dan Kegel s GNATS related links Archived at the Wayback Machine many are broken but available via archive org
