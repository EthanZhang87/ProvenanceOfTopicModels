The Public Broadcasting Service PBS is an American public broadcaster and non commercial free to air television network based in Crystal City Virginia PBS is a publicly funded nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational programs to public television stations in the United States distributing shows such as Frontline Nova PBS News Hour Masterpiece Sesame Street and This Old House br PBS is funded by a combination of member station dues the Corporation for Public Broadcasting pledge drives and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source PBS has over member television stations many owned by educational institutions nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution or entities owned by or related to state government br As of PBS has nearly member stations around the United States br br br History br br PBS was established on November by Hartford N Gunn Jr president of WGBH John Macy president of CPB James Day last president of National Educational Television and Kenneth A Christiansen chairman of the department of broadcasting at the University of Florida br It began operations on October taking over many of the functions of its predecessor National Educational Television NET which later merged with Newark New Jersey station WNDT to form WNET In it merged with Educational Television Stations Around the same time the groups started out the National Public Affairs Broadcast Center later National Public Affairs Center for Television which offered news and national affairs to the service The group was later merged into member station WETA TV in br Immediately after public disclosure of the Watergate scandal on May the United States Senate Watergate Committee commenced proceedings PBS broadcast the proceedings nationwide with Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer as commentators Although all of the Big Three TV Networks ran coverage of the hearings PBS re broadcast them on prime time For seven months nightly gavel to gavel broadcasts drew great public interest and raised the profile of the fledgling PBS network br In the Corporation for Public Broadcasting resumed funding for most PBS shows that debuted prior to with the exceptions of Washington Week in Review and Wall Street Week CPB resumed funding of Washington Week in br In The Chronicle of Philanthropy released the results of the largest study on the popularity and credibility of charitable and non profit organizations PBS ranked as the th most popular charity non profit in America from over charities researched in the study conducted by the industry publication with of Americans over the age of choosing love and like a lot for PBS br Since the mid s Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the most trusted national institution in the United States A study by Nielsen Media Research found of all US television households view the network s programs over the course of a year However PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations a large proportion of which may come from its member stations including WGBH TV WETA TV WNET WTTW WQED WHYY TV Twin Cities PBS American Public Television and independent producers This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service presents a frequent source of viewer confusion br In December PBS signed up for the Nielsen ratings audience measurement reports and began to be included in its primetime and daily Television Index reports alongside the major commercial broadcast networks br In May PBS announced that it would incorporate breaks containing underwriter spots for corporate and foundation sponsors program promotions and identification spots within four breaks placed within episodes of Nature and NOVA airing episodes broken up into segments of up to minutes rather than airing them as straight to minute episodes The strategy began that fall with the intent to expand the in program breaks to the remainder of the schedule if successful br In PBS released apps for iOS and Android to allow viewing of full length videos on mobile devices Vern Seward of The Mac Observer calls the PBS iPad App cool on so many levels An update in added Chromecast support br PBS UK was launched as a paid subscription channel in the United Kingdom on November featuring American documentary programming sourced from PBS Better identifying its subject matter this channel was renamed PBS America on July The channel has subsequently become available in other parts of Europe and Australia br On February PBS partnered with AOL to launch Makers Women Who Make America a digital documentary series focusing on high achieving women in male dominated industries such as war comedy space business Hollywood and politics br PBS initially struggled to compete with online media such as YouTube for market share In a speech to top executives from PBS stations Senior Vice President of Digital Jason Seiken warned that PBS was in danger of being disrupted by YouTube studios such as Maker Studios In the speech later described as a seminal moment for public television he laid out his vision for a new style of PBS digital video production Station leadership rallied around his vision and Seiken formed PBS Digital Studios which began producing educational but edgy videos something Seiken called PBS quality with a YouTube sensibility The studio s first hit an auto tuned version of the theme from one of their most famous television programs Mister Rogers Neighborhood was one of YouTube s most viral videos of By monthly video views on PBS org had risen from million to a quarter billion PBS org traffic had surpassed that of the CBS NBC and ABC web sites PBSKids org had become the dominant US children s site for video and PBS had won more Webby Awards than any other media company in the world br On May full length episodes of PBS prime time news and children s programs were made available through the Roku streaming player programming is available on Roku as separate streaming channels for PBS and PBS KIDS content Some content is only available with a PBS Passport member benefit subscription br On July Amazon Prime Video and PBS Distribution entered into a multi year agreement which saw several PBS Kids series on other streaming services move to Amazon Prime Video br PBS Distribution partnered with MultiChoice to launch PBS KIDS on May on DStv and GOtv subscription platforms across its Sub Saharan Africa footprint In mid the channel was added to Australia s Foxtel subscription platform br At the summer Television Critics Association press tour day for PBS on July it was announced that MVPD YouTube TV would begin to carry PBS programming and member stations in the fall of Member stations have the choice of having their traditional channel on the service with its full programming schedule received by Google over the air and uploaded to the service a YouTube TV only feed provided by the station with some programming substitutions due to lack of digital rights or a PBS provided feed with limited localization though with no local programming or pledge drive programming br In PBS announced plans to move its headquarters to another building in the Crystal Gateway complex while remaining in Crystal City Virginia and did so in which included a top building sign visible off the Richmond Highway br On August the Amazon Prime Video platform added a PBS Documentaries package As of that time it offered four separately subscribable selections of PBS programming in the United States PBS Documentaries PBS Living also on Apple TV PBS Masterpiece also in Canada and PBS KIDS In the UK a PBS America documentaries package is available on Amazon Prime Video br On September PBS began to offer a livestream of their member stations for free via its website as well as the websites from the member stations on smart TVs and on their mobile apps However only a small handful of stations currently do not have a livestream of their stations set up Jefferson Graham of USA Today called it Arguably the best bargain in streaming br July saw a PBS Julia Child channel be added to Pluto TV in the United States br The channels PBS Antiques Roadshow Julia Child Antiques Road Trip and PBS Nature were added to a number of American FAST platforms in January br The channels PBS Food in the United States and PBS History in the UK and Australia launched on certain FAST platforms in late br The channel PBS Retro was added to Roku s live TV channel lineup in the United States on April airing a variety of former shows from PBS which are considered retro br br br Operations br Even with its status as a non profit and educational television network PBS engages in program distribution providing television content and related services to its member stations each of which together cooperatively owns the network Unlike the affiliates for commercial TV networks each non profit PBS member station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news interviews cultural and public affairs programs for its individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors br In a commercial broadcast television network structure affiliates give up portions of their local advertising airtime in exchange for carrying network programming and the network pays its affiliates a share of the revenue it earns from advertising By contrast PBS member stations pay fees for the shows acquired and distributed by the national organization Under this relationship PBS member stations have greater latitude in local scheduling than their commercial broadcasting counterparts Scheduling of PBS distributed series may vary greatly depending on the market This can be a source of tension as stations seek to preserve their localism and PBS strives to market a consistent national lineup However PBS has a policy of common carriage which requires most stations to clear the national prime time programs on a common programming schedule to market them nationally more effectively Management at former Los Angeles member KCET cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS after over years in January although it would return to PBS in br Although PBS has a set schedule of programming particularly in regard to its prime time schedule member stations reserve the right to schedule PBS distributed programming in other time slots or not clear it at all if they choose to do so few of the service s members carry all its programming Most PBS stations timeshift some distributed programs Once PBS accepts a program offered for distribution PBS rather than the originating member station retains exclusive rebroadcasting rights during an agreed period Suppliers however retain the right to sell the program s intellectual property in non broadcast media such as DVDs books and sometimes PBS licensed merchandise br br br Programming br br The evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including fine arts Great Performances drama Masterpiece Downton Abbey American Family Journey of Dreams science Nova Nature history American Experience American Masters History Detectives Antiques Roadshow music Austin City Limits Soundstage public affairs Frontline PBS NewsHour Washington Week Nightly Business Report independent films and documentaries P O V Independent Lens home improvement This Old House and interviews Amanpour Company Tavis Smiley The Dick Cavett Show In PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre based schedule for example drama series encompass the Sunday schedule while science related programs are featured on Wednesdays br PBS broadcasts children s programming under the PBS Kids branding as part of the service s and including content supplied by other distributors not programmed by the service its member stations morning and afternoon schedule As the children s programs it distributes are intended to educate as well as entertain its target audience PBS and its stations have long been in compliance with educational programming guidelines set by the Federal Communications Commission in response to the enactment of the Children s Television Act of Many member stations have historically also broadcast distance education and other instructional television programs typically during daytime slots though with the advent of digital television which has allowed stations to carry these programs on digital subchannels in lieu of the main PBS feed or exclusively over online many member stations networks have replaced distance education content with children s and other programming br Unlike its radio counterpart National Public Radio PBS does not have a central program production arm or news division All of the programming carried by PBS whether news documentary or entertainment is created by or in most cases produced under contract with other parties such as individual member stations Boston member WGBH TV is one of the largest producers of educational television programming including shows like American Experience Arthur with Canada based CINAR Masterpiece Theatre Nova Antiques Roadshow and Frontline as well as many other children s and lifestyle programs News programs are produced by WETA TV PBS News Hour in Washington D C WNET in New York City and WPBT in Miami Newark New Jersey New York City member WNET produces or distributes programs such as Secrets of the Dead Nature and Cyberchase PBS also works with other networks for programming such as CNN International for Amanpour Company which is a co production of CNN International and WNET br PBS member stations are known for rebroadcasting British television costume dramas comedies and science fiction programs acquired from the BBC and other sources such as Downton Abbey Allo Allo Are You Being Served The Benny Hill Show Red Dwarf The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin Father Ted Fawlty Towers Harry Enfield Chums Keeping Up Appearances Monty Python s Flying Circus Mr Bean The Vicar of Dibley the original run of Doctor Who and Sherlock However a significant amount of sharing takes place The BBC and British broadcasters such as Channel often cooperate with PBS stations producing material that is shown on both sides of the Atlantic Less frequently Canadian Australian and other international programming appears on PBS stations such as The Red Green Show currently distributed by syndicator Executive Program Services public broadcasting syndicators are more likely to offer this programming to U S based public television stations br PBS is not the only distributor of public television programming to the member stations Other distributors have emerged from the roots of companies that maintained loosely held regional public television stations in the s Boston based American Public Television which among other names was formerly known as Eastern Educational Network and the American Program Service is second only to PBS for distributing programs to U S non commercial stations Another distributor is NETA formerly SECA whose properties have included The Shapies and Jerry Yarnell School of Fine Art In addition the member stations themselves also produce a variety of local shows some of which subsequently receive national distribution through PBS or other distributors br Rerun programming especially domestic programming not originally produced for public television is generally uncommon on PBS or its member stations The most prominent exception to this is The Lawrence Welk Show which has aired continuously in reruns on PBS through the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority almost every weekend since Reruns of programs originally produced for public television are common especially with former PBS shows whose hosts have retired or died for example The Joy of Painting and Mister Rogers Neighborhood Children s programming such as Clifford the Big Red Dog and DragonflyTV the latter of which is also syndicated on commercial television is rerun extensively In and PBS served as the over the air home to select specials from the Peanuts library under sublicense from Apple the deal was not renewed in br br br PBS Kids br br Launched as PTV on July PBS Kids is the brand for children s programs aired by PBS The PBS Kids Channel launched in and operated until was largely funded by satellite provider DirecTV The original channel ceased operations on September in favor of PBS Kids Sprout a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture between PBS Comcast Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners NBCUniversal which Comcast acquired in later acquired the other partners interests in the channel in However the original programming block still exists on PBS filling daytime and in some cases weekend morning schedules on its member stations many members also carry hour locally programmed children s networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels A revived version of the PBS Kids Channel was launched on January As of PBS Kids is the only children s programming block on U S broadcast television br As PBS is often known for doing PBS Kids has broadcast imported series from other countries these include British series originally broadcast by the BBC and ITV Through American Public Television many PBS stations also began airing the Australian series Raggs on June Some of the programs broadcast as part of the service s children s lineup or through public broadcast syndication directly to its members have subsequently been syndicated to commercial television outlets such as Ghostwriter and The Magic School Bus br br br Sports br Many PBS member stations and networks including Mississippi Public Broadcasting MHSAA Georgia Public Broadcasting GHSA Maine Public Broadcasting Network MPA Iowa PBS IGHSAU Nebraska Public Media NSAA and WKYU TV Western Kentucky Hilltoppers locally broadcast high school and college sports From the s onward the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost prohibitive in that timeframe especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential in addition starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network now defunct and Big Ten Network in and and the later launches of the Pac Network and ESPN s SEC Network and ACC Network athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university s sports programs for their cable channels restricting their use from PBS member stations even those associated with their own universities br From to KQED produced a series of Bundesliga matches under the banner Soccer Made in Germany with Toby Charles announcing PBS also carried tennis events as well as Ivy League football Notable football commentators included Upton Bell Marty Glickman Bob Casciola Brian Dowling Sean McDonough and Jack Corrigan Other sports programs included interview series such as The Way It Was and The Sporting Life br br br Governance br The board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS consisting of members professional directors station managers general directors outside directors and the PBS president All PBS Board members serve three year terms without pay PBS member stations elect the professional directors the board elects the general directors and appoints the PBS president and CEO and the entire board elects its officers br br br Member stations br br As of March PBS maintains current memberships with television stations encompassing states the District of Columbia and four U S possessions as such it is the only television broadcaster in the United States commercial or non commercial which has station partners licensed in every U S state by comparison none of the five major commercial broadcast networks has affiliates in certain states where PBS has members most notably New Jersey The service has an estimated national reach of of all households in the United States or Americans with at least one television set br PBS stations are commonly operated by nonprofit organizations state agencies local authorities such as municipal boards of education or universities in their city of license this is similar albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main PBS member to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the U S in which network affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country In some U S states a group of PBS stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single regional subnetwork such as Alabama Public Television and Arkansas PBS in this model PBS programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other full power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low power translators in other areas of the state Some states may be served by such a regional network and simultaneously have PBS member stations in a certain city such as the case with secondary member KBDI TV in Denver which is not related to Colorado member network Rocky Mountain PBS and its flagship station and primary Denver PBS member KRMA TV that operate autonomously from the regional member network br As opposed to the present commercial broadcasting model in which network programs are often carried exclusively on one television station in a given market PBS may maintain more than one member station in certain markets which may be owned by the licensee of the market s primary PBS member station or owned by a separate licensee as a prime example KOCE TV KLCS and KVCR DT which are all individually owned serve as PBS stations for the Los Angeles market KCET served as the market s primary PBS member until it left the service in January at which time it was replaced by KOCE KCET rejoined PBS in thus giving the Los Angeles area four different member stations br For these cases PBS utilizes the Program Differentiation Plan which divides by percentage the number of programs distributed by the service that each member can carry on their schedule often this assigns a larger proportion of PBS distributed programming to the primary member station with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser number of program offerings from the service s schedule Unlike public broadcasters in most other countries PBS cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any owned and operated stations This is partly due to the origins of the PBS stations themselves and partly due to historical broadcast license issues br br br Participating stations br Most PBS member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs Current regularly scheduled programming on the PBS national feed is produced by a smaller group of stations including br br WGBH TV Arthur NOVA Masterpiece Frontline Martha Speaks Peep and the Big Wide World Curious George Lidia s Kitchen Design Squad Jamie Oliver etc br WNET Nature PBS NewsHour Weekend Cyberchase Amanpour Company

a number of television networks often in partnership with other media companies PBS YOU a distance education and how to service operated between and and was largely succeeded by Create a similarly formatted network owned by American Public Television The hour PBS Kids Channel has had two iterations in the age of digital television one which existed between and being superseded by PBS Kids Sprout and the current version which was launched in World began operations in as a service operated by PBS but is now managed by American Public Television br PBS has also restructured its satellite feed system simplifying HD PBS West into a timeshift feed for the Pacific Time Zone rather than a high definition complement to its formerly primary SD feed PBS Kids Go was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for the original version of the PBS Kids Channel however plans to launch the network were folded in Programming from the PBS Satellite Service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks to fill their overnight schedules particularly those that have transitioned to a hour schedule since the late s in lieu of providing programming sourced from outside public television distributors or repeats of local programming program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on PBS during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to insert local airtime information br Some or all of these services are available on a digital cable tier of many cable providers on a free to air FTA satellite receiver receiving from PBS Satellite Service as well as via subscription based direct broadcast satellite providers With the exception of Sprout some of these services including those from PBS member stations and networks have not made contracts with Internet distributed over the top MVPD services such as Sling TV and the now defunct PlayStation Vue With the transition to over the air digital television broadcasts many of the services are also often now available as standard definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some member stations while HD PBS West serves as a secondary HD feed With the absence of advertising network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization at the end of the program which includes the standard series of bumpers from the Be More campaign br br br Independent networks br While not operated or controlled by PBS proper additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by PBS member stations The following three are also distributed by PBS via satellite br br From to Buffalo New York member station WNED TV operated ThinkBright TV a service that was carried on several stations in upstate New York Several state networks also offer a public affairs subchannel network offering full time coverage of state government events and legislative judicial proceedings in the same vein as C SPAN s coverage of the federal government Many PBS stations also carried MHz Worldview from the MHz Networks until when MHz Networks announced its discontinuation of the network on March Since then many stations has switched to World Channel as well as First Nations Experience br A separate but related concept is the state network where a group of stations across a state simulcast a single programming schedule from a central facility which may include specialty subchannels unique to that broadcaster br br br Visual identity br br PBS introduced its first iconographic logo in a multi colored wordmark of the network s initials with the P designed to resemble a silhouette of a human face The logo was designed by Ernie Smith and Herb Lubalin of the Lubalin Smith Carnase design firm Lubalin s human face P known internally at PBS as Everyman but more commonly known as the P Head became the basis for all subsequent PBS logos br In PBS introduced a new version of the logo designed by Tom Geismar of Chermayeff Geismar Chermayeff Geismar felt that the Lubalin designed logo was too similar to those of the three dominant commercial networks of the time and they sought to develop a symbol that could stand for the more inclusive concept of public television They inverted Lubalin s Everyman P to face to the right instead of the left and repeated the outline as a series to represent a multitude of people The symbol was subsequently renamed Everyone The repeated outline of the face has also been interpreted to suggest a degree of multiculturalism as well as the public service aspect of the PBS mission br The logo has been used in various forms since from onward the Geismar logo has been rendered in white on a circle br On November in honor of the network s th anniversary PBS unveiled a revamped brand identity by Lippincott intended to be better suited for use on digital platforms The Geismar logo was tweaked a new custom sans serif typeface was commissioned for the logo and other branding elements which replaces the slab serif typeface used in the PBS logo since and electric blue and white were adopted as corporate colors The network is allowing flexibility in implementation but is no longer allowing the logo to be displayed independently of the PBS name Upon the launch of the new logo some members rebranded themselves to include PBS in their name for the first time such as Wisconsin Public Television rebranding as PBS Wisconsin PBS is paying out grants to at least members to cover costs associated with the rebranding br br br Reception br br br Critical response br PBS has been praised by critics for its variety of programming Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter marked PBS airing of Downton Abbey as a turning point for the network s reputation and program variety He also wrote It s PBS s time to shine and said that the network is an endless bounty of riches Ain t this great Stevenonymous of BuzzFeed wrote PBS isn t just TV anymore David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun wrote If you want a reason to believe in PBS here it is Mekeisha Madden Toby of TheWrap wrote There is a lot to love on PBS Kristen McQuinn of Book Riot wrote PBS is awesome in every way Caroline Framke of Variety wrote There s still no beating PBS Alyssa Rosenburg of The Washington Post wrote PBS is a unifying thread through our cultural fabric Margaret Renkl of The New York Times wrote By aiming to unite PBS might save us yet Margie Barron of Entertainment Today wrote PBS remains a beacon that inspires The Marketing Research Resources survey said that PBS is the most trusted media years in a row In the network had News Documentary Emmy Award nominations more than any other organization Matt Roush of TV Insider wrote PBS is and always has been a bright light For the PBS Arts program Rob Owen of Pittsburgh Post Gazette wrote A gift to viewers br br br On air fundraising br Since to of public television s revenues come from private membership donations and grants most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising pledge drives or telethons which disrupt regularly scheduled programming This has been perceived as potentially annoying since regularly scheduled programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience such as music specials aimed at the Baby Boomer generation and financial health and motivational programs to solicit new members and donations during fundraising events these programs are often interrupted within the broadcast by long form segments of six to eight minutes in length encouraging viewers to donate to their PBS member Underwriting spots are aired at the end of each program which differ from traditional commercials in several ways Each spot must be approved to meet several guidelines The main guidelines state that underwriting spots cannot be qualitative in any way nor can they have any call to action br br br Controversies br br br Accusations of political ideological bias br A broadcast of the United States Information Agency program Let Poland be Poland about the martial law declared in Poland in was widely viewed in the U S but met with skepticism on the part of eastern European broadcasters communist countries at the time due to concerns that the program s provocative and anticommunist tone was intended as propaganda br In at least three public television stations were caught selling or trading their mailing lists with the Democratic National Committee Under IRS regulations nonprofit organizations are prohibited from participating in political actions Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting condemned the practice and conducted an investigation into the matter The stations involved were in New York Boston and Washington br Individual programs aired by PBS have been the targets of organized campaigns by individuals and groups with opposing views including by former United States Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings in br Nonetheless in every year since surveys of Americans have shown PBS to have been consistently ranked as the most trusted institution in comparison to commercial broadcast and cable television newspapers and streaming services and in January Americans valued tax dollars spent on PBS behind only military defense and oversight of food and drug safety br br br Accusations during Tomlinson tenure br In September Kenneth Tomlinson was chosen as chairman of the CPB board He criticized PBS and NPR for an allegedly liberal bias His efforts sparked complaints of political pressure br To partially balance out the perceived left leaning PBS shows from June to July PBS aired Tucker Carlson Unfiltered with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson and from September to December PBS aired The Journal Editorial Report with Paul Gigot a conservative editor of The Wall Street Journal editorial page In December Bill Moyers resigned as a PBS regular citing political pressure to alter the content of his program and saying Tomlinson had mounted a vendetta against him br In May two House Democrats requested the CPB inspector general investigate the complaints of political interference The inspector general s report was issued in November and described possible political influence on personnel decisions including e mail correspondence between Tomlinson and the White House which indicated that Tomlinson was strongly motivated by political considerations in filling the president CEO position a position filled in June by former Republican National Committee co chair Patricia Harrison Tomlinson resigned from the CPB board on November br br br Accusations since the Tomlinson tenure br In January Michael Beller the chief attorney for PBS resigned after being caught on tape suggesting that the children of Donald Trump supporters should be sent to re education camps br br br Lawsuit with Pacific Arts br In the s PBS became involved in a dispute over home video licensing rights with Pacific Arts Corporation a multimedia company owned and operated by former Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith br In Pacific Arts secured a contract with PBS to distribute their back catalog of programming on VHS under the PBS Home Video banner However in the early s Pacific Arts and PBS went through a series of serious disagreements Lawsuits were filed by Nesmith and Pacific Arts against PBS for breach of contract intentional misrepresentation intentional concealment negligent misrepresentation and interference with contract and by PBS against Nesmith and Pacific Arts for lost royalties The lawsuits escalated in and into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments PBS and Nesmith and Pacific Arts vigorously prosecuted these multimillion dollar counter suits br The six plaintiffs included PBS WGBH TV WNET the Ken Burns owned American Documentaries and Radio Pioneers Film Project and the Children s Television Workshop They sought approximately million in disputed royalties advances guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the PBS logo from the defendants Pacific Arts and Nesmith br Due to the cost of the litigation Pacific Arts was forced to cease distribution operations and suspended the use of the PBS logo on the Pacific Arts videos Though Pacific Arts distribution system had ceased operating the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee Nesmith had made to PBS in the original PBS deal in br The cases went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in February After three days of deliberation the jury unanimously sided with Nesmith The court awarded Pacific Arts for loss of its rights library plus in punitive damages The jury awarded million to Nesmith personally including million in punitive damages for a total award to Nesmith and Pacific Arts of The jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering Pacific Arts and Nesmith to pay approximately million to American Documentaries for The Civil War about to WGBH TV and to WNET br Following the ruling Nesmith expressed his personal disappointment with PBS and was quoted by BBC News as stating It s like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo You re happy to get your stereo back but it s sad to find out your grandmother is a thief br The decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out of court settlement br br br Warning Alert and Response Network WARN br PBS provides an alternative path for Wireless Emergency Alerts to wireless carriers through its Warning Alert and Response Network WARN The alerts are transmitted through the PBS satellite network on the AMC satellite to PBS stations who then broadcast the messages over their transmitters for reception by wireless carriers at their cell sites br The WARN network is funded by a grant
