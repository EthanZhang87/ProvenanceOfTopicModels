Netscape Navigator is a discontinued proprietary web browser and the original browser of the Netscape line from versions to and x It was the flagship product of the Netscape Communications Corp and was the dominant web browser in terms of usage share in the s but by around its user base had all but disappeared This was partly because the Netscape Corporation later purchased by AOL did not sustain Netscape Navigator s technical innovation in the late s br The business demise of Netscape was a central premise of Microsoft s antitrust trial wherein the Court ruled that Microsoft s bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system was a monopolistic and illegal business practice The decision came too late for Netscape however as Internet Explorer had by then become the dominant web browser in Windows br The Netscape Navigator web browser was succeeded by the Netscape Communicator suite in Netscape Communicator s x source code was the base for the Netscape developed Mozilla Application Suite which was later renamed SeaMonkey Netscape s Mozilla Suite also served as the base for a browser only spinoff called Mozilla Firefox br The Netscape Navigator name returned in when AOL announced version of the Netscape series of browsers Netscape Navigator On December AOL canceled its development but continued supporting the web browser with security updates until March AOL allows downloading of archived versions of the Netscape Navigator web browser family br br br History and development br br br Origin br br Netscape Navigator was inspired by the success of the Mosaic web browser which was co written by Marc Andreessen a part time employee of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois After Andreessen graduated in he moved to California and there met Jim Clark the recently departed founder of Silicon Graphics Clark believed that the Mosaic browser had great commercial possibilities and provided the seed money Soon Mosaic Communications Corporation was in business in Mountain View California with Andreessen as a vice president Since the University of Illinois was unhappy with the company s use of the Mosaic name the company changed its name to Netscape Communications suggested by product manager Greg Sands and named its flagship web browser Netscape Navigator br Netscape announced in its first press release October that it would make Navigator available without charge to all non commercial users and beta versions of version and were freely downloadable in November and March with the full version available in December However two months later the company announced that only educational and non profit institutions could use version at no charge br The reversal was complete with the availability of version beta on March in which a press release states that the final release would be available at no cost only for academic and non profit organizational use br The first few releases of the product were made available in commercial and evaluation versions for example version and version N The N evaluation versions were identical to the commercial versions the letter was intended as a reminder to people to pay for the browser once they felt they had tried it long enough and were satisfied with it This distinction was formally dropped within a year of the initial release and the full version of the browser continued to be made available for free online with boxed versions available on floppy disks and later CDs in stores along with a period of phone support During this era Internet Starter Kit books were popular and usually included a floppy disk or CD containing internet software and this was a popular means of obtaining Netscape s and other browsers Email support was initially free and remained so for a year or two until the volume of support requests grew too high br During development the Netscape browser was known by the code name Mozilla which became the name of a Godzilla like cartoon dragon mascot used prominently on the company s web site The Mozilla name was also used as the User Agent in HTTP requests by the browser Other web browsers claimed to be compatible with Netscape s extensions to HTML and therefore used the same name in their User Agent identifiers so that web servers would send them the same pages as were sent to Netscape browsers Mozilla is now a generic name for matters related to the open source successor to Netscape Communicator and is most identified with the browser Firefox br br br Rise of Netscape br When the consumer Internet revolution arrived in the mid s Netscape was well positioned to take advantage of it and the influx of new users it brought With a good mix of features and an attractive licensing scheme that allowed free use for non commercial purposes the Netscape browser soon became the de facto standard particularly on the Windows platform Internet service providers and computer magazine publishers helped make Navigator readily available br An innovation that Netscape introduced in was the on the fly display of web pages where text and graphics appeared on the screen as the web page downloaded Earlier web browsers would not display a page until all graphics on it had been loaded over the network connection this meant a user might have only a blank page for several minutes With Netscape people using dial up connections could begin reading the text of a web page within seconds of entering a web address even before the rest of the text and graphics had finished downloading This made the web much more tolerable to the average user br Through the late s Netscape made sure that Navigator remained the technical leader among web browsers New features included cookies frames proxy auto config and JavaScript in version Although those and other innovations eventually became open standards of the W C and ECMA and were emulated by other browsers they were often viewed as controversial Netscape according to critics was more interested in bending the web to its own de facto standards bypassing standards committees and thus marginalizing the commercial competition than it was in fixing bugs in its products Consumer rights advocates were particularly critical of cookies and of commercial web sites using them to invade individual privacy br In the marketplace however these concerns made little difference Netscape Navigator remained the market leader with more than usage share The browser software was available for a wide range of operating systems including Windows NT Macintosh Linux OS and many versions of Unix including OSF Sun Solaris BSD OS IRIX AIX and HP UX and looked and worked nearly identically on every one of them Netscape began to experiment with prototypes of a web based system known internally as Constellation which would allow users to access and edit their files anywhere across a network no matter what computer or operating system they happened to be using br Industry observers forecast the dawn of a new era of connected computing The underlying operating system it was believed would not be an important consideration future applications would run within a web browser This was seen by Netscape as a clear opportunity to entrench Navigator at the heart of the next generation of computing and thus gain the opportunity to expand into all manner of other software and service markets br br br Decline br br With the success of Netscape showing the importance of the web more people were using the Internet due in part to the ease of using Netscape Internet browsing began to be seen as a potentially profitable market Following Netscape s lead Microsoft started a campaign to enter the web browser software market Like Netscape before them Microsoft licensed the Mosaic source code from Spyglass Inc which in turn licensed code from University of Illinois Using this basic code Microsoft created Internet Explorer IE br The competition between Microsoft and Netscape dominated the browser wars Internet Explorer Version shipped in the Internet Jumpstart Kit in Microsoft Plus For Windows and IE Version the first cross platform version of the web browser supporting both Windows and Mac OS were thought by many to be inferior and primitive when compared to contemporary versions of Netscape Navigator With the release of IE version Microsoft was able to catch up with Netscape competitively with IE Version further improvement in terms of market share IE improved stability and took significant market share from Netscape Navigator for the first time br There were two versions of Netscape Navigator the Standard Edition and the Gold Edition The latter consisted of the Navigator browser with e mail news readers and a WYSIWYG web page compositor however these extra functions enlarged and slowed the software rendering it prone to crashing br This Gold Edition was renamed Netscape Communicator starting with version the name change diluted its name recognition and confused users Netscape CEO James L Barksdale insisted on the name change because Communicator was a general purpose client application which contained the Navigator browser br The aging Netscape Communicator x was slower than Internet Explorer Typical web pages had become heavily illustrated often JavaScript intensive and encoded with HTML features designed for specific purposes but now employed as global layout tools HTML tables the most obvious example of this were especially difficult for Communicator to render The Netscape browser once a solid product became crash prone and buggy for example some versions re downloaded an entire web page to re render it when the browser window was re sized a nuisance to dial up users and the browser would usually crash when the page contained simple Cascading Style Sheets as proper support for CSS never made it into Communicator x At the time that Communicator was being developed Netscape had a competing technology called JavaScript Style Sheets Near the end of the development cycle it became obvious that CSS would prevail so Netscape quickly implemented a CSS to JSSS converter which then processed CSS as JSSS this is why turning JavaScript off also disabled CSS Moreover Netscape Communicator s browser interface design appeared dated in comparison to Internet Explorer and interface changes in Microsoft and Apple s operating systems br By the end of the decade Netscape s web browser had lost dominance over the Windows platform and the August Microsoft financial agreement to invest million in Apple Computer required that Apple make Internet Explorer the default web browser in new Mac OS distributions The latest IE Mac release at that time was Internet Explorer version for Macintosh but Internet Explorer was released later that year br Microsoft succeeded in having ISPs and PC vendors distribute Internet Explorer to their customers instead of Netscape Navigator mostly due to Microsoft using its leverage from Windows OEM licenses and partly aided by Microsoft s investment in making IE brandable such that a customized version of IE could be offered Also web developers used proprietary browser specific extensions in web pages Both Microsoft and Netscape did this having added many proprietary HTML tags to their browsers which forced users to choose between two competing and almost incompatible web browsers br In March Netscape released most of the development code base for Netscape Communicator under an open source license Only pre alpha versions of Netscape were released before the open source community decided to scrap the Netscape Navigator codebase entirely and build a new web browser around the Gecko layout engine which Netscape had been developing but which had not yet incorporated The community developed open source project was named Mozilla Netscape Navigator s original code name America Online bought Netscape Netscape programmers took a pre beta quality form of the Mozilla codebase gave it a new GUI and released it as Netscape This did nothing to win back users who continued to migrate to Internet Explorer After the release of Netscape and a long public beta test Mozilla was released on June The same code base notably the Gecko layout engine became the basis of independent applications including Firefox and Thunderbird br On December the Netscape developers announced that AOL had canceled development of Netscape Navigator leaving it unsupported as of March Archived and unsupported versions of the browser remain available for download br br br Legacy br Netscape s contributions to the web include JavaScript which was submitted as a new standard to Ecma International The resultant ECMAScript specification allowed JavaScript support by multiple web browsers and its use as a cross browser scripting language long after Netscape Navigator itself had dropped in popularity Another example is the FRAME tag which is widely supported today and that has been incorporated into official web standards such as the HTML Frameset specification br In a PC World column the original Netscape Navigator was considered the best tech product of all time due to its impact on the Internet br br br See also br Comparison of web browsers br History of the World Wide Web br List of web browsers br Netscape
