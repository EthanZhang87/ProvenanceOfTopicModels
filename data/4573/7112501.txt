Firefox s global market share as of February were generally in the range of and then dropped as users migrated to Firefox and later Firefox br Partially as a result of this between mid December and the end of January Firefox was the most popular browser when counting individual browser versions passing Internet Explorer br Mozilla ended support for Firefox on March with the release of br br br Development br br Firefox was developed under the codename Gran Paradiso This like other Firefox codenames is the name of an actual place in this case the seventh highest mountain in the Graian Alps where they first came up with the idea br Planning began in October when the development team asked users to submit feature requests that they wished to be included in Firefox br The Mozilla Foundation released the first beta on November the second beta on December the third beta on February the fourth beta on March and the fifth and final beta on April The first release candidate was announced on May followed by a second release candidate on June and a third differing from the second release candidate only in that it corrected a serious bug for Mac users on June Mozilla shipped the final release on June br On its release date Firefox was featured in popular culture mentioned on The Colbert Report among others br br br Changes and features br br br Backend changes br One of the big changes in Firefox is the implementation of Gecko an updated layout engine The new version fixes many bugs improves standard compliance and implements new web APIs In particular it makes Firefox the first official release of a Mozilla browser to pass the Acid test a standards compliance test for web page rendering It also receives a better score on the Acid test than Firefox br Some of the new features are defined in the WHATWG HTML specification such as support for web based protocol handlers a native implementation of the getElementsByClassName method support for safe message passing with postMessage and support for offline web applications Other new features include APNG support and EXSLT support br A new internal memory allocator jemalloc is used rather than the default libc one br Gecko uses Cairo as a graphics backend allowing for improved graphics performance and better consistency of the look and feel on various operating systems Because of Cairo s lack of support for Windows Windows Windows ME and Windows NT versions and below and because Microsoft ended support for Windows and Windows ME on July Firefox does not run on those operating systems Similarly the Mac version of Firefox runs only on Mac OS X or higher but unlike previous versions has a native Cocoa widget interface br br br Frontend changes br br As for the frontend changes Firefox features a redesigned download manager with built in search and the ability to resume downloads Also a new plug in manager is included in the add ons window and extensions can be installed with a package manager Microformats are supported for use by software that can understand their use in documents to store data in a machine readable form br The password manager in Firefox asks the user if they would like it to remember the password after the login attempt rather than before By doing this users are able to avoid storing an incorrect password in the password manager after a bad login attempt br Firefox uses a Places system for storing bookmarks and history in an SQLite backend The new system stores more information about the user s history and bookmarks in particular letting the user tag the pages It is also used to implement an improved frecency based algorithm for the new location bar auto complete feature dubbed the Awesomebar br The Mac version of Firefox supports Growl notifications the Mac OS X spell checker and Aqua style form controls br br br Themes br To give the browser a more native look and feel on different operating systems Firefox uses separate themes for Mac OS X Linux Windows XP and Windows Vista When running on GNOME Firefox displays icons from the environment thus when the desktop environment icon theme changes Firefox follows suit Additional icons were also made to be used when no appropriate icon exists these were made following the Tango Desktop Project guidelines Additionally the GTK version has replaced the non native tab bar that was implemented in Firefox and instead uses the native GTK tab style br The default icons and icon layout for Firefox also changed dramatically taking on a keyhole shape for the forward and back buttons by default on two of the three platforms However the keyhole shape does not take effect in Linux or in the small icon mode The Iconfactory created the icons for the Microsoft Windows platform In addition separate icons sets are displayed for Windows XP and Vista br br br Breakpad br br Breakpad previously called Airbag is an open source crash reporter utility which replaced the proprietary Talkback It has been developed by Google and Mozilla and used in Firefox and Thunderbird This product is significant because it is the first open source multi platform crash reporting system br During development Breakpad was first included May in Firefox trunk builds on Windows NT Mac OS X and weeks later on Linux Breakpad replaced Talkback also known as the Quality Feedback Agent as the crash reporter used by the Mozilla software to report crashes of its products to a centralized server for aggregation or case by case analysis Talkback was proprietary software licensed to the Mozilla Corporation by SupportSoft br br br Usage br br Net Applications noted that the use of Firefox beta rapidly increased to a usage share of in May They interpreted this increase to mean that Firefox betas were stable and that users were using it as their primary browser Within hours after the release of Firefox usage rose from under to over according to Net Applications It reached a peak of in April before declining as users switched to Firefox and later Firefox br br br Guinness World Record br Mozilla sets record for most software downloads in hours at Wikinews br The official date

announced date the download day was June for time zones greater than GMT which includes half of Asia and all of Oceania br The large number of users attempting to access the Mozilla website on June caused it to become unavailable for at least a few hours and attempts at upgrading to the new version resulted in server timeouts The site was not updated for the download of Firefox until PDT UTC two
