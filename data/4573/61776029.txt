title: Firefox early version history
id: 61776029
The project that became Firefox today began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m b or mozilla browser Firefox retains the cross platform nature of the original Mozilla browser using the XUL user interface markup language The use of XUL makes it possible to extend the browser s capabilities through the use of extensions and themes The development and installation processes of these add ons raised security concerns and with the release of Firefox the Mozilla Foundation opened a Mozilla Update website containing approved themes and extensions The use of XUL sets Firefox apart from other browsers including other projects based on Mozilla s Gecko layout engine and most other browsers which use interfaces native to their respective platforms Galeon and Epiphany use GTK K Meleon uses MFC and Camino uses Cocoa Many of these projects started before Firefox and probably served as inspiration br br br Releases br br br Phoenix and Firebird br br Hyatt Ross Hewitt and Chanial developed their browser to combat the perceived software bloat of the Mozilla Suite codenamed internally referred to and continued by the community as SeaMonkey which integrated features such as IRC mail news and WYSIWYG HTML editing into one internet suite After it was sufficiently developed binaries for public testing appeared in September under the name Phoenix This name carried the implication of the mythical firebird that rose triumphantly from the ashes of its dead predecessor in this case Netscape Navigator which lost the First browser war to Microsoft s Internet Explorer The name Mozilla began as the internal codename for the original Netscape Navigator browser aiming to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world s most popular web browser The name for this would be Mosaic killer was meant to evoke the building crushing Godzilla The name Mozilla was revived as the open sourcing spinoff organization from Netscape br The name Phoenix remained until April when it was changed because of a trademark dispute with the BIOS manufacturer Phoenix Technologies which produces a BIOS based browser called Phoenix FirstWare Connect The new name Firebird met with mixed reactions particularly as the Firebird database server already carried the name In response the Mozilla Foundation stated that the browser should always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion with the database software br br br Firefox br br Due to continuing pressure from the Firebird community on February the project was renamed again to Mozilla Firefox The name Firefox a reference to the red panda was chosen for its similarity to Firebird and its uniqueness in the computing industry To ensure that no further name changes would be necessary the Mozilla Foundation began the process of registering Firefox as a trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in December This trademark process led to a delay of several months in the release of Firefox when the foundation discovered that Firefox had already been registered as a trademark in the UK for Charlton Company software The situation was resolved when the foundation was given a license to use Charlton s European trademark br Firefox version was released on November The launch of version was accompanied by a respectable amount of pre launch fervor including a fan organized campaign to run a full page ad in The New York Times br Although the Mozilla Foundation had intended to make the Mozilla Suite obsolete and replace it with Firefox the Foundation continued to maintain the suite until April because it had many corporate users and was bundled with other software The Mozilla community as opposed to the Foundation continues to release new versions of the suite using the product name SeaMonkey to avoid confusion with the original Mozilla Suite br br br Firefox br br Firefox was released on November Originally it was planned to have a version at an earlier date as the new Firefox version after with development on a later version in a separate development branch but during both branches and their feature sets were merged the Mozilla Foundation abandoned the release plan after the first two alpha builds resulting in an official release date between the original dates planned for both versions br Version implemented a new Mac like options interface the subject of much criticism from Microsoft Windows and Linux users with a Sanitize action to allow someone to clear their privacy related information without manually clicking the Clear All button In Firefox a user could clear all privacy related settings simply by exiting the browser or using a keyboard shortcut depending on their settings Moreover the software update system was improved with binary patches now possible There were also improvements in the extension management system with a number of new developer features In addition Firefox had preliminary SVG support br Behind the screens the new version resynchronized the code base of the release builds as opposed to nightly builds with the core trunk which contained additional features not available in as it branched from the trunk around the release As such there was a backlog of bug fixes between and the release of which were made available in br There were also changes in operating system support As announced on June by the Mozilla Foundation Firefox which later became and other new Mozilla products have no longer supported Mac OS X v in order to improve the quality of Firefox releases on Mac OS X v and above Firefox is the final version to support Windows br Alpha builds of Firefox id est a and a did not carry Firefox branding they were labelled Deer Park which was Firefox s internal codename and contained a different program icon This was done to dissuade end users from downloading preview versions which are intended for developers only br br br Firefox br br On October Mozilla released Firefox This version included updates to the tabbed browsing environment the extensions manager the GUI Graphical User Interface and the find search and software update engines It also implemented a new session restore feature inline spell checking and an anti phishing feature which was implemented by Google as an extension and later merged into the program itself br In December Firefox Live Chat was launched It allowed users to ask volunteers questions through a system powered by Jive Software with guaranteed hours of operation and the possibility of help after hours br Firefox was the final version that could run under an unmodified installation of Windows NT Windows and Windows Me Subsequently Mozilla Corporation announced it would not develop new versions of Firefox after the release but continued Firefox development as long as other programs such as Thunderbird mail client depended on it The final internal release was released in late April br br br Firefox br br Firefox was released on June by the Mozilla Corporation Firefox uses version of the Mozilla Gecko layout engine for displaying web pages This version fixes many bugs improves standard compliance and implements new web APIs Other new features include a redesigned download manager a new Places system for storing bookmarks and history and separate themes for different operating systems br Development stretches back to the first Firefox beta under the codename Gran Paradiso which had been released several months earlier on November and was followed by several more beta releases in spring culminating in the June release Firefox had more than million unique downloads the day it was released setting a Guinness World Record br br br Firefox br br Version codenamed Shiretoko adds a variety of new features to Firefox Initially numbered Firefox Mozilla developers decided to change the numbering of the release to in order to reflect a significantly greater scope of changes than originally planned The final release was on June The changes included much faster performance thanks to an upgrade to SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine called TraceMonkey and rendering improvements and support for the video and audio tags as defined in the HTML specification with a goal to offer video playback without being encumbered by patent problems associated with many video technologies Cross site XMLHttpRequests XHR which can allow for more powerful web applications and an easier way to implement mashups are also implemented in A new global JSON object contains native functions to efficiently and safely serialize and deserialize JSON objects as specified by the ECMAScript draft Full CSS selector support has been added Firefox uses the Gecko engine which includes a few features that were not included in the release Multi touch touchpad support was also added to the release including gesture support like pinching for zooming and swiping for back and forward Firefox also features an updated logo br br br Firefox br br Version released on January uses the Gecko engine and includes several interface improvements such as personas This release was referred to as before was changed to The codename for this version was Namoroka This is the last major official version to run on PowerPC based Macintoshes br One minor update to Firefox version code named Lorentz is the first minor update to make non intrusive changes other than minor stability and security fixes It adds Out of Process Plugins OOPP which runs plugins in a separate process allowing Firefox to recover from plugin crashes Firefox lengthens the amount of time a plugin is allowed to be unresponsive before the plugin quits br br br Firefox br br On October Brendan Eich Mozilla s then Chief Technology Officer wrote about the plans for Mozilla referring to the most comprehensive iteration since its creation of the overall platform on which Firefox and other Mozilla products run Most of the objectives were gradually incorporated into Firefox through versions and The largest changes however were planned for Firefox br After five Alpha releases twelve Beta releases and two Release Candidate versions Firefox was released on March originally Firefox Gecko during its alpha stage brought a new user interface and is said to be faster Early mockups of the new interface on Windows Mac OS X and Linux were first made available in July Other new features included improved notifications tab groups switch to tab where opened tabs can be searched through the address bar application tabs a redesigned add on manager integration with Firefox Sync and support for
