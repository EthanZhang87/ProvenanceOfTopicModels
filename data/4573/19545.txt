MySQL is an open source relational database management system RDBMS Its name is a combination of My the name of co founder Michael Widenius s daughter My and SQL the acronym for Structured Query Language A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other these relations help structure the data SQL is a language that programmers use to create modify and extract data from the relational database as well as control user access to the database In addition to relational databases and SQL an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer s storage system manages users allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups br MySQL is free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License and is also available under a variety of proprietary licenses MySQL was owned and sponsored by the Swedish company MySQL AB which was bought by Sun Microsystems now Oracle Corporation In when Oracle acquired Sun Widenius forked the open source MySQL project to create MariaDB br MySQL has stand alone clients that allow users to interact directly with a MySQL database using SQL but more often MySQL is used with other programs to implement applications that need relational database capability MySQL is a component of the LAMP web application software stack and others which is an acronym for Linux Apache MySQL Perl PHP Python MySQL is used by many database driven web applications including Drupal Joomla phpBB and WordPress MySQL is also used by many popular websites including Facebook Flickr MediaWiki Twitter and YouTube br br br Overview br MySQL is written in C and C Its SQL parser is written in yacc but it uses a home brewed lexical analyzer MySQL works on many system platforms including AIX BSDi FreeBSD HP UX ArcaOS eComStation IBM i IRIX Linux macOS Microsoft Windows NetBSD Novell NetWare OpenBSD OpenSolaris OS Warp QNX Oracle Solaris Symbian SunOS SCO OpenServer SCO UnixWare Sanos and Tru A port of MySQL to OpenVMS also exists br The MySQL server software itself and the client libraries use dual licensing distribution They are offered under GPL version or a proprietary license br Support can be obtained from the official manual Free support additionally is available in different IRC channels and forums Oracle offers paid support via its MySQL Enterprise products They differ in the scope of services and in price Additionally a number of third party organisations exist to provide support and services br MySQL has received positive reviews and reviewers noticed it performs extremely well in the average case and that the developer interfaces are there and the documentation not to mention feedback in the real world via Web sites and the like is very very good It has also been tested to be a fast stable and true multi user multi threaded SQL database server br br br History br br MySQL was created by a Swedish company MySQL AB founded by Swedes David Axmark Allan Larsson and Finnish Michael Monty Widenius br Original development of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark began in The first version of MySQL appeared on May It was initially created for personal usage from mSQL based on the low level language ISAM which the creators considered too slow and inflexible They created a new SQL interface while keeping the same API as mSQL By keeping the API consistent with the mSQL system many developers were able to use MySQL instead of the proprietarily licensed mSQL antecedent br br br Milestones br Additional milestones in MySQL development included br br First internal release on May br Version End of from www tcx se br Version January br Windows version was released on January for Windows and NT br Version production release from www mysql com br Version alpha beta from br Version beta from June production release January br Version beta from August production release March unions br Version beta from June production release October R trees and B trees subqueries prepared statements br Version beta from March production release October cursors stored procedures triggers views XA transactions br The developer of the Federated Storage Engine states that The Federated Storage Engine is a proof of concept storage engine but the main distributions of MySQL version included it and turned it on by default Documentation of some of the short comings appears in MySQL Federated Tables The Missing Manual br Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB in br Version production release November event scheduler partitioning plugin API row based replication server log tables br Version contained known crashing and wrong result bugs in addition to the present in version almost all fixed as of release br MySQL and alpha showed poor performance when used for data warehousing partly due to its inability to utilize multiple CPU cores for processing a single query br Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems on January br The day Oracle announced the purchase of Sun Michael Monty Widenius forked MySQL launching MariaDB and took a swath of MySQL developers with him br br MySQL Server was generally available as of December Enhancements and features include br The default storage engine is InnoDB which supports transactions and referential integrity constraints br Improved InnoDB I O subsystem br Improved SMP support br Semisynchronous replication br SIGNAL and RESIGNAL statement in compliance with the SQL standard br Support for supplementary Unicode character sets utf utf and utf mb br New options for user defined partitioning br MySQL Server alpha was announced on May as the last release of the line Future MySQL Server development uses a New Release Model Features developed for are being incorporated into future releases br The general availability of MySQL was announced in February New features included performance improvements to the query optimizer higher transactional throughput in InnoDB new NoSQL style memcached APIs improvements to partitioning for querying and managing very large tables TIMESTAMP column type that correctly stores milliseconds improvements to replication and better performance monitoring by expanding the data available through the PERFORMANCE SCHEMA The InnoDB storage engine also included support for full text search and improved group commit performance br The general availability of MySQL was announced in October As of MySQL August MySQL supports a native JSON data type defined by RFC br MySQL Server was announced in April including NoSQL Document Store atomic and crash safe DDL sentences and JSON Extended syntax new functions such as JSON table functions improved sorting and partial updates Previous MySQL Server dmr Milestone Release was announced September br MySQL was declared DBMS of the year from the DB Engines ranking br br br Release history br br Work on version stopped after the Sun Microsystems acquisition The MySQL Cluster product uses version The decision was made to jump to version as the next major version number br br br Legal disputes and acquisitions br On June NuSphere sued MySQL AB TcX DataKonsult AB and its original authors Michael Monty Widenius and David Axmark in U S District Court in Boston for breach of contract tortious interference with third party contracts and relationships and unfair competition br In MySQL AB sued Progress NuSphere for copyright and trademark infringement in United States district court NuSphere had allegedly violated MySQL AB s copyright by linking MySQL s GPL ed code with NuSphere Gemini table without being in compliance with the license After a preliminary hearing before Judge Patti Saris on February the parties entered settlement talks and eventually settled After the hearing FSF commented that Judge Saris made clear that she sees the GNU GPL to be an enforceable and binding license br In October Oracle Corporation acquired Innobase OY the Finnish company that developed the third party InnoDB storage engine that allows MySQL to provide such functionality as transactions and foreign keys After the acquisition an Oracle press release mentioned that the contracts that make the company s software available to MySQL AB would be due for renewal and presumably renegotiation some time in During the MySQL Users Conference in April MySQL AB issued a press release that confirmed that MySQL AB and Innobase OY agreed to a multi year extension of their licensing agreement br In February Oracle Corporation acquired Sleepycat Software makers of the Berkeley DB a database engine providing the basis for another MySQL storage engine This had little effect as Berkeley DB was not widely used and was dropped due to lack of use in MySQL a pre GA release of MySQL released in October br In January Sun Microsystems bought MySQL AB for billion br In April Oracle Corporation entered into an agreement to purchase Sun Microsystems then owners of MySQL copyright and trademark Sun s board of directors unanimously approved the deal It was also approved by Sun s shareholders and by the U S government on August On December Oracle pledged to continue to enhance MySQL as it had done for the previous four years br A movement against Oracle s acquisition of MySQL AB to Save MySQL from Oracle was started by one of the MySQL AB founders Monty Widenius The petition of developers and users called upon the European Commission to block approval of the acquisition At the same time some Free Software opinion leaders including Pamela Jones of Groklaw Jan Wildeboer and Carlo Piana who also acted as co counsel in the merger regulation procedure advocated for the unconditional approval of the merger As part of the negotiations with the European Commission Oracle committed that MySQL server will continue until at least to use the dual licensing strategy long used by MySQL AB with proprietary and GPL versions available The antitrust of the EU had been pressuring it to divest MySQL as a condition for approval of the merger But the US Department of Justice at the request of Oracle pressured the EU to approve the merger unconditionally The European Commission eventually unconditionally approved Oracle s acquisition of MySQL AB on January br In January before Oracle s acquisition of MySQL AB Monty Widenius started a GPL only fork MariaDB MariaDB is based on the same code base as MySQL server and aims to maintain compatibility with Oracle provided versions br br br Features br MySQL is offered under two different editions the open source MySQL Community Server and the proprietary Enterprise Server MySQL Enterprise Server is differentiated by a series of proprietary extensions which install as server plugins but otherwise shares the version numbering system and is built from the same code base br Major features as available in MySQL br br A broad subset of ANSI SQL as well as extensions br Cross platform support br Stored procedures using a procedural language that closely adheres to SQL PSM br Triggers br Cursors br Updatable views br Online Data Definition Language DDL when using the InnoDB Storage Engine br Information schema br Performance Schema that collects and aggregates statistics about server execution and query performance for monitoring purposes br A set of SQL Mode options to control runtime behavior including a strict mode to better adhere to SQL standards br X Open XA distributed transaction processing DTP support two phase commit as part of this using the default InnoDB storage engine br Transactions with savepoints when using the default InnoDB Storage Engine The NDB Cluster Storage Engine also supports transactions br ACID compliance when using InnoDB and NDB Cluster Storage Engines br SSL support br Query caching br Sub SELECTs i e nested SELECTs br Built in replication support br Asynchronous replication master slave from one master to many slaves or many masters to one slave br Semi synchronous replication Master to slave replication where the master waits on replication br Synchronous replication Multi master replication is provided in MySQL Cluster br Virtual Synchronous Self managed groups of MySQL servers with multi master support can be done using Galera Cluster or the built in Group Replication plugin br Full text indexing and searching br Embedded database library br Unicode support br Partitioned tables with pruning of partitions in optimizer br Shared nothing clustering through MySQL Cluster br Multiple storage engines allowing one to choose the one that is most effective for each table in the application br Native storage engines InnoDB MyISAM Merge Memory heap Federated Archive CSV Blackhole NDB Cluster br Commit grouping gathering multiple transactions from multiple connections together to increase the number of commits per second br The developers release minor updates of the MySQL Server approximately every two months The sources can be obtained from MySQL s website or from MySQL s GitHub repository both under the GPL license br br br Limitations br When using some storage engines other than the default of InnoDB MySQL does not comply with the full SQL standard for some of the implemented functionality including foreign key references Check constraints are parsed but ignored by all storage engines before MySQL version br Up until MySQL triggers are limited to one per action timing meaning that at most one trigger can be defined to be executed after an INSERT operation and one before INSERT on the same table br No triggers can be defined on views br Before MySQL inbuilt functions like UNIX TIMESTAMP would return after UTC on January In an attempt to solve the problem was submitted but was not used for the final solution that was shipped in br br br Deployment br MySQL can be built and installed manually from source code but it is more commonly installed from a binary package unless special customizations are required On most Linux distributions the package management system can download and install MySQL with minimal effort though further configuration is often required to adjust security and optimization settings br br Though MySQL began as a low end alternative to more powerful proprietary databases it has gradually evolved to support higher scale needs as well It is still most commonly used in small to medium scale single server deployments either as a component in a LAMP based web application or as a standalone database server Much of MySQL s appeal originates in its relative simplicity and ease of use which is enabled by an ecosystem of open source tools such as phpMyAdmin br In the medium range MySQL can be scaled by deploying it on more powerful hardware such as a multi processor server with gigabytes of memory br There are however limits to how far performance can scale on a single server scaling up so on larger scales multi server MySQL scaling out deployments are required to provide improved performance and reliability A typical high end configuration can include a powerful master database which handles data write operations and is replicated to multiple slaves that handle all read operations The master server continually pushes binlog events to connected slaves so in the event of failure a slave can be promoted to become the new master minimizing downtime Further improvements in performance can be achieved by caching the results from database queries in memory using memcached or breaking down a database into smaller chunks called shards which can be spread across a number of distributed server clusters br br br High availability software br Oracle MySQL offers a high availability solution with a mix of tools including the MySQL router and the MySQL shell They are based on Group Replication open source tools br MariaDB offers a similar offer in terms of products br br br Cloud deployment br br MySQL can also be run on cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft Azure Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Some common deployment models for MySQL on the cloud are br br Virtual machine image br In this implementation cloud users can upload a machine image of their own with MySQL installed or use a ready made machine image with an optimized installation of MySQL on it such as the one provided by Amazon EC br MySQL as a service br Some cloud platforms offer MySQL as a service In this configuration application owners do not have to install and maintain the MySQL database on their own Instead the database service provider takes responsibility for installing and maintaining the database and application owners pay according to their usage Notable cloud based MySQL services are the Amazon Relational Database Service Oracle MySQL HeatWave Database Service Azure Database for MySQL Rackspace HP Converged Cloud Heroku and Jelastic In this model the database service provider takes responsibility for maintaining the host and database br br br User interfaces br br br Graphical user interfaces br A graphical user interface GUI is a type of interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs through graphical icons and visual indicators such as secondary notation as opposed to text based interfaces typed command labels or text navigation br Third party proprietary and free graphical administration applications or front ends are available that integrate with MySQL and enable users to work with database structure and data visually br br br MySQL Workbench br br MySQL Workbench is the integrated environment for MySQL It was developed by MySQL AB and enables users to graphically administer MySQL databases and visually design database structures br MySQL Workbench is available in three editions the regular free and open source Community Edition which may be downloaded from the MySQL website and the proprietary Standard Edition which extends and improves the feature set of the Community Edition and the MySQL Cluster CGE br br br Other GUI tools br Adminer br Database Workbench br DBeaver br DBEdit br HeidiSQL br LibreOffice Base br Navicat br OpenOffice org Base br phpMyAdmin br SQLBuddy br SQLyog br Toad for MySQL br Webmin br br br Command line interfaces br A command line interface is a means of interacting with a computer program where the user issues commands to the program by typing in successive lines of text command lines MySQL ships with many command line tools from which the main interface is the mysql client br MySQL Utilities is a set of utilities designed to perform common maintenance and administrative tasks Originally included as part of the MySQL Workbench the utilities are a stand alone download available from Oracle br Percona Toolkit is a cross platform toolkit for MySQL developed in Perl Percona Toolkit can be used to prove replication is working correctly fix corrupted data automate repetitive tasks and speed up servers Percona Toolkit is included with several Linux distributions such as CentOS and Debian and packages are available for Fedora and Ubuntu as well Percona Toolkit was originally developed as Maatkit but as of late Maatkit is no longer developed br MySQL shell is a tool for interactive use and administration of the MySQL database It supports JavaScript Python or SQL modes and it can be used for administration and access purposes br br br Application programming interfaces br Many programming languages with language specific APIs include libraries for accessing MySQL databases These include MySQL Connector Net for NET CLI Languages and the JDBC driver for Java br In addition an ODBC interface called MySQL Connector ODBC allows additional programming languages that support the ODBC interface to communicate with a MySQL database such as ASP or ColdFusion The HTSQL URL based query method also ships with a MySQL adapter allowing direct interaction between a MySQL database and any web client via structured URLs Other drivers exists for languages like Python or Node js br br br Project forks br A variety of MySQL forks exist including the following br br br Current br MariaDB br MariaDB is a community developed fork of the MySQL relational database management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL The fork has been led by the original developers of MySQL who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle br Percona Server for MySQL br Percona Server for MySQL forked by Percona aims to retain close compatibility to the official MySQL releases Also included in Percona Server for MySQL is XtraDB Percona s fork of the InnoDB Storage Engine br br br Abandoned br Drizzle br Drizzle was a free software open source relational database management system DBMS that was forked from the now defunct development branch of the MySQL DBMS Like MySQL Drizzle had a client server architecture and uses SQL as its primary command language Drizzle was distributed under version and of the GNU General Public License GPL with portions including the protocol drivers and replication messaging under the BSD license br WebScaleSQL br WebScaleSQL was a software branch of MySQL and was announced on March by Facebook Google LinkedIn and Twitter as a joint effort to provide a centralized development structure for extending MySQL with new features specific to its large scale deployments such as building large replicated databases running on server farms Thus WebScaleSQL opened a path toward deduplicating the efforts each company had been putting into maintaining its own branch of MySQL and toward bringing together more developers By combining the efforts of these companies and incorporating various changes and new features into MySQL WebScaleSQL aimed at supporting the deployment of MySQL in large scale environments The project s source code is licensed under version of the GNU General Public License and is hosted on GitHub br OurDelta br The OurDelta distribution created by the Australian company Open Query later acquired by Catalyst IT Australia had two versions which was based on MySQL and which was based on MariaDB It included patches developed by Open Query and by other notable members of the MySQL community including Jeremy Cole and Google Once the patches were incorporated into the MariaDB mainline OurDelta s objectives were achieved and OurDelta passed on its build and packaging toolchain to Monty Program now
