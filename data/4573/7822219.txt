Tamarin is a discontinued free software virtual machine with just in time compilation JIT support intended to implement the th edition of the ECMAScript ES language standard Tamarin source code originates from ActionScript Virtual Machine AVM developed by Adobe Systems as introduced within Adobe Flash Player which implements ActionScript scripting language ActionScript Virtual Machine was donated as open source to Mozilla Foundation on November to develop Tamarin as a high performance virtual machine with the support from broad Mozilla community to be used by Mozilla and Adobe Systems in the next generation of their JavaScript and ActionScript engines with the ultimate aim to unify the scripting languages across web browsers and Adobe Flash platform and ease the development of better performing rich web applications br br br Tamarin and Mozilla br The source code including the just in time compiler and conservative garbage collector was donated to the Mozilla Foundation on November The contributed code is tri licensed under the GPL LGPL and MPL licenses to be developed in Mozilla s Mercurial repository The contributed code is approximately lines of code making it the largest single donation of code to the Mozilla project besides Netscape itself br There were plans to use Tamarin as part of Mozilla and therefore Firefox The project to integrate Tamarin and SpiderMonkey was called ActionMonkey but was canceled in because Tamarin s interpreter turned out to be slower than SpiderMonkey s and because the plans of ECMAScript development shifted from ECMAScript which was partially implemented by then existing Tamarin source code and was meant to be completed by joined efforts of Adobe Mozilla and its community within the Tamarin Project to ECMAScript Harmony br Adobe continued to use Tamarin in its Flash Player but it did not replace SpiderMonkey as the JavaScript engine of Mozilla applications br The only part of Tamarin used in modern Mozilla applications i e Firefox via SpiderMonkey is NanoJIT a module that is used to generate native code when performing just in time compilation br br br What Tamarin is not br Adobe contributed code for its ActionScript Virtual Machine and the JIT compiler The ActionScript compiler is also open source as a part of Adobe Flex There is also CrossBridge an open source C and C compiler br Tamarin is not the same as Adobe Flash Player which remains closed source The Tamarin virtual machine is only a part of Flash Player br br br Related projects br Two projects related to Tamarin were announced on July in Brendan Eich s keynote at The Ajax Experience West IronMonkey and ScreamingMonkey IronMonkey is a project to map IronPython and IronRuby to Tamarin led by Seo Sanghyeon ScreamingMonkey s goal is to allow Tamarin to run within non Mozilla browsers thus allowing them to understand JavaScript starting with Internet Explorer The project is led by Mark Hammond Neither project had production quality releases and their current status is unclear br br br Etymology br Both SpiderMonkey and Tamarin fulfill closely related goals and so were given names derived from types of monkeys the spider monkey and the tamarin respectively br br br Further reading br Tamarin page on MDN Tamarin is obsolete Archived at the Wayback Machine br Eich Brendan November Project Tamarin Retrieved Mozilla CTO br Hecker Frank November Adobe Mozilla and Tamarin Archived from the original on Mozilla Foundation executive director br Double Chris May A Quick Introduction to Tamarin Tracing Retrieved Mozilla developer br Double Chris May Implementing Native Methods in Tamarin Tracing Retrieved br Double Chris May Extending Tamarin Tracing with Forth Retrieved br Profiling Runtime Generated and Interpreted Code using the VTune Performance Analyzer PDF Intel Archived from the original PDF on January br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Tamarin Project at www archive mozilla org br Tamarin at wiki mozilla org
