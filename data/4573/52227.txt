SourceForge is a web service that offers software consumers a centralized online location to control and manage open source software projects and research business software It provides source code repository hosting bug tracking mirroring of downloads for load balancing a wiki for documentation developer and user mailing lists user support forums user written reviews and ratings a news bulletin micro blog for publishing project updates and other features br SourceForge was one of the first to offer this service free of charge to open source projects Since the website has run on Apache Allura software SourceForge offers free hosting and free access to tools for developers of free and open source software br As of September the SourceForge repository claimed to host more than projects and had more than million registered users br br br Concept br SourceForge is a web based source code repository It acts as a centralized location for free and open source software projects It was the first to offer this service for free to open source projects Project developers have access to centralized storage and tools for managing projects though it is best known for providing revision control systems such as CVS SVN Bazaar Git and Mercurial Major features amongst others include project wikis metrics and analysis access to a MySQL database and unique sub domain URLs in the form http project name sourceforge net br The vast number of users at SourceForge net over three million as of exposes prominent projects to a variety of developers and can create a positive feedback loop As a project s activity rises SourceForge net s internal ranking system makes it more visible to other developers through SourceForge directory and Enterprise Directory Given that many open source projects fail due to lack of developer support exposure to such a large community of developers can continually breathe new life into a project br br br Revenue model br SourceForge s traditional revenue model is through advertising banner sales on their site In SourceForge Inc reported quarterly takings of US million In SourceForge reported a gross quarterly income of US million through media and e commerce streams In a revenue of US million was reported for the combined value of the SourceForge slashdot and freecode holdings prior to SourceForge s acquisition br Since additional revenue generation schemes such as bundleware models have been trialled with the goal of increasing SourceForge s revenue The result has in some cases been the appearance of malware bundled with SourceForge downloads On February SourceForge announced they had eliminated their DevShare program practice of bundling installers with project downloads br Negative community reactions to the partnership program led to a review of the program which was nonetheless opened up to all SourceForge projects on February The program was canceled by new owners BIZX LLC on February br On May they announced that it would scan all projects for malware and display warnings on downloads br br br History br SourceForge founded in by VA Software was the first provider of a centralized location for free and open source software developers to control and manage software development and offering this service without charge The software running the SourceForge site was released as free software in January and was later named SourceForge Alexandria The last release under a free license was made in November after the dot com bubble SourceForge was later powered by the proprietary SourceForge Enterprise Edition a separate product re written in Java which was marketed for offshore outsourcing br SourceForge has been temporarily banned in China three times in September in July for about a month and on August for several days br In November SourceForge was sued by the French collection society Soci t civile des Producteurs de Phonogrammes en France SPPF for hosting downloads of the file sharing application Shareaza br In SourceForge announced a new site platform known as Allura which would be an extensible open source platform licensed under the Apache License utilizing components such as Python and MongoDB and offering REST APIs In June the Allura project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation as Apache Allura br In September SourceForge Slashdot and Freecode were acquired from Geeknet by the online job site Dice com for million and incorporated into a subsidiary known as Slashdot Media In July Dice announced that it planned to sell SourceForge and Slashdot and in January the two sites were sold to the San Diego based BIZX LLC for an undisclosed amount In December BIZX rebranded as Slashdot Media br On September it was reported that attackers had compromised a SourceForge mirror and modified a download of phpMyAdmin to add security exploits br br br Adware controversy br In July SourceForge announced that it would provide project owners with an optional feature called DevShare which places closed source ad supported content into the binary installers and gives the project part of the ad revenue Opinions of this new feature varied some complained about users not being as aware of what they are getting or being able to trust the downloaded content whereas others saw it as a reasonably harmless option that keeps individual projects and users in control br In November GIMP a free image manipulation program removed its download from SourceForge citing misleading download buttons that potentially confuse customers as well as SourceForge s own Windows installer which bundles potentially unwanted programs with GIMP In a statement GIMP called SourceForge a once useful and trustworthy place to develop and host FLOSS applications that now faces a problem with the ads they allow on their sites br In response to the DevShare adware many users and projects migrated to GitHub other software hosting facilities or self hosting In May SourceForge took control of pages for five projects that had migrated to other hosting sites and replaced the project downloads with adware laden downloads including GIMP This came despite SourceForge s commitment in November to never bundle adware with project downloads without developers consent br On June SourceForge claimed that they had stopped coupling third party offers with unmaintained SourceForge projects Since this announcement was made a number of other developers have reported that their SourceForge projects had been taken over by SourceForge staff accounts but have not had binaries edited including nmap and VLC media player br On June SourceForge announced that SourceForge maintained mirrored projects were removed and anticipated the formation of a Community Panel to review their mirroring practices No such Community Panel ever materialized but SourceForge discontinued DevShare and the bundling of installers after SourceForge was sold to BizX in early On May SourceForge announced that they were now scanning all projects for malware and displaying warnings on projects detected to have malware br br br Project of the Month br Since SourceForge has featured a pair of Projects of the Month one chosen by its community and the other by its staff but these have not been updated since December br br br Usage br br As of May the SourceForge repository hosted more than projects and had more than million registered users although not all were active The domain sourceforge net attracted at least million visitors by August according to a Compete com survey br br br Country restrictions br br In its terms of use SourceForge states that its services are not available to users in countries on the sanction list of the U S Office of Foreign Assets Control including Cuba Iran North Korea Sudan and Syria Since the secure server used for making contributions to the site has blocked access from those countries In January the site had blocked all access from those countries including downloads Any IP address that appeared to belong to one of those countries could not use the site By the following month SourceForge relaxed the restrictions so that individual projects could indicate whether or not SourceForge should block their software from download to those countries This however had been reversed by November for North Korea and other countries Crimea has been blocked since February br br br See also br br Comparison of source code hosting facilities br br br br br br External links br br Official website br The SourceForge Story
