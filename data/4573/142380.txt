XUL ZOOL which stands for XML User Interface Language is a user interface markup language developed by Mozilla XUL is an XML dialect for writing graphical user interfaces enabling developers to write user interface elements in a manner similar to web pages br XUL applications rely on the Mozilla codebase or a fork of it The most prominent example is the Firefox web browser However Mozilla has significantly reduced the usage of XUL in Firefox after their rewrite of the browser engine in version This resulted in the removal of the legacy add on system which relied on XUL and XPCOM another cross platform technology Mozilla decided to deprecate shortly before the release of Firefox Firefox originally permitted add ons to extensively alter its user interface but this capability was removed in and replaced with the less permissive WebExtensions API Several forks of Firefox retain support for XUL and XPCOM based add ons Waterfox maintains a fork of the legacy Mozilla codebase for the Waterfox Classic browser The Pale Moon browser Basilisk browser Hyperbola operating system and numerous smaller projects collectively use and maintain the Unified XUL Platform UXP implementation br br br History br br XUL was devised at Netscape in as part of the development effort that eventually became the Mozilla codebase XUL is similar to web technologies implemented by the Gecko rendering engine When XUL was introduced it added features beyond the then standard HTML It was designed as an extension of HTML to be used with applications rather than documents br XUL was used by various Mozilla projects forks of Mozilla projects and projects closely related to Mozilla Some software projects like Songbird Komodo IDE Zotero started as desktop applications that utilized XULRunner to render and compose their UI In the early s there was some interest in using XUL by other parties including Amazon but those have switched over to HTML Many of the features of modern web technologies such as HTML CSS ECMAScript WebGL and WebAssembly that made rich and modern web applications possible without the need of utilizing legacy NPAPI PPAPI ActiveX browser plug in technologies like Adobe Flash Silverlight Java or Shockwave also made much of XUL redundant br Mozilla released Firefox also known as Firefox Quantum in November As part of this Firefox finished transitioning to a multiprocess architecture Although XUL add ons could work in this architecture they often created large performance issues Because of this Mozilla removed support for legacy add ons including the use of custom XUL code Mozilla switched their browser extensions system to the cross browser WebExtensions API which is largely based off the Chrome extension API In late Firefox still included XUL bindings for native browser components By the end of Mozilla had removed all XUL files from their mozilla central codebase br When Mozilla removed support from Firefox there were still several applications using XUL Mozilla began gradually removing XUL support from their email client Thunderbird They released Thunderbird without support for XUL based extensions in br The SeaMonkey internet suite chose to re implement XUL for the Firefox Quantum codebase and the suite s development has subsequently slowed The Pale Moon developers forked Mozilla s entire Firefox ESR codebase to create the Unified XUL Platform UXP for their Goanna rendering engine UXP maintains the traditional XUL capabilities As a result Pale Moon and other UXP applications have remained single process but more extensible compared to modern versions of Firefox and Thunderbird br br br Usage br XUL can only be used with the Mozilla codebase or a fork of it because the Gecko or Goanna engine does the XUL rendering br Application programmers need to define a XUL interface as three discrete sets of components br br Content the XUL document s whose elements define the layout of the user interface br Skin the CSS and image files which define the appearance of an application br Locale the files containing user visible strings for easy software localization br XUL defines a wide range of elements which roughly belong to the following types br br Top level elements window page dialog wizard etc br Widgets label button text box list box combo box radio button check box tree menu toolbar group box tab box color picker spacer splitter etc br Box model box grid stack deck etc br Events and scripts script command key broadcaster observer etc br Data source template rule etc br Others overlay iframe browser editor etc br The default behavior of XUL widgets can be altered with XBL bindings br br br XBL br br XML Binding Language XBL is an XML based markup language for altering the behavior of a XUL widget such as a scroll bar An XBL file contains bindings each of which describes the behavior of a XUL widget The root element of an XBL file is the bindings element which contains one or more binding elements Each binding element declares one binding which can be attached to any XUL element It may also possess an id attribute A binding is assigned to an element by setting the CSS property moz binding to the URL of the binding s file For example br br br Example br This example shows three buttons stacked on top of each other in a vertical box container br br br Ghostbusters reference br XUL contains a reference to the film Ghostbusters The film s antagonist is the fictional deity Zuul the Gatekeeper Zuul possesses the character Dana Barrett and declares There is no Dana There is only Zuul The creators of XUL pronounced the same as Zuul made the slogan There is no data There is only XUL The slogan and Zuul as a gatekeeper are referenced in XUL s XML namespace URI and were previously present in all Firefox add ons br br http www mozilla org keymaster gatekeeper there is only xul br br br
