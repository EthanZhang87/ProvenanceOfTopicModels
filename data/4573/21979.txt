Netscape Communications Corporation originally Mosaic Communications Corporation was an American independent computer services company with headquarters in Mountain View California and then Dulles Virginia Its Netscape web browser was once dominant but lost to Internet Explorer and other competitors in the so called first browser war with its market share falling from more than percent in the mid s to less than one percent in An early Netscape employee Brendan Eich created the JavaScript programming language the most widely used language for client side scripting of web pages A founding engineer of Netscape Lou Montulli created HTTP cookies The company also developed SSL which was used for securing online communications before its successor TLS took over br Netscape stock traded from until when the company was acquired by AOL in a pooling of interests transaction ultimately worth US billion In February approximately one year prior to its acquisition by AOL Netscape released the source code for its browser and created the Mozilla Organization to coordinate future development of its product The Mozilla Organization rewrote the entire browser s source code based on the Gecko rendering engine and all future Netscape releases were based on this rewritten code When AOL scaled back its involvement with Mozilla Organization in the early s the Organization proceeded to establish the Mozilla Foundation in July to ensure its continued independence with financial and other assistance from AOL The Gecko engine is used to power the Mozilla Foundation s Firefox browser br In addition to browsers Netscape developed a suite of award winning server software known as SuiteSpot to power enterprise Internet and Intranet websites forums and email e commerce software and a consumer web portal named Netcenter Netscape s browser development continued until December when AOL announced that the company would stop supporting it by early As of AOL continued to use the Netscape brand to market a discount Internet service provider br br br History br br br Early years br br Netscape was the first company to attempt to capitalize on the emerging World Wide Web It was founded under the name Mosaic Communications Corporation on April the brainchild of Jim Clark who had recruited Marc Andreessen as co founder and Kleiner Perkins as investors The first meeting between Clark and Andreessen was never truly about a software or service like Netscape but more about a product that was similar to Nintendo Clark recruited other early team members from SGI and NCSA Mosaic Jim Barksdale came on board as CEO in January Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen originally created a page concept pitch for an online gaming network to Nintendo for the Nintendo console but a deal was never reached Marc Andreessen explains If they had shipped a year earlier we probably would have done that instead of Netscape br The company s first product was the web browser called Mosaic Netscape released on October Within four months of its release it had already taken three quarters of the browser market It became the main browser for Internet users in such a short time due to its superiority over other competition like Mosaic This browser was subsequently renamed Netscape Navigator and the company took the Netscape name coined by employee Greg Sands although it was also a trademark of Cisco Systems on November to avoid trademark ownership problems with NCSA where the initial Netscape employees had previously created the NCSA Mosaic web browser The Mosaic Netscape web browser did not use any NCSA Mosaic code The internal codename for the company s browser was Mozilla which stood for Mosaic killer as the company s goal was to displace NCSA Mosaic as the world s number one web browser A cartoon Godzilla like lizard mascot was drawn by artist employee Dave Titus which went well with the theme of crushing the competition The Mozilla mascot featured prominently on Netscape s website in the company s early years However the need to project a more professional image especially towards corporate clients led to this being removed br br br Initial public offering IPO br br On August Netscape made an extremely successful IPO only sixteen months after the company was formed The stock was set to be offered at US per share but a last minute decision doubled the initial offering to US per share The stock s value soared to US during the first day of trading nearly a record for first day gain The stock closed at US which gave Netscape a market value of US billion While it was somewhat unusual for a company to go public prior to becoming profitable Netscape s revenues had in fact doubled every quarter in The success of this IPO subsequently inspired the use of the term Netscape moment to describe a high visibility IPO that signals the dawn of a new industry During this period Netscape also pursued a publicity strategy crafted by Rosanne Siino then head of public relations packaging Andreessen as the company s rock star The events of this period ultimately landed Andreessen barefoot on the cover of Time magazine The IPO also helped kickstart widespread investment in internet companies that created the dot com bubble br It is alleged that several Microsoft executives visited the Netscape campus in June to propose dividing the market an allegation denied by Microsoft and if true would have breached antitrust laws which would have allowed Microsoft to produce web browser software for Windows while leaving all other operating systems to Netscape Netscape refused the proposition Microsoft released version of Internet Explorer as a part of the Windows Plus Pack add on According to former Spyglass developer Eric Sink Internet Explorer was based not on NCSA Mosaic as commonly believed but on a version of Mosaic developed at Spyglass which itself was based upon NCSA Mosaic br This period of time would become known as the browser wars Netscape Navigator was not free to the general public until January while Internet Explorer and Internet Information Server have always been free or came bundled with an operating system and or other applications Meanwhile Netscape faced increasing criticism for featuritis putting a higher priority on adding new features than on making their products work properly Netscape experienced its first bad quarter at the end of and underwent a large round of layoffs in January Former Netscape executives Mike Homer and Peter Currie have described this period as hectic and crazy and that the company was undone by factors both internal and external In January Netscape started the open source Mozilla project Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator under the Netscape Public License which was similar to the GNU General Public License but allowed Netscape to continue to publish proprietary work containing the publicly released code br The United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust case against Microsoft in May Netscape was not a plaintiff in the case though its executives were subpoenaed and it contributed much material to the case including the entire contents of the Bad Attitude internal discussion forum br br br Acquisition by America Online br br On November America Online AOL announced it would acquire Netscape Communications in a tax free stock swap valued at US billion By the time the deal closed on March it was valued at US billion This merger was ridiculed by many who believed that the two corporate cultures could not possibly mesh one of its most prominent critics was longtime Netscape developer Jamie Zawinski br br br Disbanding br During Netscape s acquisition by AOL joint development and marketing of Netscape software products would occur through the Sun Netscape Alliance In the newly branded iPlanet the software included messaging and calendar collaboration web application directory and certificate servers as well as production ready applications for e commerce including commerce exchange procurement selling and billing In March when the alliance was ended iPlanet became a division of Sun Sun retained the intellectual property rights for all products and the engineering br On July Time Warner formerly AOL Time Warner disbanded Netscape Most of the programmers were laid off and the Netscape logo was removed from the building However the Netscape web browser developed in house rather than with Netscape staff with some work outsourced to Sun s Beijing development center was released by AOL on August br After the Sun acquisition by Oracle in January Oracle continued to sell iPlanet branded applications which originated from Netscape br br br Final release of the browser br br The Netscape brand name continued to be used extensively The company once again had its own programming staff devoted to the development and support for the series of web browsers Additionally Netscape also maintained the Propeller web portal which was a popular social news site similar to Digg which was given a new look in June AOL marketed a discount ISP service under the Netscape brand name br A new version of the Netscape browser Netscape Navigator based on Firefox was released in October It featured a green and grey interface In November IE had of the browser market Firefox and Netscape according to Net Applications an Internet metrics firm On December AOL announced that it would drop support for the Netscape web browser and would no longer develop new releases on February The date was later extended to March to allow a major security update and to add a tool to assist users in migrating to other browsers These additional features were included in the final version of Netscape Navigator version released on February br br br Software br br br Classic releases br br br Netscape Navigator versions br br Netscape Navigator was Netscape s web browser from versions The first beta versions were released in and were called Mosaic and later Mosaic Netscape Then a legal challenge from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications makers of NCSA Mosaic which many of Netscape s founders used to develop led to the name Netscape Navigator The company s name also changed from Mosaic Communications Corporation to Netscape Communications Corporation br The browser was easily the most advanced available and so was an instant success becoming a market leader while still in beta Netscape s feature count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version was released Version added a full email reader called Netscape Mail thus transforming Netscape from a single purpose web browser to an Internet suite The email client s main distinguishing feature was its ability to display HTML email During this period the entire suite was called Netscape Navigator br Version of Netscape the first beta was codenamed Atlas was the first to face any serious competition in the form of Microsoft Internet Explorer But Netscape remained the most popular browser at that time br Netscape also released a Gold version of Navigator that incorporated WYSIWYG editing with drag and drop between web editor and email components br br br Netscape Communicator versions br br Netscape addressed the problem of Netscape Navigator being used as both the name of the suite and the browser contained within it by renaming the suite to Netscape Communicator After five preview releases in Netscape released the final version of Netscape Communicator in June This version more or less based on Netscape Navigator Code updated and added new features The new suite was successful despite increasing competition from Internet Explorer IE and problems with the outdated browser core IE was slow and unstable on the Mac platform until version Despite this Apple entered into an agreement with Microsoft to make IE the default browser on new Mac OS installations a further blow to Netscape s prestige The Communicator suite was made up of Netscape Navigator Netscape Mail Newsgroups Netscape Address Book and Netscape Composer an HTML editor br On January Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of its software would be available free of charge and developed by an open source community Mozilla Netscape Communicator was announced codenamed Gromit However its release was greatly delayed and meanwhile there were newer versions of Internet Explorer starting with version These had more features than the old Netscape version including better support of HTML CSS DOM and ECMAScript eventually the more advanced Internet Explorer became the market leader br In October Netscape Communicator was released It featured various functionality improvements especially in the Mail and Newsgroups component but did not update the browser core whose functionality was essentially identical to that of version One month later Netscape Communications Corporation was bought by AOL In November work on Netscape was canceled in favor of developing a completely new program from scratch br br br Mozilla based releases br br br Netscape versions br br In an informal group called the Mozilla Organization was formed and largely funded by Netscape the vast majority of programmers working on the code were paid by Netscape to coordinate the development of Netscape codenamed Gromit which would be based on the Communicator source code However the aging Communicator code proved difficult to work with and the decision was taken to scrap Netscape and re write the source code The re written source code was in the form of the Mozilla web browser on which with a few additions Netscape was based br br br Netscape versions br br Netscape based on Mozilla was released in August as a direct continuation of Netscape with very similar components It picked up a few users but was still very much a minority browser It did however come with the popular Radio Netscape Internet radio client AOL had decided to deactivate Mozilla s popup blocker functionality in Netscape which created an outrage in the community AOL reversed the decision and allowed Netscape to reinstate the popup blocker for Netscape Netscape also introduced a new AOL free version without the usual AOL add ons of the browser suite Netscape codenamed Buffy and based on Mozilla was released in June br In AOL closed down its Netscape division and laid off or reassigned all of Netscape s employees Mozilla org continued however as the independent Mozilla Foundation taking on many of Netscape s ex employees AOL continued to develop Netscape in house with help from Sun s Beijing development center but due to there being no staff committed to it improvements were minimal One year later in August the last version based on Mozilla was released Netscape based on Mozilla br After an official poll posted on Netscape s community support board in late speculation arose of the Netscape series of suites being fully supported and updated by Netscape s in house development team br br br Mozilla Firefox based releases br br br Netscape Browser version br Between and Netscape s releases became known as Netscape Browser AOL chose to base Netscape Browser on the relatively successful Mozilla Firefox a re written version of Mozilla produced by the Mozilla Foundation This release is not a full Internet suite as before but is solely a web browser br Other controversial decisions include the browser only being released for Microsoft Windows and featuring both the Gecko rendering engine of previous releases and the Trident engine used in Internet Explorer and switching between them based on a compatibility list that came with the browser This effectively exposed users to the security vulnerabilities in both and resulted in a completely different user experience based on which site they were on Examples are handling of right to left or bi directional text user interface widgets bugs and web standards violations in Trident etc On top of this Netscape Browser even broke Internet Explorer s ability to open XML files by damaging a Windows Registry key and would do so every time it was opened even if the user fixed it manually br AOL s acquisition of Netscape Communications in November made it less of a surprise when the company laid off the Netscape team and outsourced development to Mercurial Communications Netscape Browser was released on April and included general bug fixes identified in versions br br br Netscape Navigator version br br Netscape Navigator s features were said to include newsfeed support and become more integrated with the Propeller Internet portal alongside more enhanced methods of discussion submission and voting on web pages It also sees the browser return to multi platform support across Windows Linux and Mac OS X Like Netscape version x the new release was based upon the popular Mozilla Firefox version and supposedly had full support of all Firefox add ons and plugins some of which Netscape was already providing A beta of the program was first released on June The final version was released on October It was the first time the browser was produced in house with its own programming staff since br br br End of development and support br AOL officially announced that support for Netscape Navigator would end on March and recommended that its users download either the Flock or Firefox browsers both of which were based on the same technology br The decision met mixed reactions from communities with many arguing that the termination of product support is significantly belated Internet security site Security Watch stated that a trend of infrequent security updates for AOL s Netscape caused the browser to become a security liability specifically the versions Netscape Browser Asa Dotzler one of Firefox s original bug testers greeted the news with good riddance in his blog post but praised the various members of the Netscape team over the years for enabling the creation of Mozilla in Others protested and petitioned AOL to continue providing vital security fixes to unknowing or loyal users of its software as well as protection of a well known brand br br br Mozilla Thunderbird based releases br br br Netscape Messenger br br On June Netscape announced Netscape Mercury a standalone email and news client that was to accompany Navigator Mercury was based on Mozilla Thunderbird The product was later renamed Netscape Messenger and an alpha version was released In December AOL announced it was canceling Netscape s development of Messenger as well as Navigator br br br Product list br br br Initial product line br Netscape s initial

technology which effectively allowed websites to send regular updates of information weather stock updates package tracking etc directly to a user s desktop aka webtop Netscape s implementation of this was named Netcaster However businesses quickly recognized the use of push technology to deliver ads to users which annoyed them so Netcaster was short lived br Netscape was notable for its cross platform efforts Its client software continued to be made available for Windows NT Macintosh Linux OS BeOS and many versions of Unix including DEC Sun Solaris BSDI IRIX IBM AIX and HP UX Its server software generally was only available for Unix and Windows NT though some of its servers were made available on Linux and a version of Netscape FastTrack Server was made available for Windows Today
