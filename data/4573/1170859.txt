Webmin is a web based server management control panel for Unix like systems Webmin allows the user to configure operating system internals such as users disk quotas services and configuration files as well as modify and control open source apps such as BIND Apache HTTP Server PHP and MySQL br br br History br Webmin written by Jamie Cameron was first released as version in October It was originally written during the time that Cameron administered a DNS server and needed an easy to use interface to allow users to make changes to the DNS records without giving them root access to the server Over time various themes a dashboard that displays CPU RAM and disk space usage with visual gauges and a sidebar with a search function were also added br Financial support for the Webmin project came from the Linux distribution companies Caldera and MSC Linux as well as many user contributions of code patches hundreds of modules language translations and user suggestions br In a backdoor was discovered which would allow a remote attacker to execute malicious commands with root privileges on the machine running Webmin This backdoor exploit was present on versions when a network admin would enable the password expiration policy Developers of Webmin believed that the backdoor being introduced was the result of a malicious injection to the code via the online source code repository SourceForge br Since its release the Webmin user interface its appearance and its many features have changed dramatically using code that has been completely rewritten over the subsequent versions This includes the overhaul brought by Webmin which enforced strict HTTP Strict Transport Security policy for SSL and gave options to users upgrading from older versions br br br General description br Webmin is largely based on Perl running as its own process and web server It defaults to TCP port for communicating and can be configured to use SSL if OpenSSL is installed with additional required Perl modules Webmin is built around over standard modules which have an interface to the configuration files and the Webmin server which makes it simple to add new functionality Due to Webmin s modular design it is possible for anyone who is interested to write plugins for desktop configuration Webmin allows for controlling many machines through a single interface or seamless login on other Webmin hosts on the same subnet or LAN br Webmin is released under the BSD license br If a plugin for certain tasks is not available it is possible to open a terminal and perform various task through a command line interface CLI This is especially useful if using SSH or similar is not an option br br br Inclusion in distributions br While Webmin was included in the official repositories of some Linux distributions Debian and Ubuntu it was removed from those because Webmin was not compatible with the way that the distributions packages handled configuration files and caused unexpected issues with systems br br br Related software br Webmin can be expanded by installing modules which can be custom made Aside from this there are two other major projects that extend the functionality of Webmin br br Usermin presents and controls a subset of the features available in Webmin such as webmail and other user level tasks rather than administrator level tasks br Virtualmin which is a web hosting control panel Virtualmin enables users to host websites under domains and gives the server admin and the end user a simple interface for managing their websites br Webmin released Minecraft Server Module in January and version in March The module presents a very basic GUI for server administration The Webmin Minecraft server is free and open source with no limitations on simultaneous players br br br See also br Virtualmin br Usermin br YaST br br br br br br External links br Official website br Webmin documentation wiki
