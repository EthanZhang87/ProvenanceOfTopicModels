The Alliance for Open Media AOMedia is a non profit industry consortium headquartered in Wakefield Massachusetts and formed to develop open royalty free technology for multimedia delivery It uses the ideas and principles of open web standard development to create video standards that can serve as alternatives to the hitherto dominant standards of the Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG br Its first project was to develop AV a new open video codec and format as a successor to VP and an alternative to HEVC AV uses elements from Daala Thor and VP three preceding open video codecs br The governing members of the Alliance for Open Media are Amazon Apple ARM Cisco Facebook Google Huawei Intel Microsoft Mozilla Netflix Nvidia Samsung Electronics and Tencent br br br History br Some collaboration and work that would later be merged into AV predates the official launch of the Alliance br Following the successful standardization of an audio standard in the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF in a working group for the standardization of a royalty free video format began to form under the lead of members of the Xiph Org Foundation who had begun working on their experimental video format Daala back in In May the Internet Video Codec working group NetVC of the IETF was officially started and presented with coding techniques from Daala Cisco Systems joined forces and offered their own prototype format Thor to the working group on July br The lack of a suitable video format for inclusion in the specification of HTML video by the World Wide Web Consortium W C and the failed negotiations for one mandatory video format for WebRTC showed the need for a competitive open video standard br The emergence of a second patent pool for HEVC HEVC Advance in spring provided motivation for investments in an alternative video format and grew support for the Alliance mainly due to the uncertainty regarding royalties for MPEG s next generation video format HEVC br On September the Alliance for Open Media was announced with the goal of developing a royalty free video format as an alternative to licensed formats such as H and HEVC The founding members are Amazon Cisco Google Intel Microsoft Mozilla and Netflix The plan was to release the video format by br The alliance saw expansion of its member list since inception On April the Alliance for Open Media announced that AMD ARM and Nvidia had joined and Adobe Ateme Ittiam and Vidyo joined in the months following On November Facebook later joined as a governing member In January the alliance s website was quietly updated to add Apple as a governing member of the alliance On April Samsung Electronics joined as a governing member October Tencent joined as a governing member br br In the founder and chairman of the MPEG acknowledged the Alliance to be the biggest threat to their business model furthermore stating that Alliance for Open Media has occupied the void created by MPEG s outdated video compression standard AVC absence of competitive royalty free standards IVC and unusable modern standard HEVC Everybody realises that the old MPEG business model is now broke br br br br Articles suggested that Google was in planning to release open formats High dynamic range video HDR video and D audio as alternatives to Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision video technology A draft called IAC has been developed for audio and Samsung s HDR will not be utilized br During September AOMedia announced Project Caviar Although the name is yet to be disclosed the announcement was made public through a journal authored by AOMedia developers and biographies shared on the doc and after a month papers calls were released with an early draft The Video Codec Working Group CWG was the first AOMedia technical group Recognizing some needs AOMedia created in February the Volumetric Visual Media Working Group VVMWG br In June universities and organizations companies went to Alliance for Open Media Symposium with various engineers working on AV and developing the new technologies in the cwg incubators gains test for the Next Generation AOM standard There are in the alliance efforts done through different working groups AVM AOM Video Model was created in the AOMedia GitLab repository It consists of tools based on research candidate AVM is the software codebase that AOMedia is using for its research and development of the next generation video coding technologies The development happens in stages and each new anchor is the codebase in which previously adopted experiments have been integrated and which is used in the following round of the experiments this repo based on Libaom reference encoder for AV format br br br br During June AOMedia announced that Zoom Video Communications would become a promoter member br br br AOMedia Video br br AOMedia s first project was the creation of an open video compression format and codec optimized for streaming media over the internet intended for both commercial and non commercial content including user generated content The format is intended to be the first in a line of new AOMedia Video AV formats being developed br AOMedia planned for the first version of its format AV to be completed before the end of However work on the bitstream specification will be continued into The format is the primary contender for standardisation by the video coding standard working group NetVC of the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF br The main distinguishing features of AV are its purported royalty free licensing terms and performance AV is specifically designed for real time applications and for higher resolutions than typical usage scenarios of the current generation H of video formats br In Sisvel International formed a patent pool for selling licenses to intellectual property it anticipates will be necessary to comply with the AV standard AOMedia said this was contrary to its goal of a standard developed entirely with free donated technology owned by the organization Sisvel anticipates AV will require patented technology developed outside the AOMedia member organizations br br br Operation and structure br The Alliance is incorporated in the US as a tax exempt non profit organization and a subsidiary project of the independent Joint Development Foundation JDF also headquartered in Wakefield br The Alliance intends to release new video codecs as free software under the BSD Clause License It adopted the patent rules of the W C which mandate technology contributors to disclose all patents that may be relevant and to agree to a royalty free patent license The Alliance s patent license contains a defensive termination clause to discourage patent lawsuits br Software development happens in the open using a public source code repository and issue tracking system and welcomes contributions from the general public Contributions have to pass internal reviews and gain consensus for their adoption Different sub groups inside the Alliance handle testing reviews for IPR patent problems hardware friendliness and editing of specification documents br There are two levels of membership organizations can join as an ordinary member or as a governing member with a seat on the board of directors Confusingly these are dubbed founding members in AOM terminology although they need not be members since the Alliance was founded br There is a broad representation of the video industry among the Alliance members featuring several hardware software and content producers OTT video distributors providers of real time conferencing solutions and browser vendors Several AOM members have previously worked on MPEG s HEVC and hold patents to it e g BBC Intel Cisco Vidyo Apple Microsoft and Broadcom br br br Governing members br As of November br br br General members br As of November br br br Previous members br IBM previously a Founding Governing member but delisted from
