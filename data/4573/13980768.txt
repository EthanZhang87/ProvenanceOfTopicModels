id: 13980768
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment IDE developed by Microsoft It is used to develop computer programs including websites web apps web services and mobile apps Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms including Windows API Windows Forms Windows Presentation Foundation WPF Microsoft Store and Microsoft Silverlight It can produce both native code and managed code br Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense the code completion component as well as code refactoring The integrated debugger works as both a source level debugger and as a machine level debugger Other built in tools include a code profiler designer for building GUI applications web designer class designer and database schema designer It accepts plug ins that expand the functionality at almost every level including adding support for source control systems like Subversion and Git and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle like the Azure DevOps client Team Explorer br Visual Studio supports different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support to varying degrees nearly any programming language provided a language specific service exists Built in languages include C C C CLI Visual Basic NET C F JavaScript TypeScript XML XSLT HTML and CSS Support for other languages such as Python Ruby Node js and M among others is available via plug ins Java and J were supported in the past br The most basic edition of Visual Studio the Community edition is available free of charge The slogan for Visual Studio Community edition is Free fully featured IDE for students open source and individual developers As of February Visual Studio is a current production ready version Visual Studio and are on Extended Support while is on Mainstream Support br br br Architecture br Visual Studio does not support any programming language solution or tool intrinsically instead it allows the plugging of functionality coded as a VSPackage When installed the functionality is available as a Service The IDE provides three services SVsSolution which provides the ability to enumerate projects and solutions SVsUIShell which provides windowing and UI functionality including tabs toolbars and tool windows and SVsShell which deals with registration of VSPackages In addition the IDE is also responsible for coordinating and enabling communication between services All editors designers project types and other tools are implemented as VSPackages Visual Studio uses COM to access the VSPackages The Visual Studio SDK also includes the Managed Package Framework MPF which is a set of managed wrappers around the COM interfaces that allow the Packages to be written in any CLI compliant language However MPF does not provide all the functionality exposed by the Visual Studio COM interfaces br The services can then be consumed for creation of other packages which add functionality to the Visual Studio IDE br Support for programming languages is added by using a specific VSPackage called a Language Service A language service defines various interfaces which the VSPackage implementation can implement to add support for various functionalities Functionalities that can be added this way include syntax coloring statement completion brace matching parameter information tooltips member lists and error markers for background compilation If the interface is implemented the functionality will be available for the language Language services are implemented on a per language basis The implementations can reuse code from the parser or the compiler for the language Language services can be implemented either in native code or managed code For native code either the native COM interfaces or the Babel Framework part of Visual Studio SDK can be used For managed code the MPF includes wrappers for writing managed language services br Visual Studio does not include any source control support built in but it defines two alternative ways for source control systems to integrate with the IDE A Source Control VSPackage can provide its own customised user interface In contrast a source control plugin using the MSSCCI Microsoft Source Code Control Interface provides a set of functions that are used to implement various source control functionality with a standard Visual Studio user interface MSSCCI was first used to integrate Visual SourceSafe with Visual Studio but was later opened up via the Visual Studio SDK Visual Studio NET used MSSCCI and Visual Studio NET used MSSCCI Visual Studio and use MSSCCI Version which adds support for rename and delete propagation as well as asynchronous opening br Visual Studio supports running multiple instances of the environment each with its own set of VSPackages The instances use different registry hives see MSDN s definition of the term registry hive in the sense used here to store their configuration state and are differentiated by their AppId Application ID The instances are launched by an AppId specific exe that selects the AppId sets the root hive and launches the IDE VSPackages registered for one AppId are integrated with other VSPackages for that AppId The various product editions of Visual Studio are created using the different AppIds The Visual Studio Express edition products are installed with their own AppIds but the Standard Professional and Team Suite products share the same AppId Consequently one can install the Express editions side by side with other editions unlike the other editions which update the same installation The professional edition includes a superset of the VSPackages in the standard edition and the team suite includes a superset of the VSPackages in both other editions The AppId system is leveraged by the Visual Studio Shell in Visual Studio br br br Features br br br Code editor br Visual Studio includes a code editor that supports syntax highlighting and code completion using IntelliSense for variables functions methods loops and LINQ queries IntelliSense is supported for the included languages as well as for XML Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript when developing web sites and web applications Autocomplete suggestions appear in a modeless list box over the code editor window in proximity of the editing cursor In Visual Studio onwards it can be made temporarily semi transparent to see the code obstructed by it The code editor is used for all supported languages br The code editor in Visual Studio also supports setting bookmarks in code for quick navigation Other navigational aids include collapsing code blocks and incremental search in addition to normal text search and regex search The code editor also includes a multi item clipboard and a task list The code editor supports code snippets which are saved templates for repetitive code and can be inserted into code and customized for the project being worked on A management tool for code snippets is built in as well These tools are surfaced as floating windows which can be set to automatically hide when unused or docked to the side of the screen The code editor in Visual Studio also supports code refactoring including parameter reordering variable and method renaming interface extraction and encapsulation of class members inside properties among others br br br Debugger br Visual Studio includes a debugger that works both as a source level debugger and as a machine level debugger It works with both managed code as well as native code and can be used for debugging applications written in any language supported by Visual Studio In addition it can also attach to running processes monitor and debug those processes If source code for the running process is available it displays the code as it is being run If source code is not available it can show the disassembly The Visual Studio debugger can also create memory dumps as well as load them later for debugging Multi threaded programs are also supported The debugger can be configured to be launched when an application running outside the Visual Studio environment crashes br The Visual Studio Debugger allows setting breakpoints which allow execution to be stopped temporarily at a certain position and watches which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses Breakpoints can be conditional meaning they get triggered when the condition is met Code can be stepped over i e run one line of source code at a time It can either step into functions to debug inside it or step over it i e the execution of the function body isn t available for manual inspection The debugger supports Edit and Continue i e it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged When debugging if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable its current value is displayed in a tooltip data tooltips where it can also be modified if desired During coding the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window br br br Designer br Visual Studio includes many visual designers to aid in the development of applications These tools include br br Windows Forms Designer br The Windows Forms designer is used to build GUI applications using Windows Forms Layout can be controlled by housing the controls inside other containers or locking them to the side of the form Controls that display data like textbox list box and grid view can be bound to data sources like databases or queries Data bound controls can be created by dragging items from the Data Sources window onto a design surface The UI is linked with code using an event driven programming model The designer generates either C or VB NET code for the application br WPF Designer br The WPF designer codenamed Cider was introduced with Visual Studio Like the Windows Forms designer it supports the drag and drop metaphor It is used to author user interfaces targeting Windows Presentation Foundation It supports all WPF functionality including data binding and automatic layout management It generates XAML code for the UI The generated XAML file is compatible with Microsoft Expression Design the designer oriented product The XAML code is linked with code using a code behind model br Web designer development br Visual Studio also includes a web site editor and designer that allows web pages to be authored by dragging and dropping widgets It is used for developing ASP NET applications and supports HTML CSS and JavaScript It uses a code behind model to link with ASP NET code From Visual Studio onwards the layout engine used by the web designer is shared with the discontinued Expression Web There is also ASP NET MVC support for MVC technology as a separate download and ASP NET Dynamic Data project available from Microsoft br Class designer br The Class Designer is used to author and edit the classes including its members and their access using UML modeling The Class Designer can generate C and VB NET code outlines for the classes and methods It can also generate class diagrams from hand written classes br Data designer br The data designer can be used to graphically edit database schemas including typed tables primary and foreign keys and constraints It can also be used to design queries from the graphical view br Mapping designer br From Visual Studio onwards the mapping designer is used by LINQ to SQL to design the mapping between database schemas and the classes that encapsulate the data The new solution from ORM approach ADO NET Entity Framework replaces and improves the old technology br br br Other tools br Properties Editor br The Properties Editor tool is used to edit properties in a GUI pane inside Visual Studio It lists all available properties both read only and those which can be set for all objects including classes forms web pages and other items br Object Browser br The Object Browser is a namespace and class library browser for Microsoft NET It can be used to browse the namespaces which are arranged hierarchically in managed assemblies The hierarchy may or may not reflect the organization in the file system br Solution Explorer br In Visual Studio parlance a solution is a set of code files and other resources that are used to build an application The files in a solution are arranged hierarchically which might or might not reflect the organization in the file system The Solution Explorer is used to manage and browse the files in a solution br Team Explorer br Team Explorer is used to integrate the capabilities of Azure DevOps either Azure DevOps Services or Azure DevOps Server into the IDE In addition to version control integration it provides the ability to view and manage individual work items including user stories bugs tasks and other documents It is included as part of a Visual Studio installation and is also available as a standalone download br Data Explorer br Data Explorer is used to manage databases on Microsoft SQL Server instances It allows creation and alteration of database tables either by issuing T SQL commands or by using the Data designer It can also be used to create queries and stored procedures with the latter in either T SQL or in managed code via SQL CLR Debugging and IntelliSense support is available as well br Server Explorer br The Server Explorer tool is used to manage database connections on an accessible computer It is also used to browse running Windows Services performance counters Windows Event Log and message queues and use them as a datasource br Dotfuscator Community Edition br Visual Studio includes a free light version of Dotfuscator br Text Generation Framework br Visual Studio includes a full text generation framework called T which enables Visual Studio to generate text files from templates either in the IDE or via code br ASP NET Web Site Administration Tool br The ASP NET Web Site Administration Tool allows for the configuration of ASP NET websites br Visual Studio Tools for Office br Visual Studio Tools for Office is a SDK and an add in for Visual Studio that includes tools for developing for the Microsoft Office suite Previously for Visual Studio NET and Visual Studio it was a separate SKU that supported only Visual C and Visual Basic languages or was included in the Team Suite With Visual Studio it is no longer a separate SKU but is included with Professional and higher editions A separate runtime is required when deploying VSTO solutions br br br Testing tools br Microsoft Visual Studio can write high quality code with comprehensive testing tools to aid in the development of applications These tools include br Unit testing IntelliTest Live Unit Testing Test Explorer CodeLens test indicators code coverage analysis Fakes br br br Extensibility br br Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to extend its capabilities These extensions plug into Visual Studio and extend its functionality Extensions come in the form of macros add ins and packages Macros represent repeatable tasks and actions that developers can record programmatically for saving replaying and distributing Macros however cannot implement new commands or create tool windows They are written using Visual Basic and are not compiled Add Ins provide access to the Visual Studio object model and can interact with the IDE tools Add Ins can be used to implement new functionality and can add new tool windows Add Ins are plugged into the IDE via COM and can be created in any COM compliant languages Packages are created using the Visual Studio SDK and provide the highest level of extensibility They can create designers and other tools as well as integrate other programming languages The Visual Studio SDK provides unmanaged APIs as well as a managed API to accomplish these tasks However the managed API isn t as comprehensive as the unmanaged one Extensions are supported in the Standard and higher versions of Visual Studio Express Editions do not support hosting extensions br Visual Studio introduced the Visual Studio Shell that allows for development of a customized version of the IDE The Visual Studio Shell defines a set of VSPackages that provide the functionality required in any IDE On top of that other packages can be added to customize the installation The Isolated mode of the shell creates a new AppId where the packages are installed These are to be started with a different executable It is aimed for development of custom development environments either for a specific language or a specific scenario The Integrated mode installs the packages into the AppId of the Professional Standard Team System editions so that the tools integrate into these editions The Visual Studio Shell is available as a free download br After the release of Visual Studio Microsoft created the Visual Studio Gallery It serves as the central location for posting information about extensions to Visual Studio Community developers as well as commercial developers can upload information about their extensions to Visual Studio NET through Visual Studio Users of the site can rate and review the extensions to help assess the quality of extensions being posted An extension is stored in a VSIX file Internally a VSIX file is a ZIP file that contains some XML files and possibly one or more DLL s One of the main advantages of these extensions is that they do not require Administrator rights to be installed RSS feeds to notify users on updates to the site and tagging features are also planned br br br Supported products br Microsoft Visual C br Microsoft Visual C is Microsoft s partial implementation of the C and full implementation C compiler and associated languages services and specific tools for integration with the Visual Studio IDE It can compile either in C mode or C mode For C as of version it conforms to C The C implementation of Visual Studio still doesn t support the full standard in particular the complex number header complex h introduced in C is unsupported br Visual C supports the C CLI specification to write managed code as well as mixed mode code a mix of native and managed code Microsoft positions Visual C for development in native code or in code that contains both native as well as managed components Visual C supports COM as well as the MFC library For MFC development it provides a set of wizards for creating and customizing MFC boilerplate code and creating GUI applications using MFC Visual C can also use the Visual Studio forms designer to design UI graphically Visual C can also be used with the Windows API It also supports the use of intrinsic functions which are functions recognized by the compiler itself and not implemented as a library Intrinsic functions are used to expose the SSE instruction set of modern CPUs Visual C also includes the OpenMP version specification br Microsoft Visual C br Microsoft Visual C Microsoft s implementation of the C language targets the NET Framework along with the language services that lets the Visual Studio IDE support C projects While the language services are a part of Visual Studio the compiler is available separately as a part of the NET Framework The Visual C and compilers support versions and of the C language specifications respectively Visual C supports the Visual Studio Class designer Forms designer and Data designer among others br Microsoft Visual Basic br Microsoft Visual Basic is Microsoft s implementation of the VB NET language and associated tools and language services It was introduced with Visual Studio NET Microsoft has positioned Visual Basic for Rapid Application Development Visual Basic can be used to author both console applications as well as GUI applications Like Visual C Visual Basic also supports the Visual Studio Class designer Forms designer and Data designer among others Like C the VB NET compiler is also available as a part of NET Framework but the language services that let VB NET projects be developed with Visual Studio are available as a part of the latter br Microsoft Visual Web Developer br Microsoft Visual Web Developer is used to create web sites web applications and web services using ASP NET Either C or VB NET languages can be used Visual Web Developer can use the Visual Studio Web Designer to graphically design web page layouts br Azure DevOps br Azure DevOps is intended for collaborative software development projects and provides version control work planning and tracking data collection and reporting It also includes the Team Explorer which is integrated inside Visual Studio On September Microsoft announced a rebranding of Visual Studio Team Services VSTS to Azure DevOps Services and Team Foundation Server TFS to Azure DevOps Server br br br Previous products br Visual FoxPro br Visual FoxPro is a data centric object oriented and procedural programming language produced by Microsoft It derives from FoxPro originally known as FoxBASE which was developed by Fox Software beginning in Visual FoxPro is tightly integrated with its own relational database engine which extends FoxPro s xBase capabilities to support SQL queries and data manipulation Visual FoxPro is a full featured dynamic programming language that does not require the use of an additional general purpose programming environment In Visual FoxPro was discontinued after version Service Pack It was supported until br Visual SourceSafe br Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is a source control software package oriented towards small software development projects The SourceSafe database is a multi user multi process file system database using the Windows file system database primitives to provide locking and sharing support All versions are multi user using SMB file server networking However with Visual SourceSafe other client server modes were added Lan Booster and VSS Internet which used HTTP HTTPS Visual SourceSafe was available as a stand alone product and was included with Visual Studio and other products such as Office Developer Edition Visual SourceSafe was available as a stand alone product and included with the Team Suite Azure DevOps has superseded VSS as Microsoft s recommended platform for source control br Microsoft Visual J Microsoft Visual J br Microsoft Visual J was Microsoft s implementation of the Java language with Microsoft specific extensions and associated language services It was discontinued as a result of litigation from Sun Microsystems and the technology was recycled into Visual J Microsoft s Java compiler for NET Framework J was available with Visual Studio supported until but was discontinued in Visual Studio br Visual InterDev br Visual InterDev was used to create web applications using Microsoft Active Server Pages ASP technologies It supports code completion and includes database server management tools It has been replaced with Microsoft Visual Web Developer br br br Editions br Microsoft Visual Studio is available in the following editions or SKUs br br br Community br The Community edition was announced on November as a new free version with similar functionality to Visual Studio Professional Prior to this date the only free editions of Visual Studio were the feature limited Express variants Unlike the Express variants Visual Studio Community supports multiple languages and provides support for extensions Individual developers have no restrictions on their use of the Community edition The following uses also allow unlimited usage contributing to Open Source projects academic research in a classroom learning environment and for developing and testing device drivers for the Windows operating system All other use by an organization depends on its classification as an Enterprise more than employees or more than million USD in annual revenue per Microsoft Non Enterprises may use up to copies without restriction user number and higher require a commercial license Enterprise organizations require a commercial license for use outside of the noted exceptions Visual Studio Community is oriented towards individual developers and small teams br br br Professional br As of Visual Studio the Professional edition is the entry level commercial edition of Visual Studio Previously a more feature restricted Standard edition was available It provides an IDE for all supported development languages MSDN support is available as MSDN Essentials or the full MSDN library depending on licensing It supports XML and XSLT editing and can create deployment packages that only use ClickOnce and MSI It includes tools like Server Explorer and integration with Microsoft SQL Server also Windows Mobile development support was included in Visual Studio Standard however with Visual Studio it is only available in Professional and higher editions Windows Phone development support was added to all editions in Visual Studio Development for Windows Mobile is no longer supported in Visual Studio It is superseded by Windows Phone br br br Enterprise br In addition to the features provided by the Professional edition the Enterprise edition provides a new set of software development database development collaboration metrics architecture testing and reporting tools br br br History br The first version of Visual Studio was Visual Studio Before that Visual Basic Visual C Visual FoxPro and Visual SourceSafe were sold as separate products br br br br Microsoft first released Visual Studio codenamed Boston for the city of the same name thus beginning the VS codenames related to places in bundling many of its programming tools together for the first time Visual Studio came in two editions Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise the professional edition has three CDs and the enterprise four CDs It included Visual J for Java programming and introduced Visual InterDev for creating dynamically generated web sites using Active Server Pages There was a single companion CD that contained the Microsoft Developer Network library Visual Studio is only compatible with Windows and Windows NT It is the last version to support Windows NT before SP br Visual Studio was an attempt at using the same development environment for multiple languages Visual J InterDev and the MSDN Library had all been using the same environment called Developer Studio br Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro br br br br The next version version codenamed Aspen after the ski resort in Colorado was released in June and is the last version to support the Windows x platform as well as Windows NT before SP but after SP Each version of each language in part also settled to v including Visual J which was prior v and Visual InterDev at the first release The v edition of Microsoft was the core environment for the next four releases to provide programmers with an integrated look alike platform This led Microsoft to transition the development on the platform independent NET Framework br Visual Studio was the last version to include Visual J which Microsoft removed as part of a settlement with Sun Microsystems that required Microsoft Internet Explorer not to provide support for the Java Virtual Machine br Visual Studio came in two editions Professional and Enterprise The Enterprise edition contained extra features not found in Professional edition including br br Application Performance Explorer br Automation Manager br Microsoft Visual Modeler br RemAuto Connection Manager br Visual Studio Analyzer br Visual Studio was also sold as a bundle with the separate IDEs used for Visual C Visual Basic and Visual FoxPro br br br NET br br Microsoft released Visual Studio NET VS NET codenamed Rainier for Washington s Mount Rainier in February the beta version was released via Microsoft Developer Network in The biggest change was the introduction of a managed code development environment using the NET Framework Programs developed using NET are not compiled to machine language like C is for example but instead to a format called Microsoft Intermediate Language MSIL or Common Intermediate Language CIL When a CIL application executes it is compiled while being executed into the appropriate machine language for the platform it is being executed on thereby making code portable across several platforms Programs compiled into CIL can be executed only on platforms which have an implementation of Common Language Infrastructure It is possible to run CIL programs in Linux or Mac OS X using non Microsoft NET implementations like Mono and DotGNU br This was the first version of Visual Studio to require an NT based Windows platform The installer enforces this requirement and is the last version to support Windows NT SP or later and Windows before SP br Visual Studio NET shipped in four editions Academic Professional Enterprise Developer and Enterprise Architect Microsoft introduced C C sharp a new programming language that targets NET It also introduced the successor to Visual J called Visual J Visual J programs use Java s language syntax However unlike Visual J programs Visual J programs can only target the NET Framework not the Java Virtual Machine that all other Java tools target br Visual Basic changed drastically to fit the new framework and the new version was called Visual Basic NET Microsoft also added extensions to C called Managed Extensions for C so NET programs could be created in C br Visual Studio NET can produce applications targeting Windows using the Windows Forms part of the NET Framework the Web using ASP NET and Web Services and with an add in portable devices using the NET Compact Framework br The internal version number of Visual Studio NET is version Microsoft released Service Pack for Visual Studio NET in March br br br NET br br In April Microsoft introduced a minor upgrade to Visual Studio NET called Visual Studio NET codenamed Everett for the city of the same name It includes an upgrade to the NET Framework version and is the first release to support developing programs for mobile devices using ASP NET or the NET Compact Framework The Visual C compiler s standards compliance improved especially in the area of partial template specialization Visual C Toolkit is a version of the same C compiler shipped with Visual Studio NET without the IDE that Microsoft made freely available As of it is no longer available and the Express Editions have superseded it Visual Studio NET also supports Managed C which is the predecessor of C CLI The internal version number of Visual Studio NET is version while the file format version is Visual Studio NET drops support for Windows NT and is the last version to support Windows SP and Windows XP before SP and the only version to support Windows Server before SP br Visual Studio NET shipped in five editions Academic Standard Professional Enterprise Developer and Enterprise Architect The Visual Studio NET Enterprise Architect edition includes an implementation of Microsoft Visio s modeling technologies including tools for creating Unified Modeling Language based visual representations of an application s architecture and an object role modeling ORM and logical database modeling solution Enterprise Templates were also introduced to help larger development teams standardize coding styles and enforce policies around component usage and property settings br Service Pack was released September br br br br br Visual Studio codenamed Whidbey a reference to Whidbey Island in Puget Sound region was released online in October and to retail stores a few weeks later Microsoft removed the NET moniker from Visual Studio as well as every other product with NET in its name but it still primarily targets the NET Framework which was upgraded to version It requires Windows with Service Pack Windows XP with at least Service Pack or Windows Server with at least Service Pack It is the last version to run on Windows and also the last version able to target Windows and Windows Me for C applications br Visual Studio s internal version number is while the file format version is Microsoft released Service Pack for Visual Studio on December An additional update for Service Pack that offers Windows Vista compatibility was made available on June br Visual Studio was upgraded to support all the new features introduced in NET Framework including generics and ASP NET The IntelliSense feature in Visual Studio was upgraded for generics and new project types were added to support ASP NET web services Visual Studio additionally introduces support for a new task based build platform called Microsoft Build Engine MSBuild which employs a new XML based project file format Visual Studio also includes a local web server separate from IIS that can host ASP NET applications during development and testing It also supports all SQL Server databases Database designers were upgraded to support the ADO NET which is included with NET Framework C also got a similar upgrade with the addition of C CLI which is slated to replace the use of Managed C Other new features of Visual Studio include the Deployment Designer which allows application designs to be validated before deployments an improved environment for web publishing when combined with ASP NET and load testing to see application performance under various sorts of user loads Starting with the edition Visual Studio also added extensive bit support While the host development environment itself is only available as a bit application Visual C supports compiling for x AMD and Intel as well as IA Itanium The Platform SDK included bit compilers and bit versions of the libraries br Microsoft also announced Visual Studio Tools for Applications as the successor to Visual Basic for Applications VBA and VSA Visual Studio for Applications VSTA was released to manufacturing along with Office It is included with Office and is also part of the Visual Studio SDK VSTA consists of a customized IDE based on the Visual Studio IDE and a runtime that can be embedded in applications to expose its features via the NET object model Office applications continue to integrate with VBA except for InfoPath which integrates with VSTA Version of VSTA based on Visual Studio was released in April It is significantly different from the first version including features such as dynamic programming and support for WPF WCF WF LINQ and NET Framework br br br br Visual Studio and Visual Studio Team System codenamed Orcas a reference to Orcas Island also an island in Puget Sound region like Whidbey for the previous release were released to MSDN subscribers on November alongside NET Framework The source code for the Visual Studio IDE is available under a shared source license to some of Microsoft s partners and ISVs Microsoft released Service Pack for Visual Studio on August The internal version number of Visual Studio is version while the file format version is Visual Studio requires Windows XP Service Pack plus Windows Installer Windows Server Service Pack or later It is the last version available for Windows XP SP Windows Server SP as well as the only version to support Windows Vista before SP and Windows Server before SP and the last version to support targeting Windows for C applications br Visual Studio is focused on development of Windows Vista Office system and Web applications For visual design a new Windows Presentation Foundation visual designer and a new HTML CSS editor influenced by Microsoft Expression Web are included J is not included Visual Studio requires NET Framework and by default configures compiled assemblies to run on NET Framework but it also supports multi targeting which lets the developers choose which version of the NET Framework out of Silverlight CoreCLR or NET Compact Framework the assembly runs on Visual Studio also includes new code analysis tools including the new Code Metrics tool only in Team Edition and Team Suite Edition For Visual C Visual Studio adds a new version of Microsoft Foundation Classes MFC that adds support for the visual styles and UI controls introduced with Windows Vista For native and managed code interoperability Visual C introduces the STL CLR which is a port of the C Standard Template Library STL containers and algorithms to managed code STL CLR defines STL like containers iterators and algorithms that work on C CLI managed objects br Visual Studio features include an XAML based designer codenamed Cider workflow designer LINQ to SQL designer for defining the type mappings and object encapsulation for SQL Server data XSLT debugger JavaScript Intellisense support JavaScript Debugging support support for UAC manifests a concurrent build system among others It ships with an enhanced set of UI widgets both for Windows Forms and WPF It also includes a multithreaded build engine MSBuild to compile multiple source files and build the executable file in a project across multiple threads simultaneously It also includes support for compiling icon resources in PNG format introduced in Windows Vista An updated XML Schema designer was released separately some time after the release of Visual Studio br Visual Studio Debugger includes features targeting easier debugging of multi threaded applications In debugging mode in the Threads window which lists all the threads hovering over a thread displays the stack trace of that thread in tooltips The threads can directly be named and flagged for easier identification from that window itself In addition in the code window along with indicating the location of the currently executing instruction in the current thread the currently executing instructions in other threads are also pointed out The Visual Studio debugger supports integrated debugging of the NET Framework Base Class Library BCL which can dynamically download the BCL source code and debug symbols and allow stepping into the BCL source during debugging As of a limited subset of the BCL source is available with more library support planned for later br br br br On April Microsoft released Visual Studio codenamed Dev and NET Framework It is available for Windows Server SP Windows XP SP Windows Vista SP and Windows Server SP and has support for Windows Server R as well as for Windows It is the last version to support Windows XP SP Windows Server SP Windows Server R Windows Vista SP and Windows Server SP and the only version to support Windows before SP and Windows Server R before SP br The Visual Studio IDE was redesigned which according to Microsoft clears the UI organization and reduces clutter and complexity The new IDE better supports multiple document windows and floating tool windows while offering better multi monitor support The IDE shell has been rewritten using the Windows Presentation Foundation WPF whereas the internals have been redesigned using Managed Extensibility Framework MEF that offers more extensibility points than previous versions of the IDE that enabled add ins to modify the behavior of the IDE br The new multi paradigm ML variant F forms part of Visual Studio br Visual Studio comes with NET Framework and supports developing applications targeting Windows It supports IBM Db and Oracle databases in addition to Microsoft SQL Server It has integrated support for developing Microsoft Silverlight applications including an interactive designer Visual Studio offers several tools to make parallel programming simpler in addition to the Parallel Extensions for the NET Framework and the Parallel Patterns Library for native code Visual Studio includes tools for debugging parallel applications The new tools allow the visualization of parallel Tasks and their runtime stacks Tools for profiling parallel applications can be used for visualization of thread wait times and thread migrations across processor cores Intel and Microsoft have jointly pledged support for a new Concurrency Runtime in Visual Studio br and Intel has launched parallelism support in Parallel Studio as an add on for Visual Studio br The Visual Studio code editor now highlights references whenever a symbol is selected all other usages of the symbol are highlighted It also offers a Quick Search feature to incrementally search across all symbols in C C and VB NET projects Quick Search supports substring matches and camelCase searches The Call Hierarchy feature allows the developer to see all the methods that are called from a current method as well as the methods that call the current one IntelliSense in Visual Studio supports a consume first mode which developers can opt into In this mode IntelliSense does not auto complete identifiers this allows the developer to use undefined identifiers like variable or method names and define those later Visual Studio can also help in this by automatically defining them if it can infer their types from usage Current versions of Visual Studio have a known bug which makes IntelliSense unusable for projects using pure C not C br Visual Studio features a new Help System replacing the MSDN Library viewer The Help System is no longer based on Microsoft Help and does not use Microsoft Document Explorer Dynamic help containing links to help items based on what the developer was doing at the time was removed in the final release but can be added back using a download from Microsoft br Visual Studio no longer supports development for Windows Mobile prior to Windows Phone Visual Studio Service Pack was released in March br br br Ultimate br Visual Studio Ultimate replaces Visual Studio Team Suite It includes new modeling tools such as the Architecture Explorer which graphically displays projects and classes and the relationships between them br It supports UML activity diagram component diagram logical class diagram sequence diagram and use case diagram Visual Studio Ultimate also includes Test Impact Analysis which provides hints on which test cases are impacted by modifications to the source code without actually running the test cases This speeds up testing by avoiding running unnecessary test cases br Visual Studio Ultimate also includes a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack IntelliTrace records all events such as prior function calls method parameters events and exceptions This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded in effect allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues as well as to reproduce the issue Visual Studio Ultimate also includes the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues br br br br br The final build of Visual Studio was announced on August and the official launch event was held on September br Unlike prior versions Visual Studio cannot record and play macros and the macro editor has been removed Also unlike prior versions Visual Studio require Windows SP and Windows Server R SP br New features include support for WinRT and C CX Component Extensions and C AMP GPGPU programming Semantic Colorization br Cross compiling to ARM is supported from an x command prompt br On September a complete Developer Preview of Visual Studio was published on Microsoft s website Visual Studio Developer Preview requires Windows Windows Server R Windows or later operating systems Versions of Microsoft Foundation Class Library MFC and C runtime CRT included with this release cannot produce software that is compatible with Windows XP or Windows Server except by using native multi targeting and foregoing the newest libraries compilers and headers However on June a blog post on the VC Team blog announced that based on customer feedback Microsoft would re introduce native support for Windows XP targets though not for XP as a development platform in a version of Visual C to be released later in the fall of Visual Studio Update Visual Studio was released in November This update added support for Windows XP targets and also added other new tools and features e g improved diagnostics and testing support for Windows Store apps br On August a blog post by Sumit Kumar a Program Manager on the Visual C team listed some of the features of the upcoming version of the Visual Studio C IDE br br Semantic colorization Improved syntax coloring various user defined or default colors for C syntax such as macros enumerations typenames and functions br Reference highlighting Selection of a symbol highlights all of the references to that symbol within scope br New Solution Explorer The new Solution Explorer allows for visualization of class and file hierarchies within a solution project It can search for
