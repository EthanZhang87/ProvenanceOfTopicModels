title: Mozilla Location Service

Mozilla Location Service MLS was an open geolocation service that allowed devices to find their position by processing received signals of publicly observable radio transmitters cellular network antennae and their Cell IDs Wi Fi access points and their BSSIDs and Bluetooth beacons The service was provided by Mozilla from to The service used Mozilla s open source software project called Ichnaea br In February MLS had collected more than million unique cell networks and million unique WiFi networks April million UCN and million UWN November million UCN and million UWN November million UCN and million UWN br In March it was announced that MLS would be retired and that functionality will be reduced in stages until the project is archived in July br br br Data collection and processing br The mobile app Mozilla Stumbler for Android could be used to contribute signals of cellular networks and Wi Fi access points at the device s GPS position It was available in the Google Play store and F Droid from November to February after which it was officially retired It was noted that contributions from Firefox for Android users completely overwhelm ed the contributions made by the dedicated Stumbler app Other apps such as Tower Collector were also available for the same purpose although they were limited to collecting information related to cellular networks At the moment there is no working software capable of contributing Wi Fi or Bluetooth information br Firefox for Android had the option to contribute to the service in a similar manner to Stumbler up until Firefox version after which Mozilla performed a major rewrite of the browser and the option to contribute to MLS was not re added br Mozilla does not collect the SSID name e g Simpson family wifi from WiFi networks but does collect the BSSID which is often the MAC address of the WiFi device br The service is opt out meaning it will be enabled on client applications without the user s consent unless disabled Mozilla s client applications do not collect information about WiFi access points whose SSID is hidden or ends with the string nomap e g Simpson family wifi nomap br When the service is used to request the geolocation of a device by sending it information about nearby radio transmitters it not only responds with a location estimate but also uses the data to update its own database For example if a device requests its location by sending the service information about nearby Wi Fi networks but MLS only knows about of them the information about the previously undiscovered Wi Fi networks will be added as a data point at the device s estimated location These requests are also used to verify that the reported Wi Fi networks still exist and that their characteristics such as their location orientation or other factors that might alter the signal are unchanged If they are changed for example by someone moving their Wi Fi router to another room then the device gets the Blocked status which means that it isn t taken into account for location queries for hours If the device then remains stable at its new position it is considered usable again If it were to keep moving it will be considered a moving emitter and will not be taken into account for location queries This is used to filter out for example Wi Fi access points on buses and trains and mobile hotspots created by phones and laptops br The service does not try to calculate and store the location of the radio transmitters themselves Instead it calculates and stores the areas in which their signal can be received This area is internally represented as a circle whose center is the weighted average of the location of all the measurements in which the signal was received Measurements which are deemed to have a higher accuracy higher signal strength and better signal to noise ratio are given a higher weight The circle s size is set to be large enough to encompass a bounding box of all measurements br Mozilla publishes aggregated data set of cell locations MLS Cell Network Export Data under a public domain license CC Unlike the cell database the raw WiFi database is not made public because the underlying data contains personally identifiable information from both the users uploading data and from the owners of Wi Fi devices However Mozilla shares this proprietary data with its corporate partner Combain AB br br br Usage br The service is used by default as a geolocation provider fallback in the Beta and Nightly versions of Mozilla Firefox for desktop computers and laptops used when Firefox fails to acquire geolocation data from the operating system Some versions of Firefox distributed by third parties especially Linux distributions also use MLS By default the first party stable Firefox releases from Mozilla use a similar alternative service operated by Google Firefox users have the option to change this setting to force the browser to use MLS instead by visiting the about config page and changing the value of geo provider network url to https location services mozilla com v geolocate key MOZILLA API KEY This location data is exposed to websites using the HTML Geolocation API after the user has granted the website permission to access their location br It is also the primary location source in the GeoClue library for non GPS enabled devices which is used in the GNOME and KDE environment in location dependent applications such as the ones providing weather and maps br The service is free to use but an API key is required for requesting geolocation data Keys are given out on an individual basis In order to receive a key one must fill out a request form Mozilla does not as of provide keys to commercial or personal projects Keys are only offered if the person requesting it provides a link to their software repository which must be licensed under an open source license However it is possible to anonymously submit collected data to the service without the need for an API key br br br See also br Wi Fi positioning system br br br br br br External links br Mozilla Wiki Entry br Mozilla Location Service
