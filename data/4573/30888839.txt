title: Software categories
id: 30888839
Software categories are groups of software They allow software to be understood in terms of those categories instead of the particularities of each package Different classification schemes consider different aspects of software br br br Categorization approaches br Computer software can be put into categories based on common function type or field of use There are three broad classifications br br Application software is the general designation of computer programs for performing tasks Application software may be general purpose word processing web browsers etc or have a specific purpose accounting truck scheduling etc Application software contrasts with system software br System software is a generic term referring to the computer programs used to start and run computer systems including diverse application software and networks br Computer programming tools such as compilers and linkers are used to translate and combine computer program source code and libraries into executable RAMs programs that will belong to one of the three said br br br Copyright status br The GNU Project categorizes software by copyright status free software open source software public domain software copylefted software noncopylefted free software lax permissive licensed software GPL covered software the GNU operating system GNU programs GNU software FSF copyrighted GNU software nonfree software proprietary software freeware shareware private software and commercial software br br br Free software br Free software is software that comes with permission for anyone to use copy and distribute either verbatim or with modifications either gratis or for a fee In particular this means that source code must be available If it s not the source it s not software If a program is free then it can potentially be included in a free operating system such as GNU or free versions of the Linux system br Free software in the sense of copyright license and the GNU project is a matter of freedom not price However proprietary software companies typically use the term free software to refer to price Sometimes this means a binary copy can be obtained at no charge sometimes this means a copy is bundled with a computer for sale at no additional charge br br br Open source software br Open source software is software with its source code made available under a certain license to its licensees It can be used and disseminated at any point the source code is open and can be modified as required The one condition with this type of software is that when changes are made users should make these changes known to others One of the key characteristics of open source software is that it is the shared intellectual property of all developers and users The Linux operating system is one of the best known examples of a collection of open source software br br br Copylefted software br Copylefted software is free software whose distribution terms ensure that all copies of all versions carry more or less the same distribution terms This means for instance that copyleft licenses generally disallow others to add additional requirements to the software though a limited set of safe added requirements can be allowed and require making source code available This shields the program and its modified versions from some of the common ways of making a program proprietary Some copyleft licenses block other means of turning software proprietary br Copyleft is a general concept Copylefting an actual program requires a specific set of distribution terms Different copyleft licenses are usually incompatible due to varying terms which makes it illegal to merge the code using one license with the code using the other license If two pieces of software use the same license they are generally mergeable br br br Non copylefted free software br Noncopylefted free software comes from the author with permission to redistribute modify and add license restrictions br If a program is free but not copylefted then some copies or modified versions may not be free A software company can compile the program with or without modifications and distribute the executable file as a proprietary software product The X Window System illustrates this approach The X Consortium releases X with distribution terms that make it non copylefted free software If you wish you can get a copy that has those distribution terms and is free However nonfree versions are available and workstations and PC graphics boards for which nonfree versions are the only ones that work The developers of X made X nonfree for a while they were able to do this because others had contributed their code under the same non copyleft license br br br Shareware br Shareware is software that comes with permission to redistribute copies but says that anyone who continues to use a copy is required to pay Shareware is not free software or even semi free For most shareware source code is not available thus the program cannot be modified Shareware does not come with permission to make a copy and install it without paying a license fee including for nonprofit activity br br br Freeware br Like shareware freeware is software available for download and distribution without any initial payment Freeware never has an associated fee Things like minor program updates and small games are commonly distributed as freeware Though freeware is cost free it is copyrighted so other people can not market the software as their own br br br Microsoft TechNet and AIS Software categories br This classification has seven major elements They are platform and management education and reference home and entertainment content and communication operations and professional product manufacturing and service delivery and line of business br br Platform and management Desktop and network infrastructure and management software that allows users to control the computer operating environment hardware components and peripherals and infrastructure services and security br Education and reference Educational software that does not contain resources such as training or help files for a specific application br Home and entertainment Applications designed primarily for use in or for the home or for entertainment br Content and communications Common applications for productivity content creation and communications These typically include office productivity suites multimedia players file viewers Web browsers and collaboration tools br Operations and professional Applications designed for business uses such as enterprise resource management customer relations management supply chain and manufacturing tasks application development information management and access and tasks performed by both business and technical equipment br Product manufacturing and service delivery Help users create products or deliver services in specific industries Categories in this section are used by the North American Industry Classification System NAICS br br br Market based categories br br br Horizontal applications br Word Processing br br br Vertical applications br Accommodation and Food Services br Administrative and Support br Animal shelter and Animal rescue br Agriculture Forestry and Hunting br Arts Entertainment and Recreation br Construction br Educational Services br Finance and Insurance br Geospatial br Health Care and Social Assistance br Information br Internal and proprietary line of business applications br Management of Companies and Enterprises br Manufacturing br Mining Quarrying and Oil and Gas Extraction br Postal and Mailing br Professional Scientific and Technical Services br Public Administration br Real Estate Rental and Leasing br
