title: Outline of Perl
id: 33957176
The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the Perl programming language br Perl high level general purpose interpreted multi paradigm dynamic programming language Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in as a general purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier Since then it has undergone many changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers Larry Wall continues to oversee development of Raku Note that Perl and Raku are receiving ongoing development therefore making Perl a family of programming languages It stands for Practical Extraction and Reporting Language which processes data using pattern matching technique br br br What type of thing is Perl br Perl can be described as all of the following types of things br Family of programming languages a programming language is an artificial language designed to communicate instructions to a machine particularly a computer Programming languages can be used to create programs that control the behavior of a machine and or to express algorithms precisely Both Perl and Raku are each considered a br General purpose programming language programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains br High level programming language programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer While low level programming languages are very cryptic a higher level programming language may use natural language elements be easier to use making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable with respect to a low level language br Interpreted language programming language in which programs are indirectly executed interpreted by an interpreter program This can be contrasted with a compiled language which is converted into machine code and then directly executed by the host CPU br Scripting language programming language that supports the writing of scripts programs written for a software environment that automate the execution of tasks which could alternatively be executed one by one by a human operator br Glue language programming language usually a scripting language used for writing programs or scripts that activate other scripts and programs thus gluing them together br Dynamic programming language high level programming language that executes many common behaviors while running that other languages might perform during compilation if at all These behaviors could include extension of the program by adding new code by extending objects and definitions or by modifying the type system all during program execution br Dynamically typed programming language A programming language is said to be dynamically typed when the majority of its type checking for example numerical vs non numerical is performed at run time as opposed to at compile time Therefore the type for a particular variable or value is not locked in In dynamic typing values have types but variables do not that is a variable can refer to a value of any type br Free and open source software software that is both free software and open source It is liberally licensed to grant users the right to use copy study change and improve its design through the availability of its source code Both Perl and Raku are free and open source br Free software software that can be used studied and modified without restriction and which can be copied and redistributed in modified or unmodified form either without restriction or with restrictions that only ensure that further recipients have the same rights under which it was obtained and that manufacturers of consumer products incorporating free software provide the software as source code In addition to this Perl is available for free i e at no cost br Open source software computer software that is available in source code form the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under an open source license that permits users to study change improve and at times also to distribute the software Open source software is very often developed in a public collaborative manner Perl is developed and supported by a large international community of volunteers br br br Other names for Perl br Backronyms that describe Perl while treating it as an acronym br PERL Practical Extraction and Report Language br PERL Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister br Other descriptions br Duct tape for the Internet br Swiss Army chainsaw of scripting languages br br br Aspects of Perl br br br Strengths of Perl br Flexibility perl is feature rich and has borrowed from many other programming languages This is reflected in the motto There s more than one way to do it There are also many extension modules available to expand the language br Cross platform implementation perl programs work on many types of computers usually without the need to modify the source code Perl interpreters have been developed for most operating systems platforms taking into account the idiosyncrasies of each so all such platforms can theoretically run the same code br Text manipulation anything from spell checking to search and replace operations using regex to natural language processing br Pattern matching regex is integrated into perl br Stream editing br Database manipulation br Shell scripting perl is good for writing programs in the form of a series of commands to be run by the Unix shell a command line interpreter Such programs are called scripts In this regard perl is considered to be a scripting language Typical operations performed by shell scripts include program execution printing text and file manipulation copying renaming deleting etc br Being an interpreted language perl has the following advantages br Platform independence br Reflection and reflective use of the evaluator e g a first order eval function br Smaller executable program size since implementations have flexibility to choose the instruction code br Dynamic typing br Dynamic scoping br br br Weaknesses of Perl br Slow being an interpreted language perl code generally runs slower than compiled code It would not be well suited for writing state of the art video games for example br Software maintenance source code may be cryptic much like C making it difficult to maintain code or fix bugs in code written by somebody else unless adequate remarks are included br br br Components of Perl br br br Perl documentation br Perl Programming Documentation name of the user manual for the Perl programming language available online and for offline use br br br Perl language structure br Perl language structure br br Perl data types classifications identifying various types of data that determine the possible values for each type the operations that can be done on values of each type the meaning of the data and the way values of each type can be stored The main data types in perl are br Scalars br Arrays br Hashes br Filehandles br Subroutines br Typeglobs br Perl control structures br Perl modules modular extensions of the Perl language The following modules and module

language Many later languages have borrowed directly or indirectly from C including C D Go Rust Java JavaScript Limbo LPC C Objective C Perl PHP Python Verilog hardware description language and Unix s C shell These languages have drawn many of their control structures and other basic features from C Most of them with Python being the most dramatic exception are also very syntactically similar to C in general and they tend to combine the recognizable expression and statement syntax of C with underlying type systems data models and semantics that can be radically different br grep grep stands for
