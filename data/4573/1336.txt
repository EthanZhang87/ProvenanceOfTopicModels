The Apache Software Foundation PATCH ee ASF is an American nonprofit corporation classified as a c organization in the United States to support a number of open source software projects The ASF was formed from a group of developers of the Apache HTTP Server and incorporated on March As of it includes approximately members br The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the Apache License a permissive open source license for free and open source software FOSS The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative consensus based development process and an open and pragmatic software license which is to say that it allows developers who receive the software freely to redistribute it under non free terms Each project is managed by a self selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project The ASF is a meritocracy implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects The ASF is considered a second generation open source organization in that commercial support is provided without the risk of platform lock in br Among the ASF s objectives are to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects and to prevent the Apache brand name from being used by other organizations without permission br The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year highlighting Apache projects and related technology br br br History br The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server development beginning in February A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the NCSA HTTPd daemon They came to be known as the Apache Group On March the Apache Software Foundation was formed The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April The initial members of the Apache Software Foundation consisted of the Apache Group Brian Behlendorf Ken Coar Miguel Gonzales Mark Cox Lars Eilebrecht Ralf S Engelschall Roy T Fielding Dean Gaudet Ben Hyde Jim Jagielski Alexei Kosut Martin Kraemer Ben Laurie Doug MacEachern Aram Mirzadeh Sameer Parekh Cliff Skolnick Marc Slemko William Bill Stoddard Paul Sutton Randy Terbush and Dirk Willem van Gulik After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June br Co founder Brian Behlendorf states how the name Apache was chosen I suggested the name Apache partly because the web technologies at the time that were launching were being called cyber this or spider that or something on those themes and I was like we need something a little more interesting a little more romantic not to be a cultural appropriator or anything like that I had just seen a documentary about Geronimo and the last days of a Native American tribe called the Apaches right who succumbed to the invasion from the West from the United States and they were the last tribe to give up their territory and for me that almost romantically represented what I felt we were doing with this web server project br br br Projects br br Apache divides its software development activities into separate semi autonomous areas called top level projects formally known as a Project Management Committee in the bylaws some of which have a number of sub projects Unlike some other organizations that host FOSS projects before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement In this way the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects br br br Board of directors br The Board of Directors of The Apache Software Foundation ASF is responsible for management and oversight of the business and affairs of the corporation in accordance with the Bylaws This includes management of the corporate assets funds intellectual property trademarks and support equipment appointment of a President and corporate officers managing the core operations of the ASF and allocation of corporate resources for the benefit of Apache projects Technical decision making authority for every Apache project is assigned to their independent project management committee the participants in each project provide direction not the board br The board is elected annually by the ASF membership br Since March the board of directors has been br
