Mozilla Firefox or simply Firefox is a free and open source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary the Mozilla Corporation It uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages which implements current and anticipated web standards Firefox is available for Windows and later versions of Windows macOS and Linux Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix like operating systems including FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD and other platforms It is also available for Android and iOS However as with all other iOS web browsers the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform requirements An optimized version is also available on the Amazon Fire TV as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon s Silk Browser br Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in before its acquisition by AOL Firefox was created in under the codename Phoenix by members of the Mozilla community who desired a standalone browser rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle During its beta phase it proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed security and add ons compared to Microsoft s then dominant Internet Explorer It was released on November and challenged Internet Explorer s dominance with million downloads within nine months In November Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface br Firefox usage share grew to a peak of in November with Firefox overtaking Internet Explorer although not all versions of Internet Explorer as a whole its usage then declined in competition with Google Chrome As of July according to StatCounter it had a usage share on traditional PCs i e as a desktop browser making it the fourth most popular PC web browser after Google Chrome Microsoft Edge and Safari br br br History br br The project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt Joe Hewitt and Blake Ross They believed the commercial requirements of Netscape s sponsorship and developer driven feature creep compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite s software bloat they created a standalone browser with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite Version was released on September On April the Mozilla Organization announced that it planned to change its focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and Thunderbird br br The Firefox project has undergone several name changes The nascent browser was originally named Phoenix after the mythical bird that rose triumphantly from the ashes of its dead predecessor in this case from the ashes of Netscape Navigator after it was sidelined by Microsoft Internet Explorer in the First Browser War Phoenix was renamed in due to a trademark claim from Phoenix Technologies The replacement name Firebird provoked an intense response from the Firebird database software project The Mozilla Foundation reassured them that the browser would always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion After further pressure Mozilla Firebird became Mozilla Firefox on February The name Firefox was said to be derived from a nickname of the red panda which became the mascot for the newly named project For the abbreviation of Firefox Mozilla prefers Fx or fx although it is often abbreviated as FF br The Firefox project went through many versions before version and had already gained a great deal of acclaim from numerous media outlets such as Forbes and The Wall Street Journal Among Firefox s popular features were the integrated pop up blocker tabbed browsing and an extension mechanism for adding functionality Although these features have already been available for some time in other browsers such as the Mozilla Suite and Opera Firefox was the first of these browsers to have achieved large scale adoption Firefox attracted attention as an alternative to Internet Explorer which had come under fire for its alleged poor program design and insecurity detractors cite IE s lack of support for certain Web standards use of the potentially dangerous ActiveX component and vulnerability to spyware and malware installation Microsoft responded by releasing Windows XP Service Pack which added several important security features to Internet Explorer br Version of Firefox was released on November This was followed by version in November version in October version in June version in June version in January and version in March From version onwards the development and release model changed into a rapid one by the end of the stable release was version and by the end of it reached version br Major redesigns of its graphical user interface occurred on versions Strata in March Australis in April Photon in November and Proton in June br In Mozilla announced a project known as Quantum which sought to improve Firefox s Gecko engine and other components to improve the browser s performance modernize its architecture and transition the browser to a multi process model These improvements came in the wake of decreasing market share to Google Chrome as well as concerns that its performance was lapsing in comparison Despite its improvements these changes required existing add ons for Firefox to be made incompatible with newer versions in favor of a new extension system that is designed to be similar to Chrome and other recent browsers Firefox which was released in November was the first version to contain enhancements from Quantum and has thus been named Firefox Quantum A Mozilla executive stated that Quantum was the biggest update to the browser since version Unresponsive and crashing pages only affect other pages loaded within the same process While Chrome uses separate processes for each loaded tab Firefox distributes tabs over four processes by default since Quantum in order to balance memory consumption and performance The process count can be adjusted where more processes increase performance at the cost of memory therefore suitable for computers with larger RAM capacity br On May the expiration of an intermediate signing certificate on Mozilla servers caused Firefox to automatically disable and lock all browser extensions add ons Mozilla began the roll out of a fix shortly thereafter using their Mozilla Studies component br Support for Adobe Flash was dropped on January with the release of Firefox br On June Firefox s Proton redesign was offered through its stable release channel after being made available in the beta builds While users were initially allowed to revert to the old design through about config the corresponding key value pairs reportedly stopped working in future builds resulting in criticism These included accessibility concerns despite Mozilla s claim to continue to work with the accessibility community and are continuing issues br On January an issue with Firefox s HTTP implementation resulted in a widespread outage for multiple hours br On September Firefox introduced on device translation of web page content br On January along with the release of Firefox Mozilla introduced an official APT repository for Debian based Linux distributions br br br Features br br Features of the desktop edition include tabbed browsing full screen mode spell checking incremental search smart bookmarks bookmarking and downloading through drag and drop a download manager user profile management private browsing bookmark tags bookmark exporting offline mode a screenshot tool web development tools a page info feature which shows a list of page metadata and multimedia items a configuration menu at about config for power users and location aware browsing also known as geolocation based on a Google service Firefox has an integrated search system which uses Google by default in most markets DNS over HTTPS is another feature whose default behaviour is determined geographically br Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which they can use built in tools such as the Error Console or the DOM Inspector and extensions such as Firebug and more recently there has been an integration feature with Pocket Firefox Hello was an implementation of WebRTC added in October which allows users of Firefox and other compatible systems to have a video call with the extra feature of screen and file sharing by sending a link to each other Firefox Hello was scheduled to be removed in September br Former features include a File Transfer Protocol FTP client for browsing file servers the ability to block images from individual domains until version a D page inspector versions to tab grouping until version and the ability to add customized extra toolbars until version br br br Browser extensions br Functions can be added through add ons created by third party developers Add ons are primarily coded using an HTML CSS JavaScript with API known as WebExtensions which is designed to be compatible with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension systems Firefox previously supported add ons using the XUL and XPCOM APIs which allowed them to directly access and manipulate much of the browser s internal functionality As compatibility was not included in the multi process architecture XUL add ons have been deemed Legacy add ons and are no longer supported on Firefox Quantum and newer br Mozilla has occasionally installed extensions for users without their permission This happened in when an extension designed to promote the show Mr Robot was silently added in an update to Firefox br br br Themes br Firefox can have themes added to it which users can create or download from third parties to change the appearance of the browser br br br Guest session br In Firefox for Android added a guest session mode which wiped browsing data such as tabs cookies and history at the end of each guest session Guest session data was kept even when restarting the browser or device and deleted only upon a manual exit The feature was removed in purportedly to streamline the experience br br br Standards br br Firefox implements many web standards including HTML almost full HTML XML XHTML MathML SVG full SVG partial CSS with extensions ECMAScript JavaScript DOM XSLT XPath and APNG Animated PNG images with alpha transparency Firefox also implements standards proposals created by the WHATWG such as client side storage and the canvas element These standards are implemented through the Gecko layout engine and SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine Firefox was the first release to introduce significant HTML and CSS support br Firefox has passed the Acid standards compliance test since version Mozilla had originally stated that they did not intend for Firefox to pass the Acid test fully because they believed that the SVG fonts part of the test had become outdated and irrelevant due to WOFF being agreed upon as a standard by all major browser makers Because the SVG font tests were removed from the Acid test in September Firefox and greater scored br Firefox also implements Safe Browsing a proprietary protocol from Google used to exchange data related with phishing and malware protection br Firefox supports the playback of video content protected by HTML Encrypted Media Extensions EME since version For security and privacy reasons EME is implemented within a wrapper of open source code that allows execution of a proprietary DRM module by Adobe Systems Adobe Primetime Content Decryption Module CDM CDM runs within a sandbox environment to limit its access to the system and provide it a randomized device ID to prevent services from uniquely identifying the device for tracking purposes The DRM module once it has been downloaded is enabled and disabled in the same manner as other plug ins Since version Google s Widevine CDM on Windows and Mac OS X so streaming services like Amazon Video can switch from Silverlight to encrypted HTML video is also supported Mozilla justified its partnership with Adobe and Google by stating br br Firefox downloads and enables the Adobe Primetime and Google Widevine CDMs by default to give users a smooth experience on sites that require DRM Each CDM runs in a separate container called a sandbox and you will be notified when a CDM is in use You can also disable each CDM and opt out of future updates br and that it is an important step on Mozilla s roadmap to remove NPAPI plugin support Upon the introduction of EME support builds of Firefox on Windows were also introduced that exclude support for EME The Free Software Foundation and Cory Doctorow condemned Mozilla s decision to support EME br br br Security br br From its inception Firefox was positioned as a security focused browser At the time Internet Explorer the dominant browser was facing a security crisis Multiple vulnerabilities had been found and malware like Download Ject could be installed simply by visiting a compromised website The situation was so bad that the US Government issued a warning against using Internet Explorer Firefox being less integrated with the operating system was considered a safer alternative since it was less likely to have issues that could completely compromise a computer This led to a significant increase in Firefox s popularity during the early s as more secure alternative Moreover Firefox was considered to have fewer actively exploitable security vulnerabilities compared to its competitors In The Washington Post reported that exploit code for known security vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer were available for days compared to only nine days for Firefox before the problem was fixed A Symantec study around the same period showed that even though Firefox had a higher number of vulnerabilities on average vulnerabilities were fixed faster in Firefox than in other browsers during that period br During this period Firefox used a monolithic architecture like most browsers at the time This meant all browser components ran in a single process with access to all system resources This setup had multiple security issues If a web page used too many resources the entire Firefox process would hang or crash affecting all tabs Additionally any exploit could easily access system resources including user files Between and most browsers shifted to a multiprocess architecture isolating high risk processes like rendering media GPU and networking However Firefox was slower to adopt this change It wasn t until that Firefox started its Electrolysis e s project to implement sandboxing across multiple components This rewrite relied on interprocess communication using Chromium s interprocess communication library and placed various component including the rendering component in its own sandbox Firefox released this rewrite in to beta in August noting a increase in memory usage which was lower than Chrome s at the time However the rewrite caused issues with their legacy extension API which was not designed to work cross process and required shim code to function correctly After over a year in beta the rewrite was enabled by default all users of Firefox in November br In Mozilla launched a new project called Servo to write a completely new and experimental browser engine utilizing memory safe techniques written in Rust In Mozilla opted to integrate parts of the Servo project into the Gecko engine in a project codenamed the Quantum project The project completely overhauled Firefox s page rendering code resulting in performance and stability gains while also improving the security of existing components Additionally the older incompatible extension API was removed in favour of a WebExtension API that more closely resembled Google Chrome s extension system This broke compatibility with older extensions but resulted in lesser vulnerabilities and a much more maintainable extension system While the Servo project was intended to replace more parts of the Gecko Engine this plan never came to fruition In Mozilla laid off all developers on the Servo team transferring ownership of the project to the Linux Foundation br br br Privacy br When Firefox initially released it used a custom script permission policy where scripts that were signed by the page could gain access to higher privilege actions such as the ability to set a user s preferences However this model was not widely used and was later discontinued by Firefox Modern day Firefox instead follows the standard same origin policy permission model that is followed by most modern browsers which disallows scripts from accessing any privileged data including data about other websites br It uses TLS to protect communications with web servers using strong cryptography when using the HTTPS protocol The freely available HTTPS Everywhere add on enforces HTTPS even if a regular HTTP URL is entered Firefox now supports HTTP br In February plans were announced for Firefox to disable third party cookies by default However the introduction of the feature was then delayed so Mozilla developers could collect and analyze data on the effect of blocking some third party cookies Mozilla also collaborated with Stanford University s Cookie Clearinghouse project to develop a blacklist and whitelist of sites that will be used in the filter br Version released in August followed the lead of its competitors by blocking iframe stylesheet and script resources served from non HTTPS servers embedded on HTTPS pages by default Additionally JavaScript could also no longer be disabled through Firefox s preferences and JavaScript was automatically re enabled for users who upgraded to or higher with it disabled The change was made due to the fact the JavaScript was being used across a majority of websites on the web and disabling JavaScript could potentially have untoward repercussions on inexperienced users who are unaware of its impact Firefox also cited the fact that extensions like NoScript that can disable JavaScript in a more controlled fashion were widely available The following release added the ability to disable JavaScript through the developer tools for testing purposes br Beginning with Firefox all extensions must be signed by Mozilla to be used in release and beta versions of Firefox Firefox blocked unsigned extensions but allowed enforcement of extension signing to be disabled All extensions must be submitted to Mozilla Add ons and be subject to code analysis in order to be signed although extensions do not have to be listed on the service to be signed On May Mozilla announced that it would be strengthening the signature enforcement with methods that included the retroactive disabling of old extensions now deemed to be insecure br br Since version Firefox includes the option to use DNS over HTTPS DoH which causes DNS lookup requests to be sent encrypted over the HTTPS protocol To use this feature the user must set certain preferences beginning with network trr Trusted Recursive Resolver in about config if network trr mode is DoH is disabled activates DoH in addition to unencrypted DNS causes DoH to be used before unencrypted DNS to use only DoH the value must be By setting network trr uri to the URL special Cloudflare servers will be activated Mozilla has a privacy agreement with this server host that restricts their collection of information about incoming DNS requests br On May Firefox was updated to include the ability to block scripts that used a computer s CPU to mine cryptocurrency without a user s permission in Firefox version The update also allowed users to block known fingerprinting scripts that track their activity across the web however it does not resist fingerprinting on its own br In March Firefox launched SmartBlock in version to offer protection against cross site tracking without breaking the websites users visit Also known as state partitioning or total cookie protection works via a feature in the browser that isolates data from each site visited by the user to ensure that cross site scripting is very difficult if not impossible The feature also isolates local storage service workers and other common ways for sites to store data br br br Localizations br Firefox is a widely localized web browser Mozilla uses the in house Pontoon localization platform The first official release in November was available in different languages and for locales In Mozilla released Project Fluent a localization system that allows translators to be more flexible with their translation than to be constrained in one to one translation of strings As of July the supported versions of Firefox are available in locales languages br br br Platform availability br The desktop version of Firefox is available and supports Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux while Firefox for Android is available for Android formerly Firefox for mobile it also ran on Maemo MeeGo and Firefox OS and Firefox for iOS is available for iOS Smartphones that support Linux but do not support Android or iOS apps can also run Firefox in its desktop version for example using postmarketOS br br Notes br br In March the Windows Store app version of Firefox was cancelled although there is a beta release br SSE instruction set support is required for or later for Windows and or later for Linux IA support only applies to superscalar processors br Firefox source code may be compiled for various operating systems however officially distributed binaries are provided for the following br br br Microsoft Windows br Firefox was released for Windows as well as Windows NT or later Some users reported the x builds were operable but not installable on Windows NT br The version release includes the first x build It required Windows or Server R Starting from version Firefox for Windows requires and uses the SSE instruction set br In September Mozilla released a Metro style version of Firefox optimized for touchscreen use on the Aurora release channel However on March Mozilla cancelled the project because of a lack of user adoption br In March Firefox ESR the last version of the browser for Windows XP and Windows Vista was released Support for Firefox ESR ended in June br Traditionally installing the Windows version of Firefox entails visiting the Firefox website and downloading an installer package depending on the desired localization and system architecture In November Mozilla made Firefox available on Microsoft Store The Store distributed package does not interfere with the traditional installation br The last version of Firefox for Windows and is Firefox ESR which was released in July Its end of life is planned to be in September br br br macOS br br The first official release Firefox version supported macOS then called Mac OS X on the PowerPC architecture Mac OS X builds for the IA architecture became available via a universal binary which debuted with Firefox in br Starting with version Firefox was released for the x architecture to which macOS had migrated Version also dropped support for PowerPC architecture although other projects continued development of a PowerPC version of Firefox br Firefox was originally released for Mac OS X and higher The minimum OS then increased to Mac OS X in Firefox and in Firefox Firefox dropped support for Mac OS X and PowerPC Macs and Firefox dropped support for Mac OS X entirely The system requirements were left unchanged until when Firefox dropped support for Mac OS X Mozilla ended support for OS X in Firefox with those users being supported on the Firefox ESR branch until November Most recently Mozilla ended support for macOS in Firefox with those users being supported on the Firefox ESR branch until late br br br Linux br br Since its inception Firefox for Linux supported the bit memory architecture of the IA instruction set bit builds were introduced in the release The release replaced GTK with as a system requirement on Linux and other systems running X Org Starting with the bit builds require the SSE instruction set br br br Firefox for Android br br Firefox for mobile code named Fennec was first released for Maemo in January with version and for Android in March with version Support for Maemo was discontinued after version released in September Fennec had a user interface optimized for phones and tablets It included the Awesome Bar tabbed browsing add on support a password manager location aware browsing and the ability to synchronize with the user s other devices with Mozilla Firefox using Firefox Sync At the end of its existence it had a market share of on Android br In August Mozilla launched a new version of its Firefox for Android app named Firefox Daylight to the public and codenamed Fenix after a little over a year of testing It boasted higher speeds with its new GeckoView engine which is described as being the only independent web engine browser available on Android It also added Enhanced Tracking Protection a feature that blocks many known trackers on the Internet It also added the ability to place the address bar on the bottom and a new Collections feature However it was criticized for only having nine Add ons at launch and missing certain features In response Mozilla stated that they will allow more Add ons with time br br Notes br Firefox for iOS is not listed in this table as its version numbers would be misleading Prior to version it used version numbers that do not correspond to any of the other Firefox versions Those share a core component the Gecko rendering engine and track its version numbers whereas the version for the iOS operating system uses the operating system s rendering engine WebKit rather than Mozilla s Gecko br br br Firefox for iOS br Mozilla initially refused to port Firefox to iOS due to the restrictions Apple imposed on third party iOS browsers Instead of releasing a full version of the Firefox browser Mozilla released Firefox Home a companion app for the iPhone and iPod Touch based on the Firefox Sync technology which allowed users to access their Firefox browsing history bookmarks and recent tabs It also included Firefox s Awesomebar location bar Firefox Home was not a web browser the application launched web pages in either an embedded viewer for that one page or by opening the page in the Safari app Mozilla pulled Firefox Home from the App Store in September stating it would focus its resources on other projects The company subsequently released the source code of Firefox Home s underlying synchronization software br In April then Mozilla CEO Gary Kovacs said that Firefox would not come to iOS if Apple required the use of the WebKit layout engine to do so One reason given by Mozilla was that prior to iOS Apple had supplied third party browsers with an inferior version of their JavaScript engine which hobbled their performance making it impossible to match Safari s JavaScript performance on the iOS platform Apple later opened their Nitro JavaScript engine to third party browsers In Mozilla announced it was moving forward with Firefox for iOS with a preview release made available in New Zealand in September of that year It was fully released in November later that year It is the first Firefox branded browser not to use the Gecko layout engine as is used in Firefox for desktop and mobile Apple s policies require all iOS apps that browse the web to use the built in WebKit rendering framework and WebKit JavaScript so using Gecko is not possible Unlike Firefox on Android Firefox for iOS does not support browser add ons br In November Firefox released a new iOS app titled Firefox Focus a private web browser br br br Firefox Reality AR VR br Firefox Reality was released for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality headsets in September It supports traditional web browsing through D windows and immersive VR pages through Web VR Firefox Reality is available on HTC Vive Oculus Google Daydream and Microsoft Hololens headsets In February Mozilla announced that Igalia took over stewardship of this project under the new name of Wolvic br br br Unofficial ports br Firefox has also been ported to FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD OpenIndiana OS ArcaOS SkyOS RISC OS and BeOS Haiku and an unofficial rebranded version called Timberwolf has been available for AmigaOS An unofficial continuation of the Mac OS X PowerPC release was actively developed as TenFourFox until October br The Firefox port for OpenBSD is maintained by Landry Breuil since Firefox is regularly built for the current branch of the operating system the latest versions are packaged for each release and remain frozen until the next release In Landry began hosting packages of newer Firefox versions for OpenBSD releases from onwards making them available to installations without the ports system br The Solaris port of Firefox including OpenSolaris was maintained by the Oracle Solaris Desktop Beijing Team until March when the team was disbanded There was also an unofficial port of Firefox x to IBM AIX and of v x to UnixWare br br br Channels and release schedule br In March Mozilla presented plans to switch to the rapid release model a faster week development cycle similar to Google Chrome Ars Technica noted that this new cycle entailed significant technical and operational challenges for Mozilla notably preserving third party add on compatibility but that it would help accelerate Firefox s adoption of new web standards feature and performance improvements This plan was implemented in April The release process was split into four channels with major releases trickling down to the next channel every six to eight weeks For example the Nightly channel would feature a preliminary unstable version of Firefox which would move to the experimental Aurora channel after preliminary testing then to the more stable beta channel before finally reaching the public release channel with each stage taking around six weeks For corporations Mozilla introduced an Extended Support Release ESR channel with new versions released every weeks and supported for more weeks after a new ESR version is released though Mozilla warned that it would be less secure than the release channel since security patches would only be backported for high impact vulnerabilities br In Mozilla abandoned the Aurora channel which saw low uptake and rebased Firefox Developer Edition onto the beta channel Mozilla uses A B testing and a staged rollout mechanism for the release channel where updates are first presented to a small fraction of users with Mozilla monitoring its telemetry for increased crashes or other issues before the update is made available to all users In Firefox moved to a four week release cycle to catch up with Chrome in support for new web features Chrome switched to a four week cycle a year later br br br Licensing br Firefox source code is free software with most of it being released under the Mozilla Public License MPL version This license permits anyone to view modify or redistribute the source code As a result several publicly released applications have been built from it including Firefox s predecessor Netscape as well as the privacy focussed Tor Browser br In the past Firefox was licensed solely under the MPL then version which the Free Software Foundation criticized for being weak copyleft as the license permitted in limited ways proprietary derivative works Additionally code only licensed under MPL could not legally be linked with code under the GPL To address these concerns Mozilla re licensed most of Firefox under the tri license scheme of MPL GPL or LGPL Since the re licensing developers were free to choose the license under which they received most of the code to suit their intended use GPL or LGPL linking and derivative works when one of those licenses is chosen or MPL use including the possibility of proprietary derivative works if they chose the MPL However on January Mozilla released the GPL compatible MPL and with the release of Firefox on June Mozilla used it to replace the tri licensing scheme br br br Trademark and logo br br The name Mozilla Firefox is a registered trademark of Mozilla along with the official Firefox logo it may only be used under certain terms and conditions Anyone may redistribute the official binaries in unmodified form and use the Firefox name and branding for such distribution but restrictions are placed on distributions which modify the underlying source code The name Firefox derives from a nickname of the red panda br Mozilla has placed the Firefox logo files under open source licenses but its trademark guidelines do not allow displaying altered or similar logos in contexts where trademark law applies br br There has been some controversy over the Mozilla Foundation s intentions in stopping certain open source distributions from using the Firefox trademark Open source browsers enable greater choice and innovation in the market rather than aiming for mass market domination Mozilla Foundation Chairperson Mitchell Baker explained in an interview in that distributions could freely use the Firefox trademark if they did not modify source code and that the Mozilla Foundation s only concern was with users getting a consistent experience when they used Firefox br To allow distributions of the code without using the official branding the Firefox build system contains a branding switch This switch often used for alphas Auroras of future Firefox versions allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name and can allow a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark to be produced In the unbranded build the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived br Distributing modified versions of Firefox under the Firefox name required explicit approval from Mozilla for the changes made to the underlying code and required the use of all of the official branding For example it was not permissible to use the name Firefox without also using the official logo When the Debian project decided to stop using the official Firefox logo in because Mozilla s copyright restrictions at the time were incompatible with Debian s guidelines they were told by a representative of the Mozilla Foundation that this was not acceptable and was asked either to comply with the published trademark guidelines or cease using the Firefox name in their distribution Debian switched to branding their modified version of Firefox Iceweasel but in switched back to Firefox along with other Mozilla software GNU IceCat is another derived version of Firefox distributed by the GNU Project which maintains its separate branding br br br Branding and visual identity br br The Firefox icon is a trademark used to designate the official Mozilla build of the Firefox software and builds of official distribution partners For this reason software distributors who distribute modified versions of Firefox do not use the icon br Early Firebird and Phoenix releases of Firefox were considered to have reasonable visual designs but fell short when compared to many other professional software packages In October professional interface designer Steven Garrity authored an article covering everything he considered to be wrong with Mozilla s visual identity br Shortly afterwards the Mozilla Foundation invited Garrity to head up the new visual identity team The release of Firefox in February saw the introduction of the new branding efforts Included were new icon designs by silverorange a group of web developers with a long standing relationship with Mozilla The final renderings are by Jon Hicks who had worked on Camino The logo was later revised and updated fixing several flaws found when it was enlarged The animal shown in the logo is a stylized fox although firefox is usually a common name for the red panda The panda according to Hicks didn t really conjure up the right imagery and was not widely known br In June Mozilla unveiled a revised Firefox logo which was officially implemented on version The new logo is part of an effort to build a brand system around Firefox and its complementary apps and services which are now being promoted as a suite under the Firefox brand br br Logo history br br br br br br br br br br

availability This was followed by a series of aggressive marketing campaigns starting in with a series of events Blake Ross and Asa Dotzler called marketing weeks br Firefox continued to heavily market itself by releasing a marketing portal dubbed Spread Firefox SFX on September It debuted along with the Firefox Preview Release creating a centralized space for the discussion of various marketing techniques The release of their manifesto stated that the Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness innovation and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet A two page ad in the edition of December of The New York Times placed by Mozilla Foundation in coordination with Spread Firefox featured the names of the thousands of people worldwide who contributed to the Mozilla Foundation s fundraising campaign to support the launch of the Firefox web browser SFX portal enhanced the Get Firefox button program giving users referrer points as an incentive The site lists the top referrers From time to time the SFX team or SFX members launch marketing events organized at the Spread Firefox website As a part of the Spread Firefox campaign there was an attempt to break the world download record with the release of Firefox This resulted in an official certified Guinness world record with over eight million downloads In February Mozilla announced that it would be retiring Spread Firefox SFX Three months later in May Mozilla officially closed Spread Firefox Mozilla wrote that there are currently plans to create a new iteration of this website Spread Firefox at a later date br In celebration of the third anniversary of the founding of the Mozilla Foundation the World Firefox Day campaign was established on July and ran until September Participants registered themselves and a friend on the website for nomination to have their names displayed on the Firefox Friends Wall a digital wall that was displayed at the headquarters of the Mozilla Foundation br The Firefox community has also engaged in the promotion of their web browser In some of Firefox s contributors from Oregon State University made a crop circle of the Firefox logo in an oat field near Amity Oregon near the intersection of Lafayette Highway and Walnut Hill Road After Firefox reached million downloads on February the Firefox community celebrated by visiting Freerice to earn million grains of rice br Other initiatives included Live Chat a service Mozilla launched in that allowed users to seek technical support from volunteers The service was later retired br To promote the launch of Firefox Quantum in November Mozilla partnered with Reggie Watts to produce a series of TV ads and social media content br br br Performance br br br s br In December Internet Week ran an article in which many readers reported high memory usage in Firefox Mozilla developers said that the higher memory use of Firefox was at least partially due to the new fast backwards and forwards FastBack feature Other known causes of memory problems were malfunctioning extensions such as Google Toolbar and some older versions of AdBlock or plug ins such as older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader When PC Magazine in compared memory usage of Firefox Opera and Internet Explorer they found that Firefox used approximately as much memory as each of the other two browsers br In Softpedia noted that Firefox took longer to start up than other browsers which was confirmed by further speed tests br Internet Explorer launched more swiftly than Firefox on Windows XP since many of its components were built into the OS and loaded during system startup As a workaround for the issue a preloader application was created that loaded components of Firefox on startup similar to Internet Explorer A Windows Vista feature called SuperFetch performs a similar task of preloading Firefox if it is used often enough br Tests performed by PC World and Zimbra in indicated that Firefox used less memory than Internet Explorer Firefox used less memory than Internet Explorer Opera Beta Safari Beta and Firefox in tests performed by Mozilla CyberNet and The Browser World In mid BetaNews benchmarked Firefox and declared that it performed nearly ten times better on XP than Microsoft Internet Explorer br br br s br In January Lifehacker compared the performance of Firefox Firefox Google Chrome stable and Dev versions Safari and Opera stable and pre alpha versions Lifehacker timed how long browsers took to start and reach a page both right after boot up and after running at least once already timed how long browsers took to load nine tabs at once tested JavaScript speeds using Mozilla s Dromaeo online suite which implements Apple s SunSpider and Google s V tests and measured memory usage using Windows s process manager They concluded that Firefox and were the fifth and sixth fastest browsers respectively on startup was third and was sixth fastest to load nine tabs at once was sixth and was fifth fastest on the JavaScript tests They also concluded that Firefox was the most efficient with memory usage followed by Firefox br In February Tom s Hardware performance tested Chrome Firefox Internet Explorer Opera and Safari on Windows Tom s Hardware summarized their tests into four categories Performance Efficiency Reliability and Conformance In the performance category they tested HTML Java JavaScript DOM CSS Flash Silverlight and WebGL WebGL is current as of version and Java and Silverlight stop working as of version they also tested startup time and page load time The performance tests showed that Firefox was either acceptable or strong in most categories winning three categories HTML HTML hardware acceleration and Java only finishing weak in CSS performance In the efficiency tests Tom s Hardware tested memory usage and management In this category it determined that Firefox was only acceptable at performing light memory usage while it was strong at performing heavy memory usage In the reliability category Firefox performed a strong amount of proper page loads In the final category conformance it was determined that Firefox had strong conformance for JavaScript and HTML In conclusion Tom s Hardware determined that Firefox was the best browser for Windows OS but that it only narrowly beat Google Chrome br In June Tom s Hardware again performance tested Firefox Chrome Opera and Internet Explorer They found that Firefox slightly edged out the other browsers in their performance index which examined wait times JavaScript execution speed HTML CSS rendering and hardware acceleration performance Firefox also scored the highest on the non performance index which measured memory efficiency reliability security and standards conformance finishing ahead of Chrome the runner up Tom s Hardware concluded by declaring Firefox the sound winner of the performance benchmarks br In January a benchmark testing the memory usage of Firefox Google Chrome and Internet Explorer indicated that Firefox used the least memory when a substantial number of tabs were open br In benchmark testing in early on a high end Windows machine comparing Microsoft Edge Internet Explorer Firefox Chrome and Opera Firefox achieved the highest score on three of the seven tests Four different JavaScript performance tests gave conflicting results Firefox surpassed all other browsers on the Peacekeeper benchmark but was behind the Microsoft products when tested with SunSpider Measured with Mozilla s Kraken it came second place to Chrome while on Google s Octane challenge it took third behind Chrome and Opera Firefox took the lead with WebXPRT which runs several typical HTML and JavaScript tasks Firefox Chrome and Opera all achieved the highest possible score on the Oort Online test measuring WebGL rendering speed WebGL is now current In terms of HTML compatibility testing Firefox was ranked in the middle of the group br A similar set of benchmark tests in showed Firefox s JavaScript performance on Kraken and the newer Jetstream tests trailing slightly behind all other tested browsers except Internet Explorer IE which performed relatively poorly On Octane Firefox came ahead of IE and Safari but again slightly behind the rest including Vivaldi and Microsoft Edge Edge took overall first place on the
