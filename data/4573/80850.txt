XML RPC is a remote procedure call RPC protocol which uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism br br br History br The XML RPC protocol was created in by Dave Winer of UserLand Software and Microsoft with Microsoft seeing the protocol as an essential part of scaling up its efforts in business to business e commerce As new functionality was introduced the standard evolved into what is now SOAP br UserLand supported XML RPC from version of its Frontier web content management system released in June br XML RPC s idea of a human readable and writable script parsable standard for HTTP based requests and responses has also been implemented in competing specifications such as Allaire s Web Distributed Data Exchange WDDX and webMethod s Web Interface Definition Language WIDL Prior art wrapping COM CORBA and Java RMI objects in XML syntax and transporting them via HTTP also existed in DataChannel s WebBroker technology br The generic use of XML for remote procedure call RPC was patented by Phillip Merrick Stewart Allen and Joseph Lapp in April claiming benefit to a provisional application filed in March The patent was assigned to webMethods located in Fairfax Virginia The patent expired on March br br br Usage br In XML RPC a client performs an RPC by sending an HTTP request to a server that implements XML RPC and receives the HTTP response A call can have multiple parameters and one result The protocol defines a few data types for the parameters and result Some of these data types are complex i e nested For example you can have a parameter that is an array of five integers br The parameters result structure and the set of data types are meant to mirror those used in common programming languages br Identification of clients for authorization purposes can be achieved using popular HTTP security methods Basic access authentication can be used for identification and authentication br In comparison to RESTful protocols where resource representations documents are transferred XML RPC is designed to call methods The practical difference is just that XML RPC is much more structured which means common library code can be used to implement clients and servers and there is less design and documentation work for a specific application protocol One salient technical difference between typical RESTful protocols and XML RPC is that many RESTful protocols use the HTTP URI for parameter information whereas with XML RPC the URI just identifies the server br JSON RPC is similar to XML RPC br br br Data types br Common datatypes are converted into their XML equivalents with example values shown below br br br Examples br An example of a typical XML RPC request would be br br An example of a typical XML RPC response would be br br A typical XML RPC fault would be br br br Criticism br Recent critics from and onwards of XML RPC argue that RPC calls can be made with plain XML and that XML RPC does not add any value over XML Both XML RPC and XML require an application level data model such as which field names are defined in the XML schema or the parameter names in XML RPC Furthermore XML RPC uses about times the number of bytes compared to plain XML to encode the same objects which is itself verbose compared to JSON br br br See also br Weblogs com br Pingback br Ajax programming br Component technologies br Comparison of data serialization formats br OPML br JSON RPC br Web service br gRPC br br br br br br External links br Official website
