title: Open-core model
id: 30296792
The open core model is a business model for the monetization of commercially produced open source software The open core model primarily involves offering a core or feature limited version of a software product as free and open source software while offering commercial versions or add ons as proprietary software The term was coined by Andrew Lampitt in br The concept of open core software has proven to be controversial as many developers do not consider the business model to be true open source software Despite this open core models are used by many open source software companies br br br Use of contributor license agreements br Some open core products require their contributors to sign a contributor license agreement which either dictates that the copyright of all contributions to the product become the property of its owner or that the product s owner is given an unlimited non exclusive license to use the contributions but the authors retain copyright ownership In an open core scenario these agreements are typically meant to allow the commercial owner of the product which in some cases is ultimately the copyright holder to all of its code regardless of its original author to simultaneously market versions of the product under open source and non free licenses This is in contrast with more traditional uses of CLAs which are meant solely to allow the steward of an open source project to defend and protect the copyrights of its contributors or to guarantee that the code will only ever be made available under open source terms thus protecting it from becoming open core br br br Examples br Kafka a data streaming service under the Apache license is the open source core to the company Confluent which issues a Confluent Community License a source available license that governs additional features in the Confluent Platform br Cassandra an open source database under the Apache license is the core to the company Datastax which issues enterprise subscription license for additional management and security features inside DataStax Enterprise br Instructure s Canvas learning management software br Oracle s MySQL database software is dual licensed under a proprietary license and the GNU General Public License GPL proprietary versions offer additional features and enterprise support plans br Oracle VM VirtualBox is GNU GPL licensed but some features such as encryption and remote display require Oracle s closed source Extension Pack br Elastic s core which includes Elasticsearch Kibana Logstash and Beats was under an Apache license while additional plugins are distributed under Elastic s own proprietary license In January Elastic re licensed its software under the non free Server Side Public License and Elastic License which restrict use of the software as part of managed services and circumvention of software locks on premium features This means it is no longer open core but source available software br Eucalyptus private cloud software has a proprietary enterprise edition which provides additional features br IntelliJ IDEA CE Community Edition is licensed under the Apache License while IDEA Ultimate Edition is trialware br GitLab CE Community Edition is under an MIT style open source license while GitLab EE Enterprise Edition is under a commercial license br Neo j CE Community Edition is licensed under GPL version while Neo j EE Enterprise Edition is under a commercial license providing additional features including clustering and hot backups br Seldon Core a machine learning platform under the Apache license is the core to the company Seldon which provides Seldon Deploy under a commercial license br Redis was under a clause BSD open source license while Redis Labs offers Redis Modules under a Source available software license and Redis Enterprise under a commercial license which provides additional enterprise features such as on the fly scaling replication performance tuning and clustering support for Redis Modules In March Redis Labs re licensed Redis under Redis Source Available License and Server Side Public License both of which are non free br br br Restrictions on use in services br A new variation of the practice emerged in among several open core products intended for server side use seeking to control use of the product as part of a service offered to a customer These practices in particular target incorporation of the software into proprietary services by cloud application service providers such as Amazon Web Services but with what vendors perceive to be inadequate compensation or contributions back to the upstream software in return br MongoDB changed its license from the GNU Affero General Public License a variation of the GPL which requires that the software s source code be offered to those who use it over a network to a modified version titled the Server Side Public License SSPL where the source code of the entire service including without limitation all code needed for another user to run an instance of the service themselves must be released under the SSPL if it incorporates an SSPL licensed component unlike the AGPL where this provision only applies to the copyrighted work that is licensed under the AGPL Bruce Perens co author of The Open Source Definition argued that the SSPL violated its requirement for an open source license to not place restrictions on software distributed alongside the licensed software The Open Source Initiative OSI ruled that the SSPL violates the Open Source Definition and is therefore not a free software license as the provision discriminates against commercial users Debian Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux pulled MongoDB from their distributions after the license change considering the new license to be in violation of their licensing policies br Redis Labs made its Redis plugins subject to the Commons Clause a restriction on sale of the software on top of the existing Apache License terms After criticism this was changed in to the Redis Source Available License a non free license which forbids sale of the software as part of a database a caching engine a stream processing engine a search engine an indexing engine or an ML DL AI serving engine The last versions of the modules licensed solely under the Apache License were forked and are maintained by community members under the GoodFORM project A similar move was made when HashiCorp switched to the non free Business Source License BSL on its products including Terraform which received the Linux Foundation backed fork
