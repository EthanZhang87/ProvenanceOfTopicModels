Mozilla Prism formerly WebRunner is a discontinued project which integrated web applications with the desktop allowing web applications to be launched from the desktop and configured independently of the default web browser As of November Prism is listed as an inactive project at the Mozilla labs website br Prism is based on a concept called a site specific browser SSB An SSB is designed to work exclusively with one web application It does not have the menus toolbars and other parts of a traditional web browser br The software is built upon XULRunner so it is possible to get some Mozilla Firefox extensions to work in it br The preview announcement of Prism was made in October br On February Mozilla Labs announced it would no longer maintain Prism its ideas having been subsumed into a newer project called Chromeless However the Mozilla Labs mailing list revealed that Chromeless is not in fact a replacement for Prism and there is currently no Mozilla replacement for the out of the box site specific browser functionality of Prism Chromeless instead being a platform for developers rather than users For a while Prism continued to be maintained under the original name of WebRunner which then also was discontinued in September br br br See also br br Chromium Embedded Framework br Site specific browser br Rich Internet application br Fluid web browser br br br br br br External links br Official website via Internet Archive br Project page on Mozilla Labs
