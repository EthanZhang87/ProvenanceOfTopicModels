OpenOffice br A detailed page report in June compared the progress of the LibreOffice project with the related project Apache OpenOffice It showed that OpenOffice received about of the improvements LibreOffice did in the period of time studied br br br Supported file formats br As its native file format to save documents for all of its applications LibreOffice uses the Open Document Format for Office Applications ODF or OpenDocument an international standard developed jointly by the International Organization for Standardization ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC LibreOffice also supports the file formats of most other major office suites including Microsoft Office through a variety of import and export filters br br br br Miscellaneous features br LibreOffice can use the GStreamer multimedia framework in Linux to render multimedia content such as videos in Impress and other programs br Visually LibreOffice used the large Tango style icons that are used for the application shortcuts quick launch icons icons for associated files and for the icons found on the toolbar of the LibreOffice programs in the past and used on the toolbars and menus by default They were later replaced by multiple icon themes to adapt the look and feel of specific desktop environment such as Colibre for Windows and Elementary for GNOME br LibreOffice also ships with a modified theme which looks native on GTK based Linux distributions It also renders fonts via Cairo on Linux distributions this means that text in LibreOffice is rendered the same as the rest of the Linux desktop br With version LibreOffice includes a ribbon style GUI called Notebookbar including three different views br This feature has formerly been included as an experimental feature in LibreOffice experimental features must be enabled from LibreOffice settings to make the option available in the View menu br LibreOffice has a feature similar to WordArt called Fontwork br LibreOffice uses HarfBuzz for complex text layout it was first introduced in for Linux and for Windows and macOS Fonts with OpenType Apple Advanced Typography or SIL Graphite features can be switched by either a syntax in the Font Name input box or the Font Features dialog from the Character dialog br LibreOffice supports a hybrid PDF format a file in Portable Document Format PDF which can be read by any program supporting PDF but also contains the source document in ODF format editable in LibreOffice by dragging and dropping br br br Licensing br The LibreOffice project uses a dual LGPLv or later MPL license for new contributions to allow the license to be upgraded Since the core of the OpenOffice org codebase was donated to the Apache Software Foundation there is an ongoing effort to get all the code rebased to ease future license updates br br br Scripting and extensions br LibreOffice supports third party extensions As of July the LibreOffice Extension Repository lists more than extensions Another list is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation and another one by the Free Software Foundation Extensions and scripts for LibreOffice can be written in C Java CLI Python and LibreOffice Basic Interpreters for the latter two are bundled with most LibreOffice installers so no additional installation is needed The application programming interface for LibreOffice is called UNO and is extensively documented br br br LibreOffice Basic br LibreOffice Basic is a programming language similar to Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications VBA but based on StarOffice Basic It is available in Writer Calc and Base It is used to write small programs known as macros with each macro performing a different task such as counting the words in a paragraph br br br History br br br ooo build Go oo and Oracle br Members of the OpenOffice org community who were not Sun Microsystems employees had wanted a more egalitarian form for the OpenOffice org project for many years Sun had stated in the original OpenOffice org announcement in that the project would eventually be run by a neutral foundation and put forward a more detailed proposal in br Ximian and then Novell had maintained the ooo build patch set a project led by Michael Meeks to make the build easier on Linux and because it was difficult to get contributions accepted by Sun even from corporate partners It tracked the main line of development and was not intended to constitute a fork It was also the standard build mechanism for OpenOffice org in most Linux distributions and was contributed to by said distributions br In ooo build was made available by Novell as a software package called Go oo ooo build had used the go oo org domain name as early as which included many features not included in upstream OpenOffice org Go oo also encouraged outside contributions with rules similar to those later adopted for LibreOffice br Sun s contributions to OpenOffice org had been declining for some time They remained reluctant to accept contributions and contributors were upset at Sun releasing OpenOffice org code to IBM for IBM Lotus Symphony under a proprietary contract rather than under an open source licence br Sun was purchased by Oracle Corporation in early OpenOffice org community members were concerned by Oracle s behaviour towards open source software specifically the Java lawsuit against Google and Oracle s withdrawal of developers and lack of activity on or visible commitment to OpenOffice org as had been noted by industry observers as Meeks put it in early September The news from the Oracle OpenOffice conference was that there was no news Discussion of a fork started soon after br br br The Document Foundation and LibreOffice br On September The Document Foundation was announced as the host of LibreOffice a new derivative of OpenOffice org The Document Foundation s initial announcement stated their concerns that Oracle would either discontinue OpenOffice org or place restrictions on it as an open source project as it had on Sun s OpenSolaris br LibreOffice beta used the ooo build build infrastructure and the OpenOffice org beta code from Oracle then adding selected patches from Go oo Go oo was discontinued in favour of LibreOffice Since the office suite that was branded OpenOffice org in most Linux distributions was in fact Go oo most moved immediately to LibreOffice br Oracle was invited to become a member of The Document Foundation However Oracle demanded that all members of the OpenOffice org Community Council involved with The Document Foundation step down from the OOo Community Council claiming a conflict of interest br br br Naming br The name LibreOffice was picked after research in trademark databases and social media and checks to ensure it could be used for URLs in various countries Oracle rejected requests to donate the OpenOffice org brand to the project br LibreOffice was initially named BrOffice in Brazil OpenOffice org had been distributed as BrOffice org by the BrOffice Centre of Excellence for Free Software because of a trademark issue br br br End of OpenOffice org and beginning of Apache OpenOffice br Oracle announced in April that it was ending its development of OpenOffice org and would lay off the majority of its paid developers In June Oracle announced that it would donate the OpenOffice org code and trademark to the Apache Software Foundation where the project was accepted for a project incubation process within the foundation thus becoming Apache OpenOffice In an interview with LWN in May Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth blamed The Document Foundation for destroying OpenOffice org because it did not license its code under Oracle s Contributor License Agreement In opposition to Shuttleworth s view the former Sun executive Simon Phipps argued in the interview for the same online magazine that the lay off was an inevitable business decision by Oracle not impacted by existence of LibreOffice br In March an LWN net comparison of LibreOffice with its cousin project Apache OpenOffice concluded that LibreOffice has won the battle for developer participation br br br Release history br br br Mascot competition br In late The Document Foundation held a competition for the new mascot of LibreOffice The mascot was to be used primarily by the community and was not intended to supersede existing logos for the project Over concepts were submitted before the first evaluation phase br The mascot contest was cancelled soon after new submissions stopped being accepted The Document Foundation cited their lack of clear rules and arguments among community members as their reasoning for cancelling the contest br br br Versions br Since March and version two different major released versions of LibreOffice are available at any time in addition to development versions numbered release candidates and dated nightly builds The versions are designated to signal their appropriateness for differing user requirements Releases are designated by three numbers separated by dots The first two numbers represent the major version branch number and the final number indicates the bugfix releases made in that series LibreOffice designates the two release versions as br br Fresh the most recent major version branch which contains the latest enhancements but which may have introduced bugs not present in the still release br Still formerly Stable the prior major version which by the time it has become the still version has had around six months of bug fixing It is recommended for users for whom stability is more important than the latest enhancements br Since January and version LibreOffice use calendar based release numbering scheme br br br Release schedule br LibreOffice uses a time based release schedule for predictability rather than a when it s ready schedule New major versions are released around every six months in January or February and July or August of each year The initial intention was to release in March and September to align with the schedule of other free software projects br Minor bugfix versions of the fresh and still release branches are released frequently br br br Enterprise support br Commercially supported distributions for LibreOffice with service level agreements are available via partners such as Collabora marketed as Collabora Office and Collabora Online CIB marketed as CIB Office on the Microsoft Store and Red Hat The three vendors are major corporate contributors to the LibreOffice project br As of version the open source release of LibreOffice is officially branded as LibreOffice Community in order to emphasize that the releases are intended primarily for personal individual use and are not targeted at enterprises and not optimized for their support needs The Document Foundation states that usage of the community versions in such settings has had a two fold negative consequence for the project a poor use of volunteers time as they have to spend their time to solve problems for business that provide nothing in return to the community and a net loss for ecosystem companies br br br Users and deployments br br The figure shows the worldwide number of LibreOffice users from to in millions References are in the text br br br The Document Foundation estimated in September that there were million users worldwide who had obtained LibreOffice via downloads or CD ROMs Over of those were on Windows with another on OS X LibreOffice is the default office suite for most Linux distributions and is installed when the operating system is installed or updated Based on International Data Corporation reckonings for new or updated Linux installations in The Document Foundation estimated a subtotal of million Linux users This gave a total estimated user base of million users in In the Document Foundation set a target of million users worldwide before the end of br br In September after two years the estimated number of LibreOffice users was million A million new unique IP addresses check for downloads each week br br In LibreOffice was used by million users and governments br br In August the number of LibreOffice users was estimated at million br br The Document Foundation estimated in that there are million active LibreOffice users worldwide About of them are students and Linux users who often
