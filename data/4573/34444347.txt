Mozilla Persona was a decentralized authentication system for the web based on the open BrowserID protocol prototyped by Mozilla and standardized by IETF It was launched in July but after failing to achieve traction Mozilla announced in January plans to decommission the service by the end of the year br br br History and motivations br Persona was launched in July and shared some of its goals with some similar authentication systems like OpenID or Facebook Connect but it was different in several ways br br It used email addresses as identifiers br It was more focused on privacy br It was intended to be fully integrated in the browser relying heavily on Javascript br The privacy goal was motivated by the fact that the identity provider does not know which website the user is identifying on It was first released in July and fully deployed by Mozilla on its own websites in January br In March Mozilla indicated it was dropping full time developers from Persona and moving the project to community ownership Mozilla indicated however that it had no plans to decommission Persona and would maintain some level of involvement such as in maintenance and reviewing pull requests br Persona services are shut down since November br br br Principles and implementation br Persona was inspired by the VerifiedEmailProtocol which is now known as the BrowserID protocol It uses any user email address to identify its owner This protocol involves the browser an identity provider and any compliant website br br br The browser the provider and the website br The browser stores a list of user verified email addresses certificates issued by the identity providers and demonstrates the user s ownership of the addresses to the website using cryptographic proof br The certificates must be renewed every hours by logging into the identity provider which will usually mean entering the email and a password in a Web form on the identity provider s site Once done they will be usable for authenticating to websites with the same browser for the rest of the day without entering passwords again single sign on br The decentralization aspects of the protocol reside in the theoretical support of any identity provider service while in practice it seems to rely mainly on Mozilla s servers currently which may in turn delegate email address verification see identity bridging below However even if the protocol heavily relies on a central identity provider this central actor only knows when browsers renew certificates and cannot in principle monitor where the certificates will be used br br br Identity bridging br Mozilla announced identity bridging support for Persona in July As they describe on their blog Traditionally Mozilla would send you an email and ask you to click on the confirmation link it contained With Identity Bridging Persona learned a new trick instead of sending confirmation emails Persona can ask you to verify your identity via your email provider s existing OpenID or OAuth gateway br This announcement included support for existing users of the Yahoo Mail service In August Mozilla announced support for Identity Bridging with all Gmail accounts They wrote in this additional announcement that combined with our Identity Bridge for Yahoo Persona now natively supports more than active email users That covers roughly of people on most North American websites br br br Deployment br Persona relies heavily on the JavaScript client side program running in the user s browser making it widely usable br Support of authentication to Web applications via Persona can be implemented by CMSs such as Drupal Serendipity WordPress Tiki or SPIP There is also support for Persona in the Phonegap platform used for compiling HTML apps into mobile apps Mozilla provides its own Persona server at persona org It is also possible to set up your own Persona identity provider providing federated identity br Notable sites implementing Persona include Ting The Times Crossword and Voost br br br See also br Learning materials related to Mozilla Persona at Wikiversity JavaScript login br OpenID br WebID a set of proposed standards for identity identification and authentication on HTTP based networks br br br
