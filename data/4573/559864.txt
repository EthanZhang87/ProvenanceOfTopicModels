BioPerl is a collection of Perl modules that facilitate the development of Perl scripts for bioinformatics applications It has played an integral role in the Human Genome Project br br br Background br BioPerl is an active open source software project supported by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation The first set of Perl codes of BioPerl was created by Tim Hubbard and Jong Bhak at MRC Centre Cambridge where the first genome sequencing was carried out by Fred Sanger MRC Centre was one of the hubs and birthplaces of modern bioinformatics as it had a large quantity of DNA sequences and D protein structures Hubbard was using the th lib pl Perl library which contained many useful Perl subroutines for bioinformatics Bhak Hubbard s first PhD student created jong lib pl Bhak merged the two Perl subroutine libraries into Bio pl The name BioPerl was coined jointly by Bhak and Steven Brenner at the Centre for Protein Engineering CPE In Brenner organized a BioPerl session at the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference held in Cambridge BioPerl had some users in coming months including Georg Fuellen who organized a training course in Germany Fuellen s colleagues and students greatly extended BioPerl this was further expanded by others including Steve Chervitz who was actively developing Perl codes for his yeast genome database The major expansion came when Cambridge student Ewan Birney joined the development team br The first stable release was on June the most recent stable in terms of API release is from September There are also developer releases produced periodically Version series x is considered to be the most stable in terms of bugs version of BioPerl and is recommended for everyday use br In order to take advantage of BioPerl the user needs a basic understanding of the Perl programming language including an understanding of how to use Perl references modules objects and methods br br br Features and examples br BioPerl provides software modules for many of the typical tasks of bioinformatics programming These include br br Accessing nucleotide and peptide sequence data from local and remote databases br Example of accessing GenBank to retrieve a sequence br br Transforming formats of database file records br Example code for transforming formats br br Manipulating individual sequences br Example of gathering statistics for a given sequence br br Searching for similar sequences br Creating and manipulating sequence alignments br Searching for genes and other structures on genomic DNA br Developing machine readable sequence annotations br br br Usage br In addition to being used directly by end users BioPerl has also provided the base for a wide variety of bioinformatic tools including amongst others br br SynBrowse br GeneComber br TFBS br MIMOX br BioParser br Degenerate primer design br Querying the public databases br Current Comparative Table br New tools and algorithms from external developers are often integrated directly into BioPerl itself br br Dealing with phylogenetic trees and nested taxa br FPC Web tools br br br Advantages br BioPerl was one of the first biological module repositories that increased its usability It has very easy to install modules along with a flexible global repository BioPerl uses good test modules for a large variety of processes br br br Disadvantages br There are many ways to use BioPerl from simple scripting to very complex object programming This makes the language not clear and sometimes hard to understand For as many modules that BioPerl has some do not always work the way they are intended br br br Related libraries in other programming languages br Several related bioinformatics libraries implemented in other programming languages exist as part of the Open Bioinformatics Foundation including br br Biopython br BioJava br BioRuby br BioPHP br BioJS br Bioconductor br br br
