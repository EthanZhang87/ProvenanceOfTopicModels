Bugzilla is a web based general purpose bug tracking system and testing tool originally developed and used by the Mozilla project and licensed under the Mozilla Public License br Released as open source software by Netscape Communications in it has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system for both free and open source software and proprietary projects and products Bugzilla is used among others by the Mozilla Foundation WebKit Linux kernel FreeBSD KDE Apache Eclipse and LibreOffice Red Hat uses it but is gradually migrating its product to use Jira It is also self hosting br br br History br Bugzilla was originally devised by Terry Weissman in for the nascent Mozilla org project as an open source application to replace the in house system then in use at Netscape Communications for tracking defects in the Netscape Communicator suite Bugzilla was originally written in Tcl but Weissman decided to port it to Perl before its release as part of Netscape s early open source code drops in the hope that more people would be able to contribute to it given that Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time br Bugzilla was the result of that port to Perl and the first version was released to the public via anonymous CVS In April Weissman handed over control of the Bugzilla project to Tara Hernandez Under her leadership some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility and Bugzilla development became more community driven In July facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape Hernandez handed control to Dave Miller who was still in charge as of br Bugzilla was released on May and brought a refreshed UI an XML RPC interface custom fields and resolutions mod perl support shared saved searches and improved UTF support along with other changes br Bugzilla was released on February and Bugzilla was released in July br br br Timeline br Bugzilla s release timeline br br br Requirements br Bugzilla s system requirements include br br A compatible database management system br A suitable release of Perl br An assortment of Perl modules br A compatible web server br A suitable mail transfer agent or any SMTP server br Currently supported database systems are MariaDB MySQL PostgreSQL Oracle and SQLite Bugzilla is usually installed on Linux using the Apache HTTP Server but any web server that supports CGI such as Lighttpd Hiawatha Cherokee can be used Bugzilla s installation process is command line driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked br br br Design br br While the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a technical support ticket system task management tool or project management tool Bugzilla s developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects br br br Zarro Boogs br Bugzilla returns the string zarro boogs found instead of bugs found when a search for bugs returns no results Zarro Boogs is intended as a buggy statement itself a misspelling of zero bugs and is thus a meta statement about the nature of software debugging implying that even when no bugs have been identified some may exist br The following comment is provided in the Bugzilla source code to developers who may be confused by this behaviour br br Zarro Boogs Found br This is just a goofy way of saying that there were no bugs found matching your query When asked to explain this message Terry Weissman had the following to say br I ve been asked to explain this way back when when Netscape released version of its browser we had a release party Naturally there had been a big push to try and fix every known bug before the release Naturally that hadn t actually happened This is not unique to Netscape or to the same thing has happened with every software project I ve ever seen Anyway at the release party T shirts were handed out that said something like Netscape Zarro Boogs Just like the software the T shirt had no known bugs Uh huh So when you query for a list of bugs and it gets no results you can think of this as a friendly reminder Of course there are bugs matching your query they just aren t in the bugsystem yet br Terry Weissman br From The Bugzilla Guide Release Glossary br br br WONTFIX br WONTFIX is used as a label on issues in Bugzilla and other systems It indicates that a verified issue will not be addressed for one of several possible reasons including fixing would be too expensive complicated or risky br br br See also br br Comparison of issue tracking systems br List of computing mascots br Category Computing mascots br br br br br br External links br br Official website
