GNU IceCat formerly known as GNU IceWeasel is a completely free version of the Mozilla Firefox web browser distributed by the GNU Project It is compatible with Linux Windows Android and macOS br IceCat is released as a part of GNUzilla GNU s rebranding of a code base that used to be the Mozilla Application Suite As an internet suite GNUzilla also includes a mail and newsgroup program and an HTML composer br Mozilla produces free and open source software but the binaries include trademarked artwork The GNU Project attempts to keep IceCat in synchronization with upstream development of Firefox long term support versions while removing all trademarked artwork and non free add ons It also maintains a large list of free software plugins In addition it includes several security and privacy features not found in the mainline Firefox browser br br br History br br br Origins of the name br The Mozilla Corporation holds the trademark to the Firefox name and denies the use of the name Firefox to unofficial builds that fall outside certain guidelines Unless distributions use the binary files supplied by Mozilla fall within the stated guidelines or else have special permission they must compile the Firefox source with a compile time option enabled that creates binaries without the official branding of Firefox and related artwork using either the built in free artwork or artwork provided at compile time br This policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in and During this debate the name Iceweasel was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode in reply to Eric Dorland s suggestion of Icerabbit It was intended as a parody of Firefox Iceweasel was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox By January rebranding was being referred to as the Iceweasel route br In August the GNUzilla project adopted the GNU IceWeasel name for a rebranded distribution of Firefox that made no references to nonfree plugins br The term ice weasel appeared earlier in a line which cartoonist Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over pinning you underneath At night the ice weasels come br Debian was originally given permission to use the trademarks and adopted the Firefox name However because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license at the time which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines the substituted logo had to remain In Mozilla withdrew their permission for Debian to use the Firefox name due to significant changes to the browser that Mozilla deemed outside the boundaries of its policy changes which Debian felt were important enough to keep and Debian revived the Iceweasel name in its place br Subsequently on September one of the developers of the GNU IceWeasel package announced that the name would be changed to GNU IceCat from IceWeasel in the next release so as to avoid confusion with Debian s separately maintained unrelated rebranding of Firefox The name change took place as planned and IceCat is the current name br IceCat was ported to the Firefox codebase during Google Summer of Code of br br br Distribution br GNU IceCat is freely downloadable as source code from the GNU project br Some Linux Distributions offer binary and source packages through their repositories such as Trisquel Parabola GNU Linux libre and Fedora br As of GNU IceCat is distributed for Windows macOS and GNU Linux br GNU IceCat is available for macOS and higher br br br Additional security and privacy features br IceCat includes additional security features such as the option to block third party zero length image files resulting in third party cookies also known as web bugs This feature is available in Firefox and but the UI option was absent on GNU IceCat also provides warnings for URL redirection br In version g the certificate of a certificate authority CAcert org has been added to the list of trusted root certificates Concern about that decision has been raised in a discussion on the savannah hackers public mailing list br The GNU LibreJS extension detects and blocks non free non trivial JavaScript br IceCat also has functionality to set a different user agent string each for different domains in about config For example setting a mobile user agent string for a desired DNS domain would make it possible to view the mobile version of a website on a desktop operating system br br br Licensing br Gnuzilla is available under the MPL GPL LGPL tri license that Mozilla used for
