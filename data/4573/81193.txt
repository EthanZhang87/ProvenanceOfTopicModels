title: Cross-platform software
id: 81193
In computing cross platform software also called multi platform software platform agnostic software or platform independent software is computer software that is designed to work in several computing platforms Some cross platform software requires a separate build for each platform but some can be directly run on any platform without special preparation being written in an interpreted language or compiled to portable bytecode for which the interpreters or run time packages are common or standard components of all supported platforms br For example a cross platform application may run on Linux macOS and Microsoft Windows Cross platform software may run on many platforms or as few as two Some frameworks for cross platform development are Codename One ArkUI X Kivy Qt GTK Flutter NativeScript Xamarin Apache Cordova Ionic and React Native br br Platform can refer to the type of processor CPU or other hardware on which an operating system OS or application runs the type of OS or a combination of the two An example of a common platform is Android which runs on the ARM architecture family Other well known platforms are Linux Unix macOS and Windows these are all cross platform Applications can be written to depend on the features of a particular platform either the hardware OS or virtual machine VM it runs on For example the Java platform is a common VM platform which runs on many OSs and hardware types br br A hardware platform can refer to an instruction set architecture For example ARM or the x architecture These machines can run different operating systems br Smartphones and tablets generally run ARM architecture these often run Android or iOS and other mobile operating systems br br A software platform can be either an operating system OS or programming environment though more commonly it is a combination of both An exception is Java which uses an OS independent virtual machine VM to execute Java bytecode Some software platforms are br br Android ARM br ChromeOS ARM ARM IA x br Common Language Infrastructure CLI by Microsoft implemented in br The legacy NET Framework that works only on Microsoft Windows br The newer NET framework simply called NET that works across Microsoft Windows macOS and Linux br Other implementations such as Mono formerly by Novell and Xamarin br HarmonyOS ARM RISC V x x and LoongArch br iOS ARMv A br iPadOS ARMv A br

br Xbox br Minor historical br AmigaOS m k AmigaOS PowerPC AROS x PowerPC m k MorphOS PowerPC br Atari TOS MiNT br BSD many platforms see NetBSDnet for example br DOS type systems on the x MS DOS PC DOS DR DOS FreeDOS br OS eComStation br br The Java language is typically compiled to run on a VM that is part of the Java platform The Java virtual machine Java VM JVM is a CPU implemented in software which runs all Java code This enables the same code to run on all systems that implement a JVM Java software can be executed by a hardware based Java processor This is used mostly in embedded systems br Java code running in the JVM has access to OS related services like disk input output I O and network access if the appropriate privileges are granted The JVM makes the system calls on behalf of the Java application This lets users to decide the appropriate protection level depending on an access control list ACL For example disk and network access is usually enabled for desktop applications but not for browser based applets The Java Native Interface JNI can also be used to access OS specific functions with a loss of portability br Currently Java Standard Edition software can run on Microsoft Windows macOS several Unix like OSs and several real time operating systems for embedded devices For mobile applications browser plugins are used for Windows and Mac based devices and Android has built in support for Java There are also subsets of Java such as Java Card or Java Platform Micro Edition designed for resource constrained devices br br For software to be considered cross platform it must function on more than one computer architecture or OS Developing such software can be a time consuming task because different OSs have different application programming interfaces API br Software written for one OS may not automatically work on all architectures that OS supports Just because software is written in a popular programming language such as C or C it does not mean it will run on all OSs that support that language or even on different versions of the same OS br br Web applications are typically described as cross platform because ideally they are accessible from any web browser the browser is the platform Web applications generally employ a client server model but vary widely in complexity and functionality It can be hard to reconcile the desire for features with the need for compatibility br Basic web applications perform all or most processing from a stateless server and pass the result to the client web browser All user interaction with the application consists of simple exchanges of data requests and server responses This type of application was the norm in the early phases of World Wide Web application development Such applications follow a simple transaction model identical to that of serving static web pages Today they are still relatively common especially where cross platform compatibility and simplicity are deemed more critical than advanced functionality br Prominent examples of advanced web applications include the Web interface to Gmail and Google Maps Such applications routinely depend on additional features found only in the more recent versions of popular web browsers These features include Ajax JavaScript Dynamic HTML SVG and other components of rich web applications br br Because of the competing interests of compatibility and functionality numerous design strategies have emerged br Many software systems use a layered architecture where platform dependent code is restricted to the upper and lowermost layers br br Graceful degradation attempts to provide the same or similar functionality to all users and platforms while diminishing that functionality to a least common denominator for more limited client browsers For example a user attempting to use a limited feature browser to access Gmail may notice that Gmail switches to basic mode with reduced functionality but still of use br br Some software is maintained in distinct codebases for different hardware and OS platforms with equivalent functionality This requires more effort to maintain the code but can be worthwhile where the amount of platform specific code is high br br This strategy relies on having one codebase that may be compiled to multiple platform specific formats One technique is conditional compilation With this technique code that is common to all platforms is not repeated Blocks of code that are only relevant to certain platforms are made conditional so that they are only interpreted or compiled when needed Another technique is separation of functionality which disables functionality not supported by browsers or OSs while still delivering a complete application to the user See also Separation of concerns This technique is used in web development where interpreted code as in scripting languages can query the platform it is running on to execute different blocks conditionally br br Third party libraries attempt to simplify cross platform capability by hiding the complexities of client differentiation behind a single unified API at the expense of vendor lock in br br Responsive web design RWD is a Web design approach aimed at crafting the visual layout of sites to provide an optimal viewing experience easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing panning and scrolling across a wide range of devices from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors Little or no platform specific code is used with this technique br br Cross platform applications need much more integration testing Some web browsers prohibit installation of different versions on the same machine There are several approaches used to target multiple platforms but all of them result in software that requires substantial manual effort for testing and maintenance Techniques such as full virtualization are sometimes used as a workaround for this problem br Tools such as the Page Object Model allow cross platform tests to be scripted so that one test case covers multiple versions of an app If different versions have similar user interfaces all can be tested with one test case br br Web applications are becoming increasingly popular but many computer users still use traditional application software which does not rely on a client web server architecture The distinction between traditional and web applications is not always clear Features installation methods and architectures for web and traditional applications overlap and blur the distinction Nevertheless this simplifying distinction is a common and useful generalization br br Traditional application software has been distributed as binary files especially executable files Executables only support platform they were built for which means that a single cross platform executable could be very bloated with code that never executes on a particular platform Instead generally there is a selection of executables each built for one platform br For software that is distributed as a binary executable such as that written in C or C there must be a software build for each platform using a toolset that translates transcompiles a single codebase into multiple binary executables For example Firefox an open source web browser is available on Windows macOS both PowerPC and x through what Apple Inc calls a Universal binary Linux and BSD on multiple computer architectures The four platforms in this case Windows macOS Linux and BSD are separate executable distributions although they come largely from the same source code In rare cases executable code built for several platforms is combined into a single executable file called a fat binary br The use of different toolsets may not be enough to build a working executables for different platforms In this case programmers must port the source code to the new platform For example an application such as Firefox which already runs on Windows on the x family can be modified and re built to run on Linux on the x and potentially other architectures as well The multiple versions of the code may be stored as separate codebases or merged into one codebase br An alternative to porting is cross platform virtualization where applications compiled for one platform can run on another without modification of the source code or binaries As an example Apple s Rosetta which is built into Intel based Macintosh computers runs applications compiled for the previous generation of Macs that used PowerPC CPUs Another example is IBM PowerVM Lx which allows Linux x applications to run unmodified on the Linux Power OS br Example of cross platform binary software br br The LibreOffice office suite is built for Microsoft Windows macOS Linux FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD Android iOS iPadOS ChromeOS web based Collabora Online and many others Many of these are supported on several hardware platforms with processor architectures including IA x ARM ARMel ARMhf ARM MIPS MIPSel PowerPC ppc le and S x br br A script can be considered to be cross platform if its interpreter is available on multiple platforms and the script only uses the facilities built into the language For example a script written in Python for a Unix like system will likely run with little or no modification on Windows because Python also runs on Windows indeed there are many implementations e g IronPython for NET Framework The same goes for many of the open source scripting languages br Unlike binary executable files the same script can be used on all computers that have software to interpret the script This is because the script is generally stored in plain text in a text file There may be some trivial issues such as the representation of a new line character br Some popular cross platform scripting languages are br br bash A Unix shell commonly run on Linux and other modern Unix like systems as well as on Windows via the Cygwin POSIX compatibility layer br Perl First released in Used for CGI programming small system administration tasks and more br PHP Mostly used for web applications br Python A language which focuses on rapid application development and ease of writing instead of run time efficiency br Ruby An object oriented language which aims to be easy to read Can also be used on the web through Ruby on Rails br Tcl A dynamic programming language suitable for a wide range of uses including web and desktop applications networking administration testing and many more br br Cross platform or multi platform is a term that can also apply to video games released on a range of video game consoles Examples of cross platform games include Miner er Tomb Raider Legend FIFA series NHL series and Minecraft br Each has been released across a variety of gaming platforms such as the Wii PlayStation Xbox personal computers and mobile devices br Some platforms are harder to write for than others requiring more time to develop the video game to the same standard To offset this a video game may be released on a few platforms first then later on others Typically this happens when a new gaming system is released because video game developers need to acquaint themselves with its hardware and software br Some games may not be cross platform because of licensing agreements between developers and video game console manufacturers that limit development to one particular console As an example Disney could create a game with the intention of release on the latest Nintendo and Sony game consoles Should Disney license the game with Sony first it may be required to release the game solely on Sony s console for a short time or indefinitely br br Several developers have implemented ways to play games online while using different platforms Psyonix Epic Games Microsoft and Valve all possess technology that allows Xbox and PlayStation gamers to play with PC gamers leaving the decision of which platform to use to consumers The first game to allow this level of interactivity between PC and console games Dreamcast with specially produced keyboard and mouse was Quake br Games that feature cross platform online play include Rocket League Final Fantasy XIV Street Fighter V Killer Instinct Paragon and Fable Fortune and Minecraft with its Better Together update on Windows VR editions Pocket Edition and Xbox One br br Cross platform programming is the practice of deliberately writing software to work on more than one platform br br There are different ways to write a cross platform application One approach is to create multiple versions of the same software in different source trees in other words the Microsoft Windows version of an application might have one set of source code files and the Macintosh version another while a FOSS nix system might have a third While this is straightforward compared to developing for only one platform it can cost much more to pay a larger team or release products more slowly It can also result in more bugs to be tracked and fixed br Another approach is to use software that hides the differences between the platforms This abstraction layer insulates the application from the platform Such applications are platform agnostic Applications that run on the JVM are built this way br Some applications mix various methods of cross platform programming to create the final application An example is the Firefox web browser which uses abstraction to build some of the lower level components with separate source subtrees for implementing platform specific features like the GUI and the implementation of more than one scripting language to ease software portability Firefox implements XUL CSS and JavaScript for extending the browser in addition to classic Netscape style browser plugins Much of the browser itself is written in XUL CSS and JavaScript br br There are many tools available to help the process of cross platform programming br br th a development language

br br Testing cross platform applications may be considerably more complicated since different platforms can exhibit slightly different behaviors or subtle bugs This problem has led some developers to deride cross platform development as write once debug everywhere a take on Sun Microsystems write once run anywhere marketing slogan br Developers are often restricted to using the lowest common denominator subset of features which are available on all platforms This may hinder the application s performance or prohibit developers from using the most advanced features of each platform br Different platforms often have different user interface conventions which cross platform applications do not always accommodate For example applications developed for macOS and GNOME are supposed to place the most important button on the right hand side of a window or dialog whereas Microsoft Windows and KDE have the opposite convention Though many of these differences are subtle a cross platform application which does not conform to these conventions may feel clunky or alien to the user When working quickly such opposing conventions may even result in data loss such as in a dialog box confirming whether to save or discard changes br Scripting languages and VM bytecode must be translated into native executable code each time they are used imposing a performance penalty This penalty can be alleviated using techniques like just in time compilation but some computational overhead may be unavoidable br Different platforms require the use of native package formats such as RPM and MSI Multi platform installers such as InstallAnywhere address this need br Cross platform execution environments may suffer cross platform security flaws creating a fertile environment for cross platform
