Firefox OS project name Boot to Gecko also known as B G is a discontinued open source operating system made for smartphones tablet computers smart TVs and dongles designed by Mozilla and external contributors It is based on the rendering engine of the Firefox web browser Gecko and on the Linux kernel It was first commercially released in br Firefox OS was designed to provide a complete community based alternative operating system for running web applications directly or those installed from an application marketplace The applications use open standards and approaches such as JavaScript and HTML a robust privilege model and open web APIs that can communicate directly with hardware e g cellphone hardware As such Mozilla with Firefox OS competed with commercially developed operating systems such as Apple s iOS Google s Android Microsoft s Windows Phone BlackBerry s BlackBerry Samsung s Linux Foundation s Tizen and Jolla s Sailfish OS In December Mozilla announced it would stop development of new Firefox OS smartphones and in September announced the end of development Successors to Firefox OS include the discontinued B G OS and Acadine Technologies H OS as well as KaiOS Technologies KaiOS and Panasonic s My Home Screen br br br History br Firefox OS was publicly demonstrated in February on Android compatible smartphones By December fourteen operators in countries throughout the world offered Firefox OS phones br On December Mozilla announced that it would stop sales of Firefox OS smartphones through carriers Mozilla later announced that Firefox OS smartphones would be discontinued by May as the development of Firefox OS for smartphones would cease after the release of version Around the same time it was reported that Acadine Technologies a startup founded by Li Gong former president of Mozilla Corporation with various other former Mozilla staff among its employees would take over the mission of developing carrier partnerships for its own Firefox OS derivative H OS br In January Mozilla announced that Firefox OS would power Panasonic s UHD TVs as previously announced Firefox OS would pivot to connected devices In September Mozilla announced that work on Firefox OS had ceased and that all B G related code would be removed from mozilla central br br br Project inception and roll out br br br Commencement of project br On July Andreas Gal Director of Research at Mozilla Corporation announced the Boot to Gecko Project B G on the mozilla dev platform mailing list The project proposal was to pursue the goal of building a complete standalone operating system for the open web in order to find the gaps that keep web developers from being able to build apps that are in every way the equals of native apps built for the iPhone Android and Windows Phone The announcement identified these work areas new web APIs to expose device and OS capabilities such as telephone and camera a privilege model to safely expose these to web pages applications to prove these capabilities and low level code to boot on an Android compatible device br This led to much blog coverage According to Ars Technica Mozilla says that B G is motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the standards based open Web has the potential to be a competitive alternative to the existing single vendor application development stacks offered by the dominant mobile operating systems br In Andreas Gal expanded on Mozilla s aims He characterized the current set of mobile operating systems as walled gardens and presented Firefox OS as more accessible We use completely open standards and there s no proprietary software or technology involved That changed in see Digital rights management DRM below Gal also said that because the software stack is entirely HTML there are already a large number of established developers This assumption is employed in Mozilla s WebAPI These are intended W C standards that attempt to bridge the capability gap that currently exists between native frameworks and web applications The goal of these efforts is to enable developers to build applications using WebAPI which would then run in any standards compliant browser without the need to rewrite their application for each platform br br br Development history br In July Boot to Gecko was rebranded as Firefox OS after Mozilla s well known desktop browser Firefox and screenshots began appearing in August br In September analysts Strategy Analysts forecast that Firefox OS would account for of the global smartphone market in its first year of commercial availability br In February Mozilla announced plans for its global commercial roll out of Firefox OS br Mozilla announced at a press conference before the start of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona that the first wave of Firefox OS devices would be available to consumers in Brazil Colombia Hungary Mexico Montenegro Poland Serbia Spain and Venezuela Mozilla also announced that LG Electronics ZTE Huawei and TCL Corporation had committed to making Firefox OS devices br In December new features were added with the release including conference calling silent SMS authentication for mobile billing improved push notifications and three state settings for Do Not Track br Async Pan and Zoom APZ included in version should improve user interface responsiveness br Work was done to optimize Firefox OS to run a MB platform with version T A MB device is out that seems to use that version but it may be unfinished br In Mozilla ported Firefox OS an experimental version to MIPS to work in a sub tablet that can also run Android KitKat Mozilla has worked on developing the OS for Smart Feature Phones br Firefox OS was discontinued in January br br br Digital rights management br In Gal announced a change in course writing that future versions of the Firefox browser would include digital rights management DRM Implementation of DRM in the Firefox browser began with version br In August attempts by Matchstick TV based on Firefox OS to add DRM caused the demise of Matchstick a decision that Boing Boing called suicide by DRM br br br Demonstrations br br At Mobile World Congress Mozilla and Telef nica announced that the Spanish telecommunications provider intended to deliver open Web devices in based on HTML and these APIs br Mozilla also announced support for the project from Adobe and Qualcomm and that Deutsche Telekom s Innovation Labs would join the project br Mozilla demonstrated a sneak preview of the software and apps running on Samsung Galaxy S II phones replacing their usual Android operating system br In August a Nokia employee demonstrated the OS running on a Raspberry Pi br Firefox OS is compatible with a number of devices including Otoro PandaBoard Emulator ARM and x Desktop Nexus S Nexus S G Samsung Galaxy S II Galaxy Nexus and Nexus A MIPS port was created by Imagination Technologies in March br In December Mozilla rolled out another update and released Firefox OS Simulator which can be downloaded as an add on for Firefox The latest version of Firefox OS Simulator version was released on July and announced on July br Mozilla s planned US Firefox smartphone displayed at MWC is built by Spreadtrum Mozilla has collaborated with four handset makers and five wireless carriers to provide five Firefox powered smartphones in Europe and Latin America so far with cellphone launches being led by UK marketer John D Bernard In India Mozilla planned a launching at in partnership with Intex and Spice but the price ended up being converted from Rupees br br br Core technologies br br The initial development work involves three major software layers br br Gonk platform denomination for a combination of the Linux kernel and the HAL from Android br Gecko the web browser engine and application run time services layer br Gaia an HTML layer and user interface system br br br Gonk br Gonk consists of a Linux kernel and user space hardware abstraction layer HAL The kernel and several user space libraries are common open source projects Linux libusb BlueZ etc Some other parts of the HAL are shared with the Android project GPS camera among others Gonk is basically an extremely simple Linux distribution and is therefore from Gecko s perspective simply a porting target of Gecko there is a port of Gecko to Gonk just like there is a port of Gecko to OS X and a port of Gecko to Android However since the development team have full control over Gonk the developers can fully expose all the features and interfaces required for comprehensive mobile platforms such as Gecko but which aren t currently possible to access on other mobile OSes For example using Gonk Gecko can obtain direct access to the full telephone stack and display framebuffer but doesn t have this access on any other OS br br br Gecko br br Gecko is the web browser engine of Firefox OS Gecko implements open standards for HTML CSS and JavaScript Gecko includes a networking stack graphics stack layout engine virtual machine for JavaScript and porting layers br br br Gaia br Gaia was the user interface of Firefox OS and controlled everything drawn to the screen Gaia included by default implementations of a lock screen home screen telephone dialer and contacts application text messaging application camera application and gallery support plus the classic phone apps mail calendar calculator and marketplace Gaia was written entirely in HTML CSS and JavaScript It interfaced with the operating system through Open Web APIs which were implemented by Gecko Because it used only standard web APIs it could work on other OSes and other web browsers br br br Release history br br br Forks br Panasonic continues to develop the operating system for use in their Smart TVs which run My Home Screen powered by the Firefox OS br Acadine Technologies has derived their H OS from Firefox OS as well Li Gong the founder of the company had overseen the development of Firefox OS while serving as president of Mozilla Corporation br A fork called KaiOS has been used on a few feature phones including Alcatel s OneTouch Go Flip known as Cingular Flip on AT T Reliance Jio s JioPhone LYF F C and Intex s Turbo G The system brings support for G LTE Wi Fi GPS and HTML based apps onto non touch devices with an optimized user interface less memory usage and longer battery life br br br B G OS br br B G OS Boot Gecko was a community developed mobile operating system and the successor to Firefox OS It follows the Firefox OS goal of providing a complete community based alternative operating system that runs software as web applications Its mobile apps therefore use open web standards and programming languages such as JavaScript and HTML a robust privilege model and open web APIs that can communicate directly with the device s hardware br It is now the basis of KaiOS which has as of January over percent of the Indian mobile phone market and is the third most popular phone OS KaiOS is closed source br br br History br B G OS was forked from Firefox OS following Mozilla s decision to discontinue support for their mobile operating system The decision was made according to Ari Jaaksi and David Bryant in order to evolve quickly and enable substantial new architectural changes in Gecko Mozilla s Platform Engineering organization needs to remove all B G related code from mozilla central br As of B G OS is no longer maintained br br br Capyloon br br Capyloon is a modern fork of Firefox OS started in which additionally makes use of decentralized web technologies such as IPFS br Builds are available for Pixel a and Pixel a devices as well as GSI images for Android based devices Linux mobile devices such as the PinePhone PinePhone Pro and Librem are also supported br br br Comparison with Android br Firefox OS used the Linux kernel like Android does Firefox OS used the Gecko engine on top of the Linux kernel to render the screen output Apps were written using HTML CSS and JavaScript all three being cooperative languages used in making internet webpages In essence apps on Firefox OS were web apps and the OS could be thought of as a Web browser that stored content off line On the other hand Android s apps are coded in Java using Android Studio Android also enjoys greater maturity and support Despite these differences Firefox OS did feature all the essentials required to use a smartphone Firefox launched its first official device in Germany in which was an Alcatel One Touch Fire The device had a HVGA screen Cortex A processor MB RAM and MB storage As of December Mozilla had launched smartphones across countries br br br Criticisms br Chris Ziegler of the technology website The Verge wrote that Firefox OS would take app distribution back to the pre iPhone era requiring application developers to deal with multiple carriers and their app stores At the Mobile World Congress Mozilla s CEO Gary Kovacs said that Firefox OS has the advantage that users need not install an app to use it Mozilla sought to make the most of this with the search functionality built into Firefox OS a core feature of the platform br Janne Lindqvist a mobile security researcher at the Rutgers University WINLAB expressed concern about the discovery mechanism of a Web based platform but a Mozilla spokesperson stated that Mozilla required developers to package downloadable apps in a zip file that has been cryptographically signed by the store from which it originated assuring that it has been reviewed In addition apps coming back from search are given only limited access to device programming interfaces and applications unless the user grants permission for further access br Ben Francis an engineer on the Boot to Gecko and Firefox OS projects described the changes in direction of the project from open web technologies for app development to cheap smartphones to connected devices and how evaluation of its success was reduced to its market share as a third smartphone platform after Android and iOS br br br Devices br br br Officially and unofficially supported devices br The structural similarities between Firefox OS and Android allow the Mozilla platform to run on a number of devices that ship with Android While some ports of Firefox OS are hardly different from their original versions others are heavily modified to fit the device in question There are quite a few to note that are specifically made for Firefox OS as stated above There are some that are designed for the developers themselves and others that are consumer phones There are also emulators for testing both apps and the OS itself on the desktop which are designed for both OS testing and the developers
