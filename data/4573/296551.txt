In computing the Perl DBI Perl Database Interface offers a standardized way for programmers using the Perl programming language to embed database communication within their programs The latest DBI module for Perl from CPAN can run on a range of operating systems br br br History br In September Buzz Moschetti creator of interperl observed that several bespoke compiled extensions of perl at the time perl version or more commonly perl featuring connectivity to popular SQL based databases had emerged namely Interbase Informix Oracle and Sybase He br engaged the authors of these bespoke versions with the idea of creating a common interface layer to the databases separate from the specifics of the underlying implementations Tim Bunce took the lead and began specifying what would become the DBI module in upon the release of perl which eliminated the need for bespoke compilation in favor of dynamic invocation time loading of libraries modules As of the Perl community maintains DBI as a CPAN module in accordance with the open source model DBD DataBase Driver modules serve as plug ins to DBI allowing programmers to use near database independent SQL code in their applications Programmers can also use the DBI and DBD modules indirectly using one of the object relational mappers available for Perl such as DBIx Class for more database independent code with no need to write SQL br br br Features br The DBI and DBD Perl packages allow Perl programmers to access many database environments in a standard way The system implements each supported database environment as a DBD driver in much the same way that hardware devices from multiple vendors can operate with different CPU platforms Prospective DBD users can download DBD implementations from the Internet DBD implementations exist for proprietary products such as IBM Db Microsoft SQL Server Oracle and for free software databases such as SQLite PostgreSQL Firebird and MySQL br br br Similar projects br PHP has a similar interface called PHP Data Objects PDO Java s Java Database Connectivity JDBC is also similar br br br br br br External links br Official website br DBI module documentation on MetaCPAN br DBD drivers on MetaCPAN
