title: The Book of Mozilla
id: 420739
The Book of Mozilla is a computer Easter egg found in the Netscape Mozilla SeaMonkey Waterfox and Firefox series of web browsers br It is viewed by directing the browser to about mozilla br There is no real book titled The Book of Mozilla However apparent quotations hidden in Netscape and Mozilla give this impression by revealing passages in the style of apocalyptic literature such as the Book of Revelation in the Bible When about mozilla is typed into the location bar various versions of these browsers display a cryptic message in white text on a maroon background in the browser window br There are eight official verses of The Book of Mozilla which have been included in shipping releases although various unofficial verses can be found on the Internet All eight official verses have scriptural chapter and verse references although these are actually references to important dates in the history of Netscape and Mozilla br The eight verses all refer to the activities of a fearsome sounding beast In its early days Netscape Communications had a green fire breathing dragon like lizard mascot known as Mozilla after the code name for Netscape Navigator From this it can be conjectured that the beast referred to in The Book of Mozilla is a type of fire breathing lizard which can be viewed as a metaphor for or personification of Netscape br While part of the appeal of The Book of Mozilla comes from the mysterious nature a knowledge of the history of Netscape and Mozilla can be used to extract some meaning from the verses Furthermore the Book of Mozilla page has annotations for each of the first second third and fifth verses hidden as comments in its HTML source code These comments were written by Valerio Capello in May and were added to the Mozilla Foundation site by Nicholas Bebout in October that year Neither Capello nor Bebout are core Mozilla decision makers and there is no evidence that Capello s interpretations received any high level approval from the senior management of the Mozilla Foundation br br br The Book of Mozilla br The Book of Mozilla first appeared in Netscape released in and can be found in every subsequent x x x and x version The following prophecy was displayed br br The chapter and verse number refers to December the date that Netscape Navigator was released br The Book of Mozilla page which includes seven verses from The Book of Mozilla contains the following explanation in its HTML source code br br The beast is a metaphor for Netscape The punishments threatened towards the unbelievers most likely users who didn t conform to standards are traditionally biblical but with the strange threat that their tags shall blink until the end of days This is a reference to a feature in early versions of Netscape that would make bad tags blink as seen in the source code comments from the Book of Mozilla br br br The Book of Mozilla br On May Jamie JWZ Zawinski changed The Book of Mozilla verse to reference the fact that Netscape had released its code as open source and started the Mozilla project This verse was included in all Mozilla builds until October when a rewrite of much of the Mozilla code meant that the Easter egg was lost On February Ben Goodger then working for Netscape copied The Book of Mozilla verse across to the new code base It was included in all subsequent Mozilla builds until the introduction of the verse Netscape versions to and Beonex Communicator it still appears in Classilla due to that browser s unusual history br The verse states br br The chapter and verse number refers to March when Netscape released its source code br The Book of Mozilla page has the following comment in its HTML source about this passage br br Again the beast is Netscape The text probably refers to Netscape s hope that by opening its source they could attract a legion of developers all across the world who would help improve the software with the din of a million keyboards The legion is actually a reference to the biblical quote Mark in the King James Version KJV bible And he asked him What is thy name And he answered saying My name is Legion for we are many since The Book of Mozilla is presented as a sort of computer bible with prophecies Mammon refers to Microsoft whose Internet Explorer browser was Netscape s chief competition The word mammon in various Semitic languages is related to money and riches it appears in English translations of the Bible and is sometimes used as the name of a demon of avarice It may therefore imply not only that Microsoft has vastly greater funds to draw on but that it has greedily abused that fact to further its own position in the marketplace it also highlights the difference between the purely commercial development of Internet Explorer and the new community driven development of Netscape Mozilla Red Letter Edition may be a reference to so called Red Letter Editions of the Bible which print quotations by Jesus in red ink It could also be a reference to a fact that March was a red letter day for the Mozilla project br br br The Book of Mozilla br The next installment of The Book of Mozilla was written by Neil Deakin It is included in all versions of Mozilla released from September to July Mozilla Mozilla Firefox Beta all versions of Camino all versions of the Mozilla Thunderbird email client until all versions of the SeaMonkey application suite until the Epiphany web browser version the Minimo Pocket PC web browser and all Netscape versions from to except some Netscape Browser prototype releases br br The chapter and verse notation refers to July the day when America Online shut down its Netscape browser division and the Mozilla Foundation was launched br In the HTML source of Book of Mozilla page this verse is accompanied by the following annotation br br The beast falling refers to Netscape being closed down by its now parent company AOL The great bird that rises from the ash is the Mozilla Foundation which was established to continue Mozilla development The bird rises from the ash like a phoenix a reference to the original name of the Mozilla Firefox browser known as Firebird at the time this verse was written The bird casts down fire and thunder on the unbelievers which is a direct reference to the Mozilla Firebird now Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird products which became the main focus of Mozilla development a few months before the events of July The fact that the beast has been reborn indicates that the spirit of Netscape will live on through the Foundation which is made up mostly of ex Netscape employees and its strength has been renewed as the foundation is less reliant on AOL who many feel neglected Netscape Again Mammon is Microsoft Mozilla s main commercial competitor br br br The Book of Mozilla br Netscape s lead browser engineer Christopher Finke contributed the next verse of The Book of Mozilla It was first made public in the June release of Netscape Navigator b br The verse was included in all subsequent versions of Netscape until the final discontinuation of the browser Netscape Navigator b br br The chapter and verse notation refers to August when the first internal email was sent mentioning the possibility of developing the next Netscape Navigator in house br Unlike previous verses the HTML source for the Book of Mozilla page does not feature any verse related annotations br The Creator refers to Netscape the company There are two interpretations of the verse the phrase beast reborn appears in the previous verse referring to the Mozilla Foundation and it was good could be a tribute to everyone who contributed to the Mozilla project Beast reborn could also be a reference to Netscape reopening their browser division instead of outsourcing development Netscape Browser was produced by Mercurial Communications br This verse is a parody of God s creation of Earth as described in Genesis and of the Bible It also may be referencing Luke of the Bible br br br The Book of Mozilla br br This verse landed in the Mozilla trunk codebase on January br It was included in Firefox Beta through SeaMonkey Alpha through Thunderbird Alpha through Beta Mobile Firefox Alpha Flock Browser Version Waterfox and Songbird br In the HTML source of the Book of Mozilla page this verse is accompanied by the following annotation br br Mammon is again Internet Explorer which slept for the years between releases between Internet Explorer and The beast reborn refers to Firefox which gained supporters who self organized through Spread Firefox and undertook publicity for the browser taking out an advertisement in The New York Times and making a crop circle shaped like the Firefox logo The cunning of foxes is a direct reference to Firefox s name The new world refers to modern standards based dynamic websites and open source applications The latter half of the passage links to the Mozilla Manifesto and the about Mozilla newsletter The last part starting with Mammon awoke speaks of the release of Internet Explorer and with it was naught but a follower describes it as a follower copying several of the functions in Firefox that Internet Explorer previously lacked Additionally th edition is an allusion to the Mozilla Foundation s th anniversary which occurred during the Firefox development cycle br br br The Book of Mozilla br br This verse landed in the Mozilla trunk codebase on January It first appeared in the nightly builds of Firefox Specifically Firefox Alpha build Instead of a plain background it now features a subtle radial gradient br It is included in all Firefox versions since Firefox all SeaMonkey versions since Beta and all Thunderbird versions since Beta br The twins of Mammon refers to Apple and Google whose mobile operating systems respectively iOS and Android have taken a duopoly of the mobile OS market The new darkness refers to the closed nature of traditional app stores The beast moving swiftly refers to the new rapid release cycle of Firefox The phrase went forth and multiplied refers to Firefox becoming multiple things through Firefox for Android and Firefox OS The verse number refers to the code freeze of Firefox OS January br br br The Book of Mozilla br br This verse first appeared in Firefox Nightly landing in the Mozilla trunk codebase on September and was later uplifted to show up in Firefox Beta br It refers to the major changes that culminated in the Firefox release with the Quantum project Time and Space refer to Quantum itself while Flow refers to the Quantum Flow project new raiment and Light refer to the UI refresh known as the Photon project The Quantum Project contained the first major piece of code taken from Servo the layout engine written in Rust to which oxidised metal is a reference The chapter and verse notation refers to November the day Firefox was released br br br The Book of Mozilla br br This verse first appeared in Firefox Nightly landing in the Mozilla trunk codebase on July According to its annotation it was intended to be added on June with the introduction of Firefox Preview br In the HTML source of the Book of Mozilla page this verse is accompanied by the following annotation br br Emphasized words refer to Firefox Focus Reference Browser and Firefox Reality all of which had switched to the Quantum based GeckoView for higher performance br br br Behavior in different browsers br br br Flock br br br The Book of Mozilla br Though not an official verse by Mozilla a new verse of the Book of Mozilla became available in Flock Browser a Social Web Browser based on Firefox This verse is shown on blue white vertical gradient when about mozilla is entered into the location bar The verse is as follows br br And when the beast had taken the quarter of the earth under its rule is probably a reference to the market share Firefox had gained over the more popular Internet Explorer Birds of Sulfur references the developmental codename of Flock which is Sulfur The mountain views references the city of Mountain View California where the company that produces Flock as well as Mozilla was based at the time of writing The wise men refer to the staff employees of Flock at that time The stars refer to the star used in the branding Flockstar Though this verse was released November much of the meaning is still unclear They took their pens and dared to create is most likely a reference to the blogging and social networking integration in Flock The section Finally they dared to share their deed with the whole of mankind could possibly be making a reference to the fact that it is open source and that they shared their good deed their creation of the browser with the world br br br Internet Explorer br In some versions of Internet Explorer about mozilla produces a blank blue page referencing the Blue Screen of Death br The source markup of the page defines the text color as white The page still can be seen even in Edge for Windows when using the URL res mshtml dll about moz however without using this URL in IE it will cancel the webpage navigation The about page was defined in a registry entry HKEY LOCAL MACHINE SOFTWARE Microsoft Internet Explorer AboutURLs br br br Iceweasel br Due to a dispute with the Mozilla Corporation the Debian project was forced to change the name and branding of Mozilla Firefox in its distribution In response it changed the name to Iceweasel and the icon to a white weasel like variant of the Firefox logo Iceweasel includes the about mozilla Easter egg and showed the standard page from the Firefox version it was built from However when users navigate to about iceweasel they see a thematically similar message from the Book of Ice that describes the dispute with Mozilla and the creation of Iceweasel br br The Corpse in this edition represents the Mozilla Corporation and the references to the prohibition on flying in my name is a reference to the trademark prohibition br br br Netscape br Starting with Netscape beta and up to version about mozilla produced the text Mozilla Rules br Viewing the about mozilla page with a Unix version of Netscape would change the throbber to an animation of Mozilla rising up from behind the planet logo and breathing fire br br br Pale Moon br Prior to Pale Moon version typing about mozilla would show the verse However in Pale Moon and above it displays the following br br Similarly to Iceweasel Pale Moon has its own take on The Book of Mozilla this time dubbed The Chronicles of the Pale Moon which can be viewed by navigating to about palemoon however instead of the chapter and verse number referring to a date of significance in the browser s history it refers to the version number the verse first appeared in and instead of being in the middle of the page the subtle radial gradiant is near the top right In Pale Moon to the page title read The Child of the Moon and it showed the following text br br The phrase the form of metal is a reference to Google s Chrome browser br Since version when Pale Moon became a true fork the page title reads The Dragon s Roots and the text reads br br The ancestor is believed to refer to Firefox while the bed of withered roots is believed to refer to the Firefox ESR codebase br With the release of Pale Moon the version number references were abandoned The page title does not contain a title for the verse and the text reads br br In this verse the old nest is believed to refer to the old Mozilla XUL Platform used by prior versions which had been abandoned in favour of a fork named UXP under the hood while retaining the older but customisable interface from Firefox versions through br With version the page s text was once updated br br In this verse landscape seems to refer to the current browser scene tainted metal may be a reference to Chromium referencing the migration of browsers like Opera and Vivaldi to Chromium and sanctuary may refer to Unified XUL Platform UXP which provides a common platform for XUL based applications to build on br br br SeaMonkey br In versions of SeaMonkey browser later than about mozilla displays the same Book of Mozilla verse from the Firefox trunk build that it was built off of br br br See also br about URI scheme br Mozilla mascot br br br br br br External links br
