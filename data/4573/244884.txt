SQLite is a database engine written in the C programming language It is not a standalone app rather it is a library that software developers embed in their apps As such it belongs to the family of embedded databases It is the most widely deployed database engine as it is used by several of the top web browsers operating systems mobile phones and other embedded systems br Many programming languages have bindings to the SQLite library It generally follows PostgreSQL syntax but does not enforce type checking by default This means that one can for example insert a string into a column defined as an integer br br br History br D Richard Hipp designed SQLite in the spring of while working for General Dynamics on contract with the United States Navy Hipp was designing software used for a damage control system aboard guided missile destroyers the damage control system originally used HP UX with an IBM Informix database back end SQLite began as a Tcl extension br In August version of SQLite was released with storage based on gdbm GNU Database Manager In September SQLite replaced gdbm with a custom B tree implementation adding transaction capability In June SQLite added internationalization manifest typing and other major improvements partially funded by America Online In Hipp announced his plans to add a NoSQL interface to SQLite as well as announcing UnQL a functional superset of SQL designed for document oriented databases In SQLite adopted a Code of Conduct based on the Rule of Saint Benedict which caused some controversy and was later renamed as a Code of Ethics br SQLite is one of four formats recommended for long term storage of datasets approved for use by the Library of Congress br br br Design br SQLite was designed to allow the program to be operated without installing a database management system or requiring a database administrator Unlike client server database management systems the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates Instead a linker integrates the SQLite library statically or dynamically into an application program which uses SQLite s functionality through simple function calls reducing latency in database operations for simple queries with little concurrency SQLite performance profits from avoiding the overhead of inter process communication br Due to the serverless design SQLite applications require less configuration than client server databases SQLite is called zero conf because it does not require service management such as startup scripts or access control based on GRANT and passwords Access control is handled by means of file system permissions given to the database file itself Databases in client server systems use file system permissions that give access to the database files only to the daemon process which handles its locks internally allowing concurrent writes from several processes br SQLite stores the whole database definitions tables indices and the data itself as a single cross platform file on a host machine allowing several processes or threads to access the same database concurrently It implements this simple design by locking the database file during writing Write access may fail with an error code or it can be retried until a configurable timeout expires SQLite read operations can be multitasked though due to the serverless design writes can only be performed sequentially This concurrent access restriction does not apply to temporary tables and it is relaxed in version as write ahead logging WAL enables concurrent reads and writes Since SQLite has to rely on file system locks it is not the preferred choice for write intensive deployments br SQLite uses PostgreSQL as a reference platform What would PostgreSQL do is used to make sense of the SQL standard One major deviation is that with the exception of primary keys SQLite does not enforce type checking the type of a value is dynamic and not strictly constrained by the schema although the schema will trigger a conversion when storing if such a conversion is potentially reversible SQLite strives to follow Postel s rule br br br Features br SQLite implements most of the SQL standard for SQL but lacks some features For example it only partially provides triggers and cannot write to views however it provides INSTEAD OF triggers that provide this functionality Its support of ALTER TABLE statements is limited br SQLite uses an unusual type system for an SQL compatible DBMS instead of assigning a type to a column as in most SQL database systems types are assigned to individual values in language terms it is dynamically typed Moreover it is weakly typed in some of the same ways that Perl is one can insert a string into an integer column although SQLite will try to convert the string to an integer first if the column s preferred type is integer This adds flexibility to columns especially when bound to a dynamically typed scripting language However the technique is not portable to other SQL products A common criticism is that SQLite s type system lacks the data integrity mechanism provided by statically typed columns although it can be emulated with constraints like CHECK typeof x integer Strict tables were added in version br Tables normally include a hidden rowid index column which gives faster access If a database includes an Integer Primary Key column SQLite will typically optimize it by treating it as an alias for rowid causing the contents to be stored as a strictly typed bit signed integer and changing its behavior to be somewhat like an auto incrementing column Future versions of SQLite may include a command to introspect whether a column has behavior like that of rowid to differentiate these columns from weakly typed non autoincrementing Integer Primary Keys br Version released on October added support for foreign key constraints br Stored procedures are not supported this is an explicit choice by the developers to favor simplicity as the typical use case of SQLite is to be embedded inside a host application that can define its own procedures around the database br Full support for Unicode case conversions can be enabled through an optional extension br SQLite version first saw the addition of the FTS full text search module which features enhancements over the older FTS module FTS allows users to perform full text searches on documents similar to how search engines search webpages Version added support for creating tables without rowid which may provide space and performance improvements Common table expressions support was added to SQLite in version added a newer search module called FTS the more radical compared to FTS changes requiring a bump in version br In with the json extension and new subtype interfaces SQLite version introduced JSON content managing br As of version the maximum supported database size is TB br br br Development and distribution br SQLite s code is hosted with Fossil a distributed version control system that uses SQLite as a local cache for its non relational database format and SQLite s SQL as an implementation language br SQLite is public domain but not open contribution with the website stating the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain Instead of a code of conduct the founders have adopted a code of ethics based on the Rule of St Benedict br A standalone command line shell program called sqlite is provided in SQLite s distribution It can be used to create a database define tables insert and change rows run queries and manage an SQLite database file It also serves as an example for writing applications that use the SQLite library br SQLite uses automated regression testing prior to each release Over million tests are run as part of a release s verification Starting with the August release of SQLite SQLite releases have branch test coverage one of the components of code coverage The tests and test harnesses are partially public domain and partially proprietary br br br Notable uses br br br Operating systems br SQLite is included by default in br br Android br BlackBerry OS br Fedora Linux where it is used by the rpm core package management system br FreeBSD where starting with RELEASE version in January it is used by the core package management system br illumos br iOS br Mac OS X onwards Apple adopted it as an option in macOS s Core Data API from the original implementation br Maemo br MeeGo br MorphOS onwards br NetBSD br NixOS where it is used by the Nix core package management system br Red Hat Enterprise Linux where it is used in the same way as Fedora from which Red Hat Enterprise Linux is derived br Solaris where the Service Management Facility database is serialized for booting br Symbian OS br Tizen br webOS br Windows onwards br br br Middleware br ADO NET adapter initially developed by Robert Simpson is maintained jointly with the SQLite developers since April br ODBC driver has been developed and is maintained separately by Christian Werner Werner s ODBC driver is the recommended connection method for accessing SQLite from OpenOffice org br COM ActiveX wrapper making SQLite accessible on Windows to scripted languages such as JScript and VBScript This adds SQLite database capabilities to HTML Applications HTA br br br Web browsers br The browsers Google Chrome Opera Safari and the Android Browser all allow for storing information in and retrieving it from an SQLite database within the browser using the official SQLite Wasm WebAssembly build or using the Web SQL Database technology although the latter is becoming deprecated namely superseded by SQLite Wasm or by IndexedDB Internally these Chromium based browsers use SQLite databases for storing configuration data like site visit history cookies download history etc br Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird store a variety of configuration data bookmarks cookies contacts etc in internally managed SQLite databases Until Firefox version Firefox Quantum there was a third party add on that used the API supporting this functionality to provide a user interface for managing arbitrary SQLite databases br Several third party add ons can make use of JavaScript APIs to manage SQLite databases br
