title: Gecko (software)
id: 45999
Gecko stylized as ecko is a browser engine developed by Mozilla It is used in the Firefox browser the Thunderbird email client and many other projects br Gecko is designed to support open Internet standards and is used by different applications to display web pages and in some cases an application s user interface itself by rendering XUL Gecko offers a rich programming API that makes it suitable for a wide variety of roles in Internet enabled applications such as web browsers content presentation and client server br Gecko is written in C and JavaScript and since additionally in Rust It is free and open source software subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License version Mozilla officially supports its use on Android Linux macOS and Windows br br br History br Development of the layout engine now known as Gecko began at Netscape in following the company s purchase of DigitalStyle The existing Netscape rendering engine originally written for Netscape Navigator and upgraded through the years was slow did not comply well with W C standards had limited support for dynamic HTML and lacked features such as incremental reflow when the layout engine rearranges elements on the screen as new data is downloaded and added to the page The new layout engine was developed in parallel with the old with the intention being to integrate it into Netscape Communicator when it was mature and stable At least one more major revision of Netscape was expected to be released with the old layout engine before the switch br After the launch of the Mozilla project in early the new layout engine code was released under an open source license Originally unveiled as Raptor the name had to be changed to NGLayout next generation layout due to trademark problems Netscape later rebranded NGLayout as Gecko While Mozilla Organization the forerunner of the Mozilla Foundation initially continued to use the NGLayout name Gecko was a Netscape trademark eventually the Gecko branding won out br In October Netscape announced that its next browser would use Gecko which was still called NGLayout at the time rather than the old layout engine requiring large parts of the application to be rewritten While this decision was popular with web standards advocates it was largely unpopular with Netscape developers who were unhappy with the six months given for the rewrite It also meant that most of the work done for Netscape Communicator including development on the Mariner improvements to the old layout engine had to be abandoned Netscape the first Netscape release to incorporate Gecko was released in November the name Netscape was never used br As Gecko development continued other applications and embedders began to make use of it America Online by this time Netscape s parent company eventually adopted it for use in CompuServe and AOL for Mac OS X these products had previously embedded Internet Explorer However with the exception of a few betas Gecko was never used in the main Microsoft Windows AOL client br On July AOL laid off the remaining Gecko developers and the Mozilla Foundation formed on the same day became the main steward of Gecko development Today Gecko is developed by employees of the Mozilla Corporation employees of companies that contribute to the Mozilla project and volunteers br In October Mozilla announced Quantum an ongoing project encompassing several software development efforts to build the next generation web engine for Firefox users It included numerous improvements to Gecko taken from the experimental Servo project Firefox also known as Firefox Quantum first shipping in November is the initial version with major components from the Quantum Servo projects enabled These include increased performance in the CSS and GPU rendering components Additional components will be merged from Servo to Gecko incrementally in future versions br In September Mozilla announced GeckoView the foundation of Mozilla s next generation of mobile products based on a software library that makes Gecko reusable for Android encompassing newer software development efforts to decouple the engine itself from its user interface and made it easy to embed in other applications Firefox Focus shipped in the same month is the initial version introduced GeckoView with increased performance in median page loading Firefox Reality was also built with GeckoView In June Mozilla announced Firefox Preview as an ongoing project that focuses on building an Android web browser with GeckoView Firefox for Android also known as Firefox Daylight first shipping in August is the first stable release of that with major components powered by GeckoView engine br br br Standards support br br From the outset Gecko was designed to support open Internet standards Some of the standards Gecko supports include br br CSS Level br DOM br HTML br JavaScript ECMAScript ES or superior currently ECMAScript ES implemented in SpiderMonkey br MathML br RDF br XForms via an official extension br XHTML br XML br XSLT and XPath implemented in TransforMiiX br Gecko also supports SVG br br br Legacy IE non standard support br In order to support web pages designed for legacy versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer Gecko supports DOCTYPE switching Documents with a modern DOCTYPE are rendered in standards compliance mode which follows the W C standards strictly Documents that have no DOCTYPE or an older DOCTYPE are rendered in quirks mode which emulates some of the non standard oddities of Netscape Communicator x however some of the x features such as layers are not supported br Gecko also has limited support for some non standard Internet Explorer features such as the marquee element and the document all property though pages explicitly testing for document all will be told it is not supported br br br Usage br Gecko is primarily used in web browsers the earliest being Netscape and Mozilla Suite later renamed SeaMonkey It is also used in other Mozilla web browser derivatives such as Firefox and Firefox for mobile and the implementation of the Internet Explorer clone that is part of Wine Mozilla also uses it in their Thunderbird email client br Other web browsers using Gecko include GNU IceCat Waterfox K Meleon Lunascape Portable Firefox Conkeror Classilla TenFourFox br Gecko is also used by Sugar for the OLPC XO computer and is used as a complete implementation of the XUL XML User Interface Language Gecko currently defines the XUL specification Gecko is also used by the KaiOS mobile operating system which is based on the discontinued Firefox OS br br br Past users br Products that formerly used Gecko include Pale Moon now using Goanna Epiphany now known as GNOME Web and using WebKitGTK and GNOME DevHelp now using WebKitGTK br Discontinued products that used Gecko include Swiftfox Flock Galeon Camino Minimo Beonex Communicator Kazehakase Songbird Sunbird calendar MicroB Nightingale Instantbird and Picasa for Linux br br br Proprietary dependency br On Windows and other platforms Gecko depends on proprietary compilers Thus FOSS distributions of Linux cannot include the Gecko package used in the Windows compatibility layer Wine br After Gecko the version number was bumped to to match Firefox and from then on has been kept in sync with the major version number for both Firefox and Thunderbird to reflect the fact that it is no longer a separate component br br br Bloat br In the Netscape era a combination of poor technical and management decisions resulted in Gecko software bloat Thus in Apple chose to fork KHTML not Gecko to create the WebKit engine for its Safari browser However by Mozilla had addressed some of the bloat problems resulting in significant performance improvements for Gecko br br br Quantum br Quantum is a Mozilla project encompassing several software development efforts to build the next generation web engine for Firefox users It includes numerous improvements to Gecko largely incorporated from the experimental Servo project Quantum also includes refinements to the user interface and interactions br Firefox released in November is the initial version with a Servo component enabled Mozilla dubs this and several planned future releases Firefox Quantum br br br Background br In Mozilla began the experimental Servo project which is an engine designed from scratch with the goals of improving concurrency and parallelism while also reducing memory safety vulnerabilities Servo is written in the Rust programming language also created by Mozilla which is designed to generate compiled code with better memory safety concurrency and parallelism than compiled C code br As of April Servo needed at least several years of development to become a full featured browser engine hence the decision to start the Quantum project to bring stable portions of Servo into Firefox Mozilla laid off all Servo developers in August br br br Components br The Quantum project is composed of several sub projects br br CSS Servo s parallel style sheet system integrated into Gecko Benchmarks suggest that performance scales linearly with number of CPU cores This was released in Firefox br Render Servo s rendering architecture called WebRender integrated into Gecko WebRender replaces the immediate mode drawing model with a retained mode model that is more easily accelerated by the GPU by taking advantage of CSS DOM s similarity to a scene graph Worst case scenario rendering in testing exceeds frames per second Mozilla began enabling the new renderer for select hardware OS combinations in Firefox br Compositor Gecko s existing compositor moved to its own process isolating browser tabs from graphics driver related crashes Since compositor crashes will not bring down the browser content process the compositor process can be restarted transparently without losing user data This was released in Firefox br DOM Loosely inspired by Servo s Constellation architecture and Opera s Presto engine Quantum DOM uses cooperatively scheduled threads within the DOM to increase responsiveness without increasing the number of processes and thus memory usage The core of this shipped in Firefox br Flow An umbrella for user visible performance improvements driven by a team that works across Gecko components Focused on real user performance improvements on major webapps primarily G Suite now called Google Workspace and Facebook This work completed and shipped for Firefox br Photon A UI refresh of the entire application with a strong focus on improving UI performance Treated as a sister project to Quantum Flow This was released in Firefox br Network Improve the performance of Necko Gecko s networking layer by moving more network activity off the main thread context dependent prioritization of networking streams and racing the cache layer with the network This feature was released in Firefox br br br Azure br The Mozilla Azure project is a stateless low level graphics abstraction API used in Firefox The project has several objectives including more accurate Direct D compatibility optimized state interoperability and improved control over performance characteristics and bugs Azure will provide D hardware acceleration on top of D graphics backends Firefox began using Azure instead of Cairo in It is written in C and used by Servo The Azure name is an ode to the early Netscape founder James H Clark and his earlier work at Silicon Graphics where workstations were often named after
