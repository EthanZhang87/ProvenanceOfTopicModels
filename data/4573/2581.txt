title: Apache HTTP Server
id: 2581
The Apache HTTP Server PATCH ee is a free and open source cross platform web server software released under the terms of Apache License It is developed and maintained by a community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation br The vast majority of Apache HTTP Server instances run on a Linux distribution but current versions also run on Microsoft Windows OpenVMS and a wide variety of Unix like systems Past versions also ran on NetWare OS and other operating systems including ports to mainframes br Originally based on the NCSA HTTPd server development of Apache began in early after work on the NCSA code stalled Apache played a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web quickly overtaking NCSA HTTPd as the dominant HTTP server In it became the first web server software to serve more than million websites br As of March Netcraft estimated that Apache served of the million busiest websites while Nginx served br Cloudflare at and Microsoft Internet Information Services at rounded out the top four For some of Netcraft s other stats Nginx is ahead of Apache According to W Techs review of all web sites in June Apache was ranked second at and Nginx first at with Cloudflare Server third at br br br Name br According to The Apache Software Foundation its name was chosen from respect for the various Native American nations collectively referred to as Apache well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance This was in a context in which it seemed that the open internet based on free exchange of open source code appeared to be soon subjected to a kind of conquer by proprietary software vendor Microsoft Apache co creator Brian Behlendorf originator of the name saw his effort somewhat parallel that of Geronimo Chief of the last of the free Apache peoples But it conceded that the name also makes a cute pun on a patchy web server a server made from a series of patches br There are other sources for the patchy software pun theory including the project s official documentation in which stated Apache is a cute name which stuck It was based on some existing code and a series of software patches a pun on A PAtCHy server br But in an April interview Behlendorf asserted that the origins of Apache were not a pun stating br br The name literally came out of the blue I wish I could say that it was something fantastic but it was out of the blue I put it on a page and then a few months later when this project started I pointed people to this page and said Hey what do you think of that idea Someone said they liked the name and that it was a really good pun And I was like A pun What do you mean He said Well we re building a server out of a bunch of software patches right So it s a patchy Web server I went Oh all right When I thought of the name no It just sort of connoted Take no prisoners Be kind of aggressive and kick some ass br br In January the US based non profit Natives in Tech accused the Apache Software Foundation of cultural appropriation and urged them to change the foundation s name and consequently also the names of the software projects it hosts br When Apache is running under Unix its process name is httpd which is short for HTTP daemon br br br Feature overview br Apache supports a variety of features many implemented as compiled modules which extend the core functionality These can range from authentication schemes to supporting server side programming languages such as Perl Python Tcl and PHP Popular authentication modules include mod access mod auth mod digest and mod auth digest the successor to mod digest A sample of other features include Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security support mod ssl a proxy module mod proxy a URL rewriting module mod rewrite custom log files mod log config and filtering support mod include and mod ext filter br Popular compression methods on Apache include the external extension module mod gzip implemented to help with reduction of the size weight of web pages served over HTTP ModSecurity is an open source intrusion detection and prevention engine for Web applications Apache logs can be analyzed through a Web browser using free scripts such as AWStats W Perl or Visitors br Virtual hosting allows one Apache installation to serve many different websites For example one computer with one Apache installation could simultaneously serve example com example org test test server example edu etc br Apache features configurable error messages DBMS based authentication databases content negotiation and supports several graphical user interfaces GUIs br It supports password authentication and digital certificate authentication Because the source code is freely available anyone can adapt the server for specific needs and there is a large public library of Apache add ons br A more detailed list of features is provided below br br Loadable Dynamic Modules br Multiple Request Processing modes MPMs including Event based Async Threaded and Prefork br Highly scalable easily handles more than simultaneous connections br Handling of static files index files auto indexing and content negotiation br htaccess per directory configuration support br Reverse proxy with caching br Load balancing with in band health checks br Multiple load balancing mechanisms br Fault tolerance and Failover with automatic recovery br WebSocket FastCGI SCGI AJP and uWSGI support with caching br Dynamic configuration br TLS SSL with SNI and OCSP stapling support via OpenSSL or wolfSSL br Name and IP address based virtual servers br IPv compatible br HTTP support br Fine grained authentication and authorization access control br gzip compression and decompression br URL rewriting br Headers and content rewriting br Custom logging with rotation br Concurrent connection limiting br Request processing rate limiting br Bandwidth throttling br Server Side Includes br IP address based geolocation br User and Session tracking br WebDAV br Embedded Perl PHP and Lua scripting br CGI support br public html per user web pages br Generic expression parser br Real time status views br FTP support by a separate module br br br Performance br Instead of implementing a single architecture Apache provides a variety of MultiProcessing Modules MPMs which allow it to run in either a process based mode a hybrid process and thread mode or an event hybrid mode in order to better match the demands of each particular infrastructure Choice of MPM and configuration is therefore important Where compromises in performance must be made Apache is designed to reduce latency and increase throughput relative to simply handling more requests thus ensuring consistent and reliable processing of requests within reasonable time frames br For delivering static pages Apache series was considered significantly slower than nginx and varnish To address this issue the Apache developers created the Event MPM which mixes the use of several processes and several threads per process in an asynchronous event based loop This architecture as implemented in the Apache series performs at least as well as event based web servers according to Jim Jagielski and other independent sources However some independent but significantly outdated benchmarks show that it is still half as fast as nginx e g br br br Licensing br The Apache HTTP Server codebase was relicensed to the Apache License from the previous license in January and Apache HTTP Server and were the first releases using the new license br The OpenBSD project did not like the change and continued the use of pre Apache versions effectively forking Apache x for its purposes They initially replaced it with Nginx and soon after made their own replacement OpenBSD Httpd based on the Relayd project br br br Versions br Version br The Apache License was approved by the ASF in The primary change from the license is in the advertising clause section of the license derived products are no longer required to include attribution in their advertising materials only in their documentation br Version br The ASF adopted the Apache License in January The stated goals of the license included making the license easier for non ASF projects to use improving compatibility with GPL based software allowing the license to be included by reference instead of listed in every file clarifying the license on contributions and requiring a patent license on contributions that necessarily infringe a contributor s own patents br br br Development br br The Apache HTTP Server Project is a collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust commercial grade feature rich and freely available source code implementation of an HTTP Web server The project is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world using the Internet and the Web to communicate plan and develop the server and its related documentation This project is part of the Apache Software Foundation In addition hundreds of users have contributed ideas code and documentation to the project br Apache dropped support for BeOS TPF A UX NeXT and Tandem platforms br br br Security br br Apache like other server software can be hacked and exploited The main Apache attack tool is Slowloris which exploits a bug in Apache software It creates many sockets and keeps each of them alive and busy by sending several bytes known as keep alive headers to let the server know that the computer is still connected and not experiencing network problems The Apache developers have addressed Slowloris with several modules to limit the damage caused the Apache modules mod limitipconn mod qos mod evasive mod security mod noloris and mod antiloris have all been suggested as means of reducing the likelihood of a successful Slowloris attack Since Apache Apache ships the module mod reqtimeout as the official solution supported by the developers br br br See
