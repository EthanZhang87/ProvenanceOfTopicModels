Minimo from Mini Mozilla was a project to create a version of the Mozilla web browser for small devices like personal digital assistants and mobile phones br The project aimed to make it easier for developers to embed parts of Mozilla into systems with limited system resources for example machines with low amounts of RAM br br br Background br The Minimo Project was created to test the feasibility of porting a full function desktop browser engine to advanced mobile devices br To minimize the use of system resources Minimo initially did not include some of Mozilla s functionality such as support for SVG although continuing experiments sought to include all the features of the Mozilla codebase In addition the browser used small screen rendering technology to reformat Web pages for pocket sized displays and allowed a platform for UI experiments on mobile devices The user interface was designed to take up minimal screen space with a single px high toolbar and a hidden by default address bar Other user interface functionality such as bookmarks history and search was migrated into a special homepage called the Homebase Because Minimo is based on the Gecko infrastructure developers can decide to build specific versions and evaluate other features such as the canvas SVG support and more br Chris Hofmann created the Minimo project shortly after leaving Netscape Communications in under funding from Nokia s Maemo team He single handedly saved the project from being canceled many times Currently Chris works for the Mozilla Corporation Chris was also responsible for some of the Minimo key features such as the Homebase bar a format for displaying bookmarks more amenable to mobile devices br Early Minimo development centered on ARM devices such as Hewlett Packard s iPAQ with around MB of RAM running Familiar Linux and the GPE Palmtop Environment where it was the default browser Minimo was released for this platform in br The lead Minimo developer Doug Turner headed this and additional Mozilla mobile projects such as the Mozilla labs project named Joey The Mozilla Foundation hired Turner in December to work full time on Mobile projects Minimo was funded by Nokia and others Nokia s involvement became public in mid Chris and Doug teamed up with web developer Marcio Galli as he focused in user interface aspects and mostly creating built in applications for Minimo using HTML instead of XUL these were refereed in the source code as extensions but served as concept for web based mobile apps featuring Flickr Google Maps and more br A Windows CE version of Minimo was created for Pocket PC software development kit The first public build of Minimo for Windows CE was made available in February br In June the release of minimo included tabs a homebase bar for fast navigation to frequently used web sites and featured support for many advanced web development capabilities that made the mobile browser easier to use br On December Turner in his blog acknowledged the slow pace of development and revealed that Mozilla developers were exploring alternatives for Gecko based web browsing on mobile handsets Turner issued an invitation for others to step up as his own development priorities shift br Version came out in March and represented a product targeted for mobile developers Minimo included and upgraded interface and support for Windows Mobile br On November project head Doug Turner announced that the project was no longer supported br By Doug Turner had begun on yet another mobile web browser this time known as Firefox Mobile or Fennec br br br Criticism br Probably because it was in the early stages of development the Windows Mobile version of Minimo performed significantly slower than expected br The quality of rendered pages is congruent with the well respected layout engine it implemented Gecko but the program had very high memory and hardware requirements compared to what was typically available on most handheld platforms e g megabytes of RAM MHz ARM compatible CPU br Version was recommended for developers targeting mobile devices or interested in AJAX and Web Services driven Web application for the mobile space Minimo was compatible with many Web applications such as Gmail br br br See also br br Firefox for Android br Mobile browser br List of web browsers br Comparison of web browsers br br br br br br External links br Minimo Project homepage br An overview of the Minimo Mini Mozilla project written by the Minimo developers br Interview with Doug Turner and Chris Hofmann of the Minimo Project br Photos of Minimo running on Windows Mobile devices br Screenshots of Minimo running on the i mate JAM a Windows Mobile for Pocket PC Second Edition Phone Edition device br AJAX Mobile Apps
