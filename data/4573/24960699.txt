MariaDB is a community developed commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system RDBMS intended to remain free and open source software under the GNU General Public License Development is led by some of the original developers of MySQL who forked it due to concerns over its acquisition by Oracle Corporation in br MariaDB is intended to maintain high compatibility with MySQL with exact matching with MySQL APIs and commands allowing it in many cases to function as a drop in replacement for MySQL However new features are diverging It includes new storage engines like Aria ColumnStore and MyRocks br Its lead developer CTO is Michael Monty Widenius one of the founders of MySQL AB and the founder of Monty Program AB On January MySQL AB announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Sun Microsystems for approximately billion The acquisition completed on February Sun was then bought the following year by Oracle Corporation MariaDB is named after Widenius younger daughter Maria MySQL is named after his other daughter My br br br MariaDB Server br br br Licensing br The MariaDB Foundation mentions that MariaDB Server will remain Free and Open Source Software licensed under GPLv independent of any commercial entities br br br Versioning br MariaDB version numbers follow MySQL s numbering scheme up to version Thus MariaDB offers all of the MySQL features There exists a gap in MySQL versions between and while MariaDB issued and point releases br Since specific new features have been developed in MariaDB the developers decided that a major version number change was necessary br br br Third party software br MariaDB s API and protocol are compatible with those used by MySQL plus some features to support native non blocking operations and progress reporting This means that all connectors libraries and applications which work with MySQL should also work on MariaDB whether or not they support its native features On this basis Fedora developers replaced MySQL with MariaDB in Fedora out of concerns that Oracle was making MySQL a more closed software project OpenBSD likewise in April dropped MySQL for MariaDB br However for recent MySQL features MariaDB either has no equivalent yet like geographic function or deliberately chose not to be compatible like GTID JSON The MariaDB wiki claims that starting with MariaDB upgrading from MySQL is possible in most cases br br br Prominent users br MariaDB is used at ServiceNow DBS Bank Google Mozilla and since the Wikimedia Foundation br Several Linux distributions and BSD operating
