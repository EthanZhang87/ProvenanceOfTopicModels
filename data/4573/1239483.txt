The Netscape Portable Runtime or NSPR is a cross platform abstraction layer library for the C programming language It provides a uniform API for various operating system functions br br br History br NSPR was originally designed to provide a base for the Java virtual machine in Netscape Over time it was extended to allow support for additional functionality used for Netscape s server and client software NSPR continues to be used today by Firefox as well as many of Oracle and Red Hat s server products br br br Features br br br Threads br NSPR provides a thread API It uses the OS s threading capabilities where possible It also provides support for sharing memory between threads as well as creating and using thread pools br Locks atomics semaphores and both cached and uncached monitors are provided br br br I O br NSPR provides functions for working with files directories anonymous pipes and network sockets br br br Network addresses br NSPR defines an IP centric network address object Functions are provided to translate ASCII strings DNS names into NSPR s network address structures regardless of whether the addressing technology uses IPv or IPv br br br Time br NSPR makes timing facilities available in two forms interval timing and calendar functions br Interval timers are based on a free running bit resolution timer Their epoch and interval can be set as needed br Calendar times are represented using bit signed Unix time NSPR provides functions for manipulating and converting timestamps br br br Memory management br NSPR provides API to perform the basic malloc calloc realloc and free functions Depending on the platform the functions may be implemented almost entirely in the NSPR runtime or simply shims that call immediately into the host operating system s offerings br br br Linking br Support for linking shared library loading and unloading forms part of NSPR s feature set In most cases this is simply a smoothing over of the facilities offered by the various platform providers br br br Data structures br NSPR provides implementations of a circular linked list and a hash table br br br See also br br Apache Portable Runtime br Adaptive Communication Environment br Cross platform support middleware br br br br br br External links br Official website br NSPR source code
