Classilla is a Gecko based Internet suite for PowerPC based classic Macintosh operating systems essentially an updated descendant of the defunct Mozilla Application Suite by way of the Mac OS port maintained in the aborted WaMCom project The name is a portmanteau of Classic the classic Mac OS as defined by the Classic Environment and Mozilla br Like the Suite it is descended from Classilla offers E mail POP SMTP Usenet NNTP Gopher FTP and World Wide Web HTTP access using a modified version of the Gecko layout engine called Clecko Classilla also includes its own versions of the DOM Inspector Mozilla Composer and Venkman components the former IRC ChatZilla component was removed in version Classilla was the last updated major browser for classic Mac OS systems and the only Mozilla based browser for that environment most recently in maintenance as well as iCab s final update was in January Opera s Mac OS support ended with version on August Internet Explorer for Mac on the classic Mac OS ceased development with in July and Mozilla itself ceased support in see History br The final version of Classilla was released in March and the suite is no longer officially supported The developers considered the project to be alpha quality software Classilla shared administration with TenFourFox a fork of Mozilla Firefox for PowerPC based Macs running Mac OS X Tiger and Mac OS X Leopard The primary maintainer was Cameron Kaiser br br br History br br Official support for Mac OS and Mac OS in the Mozilla Application Suite ended with the release of Mozilla in coincident with Apple ending support for their legacy operating system However many enthusiasts discovered that Mozilla x would still generally build and run on the old Mac OS with modification apart from its dependencies on CarbonLib Mozilla x and newer will not build at all on Mac OS or without heavy modification leading to builds such as Unofficial Mozilla for Mac OS WaZilla f and WaMCom Of these WaMCom was the arguably longest maintained with its final release on July br In May Cameron Kaiser announced his intentions to start porting later Mozilla updates back to the based version used in WaMCom christening his modified version as Classilla This first version given the version number to match Mac OS with subsequent numbers matching OS version numbers was released on June br On March Kaiser released the final versions of both Classilla and TenFourFox and announced the cancellation of official support for both projects citing increasing technical issues br br br Features br Owing to Classilla s unusual provenance being essentially a heavily patched version of Mozilla vestigial proof remains in its verse from The Book of Mozilla it has more limited support for web standards than do later Gecko based browsers such as SeaMonkey and Mozilla Firefox and its layout compared to iCab is objectively inferior as the latter browser is Acid compliant and Classilla is not Similarly it only scores in Acid On the other hand its layout capability is more current than WaMCom or Mozilla and Classilla has a more modern JavaScript interpreter than iCab and better support for the Document Object Model although it is also still deficient compared to mainline Gecko based browsers It is perceived by users to be more stable and quicker to render than iCab important as the classic Mac OS relies on cooperative multitasking and has very limited support for memory protection any application crash could hang the entire system However known problems in the browser and issues with performance on older machines led the developers to implement their own limited version of NoScript as a built in part of the browser so that users had the ability to enable JavaScript only where it was safe or necessary to do so br Classilla also adds support for user agent spoofing which was not part of the original Mozilla suite and repairs various Mac OS specific bugs In addition Classilla introduced the Byblos HTML rewriting engine that can rewrite individual pages at the source code level with browser and user provided stele scripts with the intent of lightweight adaptation of complicated content to the capabilities or quirks of the browser Starting with Classilla presents a mobile user agent by default br Apart from its upgraded support for Web pages Classilla supports most of the same features that Mozilla of the same generation did with similar feature sets and bugs in its support for E mail Usenet FTP and Gopher although the latter received token upgrades In a likewise fashion Classilla also inherits many of the security failings of earlier versions of the Application Suite many of which are still not patched and openly warned of by the developers The presence of NoScript along with the unusual nature of the classic Mac OS is thought to add some level of protection although it was the avowed goal of the developers to reach security parity with modern Mozilla based releases and repair outstanding bugs br br br See also br br Mozilla Application Suite br Mac OS and Mac OS br TenFourFox br List of web browsers br List of news clients br List
