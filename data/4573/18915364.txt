Firefox branding with the Firefox name and logo br Fennec uses the Gecko engine for example version used the same engine as Firefox and the following release shared core code with Firefox Its features include HTML support Firefox Sync add ons support and tabbed browsing The browser s version numbering was bumped from version beta to version to more closely match desktop releases of Firefox since the rendering engines used in both browsers are the same br Plugin support was initially disabled by default removing compatibility with popular web content types such as Adobe Flash In September Flash support was implemented in pre release builds for pre Honeycomb versions of Android Flash support for Android x and x was enabled for most smartphones in version later it was removed in version br On June Mozilla unveiled Firefox Preview codename Fenix a redesigned version of Firefox for Android based on GeckoView an implementation of Gecko that is decoupled as a reusable library intended to be used as an alternative to the default Android WebView component based on Blink engine GeckoView was first used by Firefox Focus whose design influenced aspects of Fenix It has a redesigned user interface with support for dark mode a new Collections feature for saving sets of tabs and includes Enhanced Tracking Protection a configurable blocker for web trackers and third party cookies and a redesigned private browsing mode br The Firefox for Android Beta channel was migrated to the Fenix branch in April and it was officially released to the stable channel in August as version branded as

WebExtension support as of version Mozilla announced in November that all add ons marked as Android compatible by developers would be shown on addons mozilla org by December On December Mozilla announced that more than add ons are available for download on Firefox for Android br br br Platforms br Firefox Daylight requires Android Lollipop or later earlier versions of Firefox also supported earlier versions of Android Support for Android devices that run x processors was added in December br br br Previously or unofficially supported br Previously Firefox for mobile supported other platforms besides Android br Official support for the Nokia N Maemo device ceased with version br Firefox mobile was available for MeeGo through the third party OpenRepos repository For operating systems not supported by Fennec like Sailfish OS based on Mer project web browsers can use embedlite IPCLiteAPI a lightweight embedding API br br An alpha build of version Alpha for Windows Mobile released on February is the last build for this operating system Following the Windows Phone announcement and Microsoft s decision not to release a native development kit as with Android and other systems development for Windows Mobile was put on hold If Microsoft releases a native development kit in the future for its Windows Phone OS then Mozilla will consider again developing Fennec for the platform br Tristan Nitot president of Mozilla Europe has said that it is unlikely that a BlackBerry OS version will be released citing BlackBerry s limited operating system as the reason Mozilla has no plans to develop Firefox for the Symbian platform or webOS An unofficial port to WebOS was made but is no longer maintained as of br An unofficial port is available for the Pandora handheld console br Firefox was the last version to run on ARM devices without NEON support such as those with Tegra br br Notes br Firefox for iOS is not listed in this table as its version numbers would be misleading Prior to version it used version numbers that do not correspond to any of the other Firefox versions Those share a core component the Gecko rendering engine and track its version numbers whereas the version for the iOS operating system uses the operating system s rendering engine WebKit rather than Mozilla s Gecko br br br Reception br br The main criticisms of the browser pre version were slow browsing speed lack of plugin support and performance issues To address these concerns Mozilla redesigned the browser in version adding Flash support improving start up speed as well as other enhancements This update dramatically improved Firefox for Android As of September the average user rating of Firefox for Android on the Google Play Store is br Compared to the stock Android browser and Chrome on Android Firefox has a small market share for the month of November Firefox for Android usage share of all mobile tablet browsers was just Despite that Firefox for Android enjoys a high Play Store rating has over million downloads and continues to be developed The latest version supports Android and higher as Android support was dropped in version br In its Android browser comparison Spanish software news and reviews site Softonic com awarded Firefox version the Best of nod with reviewer Fabrizio Benedetti citing a good design efficient memory consumption the browser s open source nature and independence br In August Mozilla released a major update of Firefox for Android version which had been in development for more than year with the codename Firefox Daylight It was described by Mozilla as being dramatically redesigned to be faster easy to use customizable and private However it received intense criticism from users who complained that it was more difficult to use and slower and various features were suddenly missing Some online Tech Writers even recommended people to disable the update if possible br br br Security advantages br A number of devices run older versions of Android Some would not be upgraded to newer versions because of insufficient technical knowledge by users or their lack of access to mobile data some devices cannot be upgraded because of low system resources or the manufacturer and telecoms operator have failed to provide an update br As of early Google has stopped issuing its own patches for Android and earlier to the WebView browser component and the WebKit rendering engine therein which are used by the native stock and often default AOSP browser in a large number of Android devices thereby shifting the patching responsibility to device manufacturers In time the native browser or browser components become outdated increasingly insecure and unable to properly render modern websites br As a workaround a Google engineer suggested using the separately installable and updateable Google Chrome or Firefox browsers In case of Ice Cream Sandwich x Google stopped supporting that branch of Android with updates to its Chrome browser after Chrome and moved up to Android as the oldest release supported by Google Chrome br The open source nature of Firefox has made it possible to maintain its development for operating system versions that are past their product support life cycle and has resulted in Firefox having stronger security and better support for modern web standards This in effect extends the useful lifetime of devices stuck on older major versions of Android br br br Forks and code reuse br br br Adblock Browser br On May Eyeo GmbH the maintainers of Adblock Plus released Adblock Browser beta which is based on Firefox for Android The browser uses a similar blocking permitting model as Adblock Plus allowing by default ads deemed acceptable by Eyeo A major drawback compared to Firefox for Android is Adblock Browser s lack of support for Firefox Sync br Initial reviews have been mixed On one hand users would be happy to have less ads and resource consumption on their devices on the other hand web services publications content creators and bloggers rely on advertisements for their revenue and income br Adblock Browser was released on September It s compatible with Android or greater and has about the same system requirements as Firefox for Android br br br Fennec F Droid br Fennec F Droid s goal is to remove all proprietary binaries from Firefox some proprietary binaries however still remained in the app The Fennec F Droid app is hosted in the open source F Droid app repository since February beginning with version Since September it is based on Firefox despite still being named Fennec F Droid br br br Orfox br On June The Guardian Project announced a stable alpha of Orfox the new mobile counterpart of the Tor Browser Orfox is built from Fennec Firefox for Android code and the Tor Browser code repository and is given security hardening patches by the Tor Browser development team Some of the Orfox build work is based on the Fennec F Droid project br The project removed in Orfox the WebRTC component and Chromecast connectivity and app permissions to access the camera microphone contacts address book location data GPS et al and NFC Orfox is to supersede the Orweb browser project which used the WebView engine br On September both The Guardian Project and The Tor Project announced that Orfox had seen its final release and that Orfox had effectively become Tor Browser for Android br br br LibreOffice br br Firefox for Android Fennec s front end code was taken as a base for the new development in the LibreOffice project for Android along with the pre
