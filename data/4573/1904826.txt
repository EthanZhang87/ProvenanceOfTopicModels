title: Mantis Bug Tracker
id: 1904826
Mantis Bug Tracker is a free and open source web based bug tracking system The most common use of MantisBT is to track software defects However MantisBT is often configured by users to serve as a more generic issue tracking system and project management tool br The name Mantis and the logo of the project refer to the insect family Mantidae known for tracking and feeding on other insects colloquially referred to as bugs The name of the project is typically abbreviated to either MantisBT or just Mantis br br br History br Kenzaburo Ito started the development of the Mantis Bug Tracking Project in In Kenzaburo was joined by Jeroen Latour Victor Boctor and Julian Fitzell to be the administrators and it became a team project br Version was released in February br Version was released in December br In November after a long discussion the project switched from using the Subversion revision control tool to Git a distributed revision control tool br In February version was released br In July the MantisBT organization on GitHub became the official repository for the Project s source code br br br Features br br br Plug ins br An event driven plug in system was introduced with the release of version This plug in system allows extension of MantisBT through both officially maintained and third party plug ins As of November there are over plug ins available on the MantisBT plugins organization on GitHub br Prior to version a third party plug in system created by Vincent Debout was available to users along with a variety of different plug ins This system was not officially supported by the MantisBT project and is incompatible with MantisBT and later br br br Notifications br MantisBT supports the sending of e mail notifications upon changes being made to issues in the system Users have the ability to specify the type of e mails they receive and set filters to define the minimum severity of issues to receive notifications about Users also have the ability to explicitly subscribe to issues that affect them br RSS feeds are available for users who wish to keep track of issues that have been resolved Additionally MantisBT has integration with Twitter via a plugin to allow a notification to be tweeted when an issue is resolved br Via MantisBT s event driven plug in system it is possible to extend the built in notification support to run advanced scripts that perform additional notification actions such as sending SMS messages or updating statuses in external project management systems br br br Revision control system integration br Versions of MantisBT prior to allowed for limited integration with the CVS revision control system br With the introduction of plug in capabilities in MantisBT revision control integration was redeveloped by Amethyst Reese in the SourceIntegration plugin br The initial release of the SourceIntegration plugin supported GitHub GitWeb SourceForge and WebSVN br Over time two additional modules were added and as of November source integration is supported for the following revision control tools and web based providers br br cgit a web interface for Git repositories written in C br GitHub an open source software hosting facility that hosts Git repositories br Gitweb a free and open source web interface for Git repositories br HgWeb a cgi web front end for Mercurial repositories br SourceForge for Subversion integration only an open source software hosting facility that hosts various types of software repositories br WebSVN a free and open source web interface for Subversion repositories br RhodeCode an OpenSource web interface to Mercurial Git and Subversion repositories br Upon committing changesets to a source code repository post commit hooks within Git or Subversion can be configured to automatically notify MantisBT that changes have been made to the repository GitHub is also capable of remotely notifying a MantisBT installation of changes to a source code repository Another technique used for integrating MantisBT with web based source code hosting providers is the use of a job scheduler such as cron to manually check for changes to a repository every few minutes reporting any changes back to MantisBT br SourceIntegration allows for issues within MantisBT to be automatically resolved when a changeset message contains special strings such as Fixes which are configurable using regular expressions This also allows for relationships to be automatically created between changesets and corresponding issues recorded in MantisBT Multiple issue IDs can be specified in a single changeset message although this is commonly discouraged as it indicates the changeset doesn t have a single clear and logical purpose br br br Minor features br In addition to the features mentioned above MantisBT also has support for br br Full text search br Audit trails of changes made to issues br Revision control of text fields and notes br Roadmaps br Changelogs br Graphing of relationships between issues br Sponsorship of issues br Wiki documentation integration for DokuWiki MediaWiki TWiki WackoWiki WikkaWiki and XWiki br News br Project Management and TimeTracking with CodevTT br Localised dozens of languages on translatewiki net br br br Technical design br br br Development languages br MantisBT is mainly written in PHP and uses SQL to interface with databases The web based user interface of MantisBT is written using HTML which is styled and presented using CSS The UI also uses the jQuery client side JavaScript library to provide optional features such as Ajax and JSON powered dynamic page content br Development tools and build scripts are written predominantly in Python with some Shell script and PHP br MantisBT s codebase dates back to a time when PHP s support for object oriented programming principles was in its infancy br As of version the majority of the MantisBT codebase still uses procedural programming principles however some sections have been converted to make use of PHP s new object model br br br Database storage br Data is stored in a relational database management system by means of the ADOdb database abstraction library MantisBT supports MySQL MariaDB and PostgreSQL It has experimental support for Microsoft SQL and Oracle br MantisBT maintains a database upgrade path between versions by modifying the database schema incrementally During the installation of MantisBT database schema modifications are replayed all the way back from early versions of MantisBT to reach the latest state br br br Requirements br br MantisBT requires a configured web server the PHP programming language interpreter and a relational database management system supported by MantisBT and ADOdb br As of June the stable branch of MantisBT requires PHP or later br Several PHP extensions are required to enable specific functionality or for performance reasons the extension for the RDBMS being used i e mysqli is mandatory br MantisBT bundles a number of dependencies with each release including br br ADOdb for abstraction of support for relational database management systems br Disposable for disposable e mail checking functionality br eZ Components for plotting of statistics br NuSOAP for SOAP web service support br PHPMailer for e mail sending support br Projax for Ajax capabilities in the user interface br RSS Builder for RSS feed support br PHP UTF wrapper library for internationalization support in absence of PHP s mb string extension br For drawing graphs of relationships between issues GraphViz is required MantisBT also has an alternative dependency upon the commercial JpGraph graphics library for plotting of statistics br br br See also br br Comparison of issue tracking systems br br br br
