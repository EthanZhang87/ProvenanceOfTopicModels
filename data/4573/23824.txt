PostgreSQL POHST gres kyoo el also known as Postgres is a free and open source relational database management system RDBMS emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance br PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity consistency isolation durability ACID properties automatically updatable views materialized views triggers foreign keys and stored procedures br It is supported on all major operating systems including Linux FreeBSD OpenBSD macOS and Windows and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses or web services with many concurrent users br The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components br This core is technically what comprises PostgreSQL itself but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might traditionally be provided by a proprietary software vendor br These include special purpose database engine features like those needed to support a geospatial or temporal database or features which emulate other database products br Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features such as graphical user interfaces or load balancing and high availability toolsets br The large third party PostgreSQL support network of people companies products and projects even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large br PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California Berkeley In the project was renamed PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL After a review in the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres br br br History br PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California Berkeley In the leader of the Ingres team Michael Stonebraker left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres He returned to Berkeley in and began a post Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early s He won the Turing Award in for these and other projects and techniques pioneered in them br The new project POSTGRES aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships something used widely but maintained entirely by the user In POSTGRES the database understood relationships and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using rules POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres but not its code br Starting in published papers described the basis of the system and a prototype version was shown at the ACM SIGMOD Conference The team released version to a small number of users in June followed by version with a re written rules system in June Version released in again re wrote the rules system and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine By the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features After releasing version on June primarily a cleanup the project ended Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant which enabled other developers to use the code for any use At the time POSTGRES used an Ingres influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter which could be interactively used with a console application named monitor br In Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language creating Postgres The monitor console was also replaced by psql Yu and Chen announced the first version to beta testers on May Version of Postgres was announced on September with a more liberal license that enabled the software to be freely modifiable br On July Marc Fournier at Hub org Networking Services provided the first non university development server for the open source development effort With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B Mikheev work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley br In the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL The online presence at the website PostgreSQL org began on October The first PostgreSQL release formed version on January Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group br The project continues to make releases available under its free and open source software PostgreSQL License Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors support companies and open source programmers br br br Multiversion concurrency control MVCC br PostgreSQL manages concurrency through multiversion concurrency control MVCC which gives each transaction a snapshot of the database allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions This largely eliminates the need for read locks and ensures the database maintains ACID principles PostgreSQL offers four levels of transaction isolation Read Uncommitted Read Committed Repeatable Read and Serializable Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead PostgreSQL supports full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation SSI method The PostgreSQL MVCC implementation is prone to performance issues that require tuning when under a heavy write load which updates existing rows br br br Storage and replication br br br Replication br PostgreSQL includes built in binary replication based on shipping the changes write ahead logs WAL to replica nodes asynchronously with the ability to run read only queries against these replicated nodes This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master increasing load br PostgreSQL includes built in synchronous replication that ensures that for each write transaction the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log Unlike other database systems the durability of a transaction whether it is asynchronous or synchronous can be specified per database per user per session or even per transaction This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby br Standby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server When this fails the system fails over to the next in line br Synchronous multi master replication is not included in the PostgreSQL core Postgres XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi master replication It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL A related project is called Postgres XL Postgres R is yet another fork Bidirectional replication BDR is an asynchronous multi master replication system for PostgreSQL br Tools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier br Several asynchronous trigger based replication packages are available These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate br br Slony I br Londiste part of SkyTools developed by Skype br Bucardo multi master replication developed by Backcountry com br SymmetricDS multi master multi tier replication br br br Indexes br PostgreSQL includes built in support for regular B tree and hash table indexes and four index access methods generalized search trees GiST generalized inverted indexes GIN Space Partitioned GiST SP GiST and Block Range Indexes BRIN In addition user defined index methods can be created although this is quite an involved process Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features br br Expression indexes can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function instead of simply the value of a column br Partial indexes which only index part of a table can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement This allows a smaller index to be created br The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries using temporary in memory bitmap index operations useful for data warehouse applications for joining a large fact table to smaller dimension tables such as those arranged in a star schema br k nearest neighbors k NN indexing also referred to KNN GiST provides efficient searching of closest values to that specified useful to finding similar words or close objects or locations with geospatial data This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values br Index only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table br Block Range Indexes BRIN br br br Schemas br PostgreSQL schemas are namespaces allowing objects of the same kind and name to co exist in a single database br They are not to be confused with a br database schema the abstract structural organizational specification which defines how every table s data relates to data within other tables br All PostgreSQL database objects except for a few global objects such as roles and tablespaces exist within a schema br They cannot be nested schemas cannot contain schemas br The permission system controls access to schemas and their content br By default newly created databases have only a single schema called public but other schemas can be added and the public schema isn t mandatory br A search path setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects those without a prefixed schema By default it is set to user public user refers to the currently connected database user This default can be set on a database or role level but as it is a session parameter it can be freely changed even multiple times during a client session affecting that session only br Non existent schemas or other schemas not accessible to the logged in user that are listed in search path are silently skipped during object lookup br New objects are created in whichever valid schema one that can be accessed appears first in the search path br br br Data types br A wide variety of native data types are supported including br br Boolean br Arbitrary precision numerics br Character text varchar char br Binary br Date time timestamp time with without time zone date interval br Money br Enum br Bit strings br Text search type br Composite br HStore an extension enabled key value store within PostgreSQL br Arrays variable length and can be of any data type including text and composite types up to GB in total storage size br Geometric primitives br IPv and IPv addresses br Classless Inter Domain Routing CIDR blocks and MAC addresses br XML supporting XPath queries br Universally unique identifier UUID br JavaScript Object Notation JSON and a faster binary JSONB not the same as BSON br In addition users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL s indexing infrastructures GiST GIN SP GiST Examples of these include the geographic information system GIS data types from the PostGIS project for PostgreSQL br There is also a data type called a domain which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain br A data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types These can be discrete ranges e g all integer values to or continuous ranges e g any time between am and am The built in range types available include ranges of integers big integers decimal numbers time stamps with and without time zone and dates br Custom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base or float ranges using the float data type as a base Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the and characters respectively e g represents all integers starting from and including up to but not including Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap containment right of etc br br br User defined objects br New types of almost all objects inside the database can be created including br br Casts br Conversions br Data types br Data domains br Functions including aggregate functions and window functions br Indexes including custom indexes for custom types br Operators existing ones can be overloaded br Procedural languages br br br Inheritance br Tables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a parent table Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword i e SELECT FROM ONLY parent table Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table br Inheritance can be used to implement table partitioning using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables br This feature is not fully supported In particular table constraints are not currently inheritable All check constraints and not null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children Other types of constraints unique primary key and foreign key constraints are not inherited br Inheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in entity relationship diagrams ERDs directly into the PostgreSQL database br br br Other storage features br Referential integrity constraints including foreign key constraints column constraints and row checks br Binary and textual large object storage br Tablespaces br Per column collation br Online backup br Point in time recovery implemented using write ahead logging br In place upgrades with pg upgrade for less downtime br br br Control and connectivity br br br Foreign data wrappers br PostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers FDWs br These can take the form of any data source such as a file system another relational database management system RDBMS or a web service This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables and even join multiple data sources together br br br Interfaces br PostgreSQL supports a binary communication protocol that allows applications to connect to the database server The protocol is versioned currently as of PostgreSQL and has a detailed specification br The official client implementation of this communication protocol is a C API libpq In addition the officially supported ECPG tool allows SQL commands to be embedded in C code Both are part of the standard PostgreSQL distribution br Third party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many programming languages including C Java Julia Python Node js Go and Rust br br br Procedural languages br Procedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines functions often called stored procedures These functions can be used to build database triggers functions invoked on modification of certain data and custom data types and aggregate functions Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function using a DO command at SQL level br Languages are divided into two groups Procedures written in safe languages are sandboxed and can be safely created and used by any user Procedures written in unsafe languages can only be created by superusers because they allow bypassing a database s security restrictions but can also access sources external to the database Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions br PostgreSQL has built in support for three procedural languages br br Plain SQL safe Simpler SQL functions can get expanded inline into the calling SQL query which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to see inside the function br Procedural Language PostgreSQL PL pgSQL safe which resembles Oracle s Procedural Language for SQL PL SQL procedural language and SQL Persistent Stored Modules SQL PSM br C unsafe which allows loading one or more custom shared library into the database Functions written in C offer the best performance but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database Most built in functions are written in C br In addition PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support Perl Tcl and Python For Python the current Python is used and the discontinued Python is no longer supported as of PostgreSQL Both were supported previously defaulting to Python while old and new versions couldn t be used in the same session External projects provide support for many other languages including PL Java JavaScript PL V PL Julia PL R PL Ruby and others br br br Triggers br Triggers are events triggered by the action of SQL data manipulation language DML statements For example an INSERT statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or UPDATE statements br Triggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables Triggers can be per column and conditional in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger s WHERE clause Triggers can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order In addition to calling functions written in the native PL pgSQL triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL Python or PL Perl br br br Asynchronous notifications br PostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands A session can issue a NOTIFY command along with the user specified channel and an optional payload to mark a particular event occurring Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command which can listen to a particular channel This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed and reducing unnecessary overhead Notifications are fully transactional in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back br Many connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system including libpq JDBC Npgsql psycopg and node js so it can be used by external applications br PostgreSQL can act as an effective persistent pub sub server or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED br br br Rules br Rules allow the query tree of an incoming query to be rewritten they are an automatically invoked macro language for SQL Query Re Write Rules are attached to a table class and Re Write the incoming DML select insert update and or delete into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it Query Re Write occurs after DML statement parsing and before query planning br The functionality rules provide was in almost every way later duplicated with the introduction of newer types of triggers br The use of triggers is usually preferred over rules as it is easier to reason about trigger behavior and interactions than when equivalent rules are used br br br Other querying features br Transactions br Full text search br Views br Materialized views br Updateable views br Recursive views br Inner outer full left and right and cross joins br Sub selects br Correlated sub queries br Regular expressions br Common table expressions and writable common table expressions br Encrypted connections via Transport Layer Security TLS current versions do not use vulnerable SSL even with that configuration option br Domains br Savepoints br Two phase commit br The Oversized Attribute Storage Technique TOAST is used to transparently store large table attributes such as big MIME attachments or XML messages in a separate area with automatic compression br Embedded SQL is implemented using preprocessor SQL code is first written embedded into C code Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor which replaces SQL with calls to code library Then code can be compiled using a C compiler Embedding works also with C but it does not recognize all C constructs br br br Concurrency model br PostgreSQL server is process based not threaded and uses one operating system process per database session Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system Many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread br br br Security br PostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per role basis A role is generally regarded to be a user a role that can log in or a group a role of which other roles are members Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level and can allow or prevent the visibility creation alteration deletion of objects at the database schema table and row levels br PostgreSQL s SECURITY LABEL feature extension to SQL standards allows for additional security with a bundled loadable module that supports label based mandatory access control MAC based on Security Enhanced Linux SELinux security policy br PostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms including br br Password either SCRAM SHA MD or plain text br Generic Security Services Application Program Interface GSSAPI br Security Support Provider Interface SSPI br Kerberos br ident maps O S user name as provided by an ident server to database user name br Peer maps local user name to database user name br Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP br Active Directory AD br RADIUS br Certificate br Pluggable authentication module PAM br The GSSAPI SSPI Kerberos peer ident and certificate methods can also use a specified map file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user br These methods are specified in the cluster s host based authentication configuration file pg hba conf which determines what connections are allowed This allows control over which user can connect to which database where they can connect from IP address IP address range domain socket which authentication system will be enforced and whether the connection must use Transport Layer Security TLS br br br Standards compliance br PostgreSQL claims high but not complete conformance with the latest SQL standard as of the version release in October PostgreSQL conforms to at least of the mandatory features for SQL Core conformance and no other databases fully conformed to it One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names In PostgreSQL they are folded internally to lower case characters whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case Thus Foo should be equivalent to FOO not foo according to the standard Other shortcomings concern the absence of temporal tables allowing automatic logging of row versions during transactions with the possibility of browsing in time FOR SYSTEM TIME predicate although relatively SQL compliant third party extensions are available br br br Benchmarks and performance br br Many informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version Simple benchmarks between version and version showed that the latter was more than ten times faster on read only workloads and at least times faster on both read and write workloads br The first industry standard and peer validated benchmark was completed in June using the Sun Java System Application Server proprietary version of GlassFish Platform Edition UltraSPARC T based Sun Fire server and PostgreSQL This result of SPECjAppServer JOPS Standard compares favourably with the JOPS Standard with Oracle on an Itanium based HP UX system br In August Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of SPECjAppServer JOPS Standard With the system under test at a reduced price the price performance improved from JOPS to JOPS br The default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory PostgreSQL org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki br In April Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL s linear CPU scalability using a server with cores br Matloob Khushi performed benchmarking between PostgreSQL and MySQL for their ability to process genomic data In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of each forming random human DNA regions Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent br br br Platforms br PostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems Linux all recent distributions bit ARM and x installers available and tested for macOS OS X version and newer Windows with installers available and tested for bit Windows Server and some older PostgreSQL versions were tested back to Windows R FreeBSD OpenBSD NetBSD and these without official though unofficial likely available binary executables Solaris AIX and HP UX Most other modern Unix like systems do also work br PostgreSQL can be expected to work on any of the following instruction set architectures and operating systems bit x and bit x on Windows XP or later and other operating systems these are supported on other than Windows bit ARM and the older bit ARM including older such as ARMv in Raspberry Pi z Architecture S PowerPC incl bit Power ISA SPARC also bit IA Itanium HP UX MIPS and PA RISC It was also known to work on some other platforms while not been tested on for years i e for latest versions br br br Database administration br br Open source front ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include br br psql br The primary front end for PostgreSQL is the psql command line program which can be used to enter SQL queries directly or execute them from a file In addition psql provides a number of meta commands and various shell like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax br pgAdmin br The pgAdmin package is a free and open source graphical user interface GUI administration tool for PostgreSQL which is supported on many computer platforms The program is available in more than a dozen languages The first prototype named pgManager was written for PostgreSQL from and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License GPL in later months The second incarnation named pgAdmin II was a complete rewrite first released on January The third version pgAdmin III was originally released under the Artistic License and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL Unlike prior versions that were written in Visual Basic pgAdmin III is written in C using the wxWidgets framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems The query tool includes a scripting language called pgScript for supporting admin and development tasks In December
