Foswiki is an enterprise wiki typically used to run a collaboration platform knowledge base or document management system Users can create wiki applications using the Topic Markup Language TML and developers can extend its functionality with plugins br The Foswiki project was launched in October when a dispute about the future direction of TWiki could not be settled resulting in the decision of nearly all key TWiki contributors to fork Since then the codebases have diverged significantly However Foswiki continues to maintain compatibility with content written for TWiki Foswiki stands for free and open source wiki to emphasize its commitment to open source software The project is governed by the Foswiki Association e V a volunteer run non profit foundation br The Foswiki website is seen by some as one of the more popular Perl related websites based upon Alexa rankings of all websites in the world br br br Features br Foswiki features an open architecture programmed and implemented in the Perl and JavaScript languages and runs on standard web servers such as Apache Nginx and lighttpd With almost contributors providing over commits since its inception the Foswiki team not only develops the code but also offers on line support including on IRC and Slack software Core features include a TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor built in search engine default text database and skinnable user interface as well as RSS Atom feeds e mail support and database interfaces to support scalable database solutions such as MongoDB and MySQL Additional security related features include an auditable version control system user authentication an access control system cross site request forgery protection and improved spam prevention extensions br br br Extensions br Users have contributed over extensions Most of these extensions have been developed by or for corporate users and are maintained by developers and users as documented in the individual extension histories br Extensions have been developed to link into databases create charts tags sort tables write spreadsheets create image gallery and slideshows make drawings write blogs plot graphs interface to many different authentication schemes including single sign on track Extreme Programming projects and others br br br Application platform br Foswiki is a structured wiki that acts as an application platform for web based applications Specifically it provides database like manipulation of fields stored on pages br and offers a SQL like query language to support the embedding reports in wiki pages br Wiki applications are often called situational applications because they are created ad hoc by users for very specific needs For example users have built Foswiki applications that include call center status boards to do lists inventory systems employee handbooks bug trackers blog applications discussion forums status reports with rollups and more br br br User interface br The user interface is customizable through use of templates themes and CSS It includes support for internationalization with support for multiple character sets UTF URLs etc The English user interface has been translated by users into Bulgarian Chinese Czech Danish Dutch French German Greek Italian Japanese Korean Norwegian Polish Portuguese Russian Spanish Swedish Turkish and Klingon br br br Deployment br Foswiki is expected to be used primarily at the workplace as a corporate wiki to coordinate team activities track projects implement workflows and as an Intranet Wiki for example in academia br Foswiki among other components was used in several research programs including Data Integration Platform for Systems Biology Collaborations an interactive data integration platform supporting collaborative research projects based on Foswiki Solr Lucene and custom helper applications br br br Implementation br Foswiki is implemented in Perl and JavaScript using jQuery though it can be used without JavaScript being enabled in the browser br By default wiki pages are stored on the server in plain text files Everything including meta data such as access control settings are version controlled using RCS RCS is optional since an all Perl version control system is provided Other server side databases such as MongoDB are supported through use of extensions br Informal user reports suggest that Foswiki scales reasonably well even though it uses plain text files and no relational database to store page data especially where load balancing and caching are used to improve performance br br br Support br Foswiki is an entirely community driven project and has no controlling commercial interest behind it User support is provided by the community via the mechanisms of IRC Slack software and the main website at https foswiki org Support WebHome br Commercial support and consultancy services in many countries can be found on the Foswiki consultant web page https foswiki org Support WikiConsultants br br br History br Foswiki started life as a fork of the TWiki project Since the fork it has been worked on continuously by a relatively large development team Notable developments since the fork include adoption of the jQuery JavaScript user interface framework interfacing to the MongoDB NoSQL database interfacing to the Solr search system page caching and a modified editing interface br br br See also br br Comparison of wiki software br br br
