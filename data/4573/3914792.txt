title: Debianâ€“Mozilla trademark dispute
id: 3914792
In a branding issue developed when Mike Connor representing the Mozilla Corporation requested that the Debian Project comply with Mozilla standards for use of the Thunderbird trademark when redistributing the Thunderbird software At issue were modifications not approved by the Mozilla Foundation when the name for the software remained the same br The Debian Project subsequently rebranded the Mozilla Firefox program and other software released by Mozilla so that Debian could distribute modified software without being bound by the trademark requirements that the Mozilla Foundation had invoked The new names established by Debian were Iceweasel for Mozilla Firefox Icedove for Mozilla Thunderbird and Iceape for SeaMonkey These changes were implemented in the subsequent version of Debian Etch In July Iceowl a rebranded version of Mozilla Sunbird was added to the unstable branch of Debian br In a number of Mozilla employees and Debian maintainers argued that the branding was no longer needed and on March Debian s unstable branch switched back to the Mozilla branding with the stable branch planning to switch after Iceweasel s end of life br The decade long branding issues between the Debian Project and Mozilla Corporation ended in when all Mozilla applications in Debian were reverted to their original names br br br Applications br Debian s Iceweasel Icedove Iceowl and Iceape were based on Mozilla s Firefox Thunderbird Sunbird and SeaMonkey respectively The rebranded products still used some Internet based services from Mozilla including the Mozilla plugin finder service and Mozilla add ons and their update notifications There was also no change to how non free components such as Flash were found or used br br br Iceape br br Iceape was a free software Internet suite based on SeaMonkey It was developed by the Debian Mozilla Team in unison with the SeaMonkey Council s work on their release but in accordance with Debian s policy of only using free content copyrighted artwork and proprietary plug ins were omitted br A temporary lack of community development support resulted in Iceape being absent from the repository for Debian Lenny though the iceape dev and iceape dev bin libraries remained available Support later resumed with Debian Squeeze and by early the package was available for both Squeeze and June s release of Debian Wheezy br As of December the Iceape package was no longer being maintained by the Debian project and users were encouraged to migrate to other packages for security patches br br br Icedove br br Icedove was the Debian project s rebranded version of the Mozilla Thunderbird e mail client In February Thunderbird packages were reintroduced into the Debian repositories and on April the Icedove package in Debian Stable was de branded back to Thunderbird br br br Iceowl br br Iceowl was a calendar application distributed by the Debian project It was based on Mozilla Sunbird but was made entirely of free software The Lightning calendar extension for Mozilla Thunderbird was rebranded as Iceowl Extension br br br History br br br History and origin of name br Mozilla Foundation owns the trademark Firefox and claims the right to deny the use of the name and other trademarks to unofficial builds The Debian Free Software Guidelines are used by the Debian project to determine whether a license is a free license which in turn is used to determine whether something can be included in Debian As the logo did not meet these requirements it could not be used by software which was to be included in Debian This effect of the Mozilla trademark policy led to a long debate within the Debian Project in and br During this debate the name Iceweasel was coined to refer to rebranded versions of Firefox The first known use of the name in this context is by Nathanael Nerode in reply to Eric Dorland s suggestion of Icerabbit It was intended as a parody of Firefox Iceweasel was subsequently used as the example name for a rebranded Firefox in the Mozilla Trademark Policy and became the most commonly used name for a hypothetical rebranded version of Firefox By January such strategic rebranding had come to be referred to as the Iceweasel route br The term ice weasel appeared earlier in a line which Matt Groening fictionally attributed to Friedrich Nietzsche Love is a snowmobile racing across the tundra and then suddenly it flips over pinning you underneath At night the ice weasels come br Debian was initially given permission to use the trademarks and adopted the Firefox name However because the artwork in Firefox had a proprietary copyright license which was not compatible with the Debian Free Software Guidelines the substituted logo had to remain br br br Trademark agreement revocation br In February Mike Connor representing the Mozilla Corporation wrote to the Debian bug tracker and informed the project that Mozilla did not consider the way in which Debian was using the Firefox name to be acceptable Connor confirmed that the Mozilla Corporation was revoking the previous agreement which allowed Debian to use the Firefox name Further messages from Mike Connor clarified Mozilla s new trademark policies usage of the Firefox name is not allowed unless the rest of the branding is used and all of the browser s changes are approved by Mozilla Corporation br As Debian releases are frozen on a long term basis software in the frozen stable releases needs to be patched for any newly discovered security issue Under the revised guidelines in order to use the Firefox name approval from the Mozilla Corporation would have been required for all security patches but the Debian project felt it could not put its security in the hands of an external corporation in that manner br The Iceweasel name was revived in the Debian community as a possible name to give the rebranded version of Firefox The Iceweasel found in Debian is not GNU IceWeasel now GNU IceCat but rather a rebranded Firefox created by the Debian project The Debian maintainer has stated that he will get in touch with the GNU IceCat IceWeasel team to see what we can do together Similarly Debian renamed Mozilla Thunderbird and SeaMonkey to Icedove and Iceape respectively br br br Rebranding br According to the Debian Package Tracking System Iceweasel Icedove and Iceape were first accepted into the Debian project s unstable repository on November on October and on December respectively Icedove migrated to Etch and Thunderbird was removed on November Iceape migrated to Etch on January the old Mozilla suite having previously been removed on October Iceweasel migrated and Firefox was removed on January Debian s first stable release to include Iceweasel Icedove and Iceape was Debian Etch released April Soon after the renaming Debian also replaced Mozilla s unbranded logos with new logos designed to fit with the new names drawn by Ricardo Fernandez Fuentes br br br User agent sniffing br br Some web sites do not recognize the browsers user agent strings and refuse to work properly As a workaround Iceweasel adds a like Firefox x x x string to the user agent br br br Firefox issue resolution br As described by Sylvestre Ledru in a bug in the Debian bug tracking system Mozilla and Debian agreed on renaming Iceweasel to Firefox Mozilla recognizes that Debian potential changes are not impacting the quality of the release br Debian users who performed a dist upgrade in June received the following system message According to Chris Hoffman of PC World After a decade Debian and Mozilla are burying the hatchet Iceweasel is about to re assume its proper name br br iceweasel esr unstable urgency medium br br The iceweasel package was replaced with the firefox esr package br br Preferences under etc iceweasel prefs will need to be copied manually br to etc firefox esr br Other customizations under etc iceweasel will need additional manual br steps through CCK or addons br The developers of Parabola GNU Linux libre picked up the Iceweasel project and it continues to be maintained br br br Licensing br The rebranded programs are available under Mozilla s standard MPL GPL LGPL tri license Like Mozilla the default icons are under the same tri license but unlike Mozilla there are no trademark restrictions br br br See also br br Firefox version history br br br
