Stephen Wozniak born August also known by his nickname Woz is an American technology entrepreneur electrical engineer computer programmer philanthropist and inventor In he co founded Apple Computer with his early business partner Steve Jobs Through his work at Apple in the s and s he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution br In Wozniak started developing the Apple I into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year He was the primary designer of the Apple II introduced in known as one of the first highly successful mass produced microcomputers while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply br With human computer interface expert Jef Raskin Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Macintosh concepts from to when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak s brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident After permanently leaving Apple in Wozniak founded CL and created the first programmable universal remote released in He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his career focusing largely on technology in K schools br As of June Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in In recent years he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts dealing in areas such as GPS and telecommunications flash memory technology and pop culture conventions technical education ecology satellites and more br br Stephen Gary Wozniak was born on August in San Jose California His mother Margaret Louise Wozniak n e Kern was from Washington state and his father Francis Jacob Jerry Wozniak of Michigan was an engineer for the Lockheed Corporation Wozniak graduated from Homestead High School in in Cupertino California Steve has one brother Mark Wozniak a former tech executive who lives in Menlo Park He also has one sister Leslie Wozniak She attended Homestead High School in Cupertino She is a grant adviser at Five Bridges Foundation which helps at risk youths in San Francisco She once said it was her mother who introduced activism to her and her siblings br The name on Wozniak s birth certificate is Stephan Gary Wozniak but his mother said that she intended it to be spelled Stephen which is what he uses He has mentioned the surname Wozniak being Polish In the early s Wozniak s blue box design earned him the nickname Berkeley Blue in the phreaking community Wozniak has credited watching Star Trek and attending Star Trek conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting Apple Computer In his autobiography iWoz he also credits the Tom Swift Jr books as an inspiration for becoming an engineer br br In Wozniak returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after being expelled from the University of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking the university s computer system He re enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino before transferring to the University of California Berkeley in In June of that year for a self taught engineering project Wozniak designed and built his first computer with his friend Bill Fernandez br Predating useful microprocessors screens and keyboards and using punch cards and only TTL chips donated by an acquaintance they named it Cream Soda after their favorite beverage A newspaper reporter stepped on the power supply cable and blew up the computer but it served Wozniak as a good prelude to my thinking years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers Before focusing his attention on Apple he was employed at Hewlett Packard HP where he designed calculators It was during this time that he dropped out of Berkeley and befriended Steve Jobs br Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by Fernandez who attended Homestead High School with Jobs in Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at HP where Wozniak too was employed working on a mainframe computer br br We first met in during my college years while he was in high school A friend said you should meet Steve Jobs because he likes electronics and he also plays pranks So he introduced us br br Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled Secrets of the Little Blue Box from the October issue of Esquire and started to build his own blue boxes that enabled one to make long distance phone calls at no cost Jobs who handled the sales of the blue boxes managed to sell some two hundred of them for each and split the profit with Wozniak Jobs later told his biographer that if it had not been for Wozniak s blue boxes there wouldn t have been an Apple br In Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari Inc in Los Gatos California He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout According to Atari co founder Nolan Bushnell Atari offered equivalent to in for each chip that was eliminated in the machine Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips Wozniak reduced the number of chips by by using RAM for the brick representation The fact that this prototype had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz s prototype could not be used Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only and that Wozniak s share was thus equivalent to in Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus equivalent to in until ten years later While dismayed he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money Wozniak would have given it to him br In Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him famous the Apple I With the Apple I Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto based Homebrew Computer Club a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing The club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades Unlike other custom Homebrew designs the Apple had an easy to achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled br br Wozniak designed Apple s first products the Apple I and II computers and he helped design the Macintosh because he wanted to use them and they didn t exist br Between Woz and Jobs Woz was the innovator the inventor Steve Jobs was the marketing person br Everything I did at Apple that was an A job and that took us places I had two things in my favor I had no money and I had had no training br br By March Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer He alone designed the hardware circuit board designs and operating system for the computer Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there but was denied by the company on five occasions Jobs then advised Wozniak to start a business of their own to build and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I Wozniak at first skeptical was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandchildren that they had had their own company To raise the money they needed to build the first batch of the circuit boards Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen van br On April Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company now called Apple Inc along with administrative supervisor Ronald Wayne whose participation in the new venture was short lived The two decided on the name Apple shortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent on an apple orchard there br After the company was formed Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club to give a presentation of the fully assembled version of the Apple I Paul Terrell who was starting a new computer shop in Mountain View California called the Byte Shop saw the presentation and was impressed by the machine Terrell told Jobs that he would order units of the Apple I and pay equivalent to in each on delivery but only if they came fully assembled as he was not interested in buying bare printed circuit boards br Together the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs s parents Los Altos home initially in his bedroom and later when there was no space left in the garage Wozniak s apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors electronic devices and computer games that he had developed The Apple I sold for Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits They sold their first system boards to Terrell later that year br br In November Jobs and Wozniak received substantial funding from a then semi retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula At the request of Markkula Wozniak resigned from his job at HP and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple Wozniak s Apple I was similar to the Altair the first commercially available microcomputer except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards With expansion cards the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC In contrast the Apple I was a hobbyist machine Wozniak s design included a CPU MOS on a single circuit board with bytes of ROM K or K bytes of RAM and a character by row display controller Apple s first computer lacked a case power supply keyboard and display all components that had to be provided by the user Eventually about Apple I computers were produced in total br br After the success of the Apple I Wozniak designed the Apple II the first personal computer with the ability to display color graphics and BASIC programming language built in Inspired by the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a US chip while colors in the PAL system are achieved by accident when a dot occurs on a line and he says that to this day he has no idea how it works During the design stage Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots while Wozniak wanted eight After a heated argument during which Wozniak threatened that Jobs should go get himself another computer they decided to go with eight slots Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the April West Coast Computer Faire Wozniak s first article about the Apple II was in Byte magazine in May It became one of the first highly successful mass produced personal computers in the world Wozniak also designed the Disk II floppy disk drive released in specifically for use with the Apple II to replace the slower cassette tape storage br In Apple went public to instant and significant financial profitability making Jobs and Wozniak both millionaires The Apple II s intended successor the Apple III released the same year was a commercial failure and was discontinued in According to Wozniak the Apple III had percent hardware failures and that the primary reason for these failures was that the system was designed by Apple s marketing department unlike Apple s previous engineering driven projects br br During the early design and development phase of the original Macintosh Wozniak had a heavy influence over the project along with Jef Raskin who conceived the computer Later named the Macintosh k it would become the first mass market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse The Macintosh would also go on to introduce the desktop publishing industry with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter the first laser printer to feature vector graphics In a interview Wozniak said that in Steve Jobs really took over the project when I had a plane crash and wasn t there br br On February the Beechcraft Bonanza A TC which Wozniak was piloting and not qualified to operate crashed soon after takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley California The airplane stalled while climbing then bounced down the runway broke through two fences and crashed into an embankment Wozniak and his three passengers then fianc e Candice Clark her brother Jack Clark and Jack s girlfriend Janet Valleau were injured Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries including losing a tooth and also suffered for the following five weeks from anterograde amnesia the inability to create new memories He had no memory of the crash and did not remember his name while in the hospital or the things he did for a time after he was released He would later state that Apple II computer games were what helped him regain his memory The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash br Wozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the airplane crash seeing it as a good reason to leave Infinite Loop characterized this time Coming out of the semi coma had been like flipping a reset switch in Woz s brain It was as if in his thirty year old body he had regained the mind he d had at eighteen before all the computer madness had begun And when that happened Woz found he had little interest in engineering or design Rather in an odd sort of way he wanted to start over fresh br br Later in after recovering from the plane crash Wozniak re enrolled at UC Berkeley to complete his Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences degree that he started there in and which he would finish in Because his name was well known at this point he enrolled under the name Rocky Raccoon Clark which is the name listed on his diploma although he did not officially receive his degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences until br In May and Wozniak with help from professional concert promoter Bill Graham founded the company Unuson an abbreviation of unite us in song which sponsored two US Festivals with US pronounced like the pronoun not as initials Initially intended to celebrate evolving technologies the festivals ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music computers television and people After losing several million dollars on the festival Wozniak stated that unless the event turned a profit he would end his involvement with rock festivals and get back to designing computers Later that year Wozniak returned to Apple product development desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce br br Starting in the mid s as the Macintosh experienced slow but steady growth Apple s corporate leadership including Steve Jobs increasingly disrespected its flagship cash cow Apple II series and Wozniak along with it The Apple II division other than Wozniak was not invited to the Macintosh introduction event and Wozniak was seen kicking the dirt in the parking lot Although Apple II products provided about of Apple s sales in early the company s January annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or its employees a typical situation that frustrated Wozniak br br Even with the success he had helped to create at Apple Wozniak believed that the company was hindering him from being who he wanted to be and that it was the bane of his existence He enjoyed engineering not management and said that he missed the fun of the early days As other talented engineers joined the growing company he no longer believed he was needed there By early Wozniak left Apple again and sold most of his stock Media coverage attributed his departure to disagreements with Apple management quoting his statement that Apple had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years but Wozniak later objected to this portrayal and stated that he left primarily because he was excited to start CL and recapture the fun of developing a new technology br The Apple II platform financially carried the company well into the Macintosh era of the late s it was made semi portable with the Apple IIc of and was extended with some input from Wozniak by the bit Apple IIGS of and was discontinued altogether when the Apple IIe was discontinued on November although the Apple IIe card which allowed compatible Macintosh computers to run Apple II software and use certain Apple II peripherals was produced until May br br After his career at Apple Wozniak founded CL in which developed and brought the first programmable universal remote control to market in called the CORE Beyond engineering Wozniak s second lifelong goal had always been to teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students lives Eventually he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades and teachers as well Unuson continued to support this funding additional teachers and equipment br In Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus WOZ to create wireless GPS technology to help everyday people find everyday things much more easily In he joined the board of directors of Ripcord Networks Inc joining Apple alumni Ellen Hancock Gil Amelio Mike Connor and Wheels of Zeus co founder Alex Fielding in a new telecommunications venture Later the same year he joined the board of directors of Danger Inc the maker of the Hip Top br In Wheels of Zeus was closed and Wozniak founded Acquicor Technology a holding company for acquiring technology companies and developing them with Apple alumni Hancock and Amelio From through he was chief scientist at Fusion io In he became chief scientist at Primary Data which was founded by some former Fusion io executives Silicon Valley Comic Con SVCC is an annual pop culture and technology convention at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose California The convention was co founded by Wozniak and Rick White with Trip Hunter as CEO Wozniak announced the annual event in along with Marvel legend Stan Lee In October Wozniak founded Woz U an online educational technology service for independent students and employees As of December Woz U was licensed as a school with the Arizona state board br Though permanently leaving Apple as an active employee in Wozniak chose to never remove himself from the official employee list and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role estimated in to be US per year He is also an Apple shareholder He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs s death in October However in Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close as they used to be br In a interview Wozniak said that the original Macintosh failed under Steve Jobs and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group idiots for making the Lisa computer too expensive To compete with the Lisa Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer one that according to Wozniak was weak lousy and still at a fairly high price He made it by cutting the RAM down by forcing you to swap disks here and there says Wozniak He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away br At the end of Wozniak announced the launch of a new company helmed by him Efforce Efforce is described as a marketplace for funding ecologically friendly projects It used a WOZX cryptocurrency token for funding and blockchain to redistribute the profit to token holders and businesses engaged on the platform In September it was reported that Wozniak was also starting a company alongside co founder Alex Fielding named Privateer Space to address the problem of space debris Privateer Space debuted the first version of its space traffic monitoring software on March br br Wozniak is listed as the sole inventor on the following Apple patents br br US Patent No

for digitally controlling PAL color display br US Patent No Digitally controlled color signal generation means for use with display br br In Wozniak helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation providing some of the organization s initial funding and serving on its founding Board of Directors He is the founding sponsor of the Tech Museum Silicon Valley Ballet and Children s Discovery Museum of San Jose Also since leaving Apple Wozniak has provided all the money and much onsite technical support for the technology program in his local school district in Los Gatos Un U Son Unite Us In Song an organization Wozniak formed to organize the two US festivals is now primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic projects In Wozniak lent his name to the Stephen G Wozniak Achievement Awards popularly known as Wozzie Awards which he presented to six Bay Area high school and college students for their innovative use of computers in the fields of business art and music Wozniak is the subject of a student made film production of his friend s Joe Patane nonprofit Dream Camp Foundation for high level need youth entitled Camp Woz The Admirable Lunacy of Philanthropy br br In March Wozniak stated that while he had originally dismissed Ray Kurzweil s opinion that machine intelligence would outpace human intelligence within several decades Wozniak had changed his mind I agree that the future is scary and very bad for people If we build these devices to take care of everything for us eventually they ll think faster than us and they ll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently Wozniak stated that he had started to identify a contradictory sense of foreboding about artificial intelligence while still supporting the advance of technology br By June Wozniak changed his mind again stating that a superintelligence takeover would be good for humans They re going to be smarter than us and if they re smarter than us then they ll realise they need us We want to be the family pet and be taken care of all the time I got this idea a few years ago and so I started feeding my dog filet steak and chicken every night because do unto others br In Wozniak changed his mind again stating that he no longer worried about the possibility of superintelligence emerging because he is skeptical that computers will be able to compete with human intuition A computer could figure out a logical endpoint decision but that s not the way intelligence works in humans Wozniak added that if computers do become superintelligent they re going to be partners of humans over all other species just forever br Wozniak signed a open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for all AI labs to immediately pause for at least months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT In an interview to the BBC in May Wozniak said that AI may make scams more difficult to detect noting that AI is so intelligent it s open to the bad players the ones that want to trick you about who they are br br Wozniak lives in Los Gatos California He applied for Australian citizenship in and has stated that he would like to live in Melbourne Australia in the future

friend Steve Jobs WoZ short for Wheels of Zeus is the name of a company he founded in it closed in br Wozniak describes his impetus for joining the Freemasons in as being able to spend more time with his then wife Alice Robertson who belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star associated with the Masons He was initiated in at Charity Lodge No in Campbell California now part of Mt Moriah Lodge No in Los Gatos Today he is no longer involved I did become a Freemason and know what it s about but it doesn t really fit my tech geek personality Still I can be polite to others from other walks of life
