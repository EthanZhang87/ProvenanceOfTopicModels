Jobs took medical leave from Apple to battle pancreatic cancer Director Joshua Michael Stern stated in an interview that all material for the screenplay was collected via research and interviews br br Mark Hulme our producer had an expert team of researchers to comb through all public records and interviews that had anything to do with Steve Jobs Mark the screenwriter and the research team also took it upon themselves to interview quite a large pool of people who either worked at Apple or worked with Steve to make sure we portrayed as accurate a portrait and telling of the events possible within the constraints of the film s length br br br Filming br Production began in June at Jobs childhood home in Los Altos California with the help of Jobs stepmother Marilyn Jobs who still lives

Khoya Khoya Chand served as cinematographer for scenes shot in India though cinematographer Russell Carpenter went to India as well Bajaj notes that they shot guerrilla style in the crazy and mad by lanes of Chandni Chowk in Old Delhi We shot near the Red Fort and the famous Jama Masjid for two full days with multiple cameras spread across everywhere Ashton stood frozen with the chaos staring right in his face which helped us capture what Steve Jobs must have felt on his visit to India br br br Release br The Business Insider described the film s opening as a box office bomb earning million in its first weekend and placing seventh overall br It had a worldwide gross of million against its million budget making the film a modest box office success br br br Reception br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads An ambitious but skin deep portrait of an influential complex figure Jobs often has the feel of an over sentimentalized made for TV biopic Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br E Online said Critics have taken the film to task for a reach that falls far short of its ambition marred by its superficial and unsatisfying portrait of an icon who deserved better Forbes reported that the consensus among critics was mixed positives for Kutcher s performance and a thumbs down for Joshua Michael Stern s film br Robert X Cringely author of Accidental Empires and creator of the documentaries Triumph of the Nerds and Steve Jobs The Lost Interview argues that the film is beautifully shot and Kutcher s portrayal of Jobs while not spot on is pretty darned good He certainly has the look down and the walk But Ashton Kutcher also produced this film and he s definitely a better actor than producer There are a lot of historical inaccuracies that just don t have to be there The great failing of this film is the same failing as with Walter Isaacson s book something happened during Steve s NeXT years which occupy less than seconds of this minute film that turned Jobs from a brat into a leader but they don t bother to cover that Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle states that at its best it s a good picture and at its worst it s almost good Peter Travers of Rolling Stone suggests that Kutcher nails the genius and narcissism It s a quietly dazzling performance but also notes that Jobs is a one man show that needed to go for broke and doesn t My guess is that Jobs would give it a swat br Contributor for rogerebert com Susan Wloszczyna gave the movie two out of four stars saying that Rather than attempting a deeper plunge behind the whys and wherefores of the elite business model gospel according to Apple Inc guru Steve Jobs and more importantly what it says about our culture the filmmakers follow the easy rise fall rise again blueprint familiar to anyone who has seen an episode of VH s Behind the Music She further discusses how Kutcher s performance and the overall movie failed to portray Jobs in the iconic manner that current pop culture suggests even after Jobs passing In a movie review for The New York Times writer Manohla Dargis writes that Jobs was inevitably unsatisfying and a result of a poor performance of the filmmakers rather than the actors themselves br br br Historical accuracy br In a January interview with The Verge Steve Wozniak notes that he was approached by the crew of Jobs and given an early script to read He read it as far as he could stomach it and felt it was crap The Sony people got in contact with me too and in the end I went with them You can t do both films and be paid At around the same time he responded to the first promotional clip for the film on Gizmodo by stating that the personalities are very wrong although mine is closer our relationship was so different than what was portrayed br br In August before the wide release of the film Kutcher responded to these critiques in a few interviews In an interview with the Associated Press Kutcher stated Steve Wozniak is being paid by another company to support their Steve Jobs film It s personal for him but it s also business We have to keep that in mind He was also extremely unavailable to us when producing this film He s a brilliant man and I respect his work but he wasn t available to us as a resource so his account isn t going to be our account because we don t know exactly what it was We did the best job we could Nobody really knows what happened in the rooms He reiterated this point in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter by stating that Wozniak is being paid by another movie studio to help support their Steve Jobs film so he s gonna have an opinion that is connected to that somewhat Wozniak responded to Kutcher s comments as well as to the film itself on Gizmodo by stating that either film would have paid me to consult but the Jobs one already had a script written I can t take that creative leadership from someone else And I was turned off by the Jobs script But I still hoped for a great movie He also believed several individuals portrayed in the film were inaccurately or unfairly portrayed including himself and Steve Jobs Wozniak reiterated these points in an interview with Bloomberg Television adding that he is really easy to get a hold of Kutcher could have called me and consulted over the phone any time The Verge noted that Wozniak was in fact invited to consult on the film but declined after reading the script saying he and his wife were abhorred by it Wozniak was a consultant on Aaron Sorkin s Steve Jobs film When asked why he did not at least correct the inaccuracies he saw Wozniak said I have a very busy life and it came at a very busy time in my life br In an interview with Slashdot Daniel Kottke states that he consulted on early versions of the screenplay and notes that Ashton s very good I have no complaints with him at all no complaints with his portrayal of Jobs The complaint that people would rightly have about the film is that it portrays Woz as not having the same vision as Steve Jobs which is really unfair He also said that the early versions of the screenplay were painful Really painful I forwarded the first draft to Mike Markkula because they wanted his feedback and Mike took such a bad reaction to it he wouldn t have anything more to do with the project By the time it got to the fourth draft it was okay It wasn t making me cringe Kottke also outlines various areas that were both accurate and inaccurate in the film Bill Fernandez was part of the same interview but states that he didn t see the film because the whole thing is a work of fiction and I don t want to be upset by all the things that the screenwriter has invented and don t represent the truth Kottke responded that he didn t think of the film as fiction because I was involved early on in the film and they really sincerely tried to make it as accurate as they could br In the same interview Fernandez and Kottke commented on the characterization of Rod Holt portrayed by actor Ron Eldard Kottke disputed the characterization noting that What completely cracked us all up is the scene where Rod arrives for the first time Rod comes up wearing leathers riding up on a motorcycle with long hair he s like this motorcycle dude It just cracked us all up Fernandez who had not seen the film at the time of the interview was also surprised by this portrayal Holt however according to Kottke thought it was hilarious As for why he may have been characterized this way Kottke states that Rod was really into dirt bikes And I never saw him riding one but he talked about it all the time So the author just had him riding up on a motorcycle I liked that guy I met him on the set I had no idea who he was when I met him because he doesn t look at all like Rod he has long straight hair and he s wearing leathers Fernandez who was equally amused by this vision of Holt responded by asking Who could this possibly be in the Apple universe It seems to me that there s a lot of fan fiction about Apple Computer and about Steve Jobs and I think that this is the biggest flashiest piece of fan fiction that there s been to date br br Chris Espinosa stated on Twitter FYI My position at Apple precludes my commenting on the JobsMovie with the press or public But I can say that I enjoyed watching the film br The TV show John Wants Answers took Wozniak Kottke and Andy Hertzfeld through the film scene by scene and discussed how the events actually occurred br br br Original soundtrack br A number of classic rock classical music and contemporary works appeared in the film The commercial film soundtrack focuses on an original score by John Debney and includes some but not all of the classical and classic rock works br br br See also br br List of depictions of Steve Jobs br br br br br br Further reading br Gruman Galen The Steve Jobs story you should see isn t told in Jobs Jobs
