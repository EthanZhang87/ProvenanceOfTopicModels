Pirates of Silicon Valley is a American biographical drama television film directed by Martyn Burke and starring Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates Spanning the years and based on Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine s book Fire in the Valley The Making of the Personal Computer it explores the impact that the rivalry between Jobs Apple Computer and Gates Microsoft had on the development of the personal computer The film premiered on TNT on June br br br Plot br Steve Jobs is speaking with director Ridley Scott about the creation of the advertisement for Apple Computer which introduced the first Macintosh Jobs is trying to convey his idea that We re creating a completely new consciousness Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the advertisement br Next in with Jobs returning to Apple and announcing a new deal with Microsoft at the Macworld Expo His partner Steve Woz Wozniak is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between Big Brother and the image of Bill Gates on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement Asking how they got from there to here the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs prior to the forming of Apple br The earliest flashback is in and takes place on the U C Berkeley campus during the period of the student anti war movements Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police They flee and after finding safety Jobs states to Wozniak Those guys think they re revolutionaries They re not revolutionaries we are Wozniak then comments that Steve was never like you or me He always saw things differently Even when I was in Berkeley I would see something and just see kilobytes or circuit boards while he d see karma or the meaning of the universe br Using a similar structure the film next turns to a young Bill Gates at Harvard University in the early s with classmate Steve Ballmer and Gates s high school friend Paul Allen As with Wozniak in the earlier segment Ballmer narrates Gates s story particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of Ed Roberts s MITS Altair causing him to drop out of Harvard Gates s and Allen s early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the Homebrew Computer Club Jobs and Woz develop Apple Computer in the garage of Jobs s family home with the help of Daniel and Elizabeth Eventually Mike Markkula invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward In Jobs Woz and Markkula demo the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire This event is followed by the development of the IBM PC with the help of Gates and Microsoft in br The film follows Jobs s relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee Arlene a pseudonym for Chrisann Brennan and the difficulties he had with acknowledging his parental legitimacy of their daughter Lisa Around the time she was born Jobs unveiled his next computer which he named Lisa The Lisa was followed in by the Macintosh both having been inspired by the Xerox Alto br On the eve of the release of Windows and with Microsoft s licensing deal with NEC undercutting Apple s dealings in Japan Jobs and Gates have a bitter falling out Jobs claimed that Gates completely ripped off of Apple s design Gates responds by saying that Apple had done the same thing to Xerox and rather that it was analogous to both of them stealing from a rich neighbor who left their door unlocked The main body of the film finally concludes with a th birthday toast in to Steve Jobs shortly before he was forced out of Apple by CEO John Sculley br The film ends in with the return of year old Jobs to Apple after its acquisition of NeXT Computer and with his announcement at the MacWorld Expo of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft It also indicates that Jobs is now married has children and has reconciled with Lisa br br br

br br Development br Burke notes that when he was shown the first draft of the screenplay which is based upon Freiberger and Swaine s Fire in the Valley It was all about how the computer became the and so on I was bored by it After the studio asked him for suggestions Burke states that I m a great believer in Shakespeare and what we had was a modern equivalent of Hamlet featuring two young princes Bill Gates and Steve Jobs the more I read about Steve in particular the more I saw him in those Shakespearean terms He was brilliant volcanic obsessive suspicious even vicious in a business sense He was about conquest always conquest I said That s the sort of movie I want to make Burke was thus hired as director of the project and rewrote the screenplay In developing the characters themselves Burke also stated that he chose not to speak with any of the central figures portrayed in the film br br I did not want to do an authorized biography on either Microsoft or Apple so we made the decision going in that we would not talk or meet with them With a team of Harvard researchers I embarked on a seven month research project that encompassed virtually everything we could find on the history of both companies including old technical magazines from the s I intended every scene to be based on actual events including such seemingly fantastic moments as Bill Gates s bulldozer races in the middle of the night and Steve Jobs s bare feet going up on the board room table during an applicant s job interview I have two or more sources that verify each scene br br br Casting br br Burke sought Noah Wyle for the part of Jobs Wyle originally turned down the role but changed his mind after Burke had him watch the documentary Triumph of the Nerds Wyle states that he watched the documentary for ten seconds and knew I d kick myself for the rest of my life if I didn t play this part He also noted that Triumph of the Nerds led him to be taken by Jobs s presence his confidence smugness smartness ego and his story s trajectory He seemed to be the most Shakespearean figure in American culture in the last years I could think of the rise of the fall of and the return of The truest definition of a tragic hero but you get the bonus round that F Scott Fitzgerald said didn t exist Jobs has had one hell of a second act Burke later credited Wyle for the success of the film stating that whatever was in the air Wyle just absorbed it he became Jobs It was a remarkable transformation We had a photo of Steve Jobs at about years old from the cover of Fortune magazine We did a mockup with Noah and it was almost impossible to tell them apart Burke also credits Joey Slotnick s interpretation of Steve Wozniak with Wozniak s enthusiasm for the film Wozniak was so impressed that he flew to Los Angeles to have lunch with Slotnick Burke notes that Steve Wozniak made several speeches in which he said that the film accurately portrays how things actually happened To me that was better than any awards or nominations the film could get br Anthony Michael Hall who was cast as Bill Gates commented on his interest in the role stating that he really fought for this part because I knew it would be the role of a lifetime it was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance br br br Filming br Pirates of Silicon Valley was originally scheduled to be shot in Toronto with more than million in sets However when Wyle was unable to receive a long enough release from ER to shoot in Canada the film temporarily shut down Filming began again later in Los Angeles During the filming the cast broke down into PC and Mac factions arguing over the merits of each platform Burke states that he began the film as a PC user and ended a Mac user br br br Themes br Young Steve Jobs participated in aspects of the s counterculture Actor Noah Wyle who portrays Jobs stated in an interview with CNN These kids grew up miles south of the University of California Berkeley campus which was ripe with revolution and they couldn t have cared less about the politics going on They were in the garage tinkering with their electronics and starting a revolution that was a thousand times greater than anything that was going on the college campuses politically Director Martyn Burke also noted in an interview that Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are the true revolutionaries of our time Not the students who occupied the dean s office in the late s Not the anti war marchers who were determined to overthrow the establishment Jobs and Gates are the ones who changed the way the world thinks acts and communicates br br br Music br The soundtrack consists of classic rock disco and new wave from the s s and early mid s br The piano song that is playing in the scene when Steve Jobs accuses Bill Gates of stealing Apple s ideas is not on the soundtrack That omission sparked a search that lasted a few years until it was eventually found to be Soliloquy by English composer Tony Hymas The song was originally published in the collection The Piano Album correctly fitting the movie events timeline br br br Reception br br br Critical response br br On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of br Ray Richmond of Variety states that it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and a wildly entertaining geek tragedy with the stylistic feel of true art br John Leonard of New York Magazine refers to it as a hoot br Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette argues that the film is a fascinating drama filled with Shakespearean twists and betrayals as viewers come to know the geniuses who transformed not only the way we communicate but the way we live br Brian J Dillard of AllMovie argues that thanks to inspired casting and strong writing this well oiled TV biopic managed to transform the unglamorous genesis of the personal computer industry into solid entertainment precisely at the moment when dot com mania was sweeping the nation br Mike Lipton of People found the film to be engagingly irreverent and a real life Revenge of the Nerds that stands cheekily on its own br br br Historical accuracy br br Steve Jobs Bill Gates and Steve Wozniak all responded to the film Jobs s only public response occurred at the Macworld Expo After Pirates of Silicon Valley had aired he contacted Noah Wyle and told him that while he hated both the film and the screenplay he liked Wyle s performance noting you do look like me Jobs then invited Wyle to the Macworld convention to play a prank on the audience Wyle agreed and initially appeared as Jobs until Jobs walked onto the stage and let the audience in on the joke In contrast Jobs avoided meeting the director Martyn Burke who later said that Steve wanted nothing to do with me In a Ask Me Anything session with Reddit Gates responded to a question about his portrayal in the film by stating that it was reasonably accurate br Wozniak had a positive response to the film and discussed it in detail with fans on his official website Wozniak said that many aspects of the film were accurate stating that when the movie opened with a scene of tear gas and riots I thought My God That s just how it was He also responded to a fan email that some of his portrayal was inaccurate I never quit Apple That suggestion was based on an incorrect Wall Street Journal article that said I was leaving Apple because I didn t like things there Actually I had told the Wall Street Journal writer that I wasn t leaving Apple because of things that I didn t like and that I wasn t even leaving keeping my small salary forever as a loyal employee I just wanted a small startup experience and a chance to design a smaller product again a universal remote control In May Wozniak once again commented on the film stating that Pirates of Silicon Valley is an example of a good Hollywood dramatization of himself Steve Jobs and the story of Apple Inc He described Pirates of Silicon Valley as intriguing interesting I loved watching it every one of those incidences occurred and it occurred with the meaning that was shown in the film br A college friend of Jobs and early Apple employee Daniel Kottke also liked the film He noted in an interview that it was a great movie Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs Just unbelievable I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen He also states that in the film there were all these scenes of the garage where it s like half a dozen people working busily carrying things back and forth and oscilloscopes when he Kottke was really the only person who worked in the garage Woz would show up once a week with his latest to test it out and Steve Jobs was on the phone a lot in the kitchen br Two individuals have responded to the film s interpretation of the visit of Jobs and his team to the Xerox PARC research center which influenced the development of both the Lisa and Macintosh computers PARC s director John Seely Brown stated in a interview that the scene in which Gates and Jobs argue about the role of Xerox is not entirely accurate He said that Jobs was invited by PARC to view their technology in exchange for the ability to buy pre IPO Apple stock Wozniak said Apple worked with Xerox openly to bring their developments to a mass audience That s what Steve portrayed Apple as being good at Xerox got a lot of Apple stock for it too it was an agreement Microsoft just took it from Xerox or Apple or whomever It took them a long time to get it halfway right
