and Jobs s relationship began in while in high school Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed College In mid Jobs moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area They remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people br After Brennan graduated from high school she went to visit Jobs at the All One Farm a commune in Oregon Brennan was deeply influenced by the experience of meeting and working with the people that she met there In early Brennan became involved with a Zen Buddhist community in Los Altos It was through this community she would meet and work with the Zen master Kobun Brennan was also deeply involved in her art program at Foothill College where she studied under Gordon Holler br At this time she fell in love with Greg Calhoun Jobs former Reed classmate who had come to visit from the All One Farm Brennan moved to the All One Farm and lived with Calhoun They eventually moved back to the Bay Area then traveled for a year through India though their relationship ended by the time she returned to the United States br br br Apple br After her return from India Brennan visited Jobs whom she now considered just a friend at his parents home where he was still living It was during this period that Jobs and Brennan fell in love again as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to K bun Chino Otogawa whom she was also still following It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room Brennan notes a shift in this time period where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple and Kobun By the early she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at Duveneck Ranch in Los Altos which served as a hostel and environmental education center Brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm br As Jobs and Apple became more successful his relationship with Brennan grew more complex In Brennan Daniel Kottke and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino Brennan notes that Jobs wanted the three of them to live together because Steve told me that he didn t want to get a house with just the two of us because it felt insufficient to him Steve wanted his buddy Daniel to live with him because he believed it would break up the intensity of what wasn t working between us Our relationship was running hot and cold We were completely crazy about each other and utterly bored in turns I had suggested to Steve that we separate but he told me that he just couldn t bring himself to say good bye In addition Jobs initially suggested that all three of them each have separate rooms They were still involved with each other but even then Brennan states that in her memory of the time I recalled how awful he was becoming and how I was starting to flounder When she moved into the house she had initially planned to commit to becoming an artist However she also needed to find work and eventually took a position at Apple in the Shipping Department where she was part of a team that tested assembled and shipped Apple IIs with Mark Johnson and Bob Martinengo whom she enjoyed working with She also took art classes at nearby De Anza College br Brennan s relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew and she began to consider ending the relationship In October Brennan was approached by Apple employee Rod Holt who asked her to take a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples Both Holt and Jobs felt that it would be a good position for her given her artistic abilities Brennan s decision however was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father It took her a few days to tell Jobs whose face according to Brennan turned ugly at the news According to Brennan at the beginning of her third trimester Jobs said to her I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion I just didn t want to do that He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her Brennan herself felt confused about what to do She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun who encouraged her to have and keep the baby as he would lend his support Meanwhile Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship stating that she could be pregnant and work at Apple you can take the job I don t get what the problem is Brennan however notes that she felt so ashamed the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple with the child being his while he was unpredictable in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous I could not have endured it Brennan thus turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple She states that Jobs told her If you give up this baby for adoption you will be sorry and I am never going to help you br br br Lisa Brennan Jobs br Now alone Brennan was on welfare and cleaning houses to earn money She would sometimes ask Jobs for money but he always refused Brennan hid her pregnancy for as long as she could living in a variety of homes and continuing her work with Zen meditation At the same time according to Brennan Jobs started to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile which meant that this could not be his child A few weeks before she was due Brennan was invited to have her baby at the All One Farm in Oregon and Brennan accepted the offer br At the age of Brennan gave birth to her daughter Lisa Brennan on May Jobs did not attend the birth He eventually visited after he was contacted by Robert Friedland their mutual friend and owner of the All One Farm While distant Jobs worked with Brennan on a name for the baby She suggested the name Lisa and says that Jobs was very attached to the name Lisa while he was also publicly denying paternity She would discover later that Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name She states that she never gave him permission to use the baby s name for a computer and he hid the plans from her Jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase Local Integrated System Architecture as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa decades later however Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that obviously it was named for my daughter br Brennan explored adoption both before and after Lisa s birth but ultimately decided to become a single parent Once while staying with friends in the Bay Area Jobs stopped by to see her Brennan states that they went for a walk when Jobs said to her I am really sorry I ll be back this thing with Apple will be over when I m about thirty I am really really sorry Around the same time she met with Kobun who distanced himself from her and did not fulfill his promise to help her once the baby was born br Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs who claimed that she doesn t want money she just wants me According to Brennan Apple s Mike Scott wanted Jobs to give her money while other Apple executives advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement Brennan also notes that later after Jobs was forced out of Apple he apologized many times over for this behavior He said that he never took responsibility when he should have and that he was sorry By this time Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa who wanted her name changed and Jobs agreed So he had her name on her birth certificate changed from Lisa Brennan to Lisa Brennan Jobs br When Lisa was a baby and Jobs continued to deny paternity a DNA paternity test was given that established him as Lisa s father He was required to give Brennan a month and return the money she had received from welfare Jobs gave her a month at the time when Apple went public and Jobs became a millionaire Brennan worked as a waitress in Palo Alto Later Brennan agreed to give an interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine It would be for its Person of the Year special released on January She decided to be honest about her relationship with Jobs The Time magazine issue had a lifelong impact on Brennan Rather than give Jobs the Person of the Year award Time offered the award of Machine of the Year The Computer Moves In In the issue Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test which stated that the probability of paternity for Jobs Steven is Jobs responded by arguing that of the male population of the United States could be the father Time also noted that the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name Lisa After this issue Brennan didn t pay much attention to Steve s career again br Over the years however Brennan and Jobs developed a working relationship to co parent Lisa particularly after he was forced out of Apple Brennan credits the change in him to the influence of his newly found biological sister Mona Simpson who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs br According to Fortune Brennan wrote a letter to Jobs in and another in in which she said she would abandon writing her memoirs if Jobs would supply her with financial compensation of US million for the suffering she went through as a single mother br br br Painter br During the late s Brennan decided to finish her formal education and began to study at the California College of Arts and Crafts where she was able to transfer her units from Foothill College She asked Jobs to pay her tuition He agreed to this request and according to Brennan was quite happy to do so as part of his developing relationship with Lisa In she transferred to the San Francisco Art Institute br Brennan has lived in Monterey California while working as a professional painter She describes her art as
