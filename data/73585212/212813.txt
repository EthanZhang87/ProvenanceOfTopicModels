 is an American television commercial that introduced the Apple Macintosh personal computer It was conceived by Steve Hayden Brent Thomas and Lee Clow at Chiat Day produced by New York production company Fairbanks Films and directed by Ridley Scott The ad was an allusion to George Orwell s noted novel Nineteen Eighty Four which described a dystopian future ruled by a televised Big Brother English athlete Anya Major performed as the unnamed heroine and David Graham as Big Brother In the US it first aired in local outlets including Twin Falls Idaho where Chiat Day ran the ad on December at the last possible break before midnight on KMVT so that the advertisement qualified for the Clio Awards Its second televised airing and only US national airing was on January during a break in the third quarter of the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS br In one interpretation of the commercial used the unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh indicated by her white tank top with a stylized line drawing of Apple s Macintosh computer on it as a means of saving humanity from conformity Big Brother br Originally a subject of contention within Apple it has subsequently been called a watershed event and a masterpiece in advertising In The Clio Awards added it to its Hall of Fame and Advertising Age placed it on the top of its list of greatest commercials br In January Apple also launched the invent advertisement for Macintosh in France br br The commercial opens with a dystopian industrial setting in blue and grayish tones showing a line of people marching in unison through a long tunnel monitored by a string of telescreens This is in sharp contrast to the full color shots of the nameless runner Anya Major She looks like a competitive track and field athlete wearing an athletic uniform red athletic shorts running shoes a white tank top with a cubist picture of Apple s Macintosh computer a white sweat band on her left wrist and a red one on her right and is carrying a large brass headed sledgehammer Rows of marching minions evoke the opening scenes of Metropolis br br As she is chased by four police officers presumably agents of the Thought Police wearing black uniforms protected by riot gear helmets with visors covering their faces and armed with large night sticks she races towards a large screen with the image of a Big Brother like figure David Graham also seen on the telescreens earlier giving a speech br br Today we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives We have created for the first time in all history a garden of pure ideology where each worker may bloom secure from the pests purveying contradictory thoughts Our Unification of Thoughts is more powerful a weapon than any fleet or army on earth We are one people with one will one resolve one cause Our enemies shall talk themselves to death and we will bury them with their own confusion We shall prevail br The runner now close to the screen hurls the hammer towards it right at the moment Big Brother announces we shall prevail In a flurry of light and smoke the screen is destroyed leaving the audience in shock br br The commercial concludes with a portentous voiceover by actor Edward Grover accompanied by scrolling black text in Apple s early signature Garamond typeface the hazy whitish blue aftermath of the cataclysmic event serves as the background It reads On January th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh And you ll see why won t be like br The screen fades to black as the voiceover ends and the rainbow Apple logo appears br br The commercial was created by the advertising agency Chiat Day of Venice California with copy by Steve Hayden art direction by Brent Thomas and creative direction by Lee Clow The commercial grew out of an abandoned print campaign with a specific theme br br T here are monster computers lurking in big business and big government that know everything from what motels you ve stayed at to how much money you have in the bank But at Apple we re trying to balance the scales by giving individuals the kind of computer power once reserved for corporations br br Ridley Scott whose dystopian sci fi film Blade Runner had been released one and a half years prior was hired by agency producer Richard O Neill to direct it Less than two months after the Super Bowl airing The New York Times reported that Scott filmed it in England for about In writer Ted Friedman said the commercial had a then unheard of production budget of br The actors who appeared in the commercial were paid per day Scott later admitted that he accepted brutal budget constraints because he believed in the ad s concept outlining how the total cost was less than and that he used local skinheads to portray the broken pale drones in the commercial br Steve Jobs and John Sculley were so enthusiastic about the final product that they purchased one and a half minutes of ad time for the Super Bowl annually the most watched television program in America In December they screened the commercial for the Apple Board of Directors To Jobs and Sculley s surprise the entire board hated the commercial However Sculley himself got cold feet and asked Chiat Day to sell off the two commercial spots br Despite the board s dislike of the film Steve Wozniak and others at Apple showed copies to friends and he offered to pay for half of the spot personally if Jobs paid the other half This turned out to be unnecessary Of the original ninety seconds booked Chiat Day resold thirty seconds to another advertiser then claimed they could not sell the other seconds when in fact they did not even try br br In his Apple keynote address Steve Jobs read the following story before showcasing a preview of the commercial br br It is now It appears IBM wants it all Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money Dealers initially welcoming IBM with open arms now fear an IBM dominated and controlled future They are increasingly turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control Apple Will Big Blue dominate the entire computer industry The entire information age Was George Orwell right about br In March Michael Tyler a communications expert quoted by The New York Times said The Apple ad expresses a potential of small computers This potential may not automatically flow from the company s product But if enough people held a shared intent grass roots electronic bulletin boards through which computer users share messages might result in better balancing of political power br In Adelia Cellini writing for Macworld summarized the message br br Let s see an all powerful entity blathering on about Unification of Thoughts to an army of soulless drones only to be brought down by a plucky Apple esque underdog So Big Brother the villain from Apple s Mac ad represented IBM right According to the ad s creators that s not exactly the case The original concept was to show the fight for the control of computer technology as a struggle of the few against the many says TBWA Chiat Day s Lee Clow Apple wanted the Mac to symbolize the idea of empowerment with the ad showcasing the Mac as a tool for combating conformity and asserting originality What better way to do that than have a striking blonde athlete take a sledgehammer to the face of that ultimate symbol of conformity Big Brother br br Art director Brent Thomas said Apple had wanted something to stop America in its tracks to make people think about computers to make them think about Macintosh With about million worth of Macintoshes sold just after the advertisement ran Thomas judged the effort absolutely successful We also set out to smash the old canard that the computer will enslave us he said We did not say the computer will set us free I have no idea how it will work out This was strictly a marketing position br The estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel Nineteen Eighty Four considered the commercial to be a copyright infringement and sent a cease and desist letter to Apple and Chiat Day in April br br Clio Awards br st Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival Grand Prix br Clio Awards Hall of Fame br Advertising Age

Channel s list of the Greatest TV Ads br br Ted Friedman in his text Electric Dreams Computers in American Culture notes the impact of the commercial br br Super Bowl viewers were overwhelmed by the startling ad The ad garnered millions of dollars worth of free publicity as news programs rebroadcast it that night It was quickly hailed by many in the advertising industry as a masterwork Advertising Age named it the s Commercial of the Decade and it continues to rank high on lists of the most influential commercials of all time was never broadcast again adding to its mystique br The ad became a signature representation of Apple computers It was scripted as a thematic element in the docudrama Pirates of Silicon Valley which explores the rise of Apple and Microsoft the film opens and closes with references to the commercial including a re enactment of the heroine running towards the screen of Big Brother and clips of the original commercial br The commercial was also prominent in the th anniversary celebration of the Macintosh in as Apple reposted a new version of the ad on its website and showed it during Jobs s Keynote Address at Macworld Expo in San Francisco California In this updated version an iPod complete with signature white earbuds was digitally added to the heroine Keynote Attendees were given a poster showing the heroine with an iPod as a commemorative gift And the ad has also been cited as the turning point for Super Bowl commercials which had been important and popular before especially Coca Cola s Hey Kid Catch featuring Mean Joe Greene during Super Bowl XIV but after those ads became the most expensive creative and influential advertising set for all television coverage br Revisiting the commercial in Harper s Magazine thirty years after it aired social critic Rebecca Solnit suggested that did not so much herald a new era of liberation as a new era of oppression In the December issue of the magazine she wrote br br I want to yell at that liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer Don t do it Apple is not different That industry is going to give rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration To suicidal underpaid Chinese factory workers whose reality must be like that of the shuffling workers in the commercial If you think a crowd of people staring at one screen is bad wait until you have created a world in which billions of people stare at their own screens even while walking driving eating in the company of friends all of them eternally elsewhere br Media archivist and early Apple supporter Marion Stokes recorded the Super Bowl broadcast featuring the legendary ad which was then featured in the documentary film Recorder The Marion Stokes Project br br In March the advertisement attracted attention again when Hillary a video mashup of the original commercial with footage of Hillary Clinton used in place of Big Brother went viral in the early stages of the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination The video was produced in support of Barack Obama by Phil de Vellis an employee of Blue State Digital but was made without the knowledge of either Obama s campaign or his own employer De Vellis stated that he made the video in one afternoon at home using a Mac and some software Political commentators including Carla Marinucci and Arianna Huffington as well as de Vellis himself suggested that the video demonstrated the way technology had created new opportunities for individuals to make an impact on politics br The The
