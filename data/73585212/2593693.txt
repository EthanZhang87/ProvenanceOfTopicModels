id: 2593693
Apple Inc originally Apple Computer Inc is a multinational corporation that creates and markets consumer electronics and attendant computer software and is a digital distributor of media content Apple s core product lines are the iPhone smartphone iPad tablet computer and the Macintosh personal computer The company offers its products online and has a chain of retail stores known as Apple Stores Founders Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne created Apple Computer Co on April to market Wozniak s Apple I desktop computer and Jobs and Wozniak incorporated the company on January in Cupertino California br For more than three decades Apple Computer was predominantly a manufacturer of personal computers including the Apple II Macintosh and Power Mac lines but it faced rocky sales and low market share during the s Jobs who had been ousted from the company in returned to Apple in after his company NeXT was bought by Apple The following year he became the company s interim CEO which later became permanent Jobs subsequently instilled a new corporate philosophy of recognizable products and simple design starting with the original iMac in br With the introduction of the successful iPod music player in and iTunes Music Store in Apple established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics and media sales industries leading it to drop Computer from the company s name in The company is also known for its iOS range of smartphone media player and tablet computer products that began with the iPhone followed by the iPod Touch and then iPad As of June Apple was the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization with an estimated value of US trillion as of August Apple s worldwide annual revenue in totaled US billion growing to US billion in and billion in br br Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak referred to collectively as the two Steves first met in mid when their mutual friend Bill Fernandez introduced then year old Wozniak to year old Jobs Their first business partnership began in the fall of that year when Wozniak a self educated electronics engineer read an article in Esquire magazine that described a device that could place free long distance phone calls by emitting specific tone chirps Wozniak started to build his original blue boxes which he tested by calling the Vatican City pretending to be Henry Kissinger wanting to speak to the pope Jobs managed to sell some two hundred blue boxes for each and split the profit with Wozniak Jobs later told his biographer that if it hadn t been for Wozniak s blue boxes there wouldn t have been an Apple br By Jobs had withdrawn from Reed College and Wozniak from UC Berkeley Wozniak designed a video terminal that he could use to log on to the minicomputers at Call Computer Alex Kamradt commissioned the design and sold a small number of them through his firm Aside from their interest in up to date technology the impetus for the two Steves seems to have had another source In his essay From Satori to Silicon Valley published cultural historian Theodore Roszak made the point that Apple Computer emerged from within the West Coast counterculture and the need to produce print outs letter labels and databases Roszak offers a bit of background on the development of the two Steves prototype models br In the two Steves started attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club New microcomputers such as the Altair and the IMSAI inspired Wozniak to build a microprocessor into his video terminal circuit to make a complete computer At the time the only microcomputer CPUs generally available were the Intel equivalent to in and the Motorola equivalent to in Wozniak preferred the but both were out of his price range So he watched and learned and designed computers on paper waiting for the day he could afford a CPU br When MOS Technology released its equivalent to in chip in Wozniak wrote a version of BASIC for it then began to design a computer for it to run on The was designed by the same people who designed the as many in Silicon Valley left employers to form their own companies Wozniak s earlier paper computer needed only minor changes to run on the new chip br By March Wozniak completed the machine and took it to a Homebrew Computer Club meeting to show it off When Jobs saw Wozniak s computer which later became the Apple I he was immediately interested in its commercial potential Initially Wozniak intended to share schematics of the machine for free but Jobs insisted that they should instead build and sell bare printed circuit boards for the computer Wozniak originally offered the design to Hewlett Packard HP where he worked at the time but was denied by the company on five occasions Jobs eventually convinced Wozniak to go into business together and start a new company of their own In order to raise the money they needed to produce the first batch of printed circuit boards Jobs sold his Volkswagen Type minibus for and Wozniak his HP programmable calculator for br br On April Apple Computer Company was founded by Steve Jobs Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne The company was registered as a California business partnership br Wayne who worked at Atari Inc as a chief draftsman became a co founder in return for a stake Wayne was gun shy due to the failure of his own venture four years earlier On April less than two weeks after the company s formation Wayne left Apple selling his share back to the two Steves for br According to Wozniak Jobs proposed the name Apple Computer when he had just come back from Robert Friedland s All One Farm in Oregon Jobs told Walter Isaacson that he was on one of my fruitarian diets when he conceived of the name and thought it sounded fun spirited and not intimidating plus it would get us ahead of Atari in the phone book br The two Steves made a last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club and demonstrated the Apple I AKA The Apple Computer Paul Terrell who operated the computer store chain Byte Shop was impressed and gave the two Steves his card asking them to keep in touch The next day Jobs visited Terrell at the Mountain View Byte Shop store and tried to sell him the bare circuit boards for the Apple I Terrell said he was only interested in purchasing the machine fully assembled and that he would order assembled computers and pay US each on delivery equivalent to in Jobs took the purchase order from the Byte Shop to national electronic parts distributor Cramer Electronics and ordered the components needed When asked by the credit manager how he would pay for the parts Jobs replied I have this purchase order from the Byte Shop chain of computer stores for of my computers and the payment terms are COD If you give me the parts on net day terms I can build and deliver the computers in that time frame collect my money from Terrell at the Byte Shop and pay you br To verify the purchase order the credit manager called Paul Terrell who assured him if the computers showed up Jobs would have more than enough money for the parts order The two Steves and their small crew spent day and night building and testing the computers and delivered to Terrell on time Terrell was surprised to receive a batch of assembled circuit boards as he had expected complete computers with a case monitor and keyboard Nonetheless he kept his word and paid the two Steves the money promised br The Apple I went on sale in July as an assembled circuit board with a retail price of Wozniak later said he had had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast and that he came up with the price because he liked repeating digits About units of the Apple I were eventually sold br The Apple I computer had some notable features including the use of a TV display whereas many machines had no display at all This was not like the displays of later machines the text was displayed at characters per second still faster than the teleprinters of contemporary machines of that era The machine had bootstrap code on ROM making it easier to start up At the insistence of Paul Terrell Wozniak designed a cassette interface for loading and saving programs at the then rapid pace of bit s The simple machine was a masterpiece of design using far fewer parts than anything in its class and earned Wozniak his reputation as a designer br Jobs looked for investments to expand the business but banks were reluctant to lend him money the idea of a computer for ordinary people seemed absurd at the time In August Jobs approached his former boss at Atari Nolan Bushnell who recommended that he meet with Don Valentine the founder of Sequoia Capital Valentine was not interested in funding Apple but in turn introduced Jobs to Mike Markkula a millionaire who had worked under him at Fairchild Semiconductor Markkula saw great potential in the two Steves and became an angel investor of their company He invested in Apple out of his own property while securing a equivalent to in line of credit from Bank of America In return Markkula received a one third stake in Apple Apple Computer Inc was incorporated on January The new corporation bought out the partnership the two Steves had formed nine months earlier br In February Markkula recruited Michael Scott from National Semiconductor to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple Computer as the two Steves were both insufficiently experienced and he was not interested in taking that position himself br That same month Wozniak resigned from his job at Hewlett Packard to work full time for Apple br br Almost as soon as Apple had started selling its first computers Wozniak moved on from the Apple I and began designing a greatly improved computer the Apple II Wozniak completed a working prototype of the new machine by August The two Steves presented the Apple II computer to the public at the first West Coast Computer Faire on April and On the first day of the exhibition Jobs introduced the Apple II to a Japanese chemist named Toshio Mizushima who became the first authorized Apple dealer in Japan In the May issue of Byte Wozniak said of the Apple II design To me a personal computer should be small reliable convenient to use and inexpensive br The Apple II went on sale on June with a retail price of The computer s main internal difference from its predecessor was a completely redesigned TV interface which held the display in memory Now not only useful for simple text display the Apple II included graphics and eventually color During the development of the Apple II Jobs pressed for a well designed plastic case and built in keyboard with the idea that the machine should be fully packaged and ready to run out of the box This was almost the case for the Apple I computers but one still needed to plug various parts together and type in the code to run BASIC Jobs wanted the Apple II case to be simple and elegant and hired an industrial designer named Jerry Manock to produce such a case design Apple employee Rod Holt developed the switching power supply br While early Apple II models use ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices they were superseded in by the introduction of a inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II The Disk II system was designed by Wozniak and released with a retail price of br In the Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for what became the first killer application of the business world VisiCalc a spreadsheet So important that the Apple II became what John Markoff described as a VisiCalc accessory the application created a business market for the computer and gave home users an additional reason to buy it compatibility with the office Before VisiCalc Apple had been a distant third place competitor to Commodore and Tandy br The Apple II was one of the three Trinity computers generally credited with creating the home computer market the other two being the Commodore PET and the Tandy Corporation TRS A number of different models of the Apple II were built thereafter including the Apple IIe and Apple IIGS which continued in public use for nearly two decades The Apple II series went on to sell about six million units in total before it was discontinued in br br While the Apple II was already established as a successful business ready platform because of VisiCalc Apple management was not content The Apple III was designed to take on the business environment in an attempt to compete with IBM in the business and corporate computing market The development of the Apple III started in late under the guidance of Wendell Sander and was subsequently developed by a committee headed by Jobs The Apple III was first announced on May with a retail price ranging from br to and released in November br The Apple III was a conservative design for the era however Jobs wanted the heat generated by the electronics to be dissipated through the chassis of the machine rather than by the more usual cooling fan The case was not sufficient to cool the components and the Apple III was prone to overheating causing the integrated circuit chips to disconnect from the motherboard Customers who contacted Apple customer service were told to raise the computers six inches in the air and then let go which would cause the integrated circuits to fall back into place br Thousands of Apple III computers were recalled A new model was introduced in to try to rectify the problems but the damage was already done br br In the July issue of Kilobaud Microcomputing publisher Wayne Green stated that the best consumer ads I ve seen have been those by Apple They are attention getting and they must be prompting sale In August the Financial Times reported that br br Apple Computer the fast growing Californian manufacturer of small computers for the consumer business and educational markets is planning to go public later this year It is the largest private manufacturer in the U S of small computers Founded about five years ago as a small workshop business it has become the second largest manufacturer of small computers after the Radio Shack division of the Tandy company br On December Apple ticker symbol AAPL went public selling million shares at per share per share when adjusting for stock splits as of November generating over million which was more capital than any IPO since Ford Motor Company in Several venture capitalists cashed out reaping billions in long term capital gains By the end of the day the stock rose to per share and millionaires were created including the two Steves Around this time Wozniak offered million of his own stock to early Apple employees something Jobs refused to do Apple s market cap was billion at the end of its first day of trading br In January Apple held its first shareholders meeting as a public company in the Flint Center a large auditorium at nearby De Anza College which is often used for symphony concerts to handle the larger numbers of shareholders post IPO The business of the meeting had been planned so that the voting could be staged in minutes or less In most cases voting proxies are collected by mail and counted days or months before a meeting In this case after the IPO many shares were in new hands br Jobs started his prepared speech but after being interrupted by voting several times he dropped his prepared speech and delivered a long emotionally charged talk about betrayal lack of respect and related topics br br By August Apple was among the three largest microcomputer companies perhaps having replaced Radio Shack as the leader revenue in the first half of the year had already exceeded s million and InfoWorld reported that lack of production capacity was constraining growth Because of VisiCalc businesses purchased of Apple II computers large customers especially preferred Apple br IBM entered the personal computer market that month with the IBM PC in part because it did not want products without IBM logos on customers desks but Apple had many advantages While IBM began with one microcomputer little available hardware or software and a couple of hundred dealers Apple had five times as many dealers in the US and an established international distribution network The Apple II had an installed base of more than customers and hundreds of independent developers offered software and peripherals at least ten databases and ten word processors were available while the PC had no databases and one word processor br The company s customers gained a reputation for devotion and loyalty BYTE in stated that br br There are two kinds of people in the world people who say Apple isn t just a company it s a cause and people who say Apple isn t a cause it s just a company Both groups are right Nature has suspended the principle of noncontradiction where Apple is concerned br Apple is more than just a company because its founding has some of the qualities of myth Apple is two guys in a garage undertaking the mission of bringing computing power once reserved for big corporations to ordinary individuals with ordinary budgets The company s growth from two guys to a billion dollar corporation exemplifies the American Dream Even as a large corporation Apple plays David to IBM s Goliath and thus has the sympathetic role in that myth br The magazine noted that the loyalty was not entirely positive for Apple customers were willing to overlook real flaws in its products even while holding the company to a higher standard than for competitors The Apple III was an example of its autocratic reputation among dealers that one described as Apple arrogance After examining a PC and finding it unimpressive Apple confidently purchased a full page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal with the headline Welcome IBM Seriously The company prioritized the III for three years spending what Wozniak estimated as million on marketing and R D while not improving the Apple II to compete with the PC as doing so could hurt III sales br Microsoft head Bill Gates was at Apple headquarters the day of IBM s announcement and later said They didn t seem to care It took them a full year to realize what had happened The PC almost completely ended sales of the III the company s most comparable product The II still sold well with Apple being the leading computer manufacturer in the United States where million units were sold between and But by the PC surpassed the Apple II as the best selling personal computer IBM recruited the best Apple dealers while avoiding the discount grey market they disliked The head of a retail chain said It appears that IBM had a better understanding of why the Apple II was successful than had Apple Gene Amdahl predicted that Apple would be another of the many brash young companies that IBM had defeated br By the press called the two companies archrivals but IBM had billion in annual PC revenue more than twice that of Apple and as much as the sales of it and the next three companies combined A Fortune survey found that of American companies with personal computers used IBM PCs compared to for Apple Small businesses schools and some homes became the II s primary market br br Apple Computer s business division was focused on the Apple III another iteration of the text based computer Simultaneously the Lisa group worked on a new machine that would feature a completely different interface and introduce the words mouse icon and desktop into the lexicon of the computing public In return for the right to buy US of pre IPO stock Xerox granted Apple Computer three days access to the PARC facilities After visiting PARC they came away with new ideas that would complete the foundation for Apple Computer s first GUI computer the Apple Lisa br The first iteration of Apple s WIMP interface was a floppy disk where files could be spatially moved around After months of usability testing Apple designed the Lisa interface of windows and icons br The Lisa was introduced in at a cost of US equivalent to in Because of the high price Lisa failed to penetrate the business market br br By computer dealers saw Apple as the only clear alternative to IBM s influence some even promoted its products to reduce dependence on the PC The company announced the Macintosh K to the press in October followed by an page brochure included with magazines in December Its debut was announced by a single national broadcast of a US million television commercial equivalent to in Directed by Ridley Scott and aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January it is considered a watershed event and a masterpiece The commercial alludes to George Orwell s novel Nineteen Eighty Four which describes a dystopian future of enforced conformity In the commercial a heroine represents the coming of the Macintosh to save humanity and ends with the words On January th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh And you ll see why won t be like br On January the Macintosh went on sale with a retail price of It came bundled with two applications designed to show off its interface MacWrite and MacPaint On the same day an emotional Jobs introduced the computer to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apple s annual shareholders meeting held in the Flint Auditorium Macintosh engineer Andy Hertzfeld described the scene as pandemonium Jobs had directed the development of the Macintosh since when he took over the project from early Apple employee Jef Raskin who conceived the computer and Wozniak who led the initial design and development with Raskin but was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year making it easier for Jobs to take over the program The Macintosh was based on The Lisa and Xerox PARC s mouse driven graphical user interface and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales supporting it However the slow processing speed and limited software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of br The Macintosh was too radical for some who labeled it a mere toy Because the machine was entirely designed around the GUI existing text mode and command driven applications had to be redesigned and the programming code rewritten this was a challenging undertaking that many software developers shied away from and resulted in an initial lack of software for the new system In April Microsoft s Multiplan migrated over from MS DOS followed by Microsoft Word in January In Lotus Software introduced Lotus Jazz after the success of Lotus for the IBM PC although it was largely a flop Apple introduced Macintosh Office the same year with the lemmings ad infamous for insulting potential customers It was not successful br For a special post election edition of Newsweek in November Apple spent more than US million to buy all of the advertising pages in the issue Apple also ran a Test Drive a Macintosh promotion in which potential buyers with a credit card could take home a Macintosh for hours and return it to a dealer afterwards While people participated dealers disliked the promotion the supply of computers was insufficient for demand and many were returned in such a bad shape that they could no longer be sold This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US equivalent to in to US equivalent to in The Macintosh spawned the concept of Mac evangelism which was pioneered by Apple employee and later Apple Fellow Guy Kawasaki br br By early the Macintosh s failure to defeat the IBM PC triggered a power struggle between Jobs and CEO John Sculley who had been hired two years earlier by Jobs using the famous line Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world Sculley and Jobs visions for the company greatly differed The former favored open architecture computers like the Apple II sold to education small business and home markets less vulnerable to IBM Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the Board Jobs Macintosh division it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies duplicating services Although its products provided of Apple s sales in early the company s January annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees This frustrated Wozniak who left active employment at Apple in the spring of that year to pursue other ventures stating that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years and sold most of his stock Despite these grievances Wozniak left the company amicably and as of January continues to represent Apple at events or in interviews receiving a stipend over the years for this role estimated in to be per year Wozniak also remained an Apple shareholder following his departure br Wozniak s first venture after leaving Apple was founding CL in and creating the first programmable universal remote control two years later called the CORE stating that I never felt like I was turning my back on my own company Apple He told Apple s director of engineering Wayne Rosing about his decision to step away from the company but not his longtime business partner and friend Steve Jobs Wozniak guessed that Jobs first heard the news from an article in The Wall Street Journal where he mentioned that he wasn t leaving because he was disgruntled with Apple but that he was excited to build a new remote control The article nevertheless included some of Wozniak s criticisms of Apple and Wozniak later said it was an accident but it s been picked up by every book and every bit of history since br In April Sculley decided to remove Jobs as the general manager of the Macintosh division and gained unanimous support from the Apple board of directors Rather than submit to Sculley s direction Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple Informed by Jean Louis Gass e Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a coup and called an emergency executive meeting at which Apple s executive staff sided with Sculley and stripped Jobs of all operational duties br br Jobs while taking the position of Chairman of the firm had no influence over Apple s direction and resigned in September taking a number of Apple employees with him to found NeXT Inc In a show of defiance at being set aside by Apple Computer Jobs sold all but one of his million shares in the company for million Jobs then acquired the visual effects house Pixar for M equivalent to in NeXT Inc built computers with futuristic designs and the UNIX derived NEXTSTEP operating system NeXTSTEP eventually developed into Mac OS X While not a commercial success due in part to its high price the NeXT computer introduced important concepts to the history of the personal computer including serving as the initial platform for Tim Berners Lee as he was developing the World Wide Web br Sculley reorganized the company unifying sales and marketing in one division and product operations and development in another Despite initial marketing difficulties the Macintosh brand was eventually a success for Apple due to its introduction of desktop publishing and later computer animation through Apple s partnership with Adobe Systems which introduced the laser printer and Adobe PageMaker The Macintosh became the default platform for many arts industries including cinema music advertising and publishing br br Under leadership of John Sculley Apple issued its first corporate stock dividend on May A month later on June Apple stock split for the first time in a split Apple kept a quarterly dividend with about yield until November Between March and January Apple undertook five acquisitions including software companies Network Innovations Styleware Nashoba Systems and Coral Software as well as satellite communications company Orion Network Systems br Apple continued to sell both lines of its computers the Apple II and the Macintosh A few months after introducing the Mac Apple released a compact version of the Apple II called the Apple IIc And in Apple introduced the Apple IIGS an Apple II positioned as something of a hybrid product with a mouse driven Mac like operating environment Even with the release of the first Macintosh Apple II computers remained the main source of income for Apple for years br br At the same time the Mac was becoming a product family of its own The original model evolved into the Mac Plus in and spawned the Mac SE and the Mac II in and the Mac Classic and Mac LC in Meanwhile Apple attempted its first portable Macs the failed Macintosh Portable in and then the more popular PowerBook in a landmark product that established the modern form and ergonomic layout of the laptop Popular products and increasing revenues made this a good time for Apple MacAddict magazine has called to the first golden age of the Macintosh br On February Apple registered the Apple com domain name making it one of the first hundred companies to register a com address on the nascent Internet br br In the late s Apple s fiercest technological rivals were the Amiga and Atari ST platforms But computers based on the IBM PC were far more popular than all three and by the s they finally had a comparable GUI thanks to Windows and were out competing Apple br Apple s response to the PC threat was a profusion of new Macintosh lines including Quadra Centris and Performa These new lines were marketed poorly by what was now arguably one of the worst managed companies in the industry There were too many models differentiated by very minor graduations in technical specifications The profusion of arbitrary model numbers confused consumers and hurt Apple s reputation for simplicity Resellers like Sears and CompUSA often failed to sell or even competently display these Macs Inventory grew as Apple consistently underestimated demand for popular models and overestimated demand for others br In Apple partnered with long time competitor IBM and Motorola to form the AIM alliance with the ultimate goal to create a revolutionary new computing platform known as PReP using IBM and Motorola hardware and Apple software As the first step Apple started the Power Macintosh line in using PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM The RISC architecture of these processors differed substantially from the Motorola X series used by previous Macs Parts of Apple s operating system were rewritten to allow some older Mac software to run in emulation on the PowerPC series Apple refused IBM s offer to purchase the company but later unsuccessfully sought another offer from IBM and at one point was hours away from an acquisition by Sun Microsystems br In Apple released the Newton a failed early personal digital assistant PDA br br In Apple launched eWorld an online service providing email news and a bulletin board system to replace AppleLink It was shut down in br In to achieve deeper market penetration and extra revenue Apple officially began licensing the Mac OS and Macintosh ROMs to rd party manufacturers The Clonintoshes competed with Apple s own Mac s and reduced Apple s sales Apple had market share of over until Jobs was re hired in as interim CEO to replace Gil Amelio and found a loophole to terminate the Macintosh OS licensing program Macintosh s market share fell to around br During the s project Pink had Apple and IBM collaborating to develop a new operating system named Taligent to replace System Infighting resulted in Apple leaving the project and IBM finishing it Apple started project Copland another effort to replace System but it was affected by Feature creep then Development hell due to software planned for Taligent being reworked for Copland Ultimately Copland was scrapped br With the Copland project in disarray Apple decided it needed to acquire another company s operating system Candidates considered were Sun s Solaris and Windows NT Hancock was in favor of Solaris while Amelio preferred Windows Amelio called Bill Gates and Gates promised Microsoft engineers would port QuickDraw to NT br br In the struggling NeXT company beat Be Inc s BeOS bid to sell its operating system to Apple On December Apple announced it would purchase NeXT and its NeXTstep operating system for million and million shares of Apple stock This brought Jobs back to Apple s management for the first time since and NeXT technology became the foundation of the Mac OS X operating system br br On July Gil Amelio was ousted as CEO of Apple by the board of directors Fred D Anderson was the head of the directors in short term and obtained short term working capital from the banks in July In August Jobs stepped in as the interim CEO to begin a critical restructuring of the company s product line He eventually became CEO and served in that position from January to August On August Jobs resigned his position as chief executive officer of Apple before his long battle with pancreatic cancer took his life on October br On November Apple introduced the Apple Store an online retail store based upon the WebObjects application server the company had acquired in its purchase of NeXT The new direct sales outlet was tied to a new build to order manufacturing strategy br br At the Macworld Expo Jobs announced that Apple would begin a partnership with Microsoft with terms including a five year commitment from Microsoft to release Microsoft Office for Macintosh and a US million investment in Apple The long standing dispute over whether Windows infringed Apple patents was settled and Internet Explorer would ship as the Macintosh s default browser with the user able to have a preference Microsoft chairman Bill Gates appeared on screen explaining plans for developing Mac software and expressing excitement to be helping Apple return to success Jobs addressed the audience br br If we want to move forward and see Apple healthy and prospering again we have to let go of a few things here We have to let go of this notion that for Apple to win Microsoft has to lose We have to embrace a notion that for Apple to win Apple has to do a really good job And if others are going to help us that s great because we need all the help we can get and if we screw up and we don t do a good job it s not somebody else s fault it s our fault So I think that is a very important perspective If we want Microsoft Office on the Mac we better treat the company that puts it out with a little bit of gratitude we d like their software br So the era of setting this up as a competition between Apple and Microsoft is over as far as I m concerned This is about getting Apple healthy this is about Apple being able to make incredibly great contributions to the industry and to get healthy and prosper again br The day before the announcement Apple had a market cap of billion and had ended its previous quarter with quarterly revenues of US billion and cash reserves of US billion making the US million amount of the investment largely symbolic Apple CFO Fred Anderson stated that Apple would use the additional funds to invest in its core markets of education and creative content br br While discontinuing Apple s licensing of its operating system to third party computer manufacturers one of Jobs s first moves as new acting CEO was to develop the iMac which bought Apple time to restructure The original iMac integrated a CRT display and CPU into a streamlined translucent plastic body The line became a sales smash moving about one million units each year It helped re introduce Apple to the media and public and announced the company s new emphasis on the design and aesthetics of its products br In Apple introduced the Power Mac G which utilized the Motorola made PowerPC containing a bit instruction unit known as AltiVec its flagship processor line Apple unveiled the iBook that year its first consumer oriented laptop the first Macintosh to support the use of Wireless LAN via the optional AirPort card Based on the b standard it helped popularize Wireless LAN technology to connect computers to networks br br In Apple introduced Mac OS X an operating system based on NeXT s NeXTSTEP and incorporating parts of the FreeBSD kernel Aimed at consumers and professionals alike Mac OS X married the stability reliability and security of Unix with the ease of a completely overhauled user interface To help users transition the new operating system allowed the use of Mac OS applications through the Classic environment Apple s Carbon API allowed developers to adapt Mac OS software to use Mac OS X s features br br In May after much speculation Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores to be located throughout the major U S computer buying markets The stores were designed for two primary purposes to stem the tide of Apple s declining share of the computer market and to respond to poor marketing of Apple products at third party retail outlets br br In October Apple introduced its first iPod portable digital audio player Then iPod started as a gigabyte player capable of storing around songs It then evolved into an array of products including the Mini discontinued the iPod Touch discontinued the Shuffle discontinued the iPod Classic discontinued the Nano discontinued the iPhone and the iPad Since March the largest storage capacity for an iPod has been gigabytes Speaking to software developers on June Jobs said the company s share of the entire portable music device market stood at br The iPod gave an enormous lift to Apple s financial results In the quarter ending March Apple earned US million or a share on sales of US billion The year before in the same quarter Apple earned just US million or a share on revenue of US billion br br In early Apple unveiled a completely redesigned iMac using the G processor and LCD display The new iMac G design had a white hemispherical base and a flat panel all digital display supported by a swiveling chrome neck After several iterations increasing the processing speed and screen sizes from to to the iMac G was discontinued and replaced by the iMac G in the summer of br Later in Apple released the Xserve U rack mounted server Originally featuring two G chips the Xserve was unusual for Apple in two ways It represented an earnest effort to enter the enterprise computer market and it was cheaper than competitors similar machines This was largely due to Fast ATA drives as opposed to the SCSI hard drives used in traditional rack mounted servers Apple later released the Xserve RAID a drive RAID that was again cheaper than competing systems br In mid Jobs launched the Power Mac G based on IBM s G processor Its all metal anodized aluminum chassis finished Apple s transition away from colored plastics in their computers Apple claims this was the first bit computer sold to the general public The Power Mac G was used by Virginia Tech to build its prototype System X supercomputing cluster which at the time was considered the third fastest supercomputer in the world It cost only US million to build far less than the previous No and other ranking supercomputers Apple s Xserves were updated to use the G as well They replaced the Power Mac G machines as the main building block of Virginia Tech s System X which was ranked in November as the world s seventh fastest supercomputer br br A new iMac based on the G processor was unveiled August and was made available in mid September This model dispensed with the base altogether placing the CPU and the rest of the computing hardware behind the flat panel screen which is suspended from a streamlined aluminum foot This new iMac dubbed the iMac G was the world s thinnest desktop computer measuring in at around two inches around centimeters br was a turning point for Apple After creating a sizable financial base to work with the company began experimenting with new parts from new suppliers Apple could produce new designs quickly and released the iPod Video then the iPod Classic and eventually the iPod touch and iPhone br On April Apple released Mac OS X v Tiger br Apple s successful PowerBook and iBook relied on previous generation G architecture produced by Freescale Semiconductor a spin off from Motorola IBM engineers had some success in making their PowerPC G processor consume less power and run cooler but not enough to run in iBook or PowerBook formats In October Apple released the Power Mac G Dual featuring a Dual Core processor two cores in one rather than two separate processors The Power Mac G Quad uses two Dual Core processors The Power Mac G Dual cores run individually at GHz or GHz The Power Mac G Quad cores run individually at GHz and all variations have a graphics processor with bit memory bandwidth br br Initially Apple Stores were only in the United States but in late Apple opened its first Apple Store abroad in Tokyo s Ginza district It was followed by a store in Osaka Japan in August In Apple opened stores in Nagoya the Shibuya district of Tokyo Fukuoka and Sendai A store opened in Sapporo in Apple s first European store opened in London on Regent Street in November A store in the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham opened in April and the Bluewater shopping centre in Dartford Kent opened in July Apple opened its first store in Canada in the middle of at the Yorkdale Shopping Centre in North York Toronto Later in Apple opened the Meadowhall Store in Sheffield and the Trafford Centre Store in Manchester UK Later additions in the London area include Brent Cross January Westfield in Shepherd s Bush September and Covent Garden August which at square feet m was as of the largest Apple Store in the world br Apple opened several mini stores in October to capture markets where demand does not necessarily dictate a full scale store The first of these stores was opened at Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto California These stores are only one half the square footage of the smallest normal store br br In Apple introduced iTools a set of free web based tools that included an email account internet greeting cards called iCards a Web site review service called iReview and KidSafe to prevent children browsing inappropriate websites The latter two services were canceled because of lack of success iCards and email were integrated into Apple s Mac subscription based service introduced in and discontinued in mid to make way for MobileMe coinciding
