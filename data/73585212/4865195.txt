Though it was considered a historic home it was demolished in by its last owner Steve Jobs Its demolition followed a protracted court battle during which Jobs stated his intentions to build a smaller contemporary styled home on the site though he died before any plans could be realized br br br History br The Jackling House designer George Washington Smith was the foremost creator and proponent of the Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style that became popular in the U S and remains so especially in California and the Southwest Based in Montecito Smith helped create Santa Barbara s unified city planning and architectural aesthetic and many significant residences in the area in the s br Daniel Jackling was a copper mining baron and the estate represented his aesthetic values wealth and family needs It contained a built in residence pipe organ originally constructed by the Aeolian Company and later enlarged by George Kilgen and Sons George Washington Smith integrated the sq ft m residence and landscaped gardens with a large traditional courtyard open air balconies and many indoor outdoor sightline and access connections Details about the house and its contents when Jackling

was subdivided The house had three other owners before its last one bought the property which had a list price of million in br br br Preservation issues br br br Background br In Steve Jobs purchased the Jackling House and estate and resided there for a decade After that he leased it out for several years until when he stopped maintaining the house allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it In Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one br Local preservationists created a new group Uphold Our Heritage UOH dedicated to saving the historic residence They sued the town and Jobs claiming that both had ignored provisions of California law which prohibit cultural landmarks from being destroyed if there are reasonable feasible ways to preserve them They also contended that the initial environmental impact report did not demonstrate that preserving the house would cost more than replacing it In addition the town failed to demonstrate that demolishing the mansion would provide an overriding benefit to the public as required by state law the group s attorney Doug Carstens said The issue before you is not to preserve and rehabilitate a work of marginal importance it is to assure the protection and survival of a work of great significance said the California Department of Parks and Recreation s State Historical Resources Commission chairperson Anthea Hartig PhD br br br Interim decisions br In January Superior Court Judge Marie Weiner agreed with Uphold Our Heritage and held that Jobs could not tear the house down Jobs appealed to the State Court of Appeals and in January that Court unanimously confirmed the lower court ruling Jobs attorney asked for an appeal but in April the Supreme Court of California refused to hear it br In Jobs submitted a renewed permit application with updated estimates The Woodside Town Council granted the permit a year later in May with the condition that Jobs must allow the house to be disassembled and moved elsewhere In February Magalli and Jason Yoho offered to move the mansion to their five acre lot in Woodside Magalli Yoho reported in March that the house resembled a Spanish Colonial Revival mansion she lived in as a child in Ica Peru She said This house is just a good house for our family br On March Superior Court Judge Marie Weiner upheld the Woodside Town Council s decision that allowed Jobs to tear down his house If an appeal was not filed before Jobs obtained a demolition permit then demolition could proceed The demolition permit process typically took the better part of a couple of months according to Woodside Town Manager Susan George br On April Uphold Our Heritage appealed the March court decision The appeal put an automatic stay on the issuance of demolition permits The group hoped that the house could be relocated and restored br br br Demolition and legacy br Later in Judge Weiner upheld the council s decision to allow the house to be demolished br The pipe organ was removed in January and the entire residence was demolished the next month Nothing was built on the site and Jobs died later that year on October of pancreatic cancer Laurene Powell Jobs proposed a new building for the site in br The Woodside History Museum has an exhibit of furniture maps photographs etc from the Jackling House br The town of Woodside collected items from the home before it was destroyed As of October the items were reportedly appraised at over At a meeting that month the town council approved a plan to offer the items including a silver plated teaspoon a chandelier wall sconces door handles a flagpole and a s thermostat and toilet in sequence to the town first and then to the owners of another Smith designed home next door After that the items would be offered to the museum of the University of California Santa Barbara which has additional Smith designs nearby Remaining items would then be made available to the public via silent auction before being sent to salvage br br br br br br External links br Friends of the Jackling House br Historic Jackling House Photos br Jackling House Interior
