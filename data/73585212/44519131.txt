engineer Andy Hertzfeld fix it threatening to publicly implicate him in the presentation s credits if he does not Hertzfeld finally suggests faking the demo by using the prototype Macintosh K computer br Jobs rants to marketing executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex girlfriend Chrisann Brennan as he denies he is the father of Brennan s five year old daughter Lisa Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him she is bitter over his denials and refusal to support her despite his wealth Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house Apple co founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer which he considers obsolete is unwise br By following the Macintosh s apparent failure Jobs has founded a new company NeXT Before the NeXT Computer launch at the War Memorial Opera House in he spends time with year old Lisa However his relationship with Brennan is still strained He accuses her of irresponsible behavior and using Lisa to get money from him Wozniak arrives and predicts the NeXT will be another failure Jobs confronts him about his public criticism of him and Wozniak questions Jobs contributions to computing history Jobs defends his role as that of a conductor who directs musicians like Wozniak br Apple CEO John Sculley demands to know why the world believes he fired Jobs Jobs was actually forced out by the Apple board who were resolute on updating the Apple II following the Macintosh s lackluster sales Despite Sculley s warnings Jobs criticized the decision and dared them to cast a final vote on his tenure After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT s unclear direction she realizes Jobs designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him br By Apple has fired Sculley purchased NeXT and named Jobs CEO and Jobs is about to unveil the iMac at Davies Symphony Hall He is delighted by Hoffman s strong commercial forecasts but furious that Lisa has allowed her mother to sell the house Jobs bought for them Hoffman reminds Jobs that he threatened to withhold Lisa s college tuition and Hertzfeld admits that he paid Lisa s tuition and suggested she attend therapy Wozniak again asks Jobs to credit the Apple II team during the presentation and again he refuses in an argument br Sculley arrives in secret and the two make amends Jobs and Sculley discuss Jobs life as an adopted child and Jobs admits that his need for control stems from his feelings of powerlessness in being given up At the behest of Hoffman Jobs apologizes to Lisa for his mistakes and accepts that he is her father admitting he is poorly made He confesses to Lisa that the Lisa was named after her On seeing her Walkman he also promises Lisa that he will put more music in her pocket Lisa watches her father take the stage to introduce the first iMac but only after he hands her the printout of the abstract she made as a kid on the original Macintosh which he kept with him all those years br br Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs br Co founder of Apple Inc Fassbender acknowledged his lack of physical resemblance to Jobs but stated that he was more interested in capturing Jobs essence than his appearance In regards to how he aimed to depict Jobs Fassbender stated he aimed to depict Jobs as somebody who was passionate about his vision as opposed to a cruel person br Kate Winslet as Joanna Hoffman br Apple and NeXT marketing executive and Jobs confidant in the film When discussing her audition for the film Winslet later commented that she heard about it through a crew member who I happened to be working with in Australia on The Dressmaker I didn t even care what role it was I just wanted to be in it Found out the nature of the role Googled Hoffman Found one picture of her Got my husband to go to a wig shop Buy a short haired dark wig Stuck it on my head Sent a photograph of myself to producer Scott Rudin Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began She noted that Hoffman has a softness to her She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve s life was that she didn t need anything from him She just needed for him to be the best version of himself And that s what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues Winslet credits Hoffman s difficult childhood in Soviet Armenia with her ability to manage Jobs On the nature of the relationship between Hoffman and Jobs Winslet said that she and Fassbender were able to develop as literally co workers I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had She was like his work wife She was head of marketing for the Macintosh and then she stayed with him for his working life She was an extraordinary feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve and she was also kind of an emotional compass In developing her sense of the character Winslet stated that she just wanted to please Hoffman as much as I could How she sounds and her accent is fairly complicated She grew up largely in Armenia spent some time in Poland and has Russians in her family so she has all three accents but she s been in America since she was a teenager so she had American rhythms You know she really has this accent that goes way up and down It s almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes So I had to put it into my own register But we were all doing accents I mean Michael s Irish and he s playing Steve Jobs for God s sake Finally Winslet notes that Hoffman did genuinely love Jobs And spending time with her when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part she would become very emotional She misses him terribly br Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak br Co founder of Apple and creator of the Apple II Rogen admitted to not being familiar with Wozniak or his founding work with Apple He met with Wozniak to prepare for the film specifically picking up his tendency to move his hands around while speaking In regard to Wozniak s relationship with Jobs Rogen stated that his feelings towards Jobs were very complex and interesting Part of it was taking it at face value and part was reading between the lines Wozniak stated that he felt honored to be portrayed by Rogen in the film br Jeff Daniels as John Sculley CEO of Apple from to br Katherine Waterston as Chrisann Brennan Jobs former girlfriend and Lisa s mother br Michael Stuhlbarg as Andy Hertzfeld a member of the original

the Macintosh and iMac launches br Adam Shapiro as Avie Tevanian software engineer for NeXT and later Apple br John Ortiz as Joel Pforzheimer a journalist for GQ who interviews Jobs throughout the film br br Sony Pictures acquired the rights to Isaacson s book in October hiring Aaron Sorkin to adapt it In November George Clooney and Noah Wyle the latter of who had previously portrayed Jobs in the TV film Pirates of Silicon Valley were rumored to be considered for the title role In May Sorkin officially confirmed that he was writing the script and had enlisted the help of Steve Wozniak co founder of Apple for historical accuracy Sorkin later stated that his screenplay would consist of three minute long scenes covering years of Jobs life br Sorkin developed the screenplay around Jobs relationship with a few key people Apple co founder Steve Wozniak Jobs right hand woman Joanna Hoffman former Apple CEO John Sculley original Mac team developer Andy Hertzfeld and Jobs first child Lisa Brennan Jobs as well as her mother Chrisann Brennan Sorkin had a chance to speak with all of them while developing the screenplay including Lisa who did not communicate with Isaacson while he was developing his book However Sorkin has stated that much of the dialogue is fiction br After Sorkin s completion of the script in January development on the project began to heat up when David Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs However in April Fincher exited the project due to contractual disputes Danny Boyle was then hired to direct with Leonardo DiCaprio in discussions for the role In October DiCaprio exited with Bale Matt Damon Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper being considered Sorkin revealed in an interview that month that Bale was once again cast in the role with Seth Rogen entering negotiations to play Wozniak and Jessica Chastain being considered for a part Ike Barinholtz revealed he had auditioned for the role of Wozniak In November Bale again left the project with Michael Fassbender emerging as a frontrunner to replace him and Scarlett Johansson reportedly being offered a role before Sony put the project in turnaround and Universal Pictures acquired it br Following the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack in December Sony emails were leaked which revealed casting demands as cause of delay in the film s production Also revealed in the emails were the details that Tom Cruise Matthew McConaughey and Charlize Theron were at one point met with to discuss potential roles in the film br Natalie Portman entered into negotiations for a role in November but withdrew from the film in December Meanwhile Jeff Daniels began negotiations for a role and Michael Stuhlbarg joined the cast as Andy Hertzfeld In

playing Joanna Hoffman was confirmed in January Daniels was also cast as John Sculley and Perla Haney Jardine was cast as Lisa Brennan Jobs In February John Ortiz joined the film to play GQ magazine journalist Joel Pforzheimer br br Principal photography began on January at Jobs s childhood home in Los Altos California with additional scenes shot throughout the San Francisco Bay Area Production next moved to Berkeley on January at La M diterran e a restaurant on College Avenue in the Elmwood district br On January filming continued at Flint Center De Anza college the location of the original unveiling of the Macintosh in In late February production moved to San Francisco and took place at the Opera House Louise M Davies Symphony Hall and the Civic Center Filming wrapped on April after an overnight shoot in the San Francisco Bay Area br To distinguish each of the three product launches depicted in the movie Danny Boyle and cinematographer Alwin K chler implemented three different film formats mm for mm for and digital for They also wanted each of the film s three time periods to visually reflect Jobs own development at the time For instance K chler explains that the filming at Flint Center De Anza college for the first act combined the graininess of mm film and setting to accentuate a provisional spontaneous look much in the vein of how Jobs is portrayed at that time The third act shot with an Arri Alexa at the Davies Symphony Hall incorporated an aesthetic and color palette that were intended to be representative of Jobs own design philosophies of the iMac and subsequent Apple hardware K chler describes his experience filming Steve Jobs as brilliant and challenging at the same time and that the goal was to make sure that the visuals kept up with the words in reference to the production s collaboration between Boyle and Sorkin br Costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb says the real Jobs never wore his trademark turtleneck sweater at any of the launches The turtleneck was the off book decision In those actual launches in real life he never wore that In the portion of the film in real life he was wearing a dark greyish brownish suit We made it for him as a back up idea in case we needed to adhere to it As we got closer to the time of filming I thought we d set up rules for we d set up rules for there s so much of the film that s about design and he was about design Fassbender also remarked that the historically inaccurate black turtleneck for the third act was intentional believing that wearing the attire felt like I had arrived at Steve Jobs vision that the person had arrived Fassbender later added that he and Danny Boyle decided on this look during filming and wanted to give the audience kind of a payoff br br London based studio Union created the film s visual effects According to editor Elliot Graham extensive film editing took place even before principal photography was completed During the one week rehearsal that took place in between production for each of the three acts shot in chronological order Graham worked on the existing footage and received ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room In an interview with Variety Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the shot frequency and providing enough visual interventions to control for Sorkin s dialogue heavy screenplay He described approaching each scene as a series of fight sequences Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs which Graham and Boyle then chose from during post production Graham also said Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away He would say if I m with you the whole time we ll always have the same opinions because we re on the exact same journey br br Daniel Pemberton composed the music for the film Much like the film s visual approach the score is divided into three distinguishable sections each corresponding to the intended feel of the act in which the section is heard You have the first act which is analog Pemberton explains you have the second act which is orchestral and you have the third act which is digital For the first act s composition Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers in particular ones released no later than the time the first act takes place such as the Roland SH and Yamaha CS The second act s score is more operatic in nature matching the setting of the San Francisco Opera House Finally the third act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the iMac product launch and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac to compose this section br The soundtrack also features songs by The Libertines Bob Dylan and The Maccabees The Maccabees Grew Up At Midnight the song that played during the film s concluding scene was reportedly chosen by Danny Boyle himself who is a fan of the band Other songs were considered for the final scene even Pemberton s own score before the song was chosen The soundtrack was released digitally on October and in physical format on October br br Steve Jobs premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on September and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October It opened nationwide in the U S on October The movie also served as the closing film for the BFI London Film Festival approximately one month before its release in the United Kingdom on November br Steve Jobs was released digitally on February and was released on Blu ray and DVD on February and includes feature commentary from Boyle Sorkin and Elliot Graham The physical releases contain a minute making of documentary Inside Jobs The Making of Steve Jobs chronicling the production of the film br br Steve Jobs grossed million in the United States and Canada and million in other territories for a worldwide total of million against a budget of million The film needed to gross an estimated million in order to break even br In its opening weekend in limited release the film grossed from four theaters for a per theater average of beating out Sicario for the best average theater gross of The film began its wide release on October alongside The Last Witch Hunter Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension Rock the Kasbah and Jem and the Holograms Over the weekend the film was originally projected to gross million from theaters However after grossing just million on its first day it was revised to million It ended up grossing million finishing seventh at the box office br On November just over two weeks after its wide release the film was pulled from theaters Variety said the film suffered from fierce competition at the box office possible public weariness with Jobs and the low profile of Fassbender in the title role and that the underperformance at the box office could hurt the film s award chances After his film was pulled from wide release in the U S Danny Boyle expressed disappointment at the box office performance of Steve Jobs while suggesting that Universal expanded the film s release too wide too soon and that the studio s move was arrogant br br On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critical consensus reads Like the tech giant co founded by its subject Steve Jobs gathers brilliant people to deliver a product whose elegance belies the intricate complexities at its core On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on reviews indicating universal acclaim At CinemaScore audiences gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle s electric direction temperamentally complements Sorkin s highly theatrical three act study and praised Fassbender in the role who doesn t closely physically resemble the man yet he fully delivers the essentials of how we have come to perceive the man Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as a wildly creative fantasia a brilliant maddening ingeniously designed and monstrously self aggrandizing movie Sasha Stone writing for TheWrap stated that Fassbender gives a stunning knockout performance as Jobs in a film that is a kind of talk opera which to some might seem to be Sorkin overkill but the same could be said for the best of them David Mamet Edward Albee Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a B stating that the cast vanishes into their parts buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent Winslet s chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel He also noted that Boyle drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece br Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film three out of five stars writing that despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is it s disappointingly difficult to truly care about what s taking place He blames Sorkin s dominating script arguing that the dialogue stifles and that the actors are tasked with trying to wrangle enough breathing space to offer up something of their own He also feels that while it is Boyle s best film for years his direction plays second fiddle to a script that verges on a kind of Apple sponsored hero iWorship Joe Nocera of The New York Times who knew Jobs well took issue with how little the film has to do with the flesh and blood Steve Jobs Characterizing the movie as pure fiction he went on to say In ways both large and small Sorkin as well as Michael Fassbender the actor who plays Jobs has failed to capture him in any meaningful sense br br Danny Boyle the film s director speaking on the creative liberties he took with portraying Steve Jobs said it was what Shakespeare used to do He would take some of the facts about a man of power and he would guess at a lot of the rest and just gotten away at actually getting at the human in it And that s what s wonderful about the writing I think is that it acknowledges the people who disliked Steve Jobs the people he hurt But in the end he brings it back to a very simple father daughter relationship that he has to admit that he has made some of the most beautiful things in the world br John Sculley praised Jeff Daniels portrayal of him but claims the film misrepresented Apple s success with the Mac and argues that Jobs was much nicer than depicted Bill Atkinson denounced the film as not truthful at all That wasn t his character and the events didn t happen You think of Jobs having a reality distortion field I think of Aaron Sorkin as having a history distortion field Atkinson said that the only thing he got right in that movie was the spot on depiction of Hoffman including her accent and how she tried to rein in Steve from making an ass of himself br Steve Wozniak who consulted with Sorkin before he had written the screenplay commented on a trailer released on July that he does not talk that way I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen I never made comments to the effect that I had credit genius taken from me The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message at least partly I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer although a bit exaggerated Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not think that would be appropriate it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others He also noted that the trailer s reference to Jobs initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response It was hard on me even being quiet when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn t matter and I can almost cry remembering it In September after seeing a rough cut of the film Wozniak stated that he felt like he was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others not actors playing them I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February Wozniak claimed that the film s scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage as was shown in the movie However he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group When asked about the accuracy of the film s portrayal of Jobs Wozniak replied In real life to real people that s the way he could be very sharp although never quite as much as in the movie br br Edwin Catmull president of Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Animation Studios felt that Jobs would be appalled at his depiction in the film arguing that he was a kinder person later in life than is portrayed in the picture In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Catmull commented When Jobs left Apple he then entered into what really is the classic hero s journey He s wandering in the wilderness he s working with NeXT it s not working He s working with Pixar we re failing In that process Steve learned some major lessons and he changed He became an empathetic person that aspect of the change of Steve was missed br In a Bloomberg West interview with Emily Chang on August Andy Cunningham called it a wonderful film It s an incredible character study of a really complex man Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle did a fabulous job with it Her portrayal by Sarah Snook was a small role but professionally done The film also portrays Andy as participating in the iMac launch even though she was not working with Apple at that time Journalist Walt Mossberg compared Steve Jobs to the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane which was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst Mossberg has stated that while both films are aesthetically well developed Welles created a fictional set of characters in order to clarify that his film was a work of fiction In contrast according to Mossberg who knew Jobs for years Sorkin s decision to use real instead of fictional names detracts from the quality of a film which appears to be a biopic and yet is a work of fiction Mossberg states that the Steve Jobs portrayed in Sorkin s film isn t the man I knew Sorkin chose to cherry pick and exaggerate some of the worst aspects of Jobs character and to focus on a period of his career when he was young and immature It would be as if you made a movie called JFK almost entirely focused on Kennedy s womanizing and political rivalries and said nothing about civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis Sorkin opts to end his story just as Jobs is poised to both reel off an unprecedented string of world changing products and to mature into a much broader kinder manager and person br br At the
