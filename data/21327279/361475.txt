id: 361475
The hippocampus or hippocamp also hippokampos plural hippocampi or hippocamps Ancient Greek from horse and sea monster often called a sea horse in English is a mythological creature shared by Phoenician Etruscan Pictish Roman and Greek mythology though its name has a Greek origin The hippocampus has typically been depicted as having the upper body of a horse with the lower body of a fish br br br Mythology br Coins minted at Tyre around the th century BC show the patron god Melqart riding on a winged hippocampus and accompanied by dolphins Coins of the same period from Byblos show a hippocampus diving under a galley br A gold sea horse was discovered in a hoard from the kingdom of Lydia in Asia minor dating to the th century BC br br br Greek and Roman br br In the Iliad Homer describes Poseidon god of horses earthquakes and the sea driving a chariot drawn by brazen hoofed horses over the sea s surface and Apollonius of Rhodes describes the horse of Poseidon emerging from the sea and galloping across the Libyan sands This compares to the specifically two hoofed hippocampi of Gaius Valerius Flaccus in his Argonautica Orion when grasping his father s reins heaves the sea with the snorting of his two hooved horses In Hellenistic and Roman imagery however Poseidon or Roman Neptune often drives a sea chariot drawn by hippocampi Thus hippocampi sport with this god in both ancient depictions and much more modern ones such as in the waters of the th century Trevi Fountain in Rome surveyed by Neptune from his niche above br br The appearance of hippocampi in both freshwater and saltwater is counter intuitive to a modern audience though not to an ancient one The Greek picture of the natural hydrological cycle did not take into account the condensation of atmospheric water as rain to replenish the water table but imagined the waters of the sea oozing back landwards through vast caverns and aquifers rising replenished and freshened in springs br Thus it was natural for a temple at Helike in the coastal plain of Achaea to be dedicated to Poseidon Helikonios the Poseidon of Helicon the sacred spring of Boeotian Helikon When an earthquake suddenly submerged the city the temple s bronze Poseidon accompanied by hippocampi continued to snag fishermens nets br Likewise the hippocampus was considered an appropriate decoration for mosaics in Roman thermae or public baths as at Aquae Sulis modern day Bath in Britannia br Poseidon s horses which were included in the elaborate sculptural program of gilt bronze and ivory added by a Roman client to the temple of Poseidon at Corinth are likely to have been hippocampi the Romanised Greek Pausanias described the rich ensemble in the later nd century AD Geography of Greece ii br br On the temple which is not very large stand bronze Tritons In the fore temple are images two of Poseidon a third of Amphitrite and a Sea which also is of bronze The offerings inside were dedicated in our time by Herodes Atticus four horses gilded except for the hoofs which are of ivory and two gold Tritons beside the horses with the parts below the waist of ivory On the car stand Amphitrite and Poseidon and there is the boy Palaemon upright upon a dolphin These too are made of ivory and gold On the middle of the base on which the car has been wrought a Sea holding up the young Aphrodite and on either side are the nymphs called Nereids br br br Etruscan br Hippocampi appear with the first Oriental phase of Etruscan civilization they remain a theme in Etruscan tomb wall paintings and reliefs where they are sometimes provided with wings as they are in the Trevi fountain Katharine Shepard found in the theme an Etruscan belief in a sea voyage to the other world br br br Pictish br The sea horse also appears in Pictish stone carvings in Scotland The symbolism of the carving also known as Pictish Beast or Kelpie is unknown Although similar but not identical to Roman sea horse images it is unclear whether this depiction originates from images brought over by the Romans or had a place in earlier Pictish mythology br br br Medieval Renaissance and modern br br The mythic hippocampus has been used as a heraldic charge particularly since the Renaissance most often in the armorial bearings of people and places with maritime associations However in a blazon the terms hippocamp and hippocampus now refer to the real animal called a seahorse and the terms seahorse and sea horse refer to the mythological creature The above mentioned fish hybrids are seen less frequently In appearance the heraldic sea horse is depicted as having the head and neck of a horse the tail of a fish and webbed paws replacing its front hooves Its mane may be that of a horse or it may be replaced with an additional fin Sea horses may be depicted with wings and winged sea horses with a horn were part of the armorial bearings granted to Sir Sean Connery in by the Lord Lyon King of Arms the head of Scotland s heraldic authority br br The sea horse is also a common image in Renaissance and Baroque art for example in the Trevi fountain dating to br A winged hippocampus has been used as a symbol for Air France since its establishment in inherited from its predecessor Air Orient it appears today on the engine nacelles of Air France sea craft br Bronze hippocampi appear in Dublin Leinster Ireland on lampposts next to a statue of Henry Grattan and on Grattan Bridge br The English football club Newcastle United has two hippocampi depicted on its crest They appear to the left and right of the shield in the middle The Civic Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne is also adorned with hippocampi at the top of its central tower br br br Capricornus and related mythical animals br Closely related to the hippocampus is the sea goat represented by Capricorn a mythical creature with the front half of a goat and the rear half of a fish Canonical figures most of which were not themselves cult images and coins of the Carian goddess associated with Aphrodite as the Aphrodite of Aphrodisias through interpretatio graeca show the goddess riding on a sea goat Brody describes her thus br br a semi nude female figure appears riding on a sea goat accompanied by a dolphin and a Triton This is the goddess Aphrodite herself shown here not in her distinctive local guise but in a more traditionally Hellenistic style She is the marine aspect of Aphrodite known to the Greeks as Aphrodite Pelagia She rides on a fantastic marine creature with the body and tail of a fish and the forepart of a goat This sea goat moves to the right and turns his head back to look at the goddess This group also appears on Aphrodisian coins from the rd century A D br Aside from aigikampoi the fish tailed goats representing Capricorn other fish tailed animals rarely appeared in Greek art but are more characteristic of the Etruscans These include leokampoi fish tailed lions taurokampoi fish tailed bulls or pardalokampoi fish tailed leopards br br br Astronomy br br A small moon of Neptune discovered in July was named for the mythological creature in February br br br See also br List of fictional horses
