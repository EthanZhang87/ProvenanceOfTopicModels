excellent novel in its own right Kirkus Reviews for example in its starred review called the novel Riordan s best one yet it rivals Rowling for inventive magical storytelling The often philosophical tale zips along with snappy dialogue humor and thrilling action This volume can stand alone but no reader will be able to read just one Children s Literature made similar claims Riordan creates a masterful weaving of Greek mythology and traditional fantasy in this latest book Fans will enjoy the latest adventures of their favorite characters and those picking the book up for the first time will have no trouble falling into this magical world br Other reviews focused more on the novel as a continuation to the series Anita Burkam of Horn Book Magazine said in her review of the novel The melding of Greek myths with modern day settings remains fresh and funny in this fourth installment David Goodale of VOYA also remarks on Riordan s ability to keep the material fresh despite the far from new quest format VOYA s highlighted review gave it a for quality and for popularity Publishers Weekly s starred review states One of Riordan s strengths is the wry interplay between the real and the surreal adding the wit rousing swordplay and breakneck pace in this installment will once again keep kids hooked The website KidsReads similarly praised the book saying the story arc has remained unified and compelling The Los Angeles Times gave another positive review calling it a glorious no holds barred adventure with great plot twists a melding of ancient and bionic technology and a cliffhanger ending that will have fans eagerly awaiting the fifth and final showdown between gods and monsters next year br Matt Berman of Common Sense Media was one of few reviewers to mention the differences between this book and the ones preceding in the series He highlights The Battle of the Labyrinth s darker tone more mature themes and increased discussion of what it philosophically means for the characters to follow and support the Greek gods and Titans He concludes Up until now the series has been great fun but little more Now as it begins to grow like the Labyrinth larger and deeper and more complex it s even more fun br Despite the overall praise some reviewers were more critical School Library Journal wrote that l ike many series the Percy Jackson books are beginning to show the strain of familiarity and repetition The BBC Children Newsround praised the novel for its smart ideas but said none of it will make sense if you haven t read any of the other books Nelda Brangwin of Library Media Connection wrote If this is the only book read in the series readers may be confused by the storyline and profusion of mythological creatures It reads well on its own if readers are familiar with mythology but is best if the other three books are in the library collection The Guardian commented that the book is funny and scary at moments and makes you want to read more br The audiobook was also well received AudioFile magazine praised the audiobook raving Speedy introductions of familiar and new characters and previous plot summaries may briefly confuse a new listener but fans will savor them adding Jesse Bernstein is on target whether he s narrating blow by blow accounts of Percy s sword fights or inventing cameos for various other characters Hephaestus who repairs a Toyota an aged Daedalus and Grover Percy s slow witted sidekick Bernstein is just as skillful at wringing humor from the witty dialogue and from the contrasts between the modern and ancient worlds Booklist similarly praised Bernstein s familiarity with the series and ability to realistically portray its teenaged protagonists commenting His portrayal of Percy stands out as he manages to sound just like a year old boy The work s review in The School Library Journal was also favorable praising Bernstein for doing a good job voicing Percy and his Cyclops half brother and successfully conveying Annabeth s emotions He attempts a number of different accents for the gods demigods and mortals in the story with varying levels of success br The Battle of the Labyrinth was nominated for
