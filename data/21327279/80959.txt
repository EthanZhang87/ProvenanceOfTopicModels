The Nemean lion Greek translit Nem os l n Latin Leo Nemeaeus was a monster in Greek mythology that lived at Nemea Eventually it was killed by Heracles Hercules Because its golden fur was impervious to attack it could not be killed with mortals weapons Its claws were sharper than mortals swords and could cut through any strong armour In Bibliotheca Photius wrote that the dragon Ladon who guarded the golden apples was his brother br br br Parents br Hesiod has the Nemean lion as the offspring of Orthus and an ambiguous she often understood as probably referring to the Chimera or possibly to Echidna or even Ceto According to Hesiod the lion was raised by Hera and sent to terrorise the hills of Nemea According to Apollodorus he was the offspring of Typhon In another tradition told by Aelian citing Epimenides and Hyginus the lion was sprung from the moon goddess Selene who threw him from the Moon at Hera s request br br br First labour of Heracles br br The first of Heracles twelve labours set by King Eurystheus his cousin was to slay the Nemean lion br Heracles wandered the area until he came to the town of Cleonae There he met a boy who said that if Heracles slew the Nemean lion and returned alive within days the town would sacrifice a lion to Zeus if he did not return within days or he died the boy would sacrifice himself to Zeus Another version claims that he met Molorchos a shepherd who had lost his son to the lion saying that if he came back within days a ram would be sacrificed to Zeus If he did not return within days it would be sacrificed to the dead Heracles as a mourning offering br While searching for the lion Heracles fetched some arrows to use against it not knowing that its golden fur was impenetrable when he found the lion and shot at it with his bow he discovered the fur s protective property when the arrow bounced harmlessly off the creature s thigh After some time Heracles made the lion return to his cave The cave had two entrances one of which Heracles blocked he then entered the other In those dark and close quarters Heracles stunned the beast with his club He eventually killed it by strangling it with his bare hands br After slaying the lion he tried to skin it with a knife from his belt but failed He then tried sharpening the knife with a stone and even tried with the stone itself Finally Athena noticing the hero s plight told Heracles to use one of the lion s own claws to skin the pelt br When Heracles returned on the thirtieth day carrying the carcass of the lion on his shoulders King Eurystheus was amazed and terrified Eurystheus forbade him ever again to enter the city in the future he was to display the fruits of his labours outside the city gates Eurystheus warned him that the tasks set for him would become increasingly difficult He then sent Heracles off to complete his next quest which was to destroy the Lernaean Hydra br Heracles wore the Nemean lion s coat after killing it as it was impervious to the elements and all but the most powerful weapons Others say that Heracles armour was in fact the hide of the Lion of Cithaeron br According to Alexander of Myndus Heracles was helped in this labour by an Earth born serpent which followed him to Thebes and settled down in Aulis It was later identified as the water snake which devoured the sparrows and was turned into stone in the prophecy about the Trojan War br br br In art br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br History of lions in Europe br List of mythological lions br Lion of Cithaeron br Kangla Sha br Nongshaba br Tsavo Man Eaters br Mfuwe man eating lion br Panthera spelaea br Smilodon br br br Notes br br br br Caldwell Richard June Hesiod s Theogony Focus Publishing R Pullins Company ISBN br Clay Jenny Strauss Hesiod s Cosmos Cambridge University Press ISBN br Gantz Timothy Early Greek Myth A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources Johns Hopkins University Press pp ISBN X br Hard Robin The Routledge Handbook of Greek Mythology Based on H J Rose s Handbook of Greek Mythology Psychology Press ISBN br Hesiod Theogony in Hesiod Theogony Works and Days Testimonia Edited and translated by Glenn W Most Loeb Classical Library No Cambridge Massachusetts Harvard University Press ISBN Online version at Harvard University Press br Most G W Hesiod Theogony Works and Days Testimonia Edited and translated by Glenn W Most Loeb Classical Library No Cambridge Massachusetts Harvard University Press ISBN Online version at Harvard University Press br Smith William Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology London cite book CS maint location missing publisher link br West M L Hesiod Theogony Oxford University Press br br br See also br Master of Animals br Irresistible force paradox br br br External links br Media related to Nemean Lion at Wikimedia Commons
