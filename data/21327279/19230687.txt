In Ancient Greek religion and mythology Cronus Cronos or Kronos or from Greek Kr nos was the leader and youngest of the first generation of Titans the divine descendants of the primordial Gaia Mother Earth and Uranus Father Sky He overthrew his father and ruled during the mythological Golden Age until he was overthrown by his son Zeus and imprisoned in Tartarus According to Plato however the deities Phorcys Cronus and Rhea were the eldest children of Oceanus and Tethys br Cronus was usually depicted with a harpe scythe or sickle which was the instrument he used to castrate and depose Uranus his father In Athens on the twelfth day of the Attic month of Hekatombaion a festival called Kronia was held in honour of Cronus to celebrate the harvest suggesting that as a result of his association with the virtuous Golden Age Cronus continued to preside as a patron of the harvest Cronus was also identified in classical antiquity with the Roman deity Saturn br br br Mythology br br br Rise to power br In an ancient myth recorded by Hesiod s Theogony Cronus envied the power of his father Uranus the ruler of the universe Uranus drew the enmity of Cronus s mother Gaia when he hid the gigantic youngest children of Gaia the hundred handed Hecatoncheires and one eyed Cyclopes in Tartarus so that they would not see the light Gaia created a great stone sickle and gathered together Cronus and his brothers to persuade them to castrate Uranus br br Only Cronus was willing to do the deed so Gaia gave him the sickle and placed him in ambush When Uranus met with Gaia Cronus attacked him with the sickle castrating him and casting his testicles into the sea From the blood that spilled out from Uranus and fell upon the earth the Gigantes Erinyes and Meliae were produced The testicles produced a white foam from which the goddess Aphrodite emerged For this Uranus threatened vengeance and called his sons Titenes for overstepping their boundaries and daring to commit such an act After the deed was done Cronus cast his sickle into the waves and it was concealed under the island of Corfu which had been noted since antiquity for its sickle like shape and gave it its ancient name Drepane sickle br While Hesiod seems to imply Cronus never let them free to begin with Pseudo Apollodorus says that after dispatching Uranus Cronus re imprisoned the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes and set the dragon Campe to guard them He and his older sister Rhea took the throne of the world as king and queen The period in which Cronus ruled was called the Golden Age as the people of the time had no need for laws or rules everyone did the right thing and immorality was absent In some authors a different divine pair Ophion and Eurynome a daughter of Oceanus were said to have ruled Mount Olympus in the early age of the Titans Rhea fought Eurynome and Cronus fought Ophion and after defeating them they threw them into the waves of the ocean thus becoming rulers in their place br br br King of Gods br After securing his place as the new king of gods Cronus learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own children just as he had overthrown his father As a result although he sired the gods Demeter Hestia Hera Hades and Poseidon by Rhea he devoured them all as soon as they were born to prevent the prophecy When the sixth child Zeus was born Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save them and to eventually get retribution on Cronus for his acts against his father and children br Rhea secretly gave birth to Zeus in Crete and handed Cronus a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes also known as the Omphalos Stone which he promptly swallowed thinking that it was his son According to one Roman author when Rhea presented the swaddled rock to him Cronus asked her to nurse the infant one last time before he swallowed him Rhea pressed her breast against the rock and the milk that was sprayed across the heavens created the Milky Way galaxy Cronus then ate the rock br Rhea kept Zeus hidden in a cave on Mount Ida Crete According to some versions of the story he was then raised by a goat named Amalthea while a company of Curetes armored male dancers shouted and clapped their hands to make enough noise to mask the baby s cries from Cronus Other versions of the myth have Zeus raised by the nymph Adamanthea who hid Zeus by dangling him by a rope from a tree so that he was suspended between the earth the sea and the sky all of which were ruled by his father Cronus Still other versions of the tale say that Zeus was raised by his grandmother Gaia One Cretan myth relates how Cronus once went to Crete himself and Zeus in order to hide from his father transformed himself into a snake and changed his nymph nurses Helice and Cynosura into bears who later became the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor respectively In another myth Cronus transformed the Curetes into lions but Rhea made them her sacred animals and yoked them in her chariot br br br Overthrown br Once he had grown up Zeus used an emetic given to him by Gaia to force Cronus to disgorge the contents of his stomach in reverse order first the stone which was set down at Pytho under the glens of Mount Parnassus to be a sign to mortal men and then his two brothers and three sisters In other versions of the tale Metis gave Cronus an emetic to force him to disgorge the children br br After freeing his siblings Zeus released the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes who forged for him his thunderbolts Poseidon s trident and Hades helm of darkness In a vast war called the Titanomachy Zeus and his older brothers and sisters with the help of the Hecatoncheires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans Afterwards many of the Titans were confined in Tartarus However Oceanus Helios Atlas Prometheus Epimetheus and Astraeus were not imprisoned following the Titanomachy Gaia bore the monster Typhon to claim revenge for the imprisoned Titans br Accounts of the fate of Cronus after the Titanomachy differ In Homeric and other texts he is imprisoned with the other Titans in Tartarus In Orphic poems he is imprisoned for eternity in the cave of Nyx In yet another account referred to by Robert Graves who claims to be following the account of the Byzantine mythographer Tzetzes it is said that Cronus was castrated by his son Zeus just as Uranus had earlier been castrated by his son Cronus However the subject of a son castrating his own father or simply castration in general was so repudiated by the Greek mythographers of that time that they suppressed it from their accounts until the Christian era when Tzetzes wrote br br br Libyan account by Diodorus Siculus br In a Libyan account related by Diodorus Siculus Book Uranus and Titaea were the parents of Cronus and Rhea and the other Titans Ammon a king of Libya married Rhea However Rhea abandoned Ammon and married her younger brother Cronus With Rhea s incitement Cronus and the other Titans made war upon Ammon who fled to Crete Cronus ruled harshly and Cronus in turn was defeated by Ammon s son Dionysus who appointed Cronus and Rhea s son Zeus as king of Egypt Dionysus and Zeus then joined their forces to defeat the remaining Titans in Crete and on the death of Dionysus Zeus inherited all the kingdoms becoming lord of the world br br br Sibylline Oracles br Cronus is mentioned in the Sibylline Oracles particularly in book three wherein Cronus Titan and Iapetus the three sons of Uranus and Gaia each receive a third of the Earth and Cronus is made king overall After the death of Uranus Titan s sons attempt to destroy Cronus s and Rhea s male offspring as soon as they are born However at Dodona Rhea secretly bears her sons Zeus Poseidon and Hades and sends them to Phrygia to be raised in the care of three Cretans Upon learning this sixty of Titan s men then imprison Cronus and Rhea causing the sons of Cronus to declare and fight the first of all wars against them This account mentions nothing about Cronus either killing his father or attempting to kill any of his children br br br Release from Tartarus br In Hesiod s Theogony and Homer s Iliad Cronus and his Titan brothers are confined to Tartarus apparently forever but in other traditions Cronus and the other imprisoned Titans are eventually set free by the mercy of Zeus Two papyrus versions of a passage of Hesiod s Works and Days mention Cronus being released by Zeus and ruling over the heroes who go to the Isle of the Blessed but other editions of Hesiod s text make no mention of this and most editors agree that these lines of text are later interpolations in Hesiod s works br br And they live untouched by sorrow in the islands of the blessed along the shore of deep swirling Ocean happy heroes for whom the grain giving earth bears honey sweet fruit flourishing thrice a year far from the deathless gods and Cronos rules over them for the father of men and gods released him from his bonds br The poet Pindar in one of his poems BC wrote that although Atlas still strains against the weight of the sky Zeus freed the Titans and in another poem BC Pindar has Cronus released from Tartarus and now ruling in the Isles of the Blessed a mythical land where the Greek heroes reside in the afterlife br br Those who have persevered three times on either side to keep their souls free from all wrongdoing follow Zeus road to the end to the tower of Cronus where ocean breezes blow around the island of the blessed and flowers of gold are blazing some from splendid trees on land while water nurtures others With these wreaths and garlands of flowers they entwine their hands according to the righteous counsels of Rhadamanthys whom the great father the husband of Rhea whose throne is above all others keeps close beside him as his partner br Prometheus Lyomenos Prometheus Unbound an undated lost play by the playwright Aeschylus c c BC features a chorus composed of freed Titans as witnesses of Prometheus freeing from the rock perhaps including Cronus himself although the now freed Titans are not individually identified br br br Other accounts br In one version of Typhon s origins after the defeat of the Giants Gaia in anger slandered Zeus to Hera and she went to Cronus Cronus gave his daughter two eggs smeared with his own semen and told her to bury them underground so that they would produce a creature capable of dethroning Zeus Hera did so and thus Typhon came to be br Cronus was said to be the father of the wise centaur Chiron by the Oceanid Philyra who was subsequently transformed into a linden tree The god consorted with the nymph but his wife Rhea walked on them unexpectedly in order to escape being caught in bed with another Cronus changed into the shape of a stallion and galloped away hence the half human half equine shape of their offspring this was said to have taken place on Mount Pelion br Two other sons of Cronus and Philyra may have been Dolops and Aphrus the ancestor and eponym of the Aphroi i e the native Africans In some accounts Cronus was also called the father of the Corybantes br Cronus is featured in one of the works of satirical writer Lucian of Samosata Saturnalia where he talks with one of his priests about his festival Saturnalia with a central theme being the mistreatment of the poor by the rich during festival time In the dialogue Cronus rejects the Hesiodic tradition of him eating his children and then being overthrown and instead claims that he peacefully abdicated the throne in favour of his youngest son Zeus although he still resumes rulership for seven days each year his festival in order to remind humanity of the plenteous toil free and luxuriant life they enjoyed under his reign before the Olympians took over br br br Name and comparative mythology br br br Antiquity br During antiquity Cronus was occasionally interpreted as Chronos the personification of time The Roman philosopher Cicero st century BC elaborated on this by saying that the Greek name Cronus is synonymous to chr nos time since he maintains the course and cycles of seasons and the periods of time whereas the Latin name Saturn denotes that he is saturated with years since he was devouring his sons which implies that time devours the ages and gorges br The Greek historian and biographer Plutarch st century AD asserted that the Greeks believed that Cronus was an allegorical name for time The philosopher Plato rd century BC in his Cratylus gives two possible interpretations for the name of Cronus The first is that his name denotes k ros the pure and unblemished nature of his mind The second is that Rhea and Cronus were given names of streams Rhea from rho river stream flux and Cronus from chronos time Proclus th century the Neoplatonist philosopher makes in his Commentary on Plato s Cratylus an extensive analysis of Cronus among others he says that the One cause of all things is Chronos time that is also equivalent to Cronus br br In addition to the name the story of Cronus eating his children was also interpreted as an allegory to a specific aspect of time held within Cronus sphere of influence As the theory went Cronus represented the destructive ravages of time which devoured all things a concept that was illustrated when the Titan king ate the Olympian gods the past consuming the future the older generation suppressing the next generation br The Gnostic text Pistis Sophia rd th century references the name Cronus portraying the deity as a great ruler over others within the aeons br br br From the Renaissance to the present br During the Renaissance the identification of Cronus and Chronos gave rise to Father Time wielding the harvesting scythe br H J Rose in observed that attempts to give the name a Greek etymology had failed Recently Janda offers a genuinely Indo European etymology of the cutter from the root s ker to cut Greek keir cf English shear motivated by Cronus s characteristic act of cutting the sky or the genitals of anthropomorphic Uranus The Indo Iranian reflex of the root is kar but Janda argues that the original meaning to cut in a cosmogonic sense is still preserved in some verses of the Rigveda pertaining to Indra s heroic cutting like that of Cronus resulting in creation br br RV rdayad v tram ak od uloka he hit Vrtra fatally cutting creating a free path br RV var m a divo ak odhe cut created the loftiness of the sky br This may point to an older Indo European mytheme reconstructed as s kert wersmn diwos by means of a cut he created the loftiness of the sky The myth of Cronus castrating Uranus parallels the Song of Kumarbi where Anu the heavens is castrated by Kumarbi In the Song of Ullikummi Teshub uses the sickle with which heaven and earth had once been separated to defeat the monster Ullikummi establishing that the castration of the heavens by means of a sickle was part of a creation myth in origin a cut creating an opening or gap between heaven imagined as a dome of stone and earth enabling the beginning of time chronos and human history br A theory debated in the th century and sometimes still offered somewhat apologetically holds that is related to horned assuming a Semitic derivation from qrn Andrew Lang s objection that Cronus was never represented horned in Hellenic art was addressed by Robert Brown arguing that in Semitic usage as in the Hebrew Bible qeren was a signifier of power When Greek writers encountered the Semitic deity El they rendered his name as Cronus br Robert Graves remarks that cronos probably means crow like the Latin cornix and the Greek cor ne noting that Cronus was depicted with a crow as were the deities Apollo Asclepius Saturn and Bran br br br Elus the Phoenician Cronus br When Hellenes encountered Phoenicians and later Hebrews they identified the Semitic El by interpretatio graeca with Cronus The association was recorded c AD by Philo of Byblos Phoenician history as reported in Eusebius Pr paratio Evangelica I Philo s account ascribed by Eusebius to the semi legendary pre Trojan War Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon indicates that Cronus was originally a Canaanite ruler who founded Byblos and was subsequently deified This version gives his alternate name as Elus or Ilus and states that in the nd year of his reign he emasculated slew and deified his father Epigeius or Autochthon whom they afterwards called Uranus It further states that after ships were invented Cronus visiting the inhabitable world bequeathed Attica to his own daughter Athena and Egypt to Taautus the son of Misor and inventor of writing br br br Roman mythology and later culture br br While the Greeks considered Cronus a cruel and tempestuous force of chaos and disorder believing the Olympian gods had brought an era of peace and order by seizing power from the crude and malicious Titans the Romans took a more positive and innocuous view of the deity by conflating their indigenous deity Saturn with Cronus Consequently while the Greeks considered Cronus merely an intermediary stage between Uranus and Zeus he was a larger aspect of Roman religion The Saturnalia was a festival dedicated in his honour and at least one temple to Saturn already existed in the archaic Roman Kingdom br His association with the Saturnian Golden Age eventually caused him to become the god of time i e calendars seasons and harvests not now confused with Chronos the unrelated embodiment of time in general Nevertheless among Hellenistic scholars in Alexandria and during the Renaissance Cronus was conflated with the name of Chronos the personification of Father Time wielding the harvesting scythe br As a result of Cronus s importance to the Romans his Roman variant Saturn has had a large influence on Western culture The seventh day of the Judaeo Christian week is called in Latin Dies Saturni Day of Saturn which in turn was adapted and became the source of the English word Saturday In astronomy the planet Saturn is named after the Roman deity It is the outermost of the Classical planets the astronomical planets that are visible with the naked eye br br br Cronus alias Geb in Greco Roman Egypt br In Greco Roman Egypt Cronus was equated with the Egyptian god Geb because he held a quite similar position in Egyptian mythology as the father of the gods Osiris Isis Seth and Nephthys as Cronus did in the Greek pantheon This equation is particularly well attested in Tebtunis in the southern Fayyum Geb and Cronus were here part of a local version of the cult of Sobek the crocodile god The equation was shown on the one hand in the local iconography of the gods in which Geb was depicted as a man with attributes of Cronus and Cronus with attributes of Geb On the other hand the priests of the local main temple identified themselves in Egyptian texts as priests of Soknebtunis Geb but in Greek texts as priests of Soknebtunis Cronus Accordingly Egyptian names formed with the name of the god Geb were just as popular among local villagers as Greek names derived from Cronus especially the name Kronion br br br Astronomy br A star HD was named after him in when it was reported to have swallowed its planets The planet Saturn named after the Roman equivalent of Cronus is still referred to as Cronus in modern Greek br Cronus was also a suggested name for the dwarf planet Pluto but was rejected and not voted for because it was suggested by the unpopular and egocentric astronomer Thomas Jefferson Jackson See br br br Genealogy br br
