Wheadon of Common Sense Media rated the novel and commented Holding a fast paced fantasy quest adventure together with seven different heroes that deserve almost equal weight has the potential to really weigh the story down adding sometimes the action stops and readers will want to get back to their old pal Percy again However she finds that overall every hero takes a turn at being awesome Karen Rought of Hypable applauded Riordan for his trademark humor noting that his clever lines are new improved and back with a vengeance She appreciated the balance in the book commenting that t he funny moments weigh equally with the emotional bits while noting it slows down periodically to take note of everyone s situation br Kirkus Reviews felt that the pace initially drags during which the demigods resolve their relationships and attempt to solve both the prophecy and nightmare visions while positively noting that the pace picks up mid way and elements of humor begin to appear They opine that much of the tension present in earlier books is missing Kirkus concludes their review by writing Here Riordan s infectious love for his subject matter really comes through even as he takes some real risks with his characters Conversely The Horn Book Magazine observed Riordan s likable strong distinct characters drive the narrative in this rousing continuation of the saga Zach Dalzell of Scholastic writes that the novel is filled with fascinating mythology a bold sense of adventure and intriguing love stories all tinged with Riordan s signature demigod humor adding Mark of Athena doesn t disappoint as the Legend of Percy Jackson sails on br Few reviewers including Meann Ortiz of GMA Network criticized the multiple perspective format of the novel Ortiz felt the different perspectives were tiresome and noted that the plot was very similar to that of previous books saying it was a testament to Riordan s skills that the books never end up being too boring and predictable He also noted girlfriend and boyfriend were bandied around more times than necessary to establish who is with whom However he found it interesting to watch the characters grow up in another installment of the series and praised the cliffhanger ending A reviewer from The Guardian was less troubled calling this the best in the series so far and praising its funny bits but concurred with Ortiz on the perspective format which they felt was lopsided in favor of Annabeth Percy and Jason In contrast Benjamin Boche of KidsReads enjoyed having multiple narrators writing Each one brings a breath of fresh air to whatever is happening and their unique perspectives keep things interesting He adds There are many characters to juggle but everyone has an important role and all their actions and storylines fit together seamlessly br Rebecca Fisher of Fantasy Literature rated it writing Though it suffers a little from middle book syndrome with nothing started and nothing finished Riordan makes sure that Annabeth s quest remains the key focus of the book letting it drive the course of the otherwise sprawling narrative While observing the narrative can get a bit cluttered at times Fisher appreciated his Riordan s droll sense of writing style and contemporary updates on Greek and Roman mythology Booklist similarly appreciated the mix of various elements opining Throughout the novel the juxtaposition of humor and terror makes both aspects of the writing more vivid br br br Sequel br br The following book of the series The House of Hades was released on October br br br br
