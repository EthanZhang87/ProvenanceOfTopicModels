growth of the city Because of clauses in the city s charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles br br Los Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States On September the Los Angeles City Council promulgated

already regulated as nuisances These included explosives warehousing gas works oil drilling slaughterhouses and tanneries Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city However between and the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones and as a consequence some industrial uses emerged within them There are two differences between the Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States First the laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the New

After the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever sprawling into the San Fernando Valley The expansion of the state owned Interstate Highway System during the s and s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city s privately owned electrified rail system once the world s largest br br As a consequence of World War II suburban growth and population density

produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks br br br Geology br br Los Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire The geologic instability has produced numerous faults which cause approximately earthquakes annually in Southern California though most of them are too small to be felt The strike slip San Andreas Fault system which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every to years and seismologists have warned about the next big one as the last major earthquake was the Fort Tejon earthquake The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the Long Beach San Fernando Whittier Narrows and the Northridge events

developed piecemeal and are well defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them br br br Overview br br The city s street patterns generally follow a grid plan with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks However this is complicated by rugged terrain which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city many of which are extremely long Sepulveda Boulevard is miles km long while Foothill Boulevard is over miles km long reaching as far east as San Bernardino Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker TomTom

climate K ppen Csb on the coast Csa otherwise Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round In winter they average around F C Autumn months tend to be hot with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year with an average of only days with measurable precipitation annually br Temperatures in the coastal basin exceed F C on a dozen or so days in the year from one day a month in April May June and November to three days a month in July August October and to five days in September Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over F C The average annual temperature of the sea is F C from F C in January to F C in August Hours of sunshine total more than per year from an average of hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of in July br Due to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other For example the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is F C whereas it is F C in Canoga Park miles km away The city like much of the Southern Californian coast is subject to a late spring early summer weather phenomenon called June Gloom This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon br br More recently statewide droughts in California have further strained the city s water security Downtown Los Angeles averages in mm of precipitation annually mainly occurring between November and March generally in the form of moderate rain showers but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift Summer days are usually rainless Rarely an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer especially to the mountains The coast gets slightly less rainfall while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more Years of average rainfall are rare The usual pattern is a year to year variability with a short string of dry years of in mm rainfall followed by one or two wet years with more than in mm Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni o conditions in the Pacific dry years with cooler water La Ni a episodes A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes br br Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast with the last occurrence of a F C reading at the downtown station being January freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was inches cm on January

the highest temperature ever officially recorded is F C on September at the weather station at Pierce College in the San Fernando Valley neighborhood of Woodland Hills During autumn and winter Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Los Angeles and raise wildfire risk br br br Environmental issues br br Owing to geography heavy reliance on automobiles and the Los Angeles Long Beach port complex Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles airplanes locomotives shipping manufacturing and other sources br br The smog season lasts from approximately May to October While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog Los Angeles gets only inches mm of rain each year pollution accumulates over many consecutive days Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation including the Clean Air Act When the act was passed California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles More recently the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low emission vehicles Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it which include electric and hybrid cars improvements in mass transit and other measures br The
