In Greek mythology Tartarus Ancient Greek romanized T rtaros is the deep abyss that is used as a dungeon of torment and suffering for the wicked and as the prison for the Titans Tartarus is the place where according to Plato s Gorgias c BC souls are judged after death and where the wicked received divine punishment Tartarus appears in early Greek cosmology such as in Hesiod s Theogony where the personified Tartarus is described as one of the earliest beings to exist alongside Chaos and Gaia Earth br br br Greek mythology br br In Greek mythology Tartarus is both a deity and a place in the underworld br br br As a deity br In the Greek poet Hesiod s Theogony c late th century BC Tartarus was the third of the primordial deities following after Chaos and Gaia Earth and preceding Eros and was the father by Gaia of the monster Typhon According to Hyginus Tartarus was the offspring of Aether and Gaia br br br As a location br Hesiod asserts that a bronze anvil falling from heaven would fall nine days before it reached the earth The anvil would take nine more days to fall from earth to Tartarus In the Iliad c th century BC Zeus asserts that Tartarus is as far beneath Hades as heaven is above earth Similarly the mythographer Apollodorus describes Tartarus as a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from earth as earth is distant from the sky br While according to Greek mythology the realm of Hades is the place of the dead Tartarus also has a number of inhabitants When Cronus came to power as the King of the Titans he imprisoned the three ancient one eyed Cyclopes and only the hundred armed Hecatonchires in Tartarus and set the monster Campe as its guard Campe was part scorpion and had a ring of animal heads around her waist snapping at anyone who dared to get near She also carried a whip to torture the Cyclopes and the hundred armed ones Zeus killed Campe and released these imprisoned giants to aid in his conflict with the Titans The gods of Olympus eventually triumphed Cronus and many of the other Titans were banished to Tartarus though Prometheus Epimetheus and female Titans such as Metis were spared Other gods could be sentenced to Tartarus as well In the Homeric hymn to Hermes Apollo threatens to throw Hermes into Tartarus Apollo himself was almost condemned to Tartarus by Zeus for the act of killing the Cyclops The Hecatonchires became guards of Tartarus s prisoners Later when Zeus overcame the monster Typhon he threw him into wide Tartarus br br br Residents br Originally Tartarus was used only to confine dangers to the gods of Olympus and their predecessors In later mythologies Tartarus became a space dedicated to the imprisonment and torment of mortals who had sinned against the gods and each punishment was unique to the condemned For example br br King Sisyphus was sent to Tartarus for killing guests and travelers at his castle in violation of his hospitality seducing his niece and reporting one of Zeus sexual conquests by telling the river god Asopus of the whereabouts of his daughter Aegina who had been taken away by Zeus But regardless of the impropriety of Zeus frequent conquests Sisyphus overstepped his bounds by considering himself a peer of the gods who could rightfully report their indiscretions When Zeus ordered Thanatos to chain up Sisyphus in Tartarus Sisyphus tricked Thanatos by asking him how the chains worked and ended up chaining Thanatos as a result there was no more death This caused Ares to free Thanatos and turn Sisyphus over to him Sometime later Sisyphus had Persephone send him back to the surface to scold his wife for not burying him properly Sisyphus was forcefully dragged back to Tartarus by Hermes when he refused to go back to the Underworld after that In Tartarus Sisyphus was forced forever to try to roll a large boulder to the top of a mountain slope which no matter how many times he nearly succeeded in his attempt would always roll back to the bottom This constituted the punishment fitting the crime of Sisyphus for daring to claim that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus Zeus s cunning punishment demonstrated quite the opposite to be the case condemning Sisyphus to a humiliating eternity of futility and frustration br King Tantalus also ended up in Tartarus after he cut up his son Pelops boiled him and served him as food when he was invited to dine with the gods He also stole the ambrosia from the Gods and told his people its secrets Another story mentioned that he held onto a golden dog forged by Hephaestus and stolen by Tantalus friend Pandareus Tantalus held onto the golden dog for safekeeping and later denied to Pandareus that he had it Tantalus punishment for his actions now a proverbial term for temptation without satisfaction was to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches Whenever he reached for the fruit the branches raised his intended meal from his grasp Whenever he bent down to get a drink the water receded before he could get any Over his head towered a threatening stone like that of Sisyphus br Ixion was the king of the Lapiths the most ancient tribe of Thessaly Ixion grew to hate his father in law and ended up pushing him onto a bed of coal and wood committing the first kin related murder The princes of other lands ordered that Ixion be denied the cleansing of his sin Zeus took pity on Ixion and invited him to a meal on Olympus But when Ixion saw Hera he fell in love with her and did some under the table caressing until Zeus signaled him to stop After finding a place for Ixion to sleep Zeus created a cloud clone of Hera named Nephele to test him to see how far he would go to seduce Hera Ixion made love to her which resulted in the birth of Centaurus who mated with some Magnesian mares on Mount Pelion and thus begot the race of Centaurs who are called the Ixionidae from their descent Zeus drove Ixion from Mount Olympus and then struck him with a thunderbolt He was punished by being tied to a winged flaming wheel that was always spinning first in the sky and then in Tartarus Only when Orpheus came down to the Underworld to rescue Eurydice did it stop spinning because of the music Orpheus was playing Ixion s being strapped to the flaming wheel represented his burning lust br In some versions the Dana des murdered their husbands and were punished in Tartarus by being forced to carry water in a jug to fill a bath which would thereby wash off their sins But the jugs were filled with cracks so the water always leaked out br The giant Tityos attempted to rape Leto on Hera s orders but was slain by Apollo and Artemis As punishment Tityos was stretched out in Tartarus and tortured by two vultures who fed on his liver This punishment is extremely similar to that of the Titan Prometheus br King Salmoneus was also mentioned to have been imprisoned in Tartarus after passing himself off as Zeus causing the real Zeus to smite him with a thunderbolt br Arke is the sister of Iris who sided with the Titans as their messenger goddess Zeus removed her wings following the gods victory over the Titans and she was thrown into Tartarus with the Titans br Ocnus was condemned in Tartarus perpetually to weave a rope of straw which as fast as he weaves it is just as quickly eaten by a donkey There is no mention of what he did to deserve this fate br When his pregnant daughter Coronis was killed by either Artemis or Apollo King Phlegyas set fire to the Apollonian temple at Delphi and was killed by Apollo He was punished in Tartarus by being entombed in a rock and starved in front of an eternal feast as he shouts to the other inhabitants not to despise the gods br According to Plato c BC Rhadamanthus Aeacus and Minos were the judges of the dead and chose who went to Tartarus Rhadamanthus judged Asian souls Aeacus judged European souls and Minos was the deciding vote and judge of the Greek Souls regarded as unjust or perjured would go to Tartarus Those who committed crimes seen as curable would be purified there while those who committed crimes seen as uncurable would be eternally damned and demonstrate a warning example for the living In Gorgias Plato writes about Socrates telling Callicles who believes might makes right that doing injustice to others is worse than suffering injustice and most uncurable inhabitants of Tartarus were tyrants whose might gave them the opportunity to commit huge crimes Archelaus I of Macedon is mentioned as a possible example of this while Thersites is said to be curable because of his lack of might According to Plato s Phaedo the uncurable consisted of temple robbers and murderers while sons who killed one of their parents during a status of rage but regretted this their whole life long and involuntary manslaughterers would be taken out of Tartarus after one year so they could ask their victims for forgiveness If they should be forgiven they were liberated but if not would go back and stay there until they were finally pardoned In the Republic Plato mentions the Myth of Er who is said to have been a fallen soldier who resurrected from the dead and saw their realm According to this the length of a punishment an adult receives for each crime in Tartarus who is responsible for a lot of deaths betrayed states or armies and sold them into slavery or had been involved in similar misdeeds corresponds to ten times out of a hundred earthly years while good deeds would be rewarded in equal measure br There were a number of entrances to Tartarus in Greek mythology One was in Aornum br br br Roman mythology br In Roman mythology sinners as defined by the Roman societal and cultural norms of their time are sent to Tartarus for punishment after death Virgil describes Tartarus in great detail in the Aeneid Book VI He described it as expansive It is surrounded by three perimeter walls beyond which flows a flaming river named the Phlegethon Drinking from the Phlegethon will not kill a mortal and it will heal while causing great pain To further prevent escape a hydra with fifty black gaping jaws sits atop a gate that screeches when opened They are flanked by adamantine columns a substance that like diamond was believed to be so hard that nothing can cut through it br Inside the walls of Tartarus sits a wide walled castle with a tall iron turret Tisiphone one of the Erinyes who represents vengeance stands sleepless guard at the top of the turret lashing her whip Roman mythology describes a pit inside extending down into the earth twice as far as the distance from the lands of the living to Olympus The twin sons of the Titan Aloeus were said to be imprisoned at the bottom of this pit br br br Biblical pseudepigrapha br br Tartarus occurs in the Septuagint translation of Job and into Koine Greek and in Hellenistic Jewish literature from the Greek text of the Book of Enoch dated to BC This states that God placed the archangel Uriel in charge of the world and of Tartarus Tartarus is generally understood to be the place where fallen Watchers angels are imprisoned br Reference to the watchers of the book of Enoch is also observed in Jude where scripture describes Angels being bound by chains under everlasting darkness and Peter which further describes fallen angels committed to chains in Tartarus br In Hypostasis of the Archons also translated Reality of the Rulers an apocryphal gnostic treatise dated before AD Tartarus makes a brief appearance when Z life the daughter of Sophia wisdom casts Ialdaba th demiurge down to the bottom of the abyss of Tartarus br In The Book of Thomas Tartaros is claimed by Jesus to be the place where those who hear the word of Judas Thomas and turn away or sneer are to be sent These damned will be handed over to the angel or power Tartarouchos br br br New Testament br br In the New Testament the noun Tartarus does not occur but tartaro throw to Tartarus a shortened form of the classical Greek verb kata tartaro throw down to Tartarus does appear in Peter Liddell Scott provides other sources for the shortened form of this verb including Acusilaus th century BC Joannes Laurentius Lydus th century AD and the Scholiast on Aeschylus Eumenides who cites Pindar relating how the earth tried to tartaro cast down Apollo after he overcame the Python In classical texts the longer form kata tartaroo is often related to the throwing of the Titans down to Tartarus br The English Standard Version is one of several English versions that gives the Greek reading Tartarus as a footnote br br For if God did not spare angels when they sinned but cast them into hell a and committed them to chains b of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment br Adam Clarke reasoned that Peter s use of language relating to the Titans was an indication that the ancient Greeks had heard of a Biblical punishment of fallen angels Some Evangelical Christian commentaries distinguish Tartarus as a place for wicked angels and Gehenna as a place for wicked humans on the basis of this verse Other Evangelical commentaries in reconciling that some fallen angels are chained in Tartarus yet some not attempt to distinguish between one type of fallen angel and another br br br See also br Greek mythology in popular culture br Erebus br Charon br Lake of fire br Duat br Hell br Orcus br Sheol br The Golden
