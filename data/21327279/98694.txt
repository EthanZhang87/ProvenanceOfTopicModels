title: Pluto (mythology)
id: 98694
In ancient Greek religion and mythology Pluto Greek Plout n was the ruler of the Greek underworld The earlier name for the god was Hades which became more common as the name of the underworld itself Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god who presides over the afterlife Plout n was frequently conflated with Plo tos the Greek god of wealth because mineral wealth was found underground and because as a chthonic god Pluto ruled the deep earth that contained the seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest The name Plout n came into widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries in which Pluto was venerated as both a stern ruler and a loving husband to Persephone The couple received souls in the afterlife and are invoked together in religious inscriptions being referred to as Plouton and as Kore respectively Hades by contrast had few temples and religious practices associated with him and he is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone br Pluto and Hades differ in character but they are not distinct figures and share two dominant myths In Greek cosmogony the god received the rule of the underworld in a three way division of sovereignty over the world with his brother Zeus ruling the sky and his other brother Poseidon sovereign over the sea His central narrative in myth is of him abducting Persephone to be his wife and the queen of his realm Plouton as the name of the ruler of the underworld first appears in Greek literature of the Classical period in the works of the Athenian playwrights and of the philosopher Plato who is the major Greek source on its significance Under the name Pluto the god appears in other myths in a secondary role mostly as the possessor of a quest object and especially in the descent of Orpheus or other heroes to the underworld br Pl t plu to genitive Pl t nis is the Latinized form of the Greek Plouton Pluto s Roman equivalent is Dis Pater whose name is most often taken to mean Rich Father and is perhaps a direct translation of Plouton Pluto was also identified with the obscure Roman Orcus like Hades the name of both a god of the underworld and the underworld as a place Pluto Pluton in French and German Plutone in Italian becomes the most common name for the classical ruler of the underworld in subsequent Western literature and other art forms br br br Hesiod br br The name Plouton does not appear in Greek literature of the Archaic period In Hesiod s Theogony the six children of Cronus and Rhea are Zeus Hera Poseidon Hades Demeter and Hestia The male children divide the world into three realms Hades takes Persephone by force from her mother Demeter with the consent of Zeus Ploutos Wealth appears in the Theogony as the child of Demeter and Iasion fine Plutus who goes upon the whole earth and the broad back of the sea and whoever meets him and comes into his hands that man he makes rich and he bestows much wealth upon him The union of Demeter and Iasion described also in the Odyssey took place in a fallow field that had been ploughed three times in what seems to be a reference to a ritual copulation or sympathetic magic to ensure the earth s fertility The resemblance of the name Ploutos to Plouton it has been noted cannot be accidental Plouton is lord of the dead but as Persephone s husband he has serious claims to the powers of fertility Demeter s son Plutus merges in the narrative tradition with her son in law Pluto redefining the implacable chariot driver Hades whose horses trample the flowering earth br That the underworld god was associated early on with success in agricultural activity is already evident in Hesiod s Works and Days line Pray to Zeus of the Earth and to pure Demeter to make Demeter s holy grain sound and heavy when first you begin ploughing when you hold in your hand the end of the plough tail and bring down your stick on the backs of the oxen as they draw on the pole bar by the yoke straps br br br Plouton and Ploutos br br Plouton was one of several euphemistic names for Hades described in the Iliad as the god most hateful to mortals Plato says that people prefer the name Plouton giver of wealth because the name of Hades is fear provoking The name was understood as referring to the boundless riches of the earth both the crops on its surface he was originally a god of the land and the mines hidden within it What is sometimes taken as confusion of the two gods Plouton and Ploutos Wealth held or acquired a theological significance in antiquity As a lord of abundance or riches Pluto expresses the aspect of the underworld god that was positive symbolized in art by the horn of plenty cornucopia by means of which Plouton is distinguished from the gloomier Hades br The Roman poet Ennius ca BC the leading figure in the Hellenization of Latin literature considered Pluto a Greek god to be explained in terms of the Roman equivalents Dis Pater and Orcus It is unclear whether Pluto had a literary presence in Rome before Ennius Some scholars think that rituals and beliefs pertaining to Pluto entered Roman culture with the establishment of the Saecular Games in BC and that Dis pater was only a translation of Plouton In the mid st century BC Cicero identifies Pluto with Dis explaining that The earth in all its power and plenty is sacred to Father Dis a name which is the same as Dives The Wealthy One as is the Greek Plouton This is because everything is born of the earth and returns to it again br During the Roman Imperial era the Greek geographer Strabo st century AD makes a distinction between Pluto and Hades In writing of the mineral wealth of ancient Iberia Roman Spain he says that among the Turdetani it is Pluto and not Hades who inhabits the region down below In the discourse On Mourning by the Greek author Lucian nd century AD Pluto s wealth is the dead he rules over in the abyss chasma the name Hades is reserved for the underworld itself br br br Other identifications br In Greek religious practice Pluto is sometimes seen as the chthonic Zeus Zeus Chthonios or Zeus Catachthonios or at least as having functions or significance equivalent to those of Zeus but pertaining to the earth or underworld In ancient Roman and Hellenistic religion Pluto was identified with a number of other deities including Summanus the Roman god of nocturnal thunder Februus the Roman god from whose purification rites the month of February takes its name and an Etruscans god of the underworld the syncretic god Serapis regarded as Pluto s Egyptian equivalent and the Semitic god Muth Muth was described by Philo of Byblos as the equivalent of both Thanatos Death personified and Pluto The ancient Greeks did not regard Pluto as death per se br br br Mythology br br The best known myth involving Pluto or Hades is the abduction of Persephone also known as Kore the Maiden The earliest literary versions of the myth are a brief mention in Hesiod s Theogony and the extended narrative of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter in both these works the ruler of the underworld is named as Hades the Hidden One Hades is an unsympathetic figure and Persephone s unwillingness is emphasized Increased usage of the name Plouton in religious inscriptions and literary texts reflects the influence of the Eleusinian Mysteries which treated Pluto and Persephone as a divine couple who received initiates in the afterlife as such Pluto was disassociated from the violent abductor of Kore Two early works that give the abductor god s name as Pluto are the Greek mythography traditionally known as the Library of Apollodorus st century BC and the Latin Fables of Hyginus ca BC AD br The most influential version of the abduction myth is that of Ovid d or AD who tells the story in both the Metamorphoses Book and the Fasti Book Another major retelling also in Latin is the long unfinished poem De raptu Proserpinae On the Abduction of Proserpina by Claudian d AD Ovid uses the name Dis not Pluto in these two passages and Claudian uses Pluto only once translators and editors however sometimes supply the more familiar Pluto when other epithets appear in the source text The abduction myth was a popular subject for Greek and Roman art and recurs throughout Western art and literature where the name Pluto becomes common see Pluto in Western art and literature below Narrative details from Ovid and Claudian influence these later versions in which the abductor is named as Pluto especially the role of Venus and Cupid in manipulating Pluto with love and desire Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance and certainly by the time of Natale Conti s influential Mythologiae the traditions pertaining to the various rulers of the classical underworld coalesced into a single mythology that made few if any distinctions among Hades Pluto Dis and Orcus br br br Offspring br Unlike his freely procreating brothers Zeus and Poseidon Pluto is monogamous and is rarely said to have children In Orphic texts the chthonic nymph Melinoe is the daughter of Persephone by Zeus disguised as Pluto and the Eumenides The Kindly Ones are the offspring of Persephone and Zeus Chthonios often identified as Pluto The Augustan poet Vergil says that Pluto is the father of the Furies but the mother is the goddess Nox Nyx not his wife Persephone The lack of a clear distinction between Pluto and chthonic Zeus confuses the question of whether in some traditions now obscure Persephone bore children to her husband In the late th century AD Claudian s epic on the abduction motivates Pluto with a desire for children The poem is unfinished however and anything Claudian may have known of these traditions is lost br Justin Martyr nd century AD alludes to children of Pluto but neither names nor enumerates them Hesychius th century AD mentions a son of Pluto In his th century mythography Boccaccio records a tradition in which Pluto was the father of the divine personification Veneratio Reverence noting that she had no mother because Proserpina the Latin name of Persephone was sterile br In The Faerie Queene s Edmund Spenser invents a daughter for Pluto whom he calls Lucifera The character s name was taken from the th century mythography of Natale Conti who used it as the Latin translation of Greek phosphor light bearer a regular epithet of Hecate Spenser incorporated aspects of the mysteries into The Faerie Queene br br br Pluto and Orpheus br br Orpheus was regarded as a founder and prophet of the mysteries called Orphic Dionysiac or Bacchic Mythologized for his ability to entrance even animals and trees with his music he was also credited in antiquity with the authorship of the lyrics that have survived as the Orphic Hymns among them a hymn to Pluto Orpheus s voice and lyre playing represented a medium of revelation or higher knowledge for the mystery cults br In his central myth Orpheus visits the underworld in the hope of retrieving his bride Eurydice relying on the power of his music to charm the king and queen of Hades Greek narratives of Orpheus s descent and performance typically name the ruler of the underworld as Plouton as for instance in the Bibliotheca The myth demonstrates the importance of Pluto the Rich as the possessor of a quest object Orpheus performing before Pluto and Persephone was a common subject of ancient and later Western literature and art and one of the most significant mythological themes of the classical tradition br The demonstration of Orpheus s power depends on the normal obduracy of Pluto the Augustan poet Horace describes him as incapable of tears Claudian however portrays the steely god as succumbing to Orpheus s song so that with iron cloak he wipes his tears ferrugineo lacrimas deterget amictu an image renewed by Milton in Il Penseroso Such notes Drew iron tears down Pluto s cheek br The Greek writer Lucian ca after AD suggests that Pluto s love for his wife gave the ruler of the underworld a special sympathy or insight into lovers parted by death In one of Lucian s Dialogues of the Dead Pluto questions Protesilaus the first Greek hero killed in the Trojan War who wishes to return to the world of the living You are then in love with life Pluto asks Such lovers we have here in plenty but they love an object which none of them can obtain Protesilaus explains like an Orpheus in reverse that he has left behind a young bride whose memory even the Lethe s waters of forgetting have not erased from him Pluto assures him that death will reunite them someday but Protesilaus argues that Pluto himself should understand love and its impatience and reminds the king of his grant to Orpheus and to Alcestis who took her husband s place in death and then was permitted at the insistence of Heracles to return to him When Persephone intercedes for the dead warrior Pluto grants the request at once though allowing only one day for the reunion br br br Mysteries and cult br br As Pluto gained importance as an embodiment of agricultural wealth within the Eleusinian Mysteries from the th century BC onward the name Hades was increasingly reserved for the underworld as a place Neither Hades nor Pluto was one of the traditional Twelve Olympians and Hades seems to have received limited cult perhaps only at Elis where the temple was opened once a year During the time of Plato the Athenians periodically honored the god called Plouton with the strewing of a couch t n klin n str sai At Eleusis Plouton had his own priestess Pluto was worshipped with Persephone as a divine couple at Knidos Ephesos Mytilene and Sparta as well as at Eleusis where they were known simply as God Theos and Goddess Thea br In the ritual texts of the mystery religions preserved by the so called Orphic or Bacchic gold tablets from the late th century BC onward the name Hades appears more frequently than Plouton but in reference to the underground place Plouton is the ruler who presides over it in a harmonious partnership with Persephone By the end of the th century BC the name Plouton appears in Greek metrical inscriptions Two fragmentary tablets greet Pluto and Persephone jointly and the divine couple appear as welcoming figures in a metrical epitaph br br I know that even below the earth if there is indeed a reward for the worthy ones the first and foremost honors nurse shall be yours next to Persephone and Pluto br br Hesychius identifies Pluto with Eubouleus but other ancient sources distinguish between these two underworld deities In the Mysteries Eubouleus plays the role of a torchbearer possibly a guide for the initiate s return In the view of Lewis Richard Farnell Eubouleus was originally a title referring to the good counsel the ruler of the underworld was able to give and which was sought at Pluto s dream oracles by the nd century BC however he had acquired a separate identity br br br Orphic Hymn to Pluto br The Orphic Hymn to Pluto addresses the god as strong spirited and the All Receiver who commands death and is the master of mortals His titles are given as Zeus Chthonios and Euboulos Good Counsel In the hymn s topography Pluto s dwelling is in Tartarus simultaneously a meadow and thick shaded and dark where the Acheron encircles the roots of the earth Hades is again the name of the place here described as windless and its gates through which Pluto carried pure Demeter s daughter as his bride are located in an Attic cave within the district of Eleusis The route from Persephone s meadow to Hades crosses the sea The hymn concludes br br You alone were born to judge deeds obscure and conspicuous Holiest and illustrious ruler of all frenzied god You delight in the worshiper s respect and reverence Come with favor and joy to the initiates I summon you br br The hymn is one of several examples of Greco Roman prayer that express a desire for the presence of a deity and has been compared to a similar epiclesis in the Acts of Thomas br br br Magic invocations br The names of both Hades and Pluto appear also in the Greek Magical Papyri and curse tablets with Hades typically referring to the underworld as a place and Pluto regularly invoked as the partner of Persephone Five Latin curse tablets from Rome dating to the mid st century BC promise Persephone and Pluto an offering of dates figs and a black pig if the curse is fulfilled by the desired deadline The pig was a characteristic animal sacrifice to chthonic deities whose victims were almost always black or dark in color br A set of curse tablets written in Doric Greek and found in a tomb addresses a Pasianax Lord to All sometimes taken as a title of Pluto but more recently thought to be a magical name for the corpse Pasianax is found elsewhere as an epithet of Zeus or in the tablets may invoke a daimon like Abrasax br br br Sanctuaries of Pluto br br A sanctuary dedicated to Pluto was called a ploutonion Latin plutonium The complex at Eleusis for the mysteries had a ploutonion regarded as the birthplace of the divine child Ploutos in another instance of conflation or close association of the two gods Greek inscriptions record an altar of Pluto which was to be plastered that is resurfaced for a new round of sacrifices at Eleusis One of the known ploutonia was in the sacred grove between Tralleis and Nysa where a temple of Pluto and Persephone was located Visitors sought healing and dream oracles The ploutonion at Hierapolis Phrygia was connected to the rites of Cybele but during the Roman Imperial era was subsumed by the cult of Apollo as confirmed by archaeological investigations during the s It too was a dream oracle The sites often seem to have been chosen because the presence of naturally occurring mephitic vapors was thought to indicate an opening to the underworld In Italy Avernus was considered an entrance to the underworld that produced toxic vapors but Strabo seems not to think that it was a ploutonion br br br Iconography and attributes br br br In Eleusinian scenes br Kevin Clinton attempted to distinguish the iconography of Hades Plouton Ploutos and the Eleusinian Theos in th century vase painting that depicts scenes from or relating to the mysteries In Clinton s schema Plouton is a mature man sometimes even white haired Hades is also usually bearded and mature but his darkness is emphasized in literary descriptions represented in art by dark hair Plouton s most common attribute is a sceptre but he also often holds a full or overflowing cornucopia Hades sometimes holds a horn but it is depicted with no contents and should be understood as a drinking horn Unlike Plouton Hades never holds agrarian attributes such as stalks of grain His chest is usually bare or only partly covered whereas Plouton is fully robed exceptions however are admitted by the author Plouton stands often in the company of both Demeter and Kore or sometimes one of the goddesses but Hades almost always sits or reclines usually with Persephone facing him Confusion and disagreement about the interpretation of these images remain br br br The keys of Pluto br Attributes of Pluto mentioned in the Orphic Hymn to Pluto are his scepter keys throne and horses In the hymn the keys are connected to his capacity for giving wealth to humanity specifically the agricultural wealth of the year s fruits br br Pausanias explains the significance of Pluto s key in describing a wondrously carved cedar chest at the Temple of Hera in Elis Numerous deities are depicted with one panel grouping Dionysus Persephone the nymphs and Pluto Pluto holds a key because they say that what is called Hades has been locked up by Pluto and that nobody will return back again therefrom Natale Conti cites Pausanias in noting that keys are an attribute of Pluto as the scepter is of Jove Greek Zeus and the trident of Neptune Poseidon br A golden key chrusea kl s was laid on the tongue of initiates by priests at Eleusis and was a symbol of the revelation they were obligated to keep secret A key is among the attributes of other infernal deities such as Hecate Anubis and Persephone and those who act as guardians or timekeepers such as Janus and Aion Aeacus Aiakos one of the three mortal kings who became judges in the afterlife is also a kleidouchos holder of the keys and a priestly doorkeeper in the court of Pluto and Persephone br br br Vegetation and color br According to the Stoic philosopher Cornutus st century AD Pluto wore a wreath of phasganion more often called xiphion traditionally identified as a type of gladiolus Dioscorides recorded medical uses for the plant For extracting stings and thorns xiphion was mixed with wine and frankincense to make a cataplasm The plant was also used as an aphrodisiac and contraceptive It grew in humid places In an obscure passage Cornutus seems to connect Pluto s wearing of phasganion to an etymology for Avernus which he derives from the word for air perhaps through some association with the color glaukos bluish grey greenish or sea colored which might describe the plant s leaves Because the color could describe the sky Cornutus regularly gives it divine connotations Pluto s twin sister was named Glauca br Ambiguity of color is characteristic of Pluto Although both he and his realm are regularly described as dark black or gloomy the god himself is sometimes seen as pale or having a pallor Martianus Capella th century describes him as both growing pale in shadow a fugitive from light and actively shedding darkness in the gloom of Tartarean night crowned with a wreath made of ebony as suitable for the kingdom he governs The horses of Pluto are usually black but Ovid describes them as sky colored caeruleus from caelum sky which might be blue greenish blue or dark blue br br The Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti says wreaths of narcissus maidenhair fern adianthus and cypress were given to Pluto In the Homeric Hymn to Demeter Gaia Earth produced the narcissus at Zeus s request as a snare for Persephone when she grasps it a chasm opens up and the Host to Many Hades seizes her Narcissus wreaths were used in early times to crown Demeter and Persephone as well as the Furies Eumenides The flower was associated with narcotic drugginess nark torpor erotic fascination and imminent death to dream of crowning oneself with narcissus was a bad sign In the myth of Narcissus the flower is created when a beautiful self absorbed youth rejects sexuality and is condemned to perpetual self love along the Styx br Conti s inclusion of adianthus Adiantum in modern nomenclature is less straightforward The name meaning unmoistened Greek adianton was taken in antiquity to refer to the fern s ability to repel water The plant which grew in wet places was also called capillus veneris hair of Venus divinely dry when she emerged from the sea Historian of medicine John M Riddle has suggested that the adianthus was one of the ferns Dioscorides called asplenon and prescribed as a contraceptive atokios The associations of Proserpine Persephone and the maidenhair are alluded to by Samuel Beckett in a poem in which the self is a Platonic cave with capillaires in French both maidenhair fern and blood vessels br The cypress Greek cyparissus Latin cupressus has traditional associations with mourning In ancient Attica households in mourning were garlanded with cypress and it was used to fumigate the air during cremations In the myth of Cyparissus a youth was transformed into a cypress consumed by grief over the accidental death of a pet stag A white cypress is part of the topography of the underworld that recurs in the Orphic gold tablets as a kind of beacon near the entrance perhaps to be compared with the Tree of Life in various world mythologies The description of the cypress as white Greek leuk since the botanical tree is dark is symbolic evoking the white garments worn by initiates or the clothing of a corpse or the pallor of the dead In Orphic funeral rites it was forbidden to make coffins of cypress br The tradition of the mystery religions favors Pluton Hades as a loving and faithful partner to Persephone but one ancient myth that preserves a lover for him parallels the abduction and also has a vegetative aspect A Roman source says that Pluto fell in love with Leuca Greek Leuk White the most beautiful of the nymphs and abducted her to live with him in his realm After the long span of her life came to its end he memorialized their love by creating a white tree in the Elysian Fields The tree was the white poplar Greek leuk the leaves of which are white on one side and dark on the other representing the duality of upper and underworld A wreath of white poplar leaves was fashioned by Heracles to mark his ascent from the underworld an aition for why it was worn by initiates and by champion athletes participating in funeral games Like other plants associated with Pluto white poplar was regarded as a contraceptive in antiquity The relation of this tree to the white cypress of the mysteries is debated br br br The helmet of invisibility br The Bibliotheca of Pseudo Apollodorus uses the name Plouton instead of Hades in relating the tripartite division of sovereignty the abduction of Persephone and the visit of Orpheus to the underworld This version of the theogony for the most part follows Hesiod see above but adds that the three brothers were each given a gift by the Cyclopes to use in their battle against the Titans Zeus thunder and lightning Poseidon a trident and Pluto a helmet kyne br The helmet Pluto receives is presumably the magical Cap of Invisibility aidos kyne but the Bibliotheca is the only ancient source that explicitly says it belonged to Pluto The verbal play of aidos invisible and Hades is thought to account for this attribution of the helmet to the ruler of the underworld since no ancient narratives record his use or possession of it Later authors such as Rabelais th century do attribute the helmet to Pluto Erasmus calls it the helmet of Orcus and gives it as a figure of speech referring to those who conceal their true nature by a cunning device Francis Bacon notes the proverbial usage the helmet of Pluto which maketh the politic man go invisible is secrecy in the counsel and celerity in the execution br br br Bident br br No ancient image of the ruler of the underworld can be said with certainty to show him with a bident though the ornamented tip of his scepter may have been misunderstood at times as a bident In the Roman world the bident from bi two dent teeth was an agricultural implement It may also represent one of the three types of lightning wielded by Jupiter the Roman counterpart of Zeus and the Etruscan Tinia The later notion that the ruler of the underworld wielded a trident or bident can perhaps be traced to a line in Seneca s Hercules Furens Hercules Enraged in which Father Dis the Roman counterpart of Pluto uses a three pronged spear to drive off Hercules as he attempts to invade Pylos Seneca calls Dis the Infernal Jove or the dire Jove the Jove who gives dire or ill omens dirae just as in the Greek tradition Plouton is sometimes identified as a chthonic Zeus That the trident and bident might be somewhat interchangeable is suggested by a Byzantine scholiast who mentions Poseidon being armed with a bident br In the Middle Ages classical underworld figures began to be depicted with a pitchfork Early Christian writers had identified the classical underworld with Hell and its denizens as demons or devils In the Renaissance the bident became a conventional attribute of Pluto In an influential ceiling mural depicting the wedding of Cupid and Psyche painted by Raphael s workshop for the Villa Farnesina in Pluto is shown holding the bident with Cerberus at his side while Neptune holds the trident Perhaps influenced by this work Agostino Carracci originally depicted Pluto with a bident in a preparatory drawing for his painting Pluto in which the god ended up holding his characteristic key In Caravaggio s Giove Nettuno e Plutone ca a ceiling mural based on alchemical allegory it is Neptune who holds the bident br br br In Greek literature and philosophy br br The name Plouton is first used in Greek literature by Athenian playwrights In Aristophanes comedy The Frogs Batrachoi BC in which the Eleusinian colouring is in fact so pervasive the ruler of the underworld is one of the characters under the name of Plouton The play depicts a mock descent to the underworld by the god Dionysus to bring back one of the dead tragic playwrights in the hope of restoring Athenian theater to its former glory Pluto is a silent presence onstage for about lines presiding over a contest among the tragedians then announces that the winner has the privilege of returning to the upper world The play also draws on beliefs and imagery from Orphic and Dionysiac cult and rituals pertaining to Ploutos Plutus wealth In a fragment from another play by Aristophanes a character is comically singing of the excellent aspects of being dead asking in reference to the tripartition of sovereignty over the world br br To Plato the god of the underworld was an agent in the beneficent cycle of death and rebirth meriting worship under the name of Plouton a giver of spiritual wealth In the dialogue Cratylus Plato has Socrates explain the etymology of Plouton saying that Pluto gives wealth ploutos and his name means giver of wealth which comes out of the earth beneath Because the name Hades is taken to mean the invisible people fear what they cannot see although they are in error about the nature of this deity s power Socrates says the office and name of the God really correspond br br He is the perfect and accomplished Sophist and the great benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world and even to us who are upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings For he has much more than he wants down there wherefore he is called Pluto or the rich Note also that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body Now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that for in their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue but while they are flustered and maddened by the body not even father Cronos himself would suffice to keep them with him in his own far famed chains br br Since the union of body and soul is not better than the loosing death is not an evil Walter Burkert thus sees Pluto as a god of dissolution Among the titles of Pluto was Isodait s divider into equal portions a title that connects him to the fate goddesses the Moirai Isodait s was also a cult title for Dionysus and Helios br In ordering his ideal city Plato proposed a calendar in which Pluto was honored as a benefactor in the twelfth month implicitly ranking him as one of the twelve principal deities In the Attic calendar the twelfth month more or less equivalent to June was Skirophorion the name may be connected to the rape of Persephone br br br Theogonies and cosmology br br br Euhemerism and Latinization br In the theogony of Euhemerus th century BC the gods were treated as mortal rulers whose deeds were immortalized by tradition Ennius translated Euhemerus into Latin about a hundred years later and a passage from his version was in turn preserved by the early Christian writer Lactantius Here the union of Saturn the Roman equivalent of Cronus and Ops an Italic goddess of abundance produces Jupiter Greek Zeus Juno Hera Neptune Pluto and Glauca br br Then Saturn took Ops to wife Titan the elder brother demanded the kingship for himself Vesta their mother with their sisters Ceres Demeter and Ops persuaded Saturn not to give way to his brother in the matter Titan was less good looking than Saturn for that reason and also because he could see his mother and sisters working to have it so he conceded the kingship to Saturn and came to terms with him if Saturn had a male child born to him it would not be reared This was done to secure reversion of the kingship to Titan s children They then killed the first son that was born to Saturn Next came twin children Jupiter and Juno Juno was given to Saturn to see while Jupiter was secretly removed and given to Vesta to be brought up without Saturn s knowledge In the same way without Saturn knowing Ops bore Neptune and hid him away In her third labor Ops bore another set of twins Pluto and Glauce Pluto in Latin is Dis pater some call him Orcus Saturn was shown his daughter Glauce but his son Pluto was hidden and removed Glauce then died young That is the pedigree as written of Jupiter and his brothers that is how it has been passed down to us in holy scripture br br In this theogony which Ennius introduced into Latin literature Saturn Titan Vesta Ceres and Ops are siblings Glauca is the twin of Pluto and dies mysteriously young There are several mythological figures named Glauca the sister of Pluto may be the Glauca who in Cicero s account of the three aspects of Diana conceived the third with the equally mysterious Upis This is the genealogy for Pluto that Boccaccio used in his Genealogia Deorum Gentilium and in his lectures explicating the Divine Comedy of Dante br In Book of the Sibylline Oracles dating mostly to the nd century AD Rhea gives birth to Pluto as she passes by Dodona where the watery paths of the River Europus flowed and the water ran into the sea merged with the Peneius This is also called the Stygian river br br br Orphic and philosophical systems br The Orphic theogonies are notoriously varied and Orphic cosmology influenced the varying Gnostic theogonies of late antiquity Clementine literature th century AD preserves a theogony with explicit Orphic influence that also draws on Hesiod yielding a distinctive role for Pluto When the primordial elements came together by orderly cyclonic force they produced a generative sphere the egg from which the primeval Orphic entity Phanes is born and the world is formed The release of Phanes and his ascent to the heavenly top of the world egg causes the matter left in the sphere to settle in relation to weight creating the tripartite world of the traditional theogonies br br Its lower part the heaviest element sinks downwards and is called Pluto because of its gravity weight and great quantity pl thos of matter After the separation of this heavy element in the middle part of the egg the waters flow together which they call Poseidon The purest and noblest element the fire is called Zeus because its nature is glowing zeousa It flies right up into the air and draws up the spirit now called Metis that was left in the underlying moisture And when this spirit has reached the summit of the ether it is devoured by Zeus who in his turn begets the intelligence sunesis also called Pallas And by this artistic intelligence the etherial artificer creates the whole world This world is surrounded by the air which extends from Zeus the very hot ether to the earth this air is called Hera br br This cosmogony interprets Hesiod allegorically and so the heaviest element is identified not as the Earth but as the netherworld of Pluto In modern geochemistry plutonium is the heaviest primordial element Supposed etymologies are used to make sense of the relation of physical process to divine name Plouton is here connected to pl thos abundance br In the Stoic system Pluto represented the lower region of the air where according to Seneca st century AD the soul underwent a kind of purgatory before ascending to the ether Seneca s contemporary Cornutus made use of the traditional etymology of Pluto s name for Stoic theology The Stoics believed that the form of a word contained the original truth of its meaning which over time could become corrupted or obscured Plouton derived from ploutein to be wealthy Cornutus said because all things are corruptible and therefore are ultimately consigned to him as his property br Within the Pythagorean and Neoplatonic traditions Pluto was allegorized as the region where souls are purified located between the Moon as represented by Persephone and the Sun Neoplatonists sometimes interpreted the Eleusinian Mysteries as a fabula of celestial phenomena br br Authors tell the fable that Ceres was Proserpina s mother and that Proserpina while playing one day was kidnapped by Pluto Her mother searched for her with lighted torches and it was decreed by Jupiter that the mother should have her daughter for fifteen days in the month but Pluto for the rest the other fifteen This is nothing but that the name Ceres is used to mean the earth called Ceres on analogy with crees you may create for all things are created from her By Proserpina is meant the moon and her name is on analogy with prope serpens creeping near for she is moved nearer to the earth than the other planets She is called earth s daughter because her substance has more of earth in it than of the other elements By Pluto is meant the shadow that sometimes obstructs the moon br br br Plouton Helios br br A dedicatory inscription from Smyrna describes a st nd century sanctuary to God Himself as the most exalted of a group of six deities including clothed statues of Plouton Helios and Koure Selene Pluto the Sun and Kore the Moon The status of Pluto and Kore as a divine couple is marked by what the text describes as a linen embroidered bridal curtain The two are placed as bride and groom within an enclosed temple separately from the other deities cultivated at the sanctuary br Plouton Helios is mentioned in other literary sources in connection with Koure Selene and Helios Apollon the sun on its nighttime course was sometimes envisioned as traveling through the underworld on its return to the east Apuleius describes a rite in which the sun appears at midnight to the initiate at the gates of Proserpina it has been suggested that this midnight sun could be Plouton Helios br The Smyrna inscription also records the presence of Helios Apollon at the sanctuary As two forms of Helios Apollo and Pluto pose a dichotomy br br It has been argued that the sanctuary was in the keeping of a Pythagorean sodality or brotherhood The relation of Orphic beliefs to the mystic strand of Pythagoreanism or of these to Platonism and Neoplatonism is complex and much debated br br br Plutonius br br In the Hellenistic era the title or epithet Plutonius is sometimes affixed to the names of other deities In the Hermetic Corpus Jupiter Plutonius rules over earth and sea and it is he who nourishes mortal things that have soul and bear fruit br In Ptolemaic Alexandria at the site of a dream oracle Serapis was identified with Aion Plutonius Gilles Quispel conjectured that this figure results from the integration of the Orphic Phanes into Mithraic religion at Alexandria and that he assures the eternity of the city where the birth of Aion was celebrated at the sanctuary of Kore on January In Latin Plutonius can be an adjective that simply means of or pertaining to Pluto br br br Neoplatonic demiurge br The Neoplatonist Proclus th century AD considered Pluto the third demiurge a sublunar demiurge who was also identified variously with Poseidon or Hephaestus This idea is present in Renaissance Neoplatonism as for instance in the cosmology of Marsilio Ficino who translated Orphic texts into Latin for his own use Ficino saw the sublunar demiurge as a daemonic many headed sophist a magus an enchanter a fashioner of images and reflections a shape changer of himself and of others a poet in a way of being and of not being a royal Pluto This demiurgic figure identified with Pluto is also a purifier of souls who presides over the magic of love and generation and who uses a fantastic counter art to mock but also to supplement the divine icastic or truly imitative art of the sublime translunar Demiurge br br br In Western art and literature br br br Christianization br Christian writers of late antiquity sought to discredit the competing gods of Roman and Hellenistic religions often adopting the euhemerizing approach in regarding them not as divinities but as people glorified through stories and cultic practices and thus not true deities worthy of worship The infernal gods however retained their potency becoming identified with the Devil and treated as demonic forces by Christian apologists br One source of Christian revulsion toward the chthonic gods was the arena Attendants in divine costume among them a Pluto who escorted corpses out were part of the ceremonies of the gladiatorial games Tertullian calls the mallet wielding figure usually identified as the Etruscan Charun the brother of Jove that is Hades Pluto Dis an indication that the distinctions among these denizens of the underworld were becoming blurred in a Christian context Prudentius in his poetic polemic against the religious traditionalist Symmachus describes the arena as a place where savage vows were fulfilled on an altar to Pluto solvit ad aram Plutonis fera vota where fallen gladiators were human sacrifices to Dis and Charon received their souls as his payment to the delight of the underworld Jove Iovis infernalis br br br Medieval mythography br Medieval mythographies written in Latin continue the conflation of Greek and Roman deities begun by the ancient Romans themselves Perhaps because the name Pluto was used in both traditions it appears widely in these Latin sources for the classical ruler of the underworld who is also seen as the double ally or adjunct to the figure in Christian mythology known variously as the Devil Satan or Lucifer The classical underworld deities became casually interchangeable with Satan as an embodiment of Hell For instance in the th century Abbo Cernuus the only witness whose account of the Siege of Paris survives called the invading Vikings the spawn of Pluto br In the Little Book on Images of the Gods Pluto is described as br br an intimidating personage sitting on a throne of sulphur holding the scepter of his realm in his right hand and with his left strangling a soul Under his feet three headed Cerberus held a position and beside him he had three Harpies From his golden throne of sulphur flowed four rivers which were called as is known Lethe Cocytus Phlegethon and Acheron tributaries of the Stygian swamp br br This work derives from that of the Third Vatican Mythographer possibly one Albricus or Alberic who presents often extensive allegories and devotes his longest chapter including an excursus on the nature of the soul to Pluto br br br Medieval and Renaissance literature br In Dante s Divine Comedy written Pluto presides over the fourth circle of Hell to which the greedy are condemned The Italian form of the name is Pluto taken by some commentators to refer specifically to Plutus as the god of wealth who would preside over the torment of those who hoarded or squandered it in life Dante s Pluto is greeted as the great enemy and utters the famously impenetrable line Pap Sat n pap Sat n aleppe Much of this Canto is devoted to the power of Fortuna to give and take away Entrance into the fourth circle has marked a downward turn in the poet s journey and the next landmark after he and his guide cross from the circle is the Stygian swamp through which they pass on their way to the city of Dis Italian Dite Dante s clear distinction between Pluto and Dis suggests that he had Plutus in mind in naming the former The city of Dis is the citadel of Lower Hell where the walls are garrisoned by fallen angels and Furies Pluto is treated likewise as a purely Satanic figure by the th century Italian poet Tasso throughout his epic Jerusalem Delivered in which great Dis great Pluto is invoked in the company of all ye devils that lie in deepest hell br Influenced by Ovid and Claudian Geoffrey Chaucer developed the myth of Pluto and Proserpina the Latin name of Persephone in English literature Like earlier medieval writers Chaucer identifies Pluto s realm with Hell as a place of condemnation and torment and describes it as derk and lowe dark and low But Pluto s major appearance in the works of Chaucer comes as a character in The Merchant s Tale where Pluto is identified as the Kyng of Fayerye Fairy King As in the anonymous romance Sir Orfeo ca Pluto and Proserpina rule over a fantastical world that melds classical myth and fairyland Chaucer has the couple engage in a comic battle of the sexes that undermines the Christian imagery in the tale which is Chaucer s most sexually explicit The Scottish poet William Dunbar ca also described Pluto as a folkloric supernatural being the elrich incubus in cloke of grene the eldritch incubus in cloak of green who appears among the courtiers of Cupid br The name Pluto for the classical ruler of the underworld was further established in English literature by Arthur Golding whose translation of Ovid s Metamorphoses was of great influence on William Shakespeare Christopher Marlowe and Edmund Spenser Golding translates Ovid s Dis as Pluto a practice that prevails among English translators despite John Milton s use of the Latin Dis in Paradise Lost The Christian perception of the classical underworld as Hell influenced Golding s translation practices for instance Ovid s tenebrosa sede tyrannus exierat the tyrant Dis had gone out of his shadowy realm becomes the prince of fiends forsook his darksome hole br Pluto s court as a literary setting could bring together a motley assortment of characters In Huon de M ry s th century poem The Tournament of the Antichrist Pluto rules over a congregation of classical gods and demigods biblical devils and evil Christians In the th century dream allegory The Assembly of Gods the deities and personifications are apparelled as medieval nobility basking in the magnyfycence of their lord Pluto who is clad in a smoky net and reeking of sulphur br Throughout the Renaissance images and ideas from classical antiquity entered popular culture through the new medium of print and through pageants and other public performances at festivals The F te Dieu at Aix en Provence in featured characters costumed as a number of classical deities including Pluto and Pluto was the subject of one of seven pageants presented as part of the Midsummer Eve festival in London During the th century no mythological theme was brought to the stage more often than Orpheus s descent with the court of Pluto inspiring fantastical stagecraft Leonardo da Vinci designed a set with a rotating mountain that opened up to reveal Pluto emerging from the underworld the drawing survives and was the basis for a modern recreation br br br Opera and ballet br The tragic descent of the hero musician Orpheus to the underworld to retrieve his bride and his performance at the court of Pluto and Proserpina offered compelling material for librettists and composers of opera see List of Orphean operas and ballet Pluto also appears in works based on other classical myths of the underworld As a singing role Pluto is almost always written for a bass voice with the low vocal range representing the depths and weight of the underworld as in Monteverdi and Rinuccini s L Orfeo and Il ballo delle ingrate In their ballo a form of ballet with vocal numbers Cupid invokes Pluto from the underworld to lay claim to ungrateful women who were immune to love Pluto s part is considered particularly virtuosic and a reviewer at the premi re described the character who appeared as if from a blazing Inferno as formidable and awesome in sight with garments as given him by poets but burdened with gold and jewels br br The role of Pluto is written for a bass in Peri s Euridice Caccini s Euridice Rossi s Orfeo Cesti s Il pomo d oro Sartoris s Orfeo Lully s Alceste a trag die en musique Charpentier s chamber opera La descente d Orph e aux enfers Telemann s Orpheus and Rameau s Hippolyte et Aricie Pluto was a baritone in Lully s Proserpine which includes a duo dramatizing the conflict between the royal underworld couple that is notable for its early use of musical characterization Perhaps the most famous of the Orpheus operas is Offenbach s satiric Orpheus in the Underworld in which a tenor sings the role of Pluton disguised in the giddily convoluted plotting as Arist e Aristaeus a farmer br Scenes set in Pluto s realm were orchestrated with instrumentation that became conventionally hellish established in Monteverdi s L Orfeo as two cornets three trombones a bassoon and a r gale br Pluto has also been featured as a role in ballet In Lully s Ballet of Seven Planets interlude from Cavalli s opera Ercole amante Hercules in Love Louis XIV himself danced as Pluto and other characters it was a
