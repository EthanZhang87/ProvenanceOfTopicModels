who instructed him to bring lightning and thunder from Olympus br Pegasus is the creator of Hippocrene the fountain on Mount Helicon He was captured by the Greek hero Bellerophon near the fountain Peirene with the help of Athena and Poseidon Pegasus allowed Bellerophon to ride him in order to defeat the monster Chimera which led to many more exploits Bellerophon later fell from Pegasus s back while trying to reach Mount Olympus Both Pegasus and Bellerophon were said to have died at the hands of Zeus for trying to reach Olympus Other tales have Zeus bring Pegasus to Olympus to carry his thunderbolts br Long honored as a constellation Pegasus is a subject of very rich iconography especially through ancient Greek pottery as well as paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance br br br Etymology br br The poet Hesiod presents a folk etymology of the name Pegasus as derived from p g spring well referring to the pegai of Okeanos where he was born br A proposed etymology of the name is Luwian pihassas lightning and Pihassassi a local Luwian Hittite name in southern Cilicia of a weather deity associated with thunder and lightning The proponents of this etymology adduce the role of Pegasus reported as early as Hesiod as the bringer of thunderbolts to Zeus That interpretation was first suggested in and remains widely accepted but Robin Lane Fox has criticized it as implausible br br br Springs br According to early myths everywhere the winged horse struck his hoof to the earth an inspiring water spring burst forth One of these springs was upon the Muses Mount Helicon the Hippocrene horse spring Antoninus Liberalis has suggested that it was opened at the behest of Poseidon to prevent the mountain from swelling with rapture at the song of the Muses Another spring associated with Pegasus was at Troezen Hesiod relates how Pegasus was peacefully drinking from a spring when the hero Bellerophon captured him br br br Thunderbolts br Hesiod wrote that Pegasus carried thunderbolts for Zeus br br br Birth br There are several versions of the birth of the winged stallion and his brother Chrysaor in the far distant place at the edge of Earth Hesiod s springs of Oceanus which encircles the inhabited earth where Perseus found Medusa br One is that they sprang from the blood issuing from Medusa s neck as Perseus was beheading her similar to the manner in which Athena was born from the head of Zeus after he swallowed her pregnant mother br In another version when Perseus beheaded Medusa the brothers were born of the Earth when the Gorgon s blood fell upon her A variation of this story holds that they were formed from the mingling of Medusa s blood pain and sea foam implying that Poseidon had involvement in their making br The last version bears resemblance to Hesiod s account of the birth of Aphrodite from the foam created when the severed genitals of Uranus were cast into the sea by Cronus br br br Bellerophon br br Pegasus aided the hero Bellerophon in his fight against the Chimera There are varying tales about how Bellerophon found Pegasus the most common being that the hero was told by Polyeidos to sleep in the temple of Athena where the goddess visited him in the night and presented him with a golden bridle The next morning still clutching the bridle Bellerophon found Pegasus drinking at the Pierian spring caught him and eventually tamed him br br br Perseus br Michaud s Biographie universelle relates that when Pegasus was born he flew to where thunder and lightning are released Then according to certain versions of the myth Athena tamed him and gave him to Perseus who flew to Ethiopia to help Andromeda br br br Olympus br br After Bellerophon fell off Pegasus while trying to reach Olympus Pegasus and Athena left him and continued to Olympus where he was stabled with other steeds belonging to Zeus and was given the task of carrying Zeus thunderbolts along with other members of his entourage his attendants handmaidens shield bearers shieldmaidens Astrape and Bronte br Because of his years of faithful service to Zeus Pegasus was later honoured with transformation into a constellation On the day of his catasterism when Zeus transformed him into a constellation a single feather fell to Earth near the city of Tarsus br br br Legacy br br br In heraldry br The pegasus became a common element in British
