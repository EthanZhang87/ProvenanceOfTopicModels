the twelfth time and Nico convinces a reluctant Chiron to give him and Will an official quest to rescue Bob The quest brings up the problems with Nico and Will s relationship particularly due to the effects of the River Acheron on the two demigods Will is shown to be uncomfortable with the Underworld in general which irks his boyfriend due to Nico seeing it as his second home although Nico helps Will to get a new perspective on it In addition Will is weakened over time by being so far from his father s domain of the sun While telling stories to Gorgyra in exchange for her help Nico and Will reveal the story of their relationship including the fact that it was Nico who made the first move in what was intended to be a private picnic with the help of Juniper and the dryads but was turned

of Hades to release Iapetus from where he has been locked in Tartarus for millennia Iapetus battles Percy Jackson Annabeth Chase Nico and Thalia Grace proving to be more than a match for them In desperation Percy throws Iapetus into the River Lethe which erases the Titan s memories leaving him with a childlike personality Percy convinces the amnesic Iapetus that he s actually their friend Bob and Bob heals Percy s injuries from the fight and aids him in confronting Persephone over her secret creation of the sword in the first place Bob is subsequently employed as a janitor in the Underworld by Hades br In The House of Hades while trapped in Tartarus Percy and Annabeth briefly reminisce about Bob inadvertently summoning him to their aid when the Titan overhears them Percy is left feeling guilty after learning how Hades and Persephone used Bob as a servant while Nico would visit and tell the Titan about how good of a friend Percy is Bob acts as a guide and protector to Percy and Annabeth his knowledge of Tartarus from his time trapped there proving vital in their quest to reach the Doors of Death and escape However the regenerative effects of Tartarus on monsters

and then destroyed by Atlas in The Titan s Curse Bob leads Percy and Annabeth to the friendly giant Damasen who heals the two demigods injuries but is convinced that he can t change his fate of forever battling the maeonian drakon despite Percy and Annabeth s belief that the line of the Prophecy of Seven about foes bare arms to the Doors of Death refers to the four of them two demigods a Titan and a Giant who should be mortal enemies under normal circumstances Ultimately despite the return of his memories Bob takes Percy s advice to heart that he should take the parts of Iapetus past that he wants while leaving everything else behind and continues to side with them showing disgust for his evil past At the Doors of Death firmly identifying himself as Bob rather than Iapetus he faces off against the embodiment of Tartarus alongside Small Bob Damasen and the drakon to ensure Percy and Annabeth s escape from the realm and the closing of the Doors of Death The four are presumably destroyed in the process devastating Nico Percy and Annabeth who recognize Bob as a true friend Percy sadly fulfils Bob s last request to say hello to the stars for him Bob having wanted to

just four years after she joined She would not trust anyone so easily which was a good quality because she had a whole legion to lead She did everything she could for her friends and family which was everyone in New Rome When she found out about the Greek demigods Reyna chose not to pursue revenge against the Greeks despite her difficult history with them She understands the importance of both camps united br She does not have a fatal flaw unlike Annabeth However she could still not get everything she wanted She could not find love just like Venus had said In the Tyrant s Tomb she joined the Hunters It is a sign of her overcoming fate and living beyond other s expectations br She is described as intimidating and a natural leader she has glossy black hair and very dark brown eyes Reyna is generally more used to responsibility than other demigods as she is a praetor at Camp Jupiter Reyna s demigod ability is the power to lend her energy skills and character traits to nearby demigods

or an evil insane ghost When the mania attacked Hylla young Reyna picked up the closest weapon and killed what remained of her father Reyna is reluctant to discuss the incident because patricide is unforgivable in New Rome Reyna was in love with Jason Grace which is shown throughout the series Several characters like Percy Annabeth Piper and Hazel have noticed Reyna s romantic feelings for Jason In The Mark of Athena Annabeth noticed that Reyna had a hungry sort of gleam in her eyes when she reunited with Jason Grace Eventually Annabeth sensed that Reyna wanted Jason to love her back In The House of Hades Jason felt guilty for letting her believe they had a future together In The Blood of Olympus she daydreams about romantic activities with Jason like romantic walks and sunset picnics When Jason had disappeared for months she briefly considered Percy a romantic partner br In The Tyrant s Tomb Reyna is revealed to be asexual and has always felt pressured to take a romantic partner

others In The Mark of Athena Hazel learns her former boyfriend Sammy Valdez was Leo s great grandfather Until he falls in love with Calypso a nymph third generation titanness in The House of Hades Leo flirts with almost every girl he meets to cover up his insecurities about never finding love In The Blood of Olympus Leo sacrifices himself to annihilate Gaia and dies in the process but is brought back to life using the Physician s Cure and returns for Calypso on her island Ogygia This is an impressive feat as nobody has ever been to Ogygia twice However Leo had the advantage of an astrolabe that had been created for just such a purpose by Odysseus as an old man Leo had gotten the device from two dwarfs shortly before landing on Ogygia and had learned from them that Odysseus had lacked a vital crystal to complete the device which Leo had convinced Calypso to give him before leaving the island br He and Calypso then journey back to Camp Half Blood sending a magic scroll ahead to let his friends know he s alive When he does arrive at camp at the end of The Hidden Oracle everyone lines up to punch him for keeping them worried for so long As Leo is included in the prophecy of the

Festus transports Jason Piper and Leo before being destroyed by a crash landing at King Midas mansion Leo asks Hephaestus to take his head to Bunker Nine at Camp Half Blood where he later repairs him to be the figurehead on the Argo II Festus acts in this role throughout The Mark of Athena and The House of Hades acting as the ship s control interface and occasionally helping to defend against attacks After Piper uses charmspeak on him Festus is stated to be constantly active and he is described as being more alive than ever Although Festus was initially damaged beyond any hope of repair due to his control disk being destroyed in the crash landing Leo is able to build him a new control disk using the works of Archimedes that he had recovered in The Mark of Athena br In The Blood of Olympus Festus is secretly rebuilt by Leo and plays a vital role in the defeat of Gaea lifting the primordial goddess high in the air where she s weaker and holding Jason and Piper steady as Piper charms the goddess to sleep After Gaea s defeat Festus resurrects Leo with the Physician s Cure and helps him to rescue Calypso using a mariner s astrolabe created by Odysseus br In The Trials of

nymph Mellie had seemed angry at Jason leading Apollo to mistakenly believe that Jason had broken up with Piper while in fact Piper had ended the relationship because she felt it was forced It is later unveiled that she wanted to discover herself and who she really was without the pressure of being the daughter of Aphrodite The trick of the Mist that Hera used at the beginning of their relationship also contributed to the breakup as that meant that their relationship was technically fake Still she is heartbroken when he sacrifices himself in The Burning Maze In The Tower of Nero because he was still one of her best friends who she could confide in Later she is revealed to be in a relationship with a mortal woman named Shel br In The Sun and the Star after returning from

power of being a son of Mars and having the ability to shapeshift makes his life very fragile The Fates tied his life force to a piece of firewood when he was a baby so if the wood burns up he will die as in the ancient Greek legend of Meleager The goddess Juno appears to his mother and grandmother while he is a baby to warn them of this fact as he would be crucial to defeating the Giants In all

Desjardins is the grandnephew of Jean Fran ois Champollion and approximately years old considered young for a magician As such he has known only the House policy forbidding the Path of the Gods He is therefore at first opposed to cooperation with the gods and disagrees with the Kanes when they claim it is necessary to stop Apophis As a result of his antagonistic behavior the Kanes wrongly suspect him of being the host of Set in The Red Pyramid After Set s defeat Desjardins is outraged that Carter and Sadie chose to make a deal with the god rather than banish but chooses not to attack them in the end realizing that enough fighting has been done for one day and that his men appear to be wavering after witnessing the Kanes give up the powers of Horus and Isis willingly In The Throne of Fire he works with Vladimir Menshikov in the latter s attempt to hunt Sadie and Carter Kane believing his lies about how the Kanes efforts will empower Apophis Throughout the book Desjardins grows visibly weaker and older and Zia Rashid realizes that Menshikov has been poisoning him while Desjardins mistakenly believes that it is the weight of leadership getting to him Desjardins eventually realizes the truth and comes to the Kanes rescue in the Duat where Menshikov has been possessed by the spirit of Apophis Desjardins casts an execration spell upon Menshikov killing him and banishing Apophis deeper into the Duat for a while However the effort costs Desjardins his life as Desjardins uses up all of his life force to cast the spell Before dying Desjardins makes peace with the Kanes and has them pass on his title of Chief Lector of the House of Life to Amos Kane He is mentioned several times throughout The Serpent s Shadow particularly in relation to how the Kanes plan to defeat Apophis is to perform their own execration upon the god It s noted that Desjardins only faced a weaker manifestation of the snake and couldn t do more than banish him for a while the Kanes face Apophis himself at his full power br br br Set br Set is the ancient Egyptian god of evil and the secondary antagonist of The Red Pyramid and a supporting character in The Throne of Fire and The Serpent s Shadow Although he initially appears to be the main antagonist of The Red Pyramid Set is actually manipulated secretly by Apophis throughout the book While Set is evil he is stated many times to be more of a necessary evil unlike Apophis In ancient times Set acted as the faithful lieutenant of Ra in the eternal war against Apophis and he was born on the third Demon Day or December He would eventually marry his sister Nepthys and have a son with her Anubis but Anubis was raised by Osiris and Isis instead After Ra retreated into the heavens and Osiris became the new Pharaoh of the gods Set refused to stand for it imprisoned his brother in a magnificent sarcophagus and relentlessly chased Isis who was able to rescue Osiris However Set blew Osiris into fourteen different pieces and although Isis managed to reconstruct her husband she was only ever able to resurrect him as the Lord of the Underworld Set was eventually dethroned by Horus in revenge and in time would be imprisoned along with the rest of the gods by the House of Life br In The Red Pyramid Julius Kane uses the Rosetta Stone to release Osiris and return him to his throne in the Underworld as a first step towards restoring the gods due to the increasing threat of Apophis However Julius inadvertently releases all five gods of the Demon Days including Set who imprisons Julius and Osiris in a sarcophagus and begins draining them of their power He also secretly possesses Amos Kane to get close to Julius children Carter and Sadie the hosts of Horus and Isis respectively whom he sends various minions after including two other gods Goaded by his demon minion Face of Horror Set decides to summon a storm that will destroy North America at sunrise on his birthday to increase his own power Despite Set s machinations and having to avoid the House of Life the Kanes manage to confront Set at his base the Red Pyramid As Carter fights Set Sadie teleports the pyramid to Washington DC through a portal severing Set from the source of his power the desert and stopping the storm and his plot Having gotten Set s secret name Evil Day from Nepthys Sadie performs a spell to banish Set deep into the Duat but sensing that something is wrong looks into the rift that the spell opened and spots Apophis the true orchestrator of the plot Breaking the spell Sadie uses the Feather of Truth to show Carter and Set Apophis in the sky and Carter kills Face of Horror who is revealed to be possessed by Apophis whose true plan was to use the Chaos energy generated by Set s storm to escape from his prison Rather than continue their attempt to banish Set the Kanes negotiate with him recognizing Set as a necessary evil and an important part in the war with Apophis In exchange for being released Set swears on his secret name and Ra s throne to not return until he is summoned to help in the fight against Apophis Once Set is released he departs into the Duat br In The Throne of Fire Vladimir Menshikov summons Set into a malachite jar trapping him and using his knowledge of Set s secret name to force the god to reveal the properties of Apophis prison Noticing the Kanes hiding nearby he alerts Menshikov to their prison and outmatched by the older magician Sadie breaks the jar and frees Set who incapacitates Menshikov and allows the Kanes to escape as thanks After Carter is poisoned by a deadly monster snake Set helps Sadie get Carter to safety and in exchange for Sadie giving him back his secret name he offers her the location of the last part of the Book of Ra which Bes confirms that Set would know as he was the one to hide it After making Set agree to a continuing truce with her family Sadie takes the deal In addition Set informs Sadie of where to find the missing Zia Rashid which makes Sadie suspicious as Apophis did the exact same thing although not as well as Set To Sadie s surprise Set keeps their deal and departs without trying to harm them He is later present when Ra retakes his throne br In The Serpent s Shadow Amos is revealed to have been communicating with and channeling the power of Set concerning Carter Sadie and Zia who fear that Set may be controlling Amos again Set appears to Carter on the Egyptian Queen and reassures Carter that he is not manipulating Amos implying that Amos had in fact sent Set to talk to Carter Set insists that he is simply a necessary evil balancing out the other gods who are good and that he does not want Apophis to win reminding Carter of his service as Ra s faithful lieutenant During the final battle with Apophis and the rebel magicians Amos acts as Set s host and although Amos is in control he appears to struggle with some of Set s more violent tendencies After Apophis is destroyed Set is exiled along with the other gods He attends Horus coronation as Pharaoh of the gods supporting him but with a smile that suggests that Set has something evil planned In addition Amos begins wearing crimson clothing which Carter thinks is to play up his connection to Set As a result Carter doubts that Amos will have any more trouble enforcing his rule br br br Apophis br Apophis is the serpent of Chaos who fought Ra in ancient times and the primary antagonist of The Kane Chronicles When Ra eventually retired to the heavens he sacrificed his third aspect Khepri to seal Apophis away in a prison deep within the Duat and sent his loyal cat goddess Bast to fight Apophis for eternity inside of the prison Before the series begins Ruby Kane who has prophetic abilities foresees Apophis eventual escape and sacrifices herself to rescue Bast from their prison as a first step to restoring the gods and preventing Apophis rise br In The Red Pyramid Apophis acts from behind the scenes after Julius Kane begins the process of releasing the other gods By possessing Set s demon minion Face of Horror with a fragment of his soul from within his weakened prison Apophis pushes Set to create a storm that will destroy all of North America which will create enough Chaos energy to allow Apophis to break free Both the gods and the magicians remain unaware of Apophis role in the events believing that Set is only acting on his own something that Set himself is also unaware of During the final battle as Sadie Kane performs a banishing spell for Set the advice of her mother causes her to look into the sky and see Apophis within the rift opened by the spell and she finally understands the truth Breaking the spell Sadie uses the Feather of Truth to reveal Apophis to both her brother Carter and Set Enraged Apophis has Face of Horror attack Sadie but Carter kills him with his sword As the demon dies Apophis taunts them at what he had managed to accomplish through only a fragment of himself before the fragment rejoins Apophis in the closing rift Recognizing that Apophis is returning and is the greater threat the Kanes make a deal with Set rather than banishing him br In The Throne of Fire the Kanes and their allies work to combat Apophis inevitable escape by locating and restoring Ra to power At the same time Apophis has magician assassin Vladimir Menshikov one of his allies hunt the Kanes and sends various monsters after them Despite the best efforts of Apophis forces the Kanes manage to awaken Ra but he is in a weakened and senile state In a final confrontation in the cavern holding Apophis prison the Kanes learn that the price of retrieving Khepri Ra s final aspect is the release of Apophis from his prison Sadie nevertheless completes the spell taking the final beetle of Khepri s form and releasing Apophis who possesses Menshikov to fight the Kanes directly proving to be more than a match for them However House of Life Chief Lector Michel Desjardins arrives to help after finally believing that the Kanes are telling the truth Desjardins performs an execration spell on Apophis a spell that uses a small representation of a target to completely erase the spell s target However as a god Apophis can t be killed by the spell which only destroys Menshikov and banishes the serpent a little deeper into the Duat buying the Kanes time to escape with Ra Desjardins dies after using up all of his life force to banish Apophis br In The Serpent s Shadow Apophis is in an all out war with the House of Life and has secretly allied himself with the rebel magicians who are fighting against Amos Kane s leadership of the House of Life putting the Kanes and their allies into a two front war that they are slowly losing The Kanes learn that Apophis intends to rise on the fall equinox while having the rebels attack the First Nome at the same time With Ra still in a senile state the Kanes desperately search for a way to defeat Apophis and learn that he has been destroying copies of the Book of Overcoming Apophis written by Setne and attempt to secure the last copy resulting in a battle that destroys the Fifty First Nome and kills many of their remaining allies Sadie manages to banish Apophis from the battle by invoking Ma at but the effort involved nearly kills her However the magicians manage to recover a shadow box containing King Tut s sheut or shadow which is a part of his soul Carter comes upon the idea of using Apophis own shadow in a stronger execration spell which Anubis reveals is possible but is highly secret and forbidden magic as such a spell could destroy even a god forever With the help of Setne Carter and Zia Rashid seek out Apophis shadow which has been absorbing the souls of many people including their mother to help boost the serpent s power The two manage to capture the shadow and escape with the unexpected help of elderly gods from the Duat br Upon emerging in the mortal world it s discovered that Apophis has begun his attack which is only held off only by Bast While the Kanes rush to help their friends Ra reborn after taking Zia as a host Sobek and Bes join the fight to hold him off After defeating the rebel magicians Carter calls upon the gods to join the battle but even together they prove to be no match for Apophis who kills Nekhbet and swallows Ra darkening the sun With all hope seemingly lost Carter and Sadie with the help of Horus and Isis cast the shadow execration upon Apophis while Bast and Bes hold Apophis off to buy them the time that they need As he casts the spell Carter comes to the understanding that Apophis shadow is more than just a backup copy of a person s soul it stands for their legacy their impact on the world With no shadow a person s existence becomes meaningless and they can t be alive As a result even if Apophis manages to survive the spell it will cut his connection to the mortal world and he will never be able to rise again Apophis defeats Bes and Bast but is too late to stop the Kanes from finishing the spell destroying his shadow All of the souls that the shadow had consumed are released and it shatters his legacy upon the world causing all of the wars murders turmoil and anarchy Apophis has caused since ancient times to lose their power and finally stop casting their shadow across the world s future As he dies Apophis warns the Kanes that they haven t just killed him but they have exiled the gods as well because Ma at and Chaos are linked and to push one away is to push the other away As Apophis tells the Kanes that Ra will die within him

and explored extensively and to have stolen a number of spell books that he should never have gotten his hands on and to have created a number of his own spells His ultimate ambition is to become a god himself and his power is only constrained by the fact that he is long dead and is currently a ghost br In The Serpent s Shadow the Kanes and their allies seek out the last copy of the Book of Overcoming Apophis written by Setne having come to the conclusion that it holds the secret to defeating the evil god since he has specifically targeted all of the existing copies Setne himself appears to Sadie Kane warning her that she will need his help and to save a shadow box The book is destroyed but the shadow box presents a clue that causes the Kanes to realize that Setne may have developed a way to kill an immortal being using their shadows or sheuts With Setne facing oblivion in the Underworld the Kanes convince their father Julius and Osiris to lend Setne to them and he leads Carter and Zia to the Book of Thoth and then into the Land of Demons to get Apophis shadow After several foiled betrayals Setne manages to subdue Carter and Zia and reveals that he intends to force Apophis to obey his commands having needed their help only to get the shadow The timely arrival of Sadie foils Setne s plan but he somehow manages to escape with the Book of Thoth and the dangerous magic within The magic that Setne taught the Kanes enables them to destroy Apophis forever and restore Bes but they are left concerned by the implications of his escape Julius states that Setne was bound to get away again and that the best they could ve hoped for was that he would help them long enough to get the shadow and the spell br In Demigods Magicians Setne begins using hybrid Greek Egyptian magic from the Book of Thoth repeatedly drawing the attention of the Kanes Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase to stop him In The Crown of Ptolemy Setne enacts his ultimate plan by stealing the crown of Egypt and the power of the goddesses Wadjet and Nekhbet to finally become a god himself Unable to defeat Setne with their individual powers the Kanes Percy and Annabeth share their powers with each other so that the demigods are using magician abilities and the magicians are using demigod abilities which proves to be highly effective against Setne allowing them to retrieve the Book of Thoth In a final effort the Kanes and Annabeth perform a spell from the Book of Thoth to imprison Setne while Percy becomes the host of Nekhbet to fight Setne directly Ultimately after falling into the ocean Percy s natural power from Poseidon combined with his borrowed power from Nekhbet allows him to overpower Setne and strip him of all of his stolen power However Percy chooses not to destroy Setne as he is not the kind of person to do that despite Nekhbet pushing him to do it The completed spell then traps Setne forever inside of a snow globe which becomes a paperweight on Carter s desk br In the Brooklyn House Magician s Manual Setne is shown plotting to escape after his prison is accidentally cracked by one of Sadie s spells after which he intends to take the Book of Thoth travel into the Duat and finally become a god However his eventual escape is actually anticipated by the Kanes and engineered so that it doesn t happen when no one s watching which would be bad for everyone Although Setne
