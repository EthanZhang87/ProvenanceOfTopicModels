Poseidon Greek is one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and mythology presiding over the sea storms earthquakes and horses He was the protector of seafarers and the guardian of many Hellenic cities and colonies In pre Olympian Bronze Age Greece Poseidon was venerated as a chief deity at Pylos and Thebes with the cult title earth shaker in the myths of isolated Arcadia he is related to Demeter and Persephone and was venerated as a horse and as a god of the waters Poseidon maintained both associations among most Greeks he was regarded as the tamer or father of horses who with a strike of his trident created springs the terms for horses and springs are related in the Greek language His Roman equivalent is Neptune br Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when following the overthrow of his father Cronus the world was divided by lot among Cronus three sons Zeus was given the sky Hades the underworld and Poseidon the sea with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three In Homer s Iliad Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War in the Odyssey during the sea voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon s fury by blinding his son the Cyclops Polyphemus resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms causing the complete loss of his ship and companions and delaying his return by ten years Poseidon is also the subject of a Homeric hymn In Plato s Timaeus and Critias the legendary island of Atlantis was Poseidon s domain br Poseidon is famous for his contests with other deities for winning the patronage of the city According to legend Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon though he remained on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate Erechtheus After the fight Poseidon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic plain to punish the Athenians for not choosing him In similar competitions with other deities in different cities he causes devastating floods when he loses Poseidon is a horrifying and avenging god and must be honoured even when he is not the patron deity of the city br Some scholars suggested that Poseidon was probably a Pelasgian god or a god of the Minyans However it is possible that Poseidon like Zeus was a common god of all Greeks from the beginning br br br Etymology br The earliest attested occurrence of the name written in Linear B is Po se da o or Po se da wo ne which correspond to Poseida n and o Poseidaw nos in Mycenean Greek in Homeric Greek it appears as Posida n in Aeolic as Pote i da n in Doric as Poteidan and Poteidas in Arcadic as o Posoidan In inscriptions with Laconic style from Tainaron Helos and Thuria as ho Pohoidan indicating that the Dorians took the name from the older population The form Poteidaw n appears in Corinth br The origins of the name Poseidon are unclear and the possible etymologies are contradictive between the scholars One theory breaks it down into an element meaning husband or lord Greek posis from PIE p tis and another element meaning earth da Doric for g producing something like lord or spouse of Da i e of the earth this would link him with Demeter Earth mother Burkert finds that the second element remains hopelessly ambiguous and finds a husband of Earth reading quite impossible to prove According to Beekes in Etymological Dictionary of Greek there is no indication that means earth although the root da appears in the Linear B inscription E ne si da o ne earth shaker br Another theory interprets the second element as related to the presumed Doric word d won water Proto Indo European dah water or d enh to run flow Sanskrit d nu fluid drop dew and names of rivers such as Danube Danuvius or Don This would make Posei daw n into the master of waters br Plato in his dialogue Cratylus gives two traditional etymologies either the sea restrained Poseidon when walking as a foot bond or he knew many things or br Beekes suggests that the word has probably a Pre Greek origin The original form was probably the Mycenean Greek Pot s eidaw n The inervocalic aspiration suggests a Pre Greek Pelasgian origin rather than an Indoeuropean one br br br Bronze Age Greece br br br Linear B Mycenean Greek inscriptions br If surviving Linear B clay tablets can be trusted the br names po se da wo ne and Po se da o Poseidon occurs with greater frequency than does di u ja Zeus A feminine variant po se de ia is also found indicating a lost consort goddess in effect the precursor of Amphitrite br Poseidon was the chief god at Pylos The title wa na ka appears in the inscriptions Poseidon was identified with wanax from the Homeric era to classical Greece anax The title didn t mean only king but also protector Wanax had chthonic aspects and he was closely associated with Poseidon who had the title Lord of the Underworld The chthonic nature of Poseidon is also indicated by his title E ne si da o ne Earth shaker in Mycenean Knossos and Pylos Through Homer the epithet was also used in classical Greece ennosigaios ennosidas br Po tini ja potnia lady or mistress was the chief goddess at Pylos and she was closely associated with Poseidon She was the Mycenean goddess of nature and Poseidon Wanax is one from the gods who may be considered her male paredros The earth shaker received offerings in the cave of the goddess of childbirth Eileithyia at Amnisos in Crete Poseidon is allied with Potnia and the divine child br Wa na ssa anassa queen or lady appears in the inscriptions usually in plural Wa na ssoi The dual number is common in Indoeuropean grammar usually for chthonic deities like the Erinyes and the duality was used for Demeter and Persephone in classical Greece the double named goddesses Potnia and wanassa refer to identical deities or two aspects of the same deity br E ri nu Erinys is attested in the inscriptions In some ancient cults Erinys is related to Poseidon and her name is an epithet of Demeter br It is possible that Demeter appears as Da ma te in a Linear B inscription PN EN however the interpretation is still under dispute Si to Po tini ja is probably related with Demeter as goddess of grain br Tablets from Pylos record sacrificial goods destined for the Two ladies and the Lord or to the Two Queens and the King wa na soi wa na ka te Wa na ssoi may be related with Demeter and Persephone or their precursors goddesses who were not associated with Poseidon in later periods br br br Mycenean cult br During the Mycenean period the ancestral male gods of the Myceneans were probably not represented in human forms and the information given by the tablets found at Pylos and Knossos is insufficient Poseidon was the chief deity at Pylos and Thebes He is identified with Anax and he carried the title Master of the Underworld Anax had probably a cult associated with the protection of the palace In Acrocorinth he was worshipped as Poseidon Anax during the Mycenean age In the city there was the famous spring Peirene which in a myth is related to the winged horse Pegasus In Attica there was a cult of Anax heroes who was connected to Poseidon A cult title of Poseidon was earth shaker and in Knossos he was worshipped together with the goddess Eleithyia who was related to the annual birth of the divine child Potnia was the Mycenean goddess of nature and she was the consort of Poseidon at Pylos She is mentioned together with bucrania in decorated jugs and he was associated with the animals and especially to the bull In Athens Poseidon was an inland god who created the salt sea Erecth s sea of Erechtheus In Acropolis his cult was superimposed on the cult of the local ancestral figure Erechtheus In Athens and Asine he was worshipped in the house of the king during the Mycenean period The bull was the favourite animal for sacrifices and it seems that horses were rarely used during the burial of the Mycenean leaders br br br Arcadian myths br br In the Arcadian myths Poseidon is related to Demeter and Despoina another name of Kore Persephone and he was worshipped with the surname Hippios in many Arcadian cities At Thelpusa and Phigalia there were sister worships which are very important for the study of primitive religions In these cults Demeter and Poseidon were chthonic divinities of the underworld br Near Thelpusa the river Ladon descended to the sunctuary of Demeter Erinys Demeter Fury During her wandering in search of her daughter Demeter changed into a mare to avoid Poseidon Poseidon took the form of a stallion and after their mating she gave birth to a daughter whose name was not allowed to be told to the unitiated and a horse called Arion very swift Her daughter obviously had the shape of a mare too At first Demeter became angry and she was given the surname Erinys fury by the Thelpusians The Erinyes were deities of vangeance and Erinys had a similar function with the goddess Dike Justice In the very old myth of Thelpusa Demeter Erinys and Poseidon are divinities of the underworld in a pre mythic period Poseidon appears as a horse In Greek folklore the horses had chthonic associations and it was believed that they could create springs In European folklore the water creatures or water spirits appear with the shape of a horse or a bull In Greece the river god Acheloos is represented like a bull or a man bull Many people when sacrificed to Demeter should make a premilinary sacrifice to Acheloos br At Phigalia Demeter had a sanctuary in a cavern and she was given the surname Melaina black The goddess was related to the black undeworld In a similar myth Poseidon appears as horse and Demeter gives birth to a daughter whose name was not allowed to be told to the unitiated At Lycosura her daughter was called Despoina Demeter angry with Poseidon put on a black dressing and shut herself in the cavern When the fruits of the earth were perished Zeus sent the Moirai to Demeter who listened to them and led aside her wrath In this cult we have traces of a very old cult of Demeter and Poseidon as deities of the underworld br br In another Arcadian myth when Rhea had given birth to Poseidon she told Cronus that she had given birth to a horse and gave him a foal to swallow instead of the child In the Homeric Hymn Demeter puts a dark mourning robe around her shoulders as a sign of her sorrow Demeter s mare form was worshipped into historical times The xoanon of Melaina at Phigalia shows how the local cult interpreted her as goddess of nature A Medusa type with a horse s head with snaky hair holding a dove and a dolphin probably representing her power over air and water br br br Boeotian myths br The myth of Poseidon appearing as a horse and mating with Demeter was not localized in Arcadia At Haliartos in Boeotia near Thebes Poseidon appears as stallion He mates with Erinys near the spring of Tilpousa and she gives birth to the faboulous horse Arion At Tilpusa we have a very old cult of the chthonic deities Erinys and Poseidon The water god Poseidon appears as a horse which seems to represent the water spirit and Erinys is probably the personification of a revenging earth spirit From earlier times at Delphi Poseidon was joined in a religious union with the earth goddess Ge She is represented as a snake which is a form of the earth spirit br In the Theogony of Hesiod Poseidon once slept with the monstrous Medousa near the mountain Helikon She conceived the winged horse Pegasus who sprang out of her body when Perseus cut off her head Pegasus stuck the ground with his hoof and created the famous spring Hippocrene near Helikon br Praxidicai were female deities of judicial punishment worshipped in the region of Haliartos in the historical times Ttheir origin is probably the same with Erinys Their images depicted only the heads of the goddesses probably a representation of the earth goddess emerging from the ground Praxidice is and epithet of Persephone in the Orphic Hymn Persephone is sometimes depicted with her head emerging from the ground br br br Origins br br During the Mycenean period Poseidon was worshipped in several regions in Greece At Pylos and some other cities he was a god of the underworld Lord of the Underworld and his cult was related to the protection of the palace He carried the title anax king or protector His consort potnia lady or mistress was the Mycenean goddess of nature Her main aspects were birth and vegetation Poseidon had the title Enesidaon earth shaker and in Crete he was associated with the goddess of childbirth Eleithyia Through Homer the Mycenean titles were also used in classical Greece with similar meaning He was identified with anax and he carried the epithets Ennosigaios and Ennosidas earth shaker Potnia was a title which accompanied female goddesses The goddess of nature survived in the Eleusinian cult where the following words were uttered Mighty Potnia bore a strong son In the heavily sea dependent Mycenaean culture there is not sufficient evidence that Poseidon was connected with the sea it is unclear whether Posedeia was a sea goddess The Greeks invaders came from far inland and they were not familiarized with the sea br In the primitive Boeotian and Arcadian myths Poseidon the god of the underworld appears as a horse and he is mating with the earth goddess The earth goddess is called Erinys or Demeter and she gives birth to the fabulous horse Arion and the unnamed daughter Despoina which is another name of Persephone The horse represents the divine spirit numen and is related to the liquid element and the underworld In Greek folklore the horse is associated with the underworld and it was believed that it had the ability to create springs In the European folklore the water spirit appears with the shape of a horse or a bull In Greece the river god Acheloos is represented as a bull or a man bull Burkert suggests that the Hellenic cult of Poseidon as a horse god may be connected to the introduction of the horse and war chariot from Anatolia to Greece around BC br In the Boeotian myth Poseidon is the water god and Erinys is a goddess of the underworld br She is probably the personification of a revenging earth spirit and it seems that she had a similar function with the goddess Dike Justice At the spring Tilpousa she gives birth to the fabulous horse Arion In the Arcadian myth Poseidon Hippios horse is mating with the mare Demeter At Thelpousa Demeter Erinys gives birth to the horse Arion and to an unnamable daughter who has the shape of a mare In some neighbour cults the daughter was called Despoina mistress which is another name of Persephone The theriomorphic form of gods seems to be local in Arcadia in an old religion associated with xoana br br According to some theories Poseidon was a Pelasgian god or a god of the Minyans Traditionally the Minyans are considered Pelasgians and they lived in Thessaly and Boeotia In Thessaly Pelasgiotis there was a close relation to the horses Poseidon created the first horse Skyphios hitting a rock with his trident and managed in the same way to drain the valley of Tempe The Thessalians were famous charioteers Some of the oldest Greek myths appear in Boeotia In ancient cults Poseidon was worshipped as a horse The mythical horse Arion was a sire of Poseidon horse with Erinys and the winged horse Pegasus a sire of Poseidon foaled by Medousa At Onchestos he had an old famous festival which included horseracing However it is possible that Poseidon like Zeus was a common god of all Greeks from the beginning br It is possible that the Greeks did not bring with them other gods except Zeus Eos and the Dioskouroi The Pelasgian god probably represented the fertilising power of water and then he was he was considered god of the sea As the sea encircles and holds the earth in its position Poseidon is the god who holds the earth and who has the ability to shake the earth The primeval water who encircled the earth Oceanus is the origin of all rivers and springs They are children of Oceanus and Tethys br Farnell suggested that Poseidon was originally the god of the Minyans who occupied Thessaly and Boeotia There is a similarity between the Boeotian and Arcadian myths and especially between the myths which represent the god of the waters Poseidon as a horse The mythical horse Arion appears in both regions The offspring of Poseidon winged horse Pegasus creates famous springs near Helikon and at Troizen Some springs of Poseidon have similar names in Boeotia and Peloponnese It is possible that the name of Poseidon Helikonios in Boeotia whose fest included horseracing derives from the mountain Helikon The Minyans had trade contacts with Mycenean Pylos and the Achaeans adopted the cult of Poseidon Helikonios The cult spread in Peloponnese and then to Ionia when the Achaeans migrated to Asia Minor br br Nilsson suggested that Poseidon was probably a common god of all Greeks from the beginning The Greeks occupied Thessaly Boeotia and Peloponnese during the Bronze Age In all these regions Poseidon was the god of the horses The origin of his cult was Peloponnese and he was the inland god of the Achaeans the god of the horses and the earthquakes When the Achaeans migrated to Ionia there was a transition to regarding Poseidon as the god of the sea because the Ionians were sea dependent With no doubt he was originally the god of the waters The Greeks believed that the cause of the earthquakes was the erosion of the rocks by the waters by the rivers in Peloponnese which they saw to disappear into the earth and then to burst out again The god of the waters became the earth shaker This is what the natural philosophers Thales Anaximenes and Aristotle believed and could not be different from the folk belief br In the Greek legends Arethusa and the river Alpheus traversed underground under the sea and reappeared at Ortygia br In any case the early importance of Poseidon can still be glimpsed in Homer s Odyssey where Poseidon rather than Zeus is the major mover of events In Homer Poseidon is the master of the sea He is described as a majestic scary and avenging monarch of the sea br br br Worship of Poseidon br br I begin to sing about Poseidon the great god br mover of the earth and fruitless sea br god of the deep who is also lord of Helicon and wide Aegae br A two fold office the gods allotted you br O Shaker of the Earth to be a tamer of horses br and a saviour of ships br Hail Poseidon Holder of the Earth dark haired lord br O blessed one be kindly in heart br and help those who voyage in ships br Homeric Hymn to Poseidon br The worship of Poseidon was extended all over Greece and southern Italy but he was specially honoured in Peloponnese which is called the residence of Poseidon and in the Ionic cities The significance of his cult is indicated by the names of cities like Poteidaia in the Chalkidiki peninsula and Poseidonia Paestum a Greek colony in Italy Poseidion is a frequent Greek placename along coastlines and the name of a Greek colony at the Syrian coast br In Ionia his cult was introduced by Achaean colonists from Greece in the th century BC Traditionally the colonists came from Pylos where Poseidon was the principal god of the city The god had a famous temple near the mountain Mycale The month Poseidaon is the month of the winter storms The name of the month was used in Ionic territories in Athens in the islands of the Aegean and in the cities of Asia Minor At Lesbos and Epidauros the month was called Poseidios During this month Poseidon was worshipped as the master of the sea in a bright cult br br Poseidon was a major civic god of several cities in Athens he was second only to Athena in importance while in Corinth and many cities of Ionia and Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis Many fests of Poseidon included athletic competitions and horseracing br In Corinth his cult was related to the Isthmian games In Arcadia his cult was related to the games Hippocrateia and at Sparta he had a temple near an Hippodrome In Onchestos of Boeotia horseracing was a part of the athletic games in honour of the god br Poseidon was considered a symbol of unity The Panionia the festival of all Ionians near Mycale were celebrated in honour of Poseidon Helikonios and was the place of meeting of the Ionian League He was the patron god of the Amphictiony of Kalaureia At Onchestos of Boeotia he was worshipped as Poseidon Helikonios His sanctuary became the place of meeting of the second Boeotian league At Helike of Achaea there was the famous temple of Poseidon Helikonios which was the place of meeting of the Achaean League br The master of the sea creates br clouds and storms but he is also the protector of the sailors He has the ability to calm the sea for a good voyage and save those who are in danger He was worshipped with the surname savior as the protector of the seafarers and the fishermen He is the earthshaker however he is also the protector against the earthquakes In some cults he was worshipped as the bringer of safety or protector of the house and the foundations br br The god was considered the creator of the first horse and it was believed that he taught men the art of taming horses He was depicted on horseback or riding in a chariot drawn by two or four horses He had a lot of temples in Arcadia with the surname Hippios of the horse and he was also transformed into a horse to seduce Demeter br br Being the god of waters Poseidon is related to the primeval water which encircles the earth Oceanus who is the father of all rivers and springs He can create springs with the strike of his trident He was worshipped as ruler of the springs and leader of the nymphs In Thessaly it was believed that he drained the area cutting the rocks of Tempe with his trident In Greek folklore the horse can also create springs br As god of the sea Poseidon was also god of fishing and especially of sea fishing Tuna was offered to him by the fishermen during the festal meal for the protection of the nets Tuna and later dolphin was his attribute He was worshipped in many islands and cities by the coast At Corcyra a roaring bull near the sea shore quaranteed a good fishing The devastating storm of Poseidon is related to fishermen and they poured drink offerings to Poseidon savior into the sea The god of inland waters is very close to vegetation and Poseidon was worshipped in many cities as god of vegetation Haloa in Athens was a fest of vegetation The Protrygaia a wine fest seem to belong to Dionysus and Poseidon br In several cities Poseidon was worshipped in relation to the genealogy and the phratry At Tinos he was worshipped as a healer god probably a forerunner of the famous Evangelistria br The bull is related to Poseidon mainly in Ionia The sacrifice of a bull offered to Poseidon is mentioned by Homer in an Ionic festival Panionia The sacrifices offered to Poseidon consisted of black and white bulls which were killed or thrown into the sea Boars and rams were also used and in Argolis horses were thrown into a well as a sacrifice to him br br In his benign aspect Poseidon was seen as creating new islands and offering calm seas When offended or ignored he supposedly struck the ground with his trident and caused chaotic springs earthquakes drownings and shipwrecks br Sailors prayed to Poseidon for a safe voyage sometimes drowning horses as a sacrifice in this way according to a fragmentary papyrus Alexander the Great paused at the Syrian seashore before the climactic battle of Issus and resorted to prayers invoking Poseidon the sea god for whom he ordered a four horse chariot to be cast into the waves br According to Pausanias Poseidon was one of the caretakers of the oracle at Delphi before Olympian Apollo took it over Apollo and Poseidon worked closely in many realms in colonization for example Delphic Apollo provided the authorization to go out and settle while Poseidon watched over the colonists on their way and provided the lustral water for the foundation sacrifice At one time Delphi belonged to him in common with Ge but Apollo gave him the psychopompeion Kalaureia as a compensation for it br Xenophon s Anabasis describes a group of Spartan soldiers in BC singing to Poseidon a paean a kind of hymn normally sung for Apollo Like Dionysus who inflamed the maenads Poseidon also caused certain forms of mental disturbance A Hippocratic text of ca BC On the Sacred Disease says that he was blamed for certain types of epilepsy br Poseidon is still worshipped today in modern Hellenic religion among other Greek gods The worship of Greek gods has been recognized by the Greek government since br br br Epithets and attributes br br Poseidon had a variety of roles duties and attributes He is a separate deity from the oldest Greek god of the sea Pontus In Athens his name is superimposed n the name of the non Greek god Erechtheus Poseidon Erechtheus br In the Iliad he is the lord of the sea and his golden palace is built in Aegai in the depth of the sea His significance

to be related with fishing He had a fest where women were not allowed with special offers also to Poseidon Temenites related to an official domain At the same day they made offers to Demeter Chloe

sufficient evidence for the existence of earliest Doric Greek temples in the city A building constructed in early th century BC c BC at Isthmia near Corinth which was later dedicated to Poseidon is considered a pioneering building featuring Doric architecture It seems that the first temple with pure Doric elements was built with the aid of Corinthians at Thermon in Aetolia in the middle of th century BC century c BC It was a peripteral narrow wooden structure dedicated to Apollo It measured X m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was X br In the earlier temples the peripteral colonnade is treated with a freedom unknown to later Doric architects This is in part an especially western feature in Italy because the hexastyle sceme was adopted as in the temple of Poseidon at Taranto and the second temple of Hera at Paestum traditionally named temple of Poseidon In the earlier temples where the number of the columns in the porch is odd so are the columns of the pteron facade In such temples the side ptera are approximately the width of one or two intercolumniations In the hexastyle scheme like the temple of Poseidon at Sounion there are normally two or four columns in the porch and the side ptera are approximately the width of one intercolumniation In Doric early work the distance between column and column differs on the fronts and on the flanks and this can be observed in the temple of Poseidon at Kalaureia and in Basilica at Paestum After the th century the rule in Doric is an approximate equality of intercolumniations and it can be observed in the temple of Poseidon at Sounion where there is a slight difference br br Isthmia The temple dedicated later to the god Poseidon was probably built in early th century BC c BC in the city Isthmia near Corinth and it had a wooden peristyle The building was completely destroyed in BC and it seems that it was one of the pioneering buildings featuring Doric architecture The ground plan showed a temple that was of epic proportions for its time and of a layout that was almost entirely new however there was no evidence for the employment of the Doric style as it was suggested br br Paestum on the west coast of Italy near Naples The Greek name of the city was Poseidonia The Doric temple was built in early th century BC and it was believed that it was a temple of Poseidon Traditionally this name is associated with the th century BC temple at Paestum however recent excavations indicate that both temples were dedicated to Hera The so called Basilica measured X m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was x The temple is wider than most Greek temples it had two doors This may indicate a dual dedication of the temple br A Doric temple the so called temple of Poseidon was built in the first half of the th century BC and is usually placed later than Parthenon The temple measured X m at the stylobate It was an hexastyle structure and the number of pteron columns was X The temple was also used to worship Zeus and another deity whose identity is unknown br br Taranto a city of Magna Graecia in Italy he temple of Poseidon was a perpiteral Doric temple however its exact plan cannot be outlined It was probably built in th century BC and it seems that the number of pteron columns was X The interval of the remaining columns is m indicating that the maximum dimensions of the temple at the stylobate could be X m br Sounion in Attica The first temple of Poseidon formerly called temple of Athena was built in BC and it was destroyed by the Persians before completion It measured X m at the stylobate and the number of pteron columns was X There is a slight difference between the front and back intercolumniations and those of the flanks There was probably a double row of inner columns close wall engaged The cella with porches and adyta measured c X m br The second temple was built in BC and it was modelled on its predecessor It measured X m at the stylobate and the number of pteron

the entrance a colossal bronze statue of Poseidon br br Kalaureia an island close to the coast of Troezen in the Peloponnese part of the modern island pair Poros Early roof tiles from c BC suggest the existence of a precursor to the Late Archaic temple of Poseidon This Doric temple was probably built in the middle of the th century BC constructed mainly of poros stone It measured X m at the stylobate and the number of the pteron columns was X Both front and back intercolumniations were wider than those on the flanks The building was surrounded by a low wall with the main entrance on the east side br br Hermione in Argolis The most remarkable temple in the time of Pausanias was the temple of Poseidon The temple was built in the Late archaic Early classical period in late th century BC It was completely destroyed and its foundations at the peninsula of Bisti Poseidio indicate that the temple measured approximately X m at the stylobate br Tainaron The sacred sanctuary of Poseidon was built in a cave at the Tainaron peninsula The path to the interior carved into the rock was preparing him who wanted to get into the psychopompeion It also functioned as a necromancy and oneiromancy temple The temple was also established as a place for persecuted who fled there for protection br Tinos an island of Cyclades The temple of Poseidon and Amphitrite was built near a beach of the island in the th century BC Hellenistic period It was a peripteral Doric temple which was reconstructed in the rd century BC The temple was made of local marble and had some representations of the god s symbols such as dolphins and the trident br br br Mythology br br br Birth br br In the standard version Poseidon was born to the Titans Cronus and Rhea the fifth child out of six born after Hestia Demeter Hera and Hades in that order Because Poseidon s father was afraid that one of his children would overthrow him like he had done to his own father Cronus devoured each infant as soon as they were born Poseidon was the last one to suffer this fate before Rhea decided to deceive Cronus and whisk the sixth child Zeus away to safety after offering Cronus a rock wrapped in a blanket to eat Once Zeus was grown he gave his father a powerful emetic that made him gorge up the children he had eaten The five children emerged from their father s belly in reverse order making Poseidon both the second youngest child and the second oldest at the same time Armed with a trident forged for him by the Cyclopes Poseidon with his siblings and other divine allies defeated the Titans and became rulers in their place According to Homer and Apollodorus Zeus Poseidon and the third brother Hades then divided the world between them by drawing lots Zeus got the sky Poseidon the sea and Hades the Underworld br br In a rarer and later version Poseidon avoided being devoured by his father as his mother Rhea saved him in the same manner she did Zeus by offering Cronus a foal instead claiming she had given birth to a horse instead of a god while she had actually laid the child in a flock Rhea entrusted her infant to a spring nymph When Cronus demanded the child the nymph Arne denied having him and her spring thereafter was called Arne which bears resemblance to the Greek word for deny br In another tale Rhea gave Poseidon to the Telchines ancient inhabitants of the island of Rhodes Capheira an Oceanid nymph became the young god s nurse As Poseidon grew he fell in love with Halia the beautiful sister of the Telchines and fathered six sons and one daughter Rhodos on her By that time Aphrodite the goddess of love had been born and risen from the sea and attempted to make a stop at Rhodes on her way to Cyprus Poseidon and Halia s sons denied her hospitality so Aphrodite cursed them to fall in love and rape Halia After they had done so Poseidon made them sink below the sea br In Homer s Odyssey Poseidon has a home in Aegae br br br City patronage br br br Foundation of Athens br br Athena became the patron goddess of the city of Athens after a competition with Poseidon Yet Poseidon remained a numinous presence on the Acropolis in the form of his surrogate Erechtheus At the dissolution festival at the end of the year in the Athenian calendar the Skira the priests of Athena and the priest of Poseidon would process under canopies to Eleusis They agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and the Athenians would choose whichever gift they preferred Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up the water was salty and not very useful whereas Athena offered them an olive tree br The Athenians or their king Cecrops accepted the olive tree and along with it Athena as their patron for the olive tree brought wood oil and food After the fight infuriated at his loss Poseidon sent a monstrous flood to the Attic Plain to punish the Athenians for not choosing him The depression made by Poseidon s trident and filled with salt water was surrounded by the northern hall of the Erechtheum remaining open to the air br br Burkert noted In cult Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus and the myth turns this into a temporal causal sequence in his anger at losing Poseidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus br It was also said that Poseidon in his anger over his defeat sent one of his sons Halirrhothius to cut down Athena s tree gift But as Halirrhothius swung his axe he missed his aim and it fell in himself killing him instantly Poseidon in fury accused Ares of murder and the matter was eventually settled on the Areopagus hill of Ares in favour of Ares which was thereafter named after the event In other versions Halirrhothius raped Alcippe Ares s daughter so Ares slew him Poseidon was enraged over the murder of his son and Ares was thus held in hold which eventually acquitted him br The contest of Athena and Poseidon was the subject of the reliefs on the western pediment of the Parthenon the first sight that greeted the arriving visitor br This myth is construed by Robert Graves and others as reflecting a clash between the inhabitants during Mycenaean times and newer immigrants Athens at its height was a significant sea power at one point defeating the Persian fleet at Salamis Island in a sea battle br br br Others br br The Corinthians had a similar story to the foundations of Athens about their own city Corinth According to the myth Helios and Poseidon clashed both desiring to make the city their own Their dispute was brought to one of the Hecatoncheires Briareos an elder god who was thus tasked to settle the fight between the two gods Briareus decided to award the Acrocorinth to Helios while to Poseidon he gave the isthmus of Corinth In this tale Helios and Poseidon are supposed to represent fire versus water Helios as the sun god received the area that is closest to the sky while Poseidon who is the sea god got the isthmus by the sea br At another time Poseidon came to an agreement with another goddess Leto that he would give her the island of Delos in exchange for the island of Calauria he also exchanged Delphi for Taenarum with Apollo A temple of Poseidon stood at Calauria during ancient times Poseidon also came to dispute with his sister Hera over the city of Argos A local king was chosen to settle the matter Phoroneus and he decided to award the city to Hera who then became its patroness Poseidon was enraged and sent a drought to plague the city One day as an Argive woman named Amymone went out in search of water came upon a satyr who tried to rape her Amymone prayed to Poseidon for help and he scared the satyr away with his trident After Poseidon rescued Amymone from the lecherous satyr he fathered a child on her Nauplius br br br Walls of Troy br Poseidon and Apollo having offended Zeus by their rebellion in Hera s scheme were temporarily stripped of their divine authority and sent to serve King Laomedon of Troy He had them build huge walls around the city and promised to reward them with his immortal horses a promise he then refused to fulfill In vengeance before the Trojan War Poseidon sent a sea monster to attack Troy The monster was later killed by Heracles br br br Theseus br br Poseidon fathered the hero Theseus with the Troezenian princess Aethra Theseus was also said to be the son of Aegeus the king of Athens who slept with Aethra on the very same night Thus Theseus s origins included both the human and the divine element br Meanwhile in Crete Zeus s son Minos asked for Poseidon s help in order to certify his claim on the throne of Crete Poseidon offered Minos a splendid white bull with the understanding that he was to sacrifice the bull to Poseidon later The Cretans were so impressed with the bull and the divine sign itself that Minos was declared king of Crete But wishing to keep the beautiful animal for himself Minos instead sacrificed an ordinary bull to the sea god instead of the agreed upon one br Poseidon enraged caused Minos s wife Pasiphae to fall in love with the bull their coupling produced the Minotaur a half bull half human creature who fed on human flesh Minos concealed him within the labyrinth built by Daedalus and fed to him Athenian men and women he forced Aegeus to send him over br Once Theseus was grown up and recognized by his father Aegeus in Athens he decided to end the bloody tax Athens had to pay to Crete once and for all and volunteered to set sail to Crete along with the other Athenian youths who had been chosen to be devoured by the Minotaur br Once he arrived in Crete Minos insulted Theseus and insisted he was no son of Poseidon to demonstrate so he threw his own ring in to the sea and commanded Theseus to retrieve it expecting he would not be able to do so Theseus immediately dove in after it br br Dolphins then came as guides and escorted him to the halls of Poseidon and Amphitrite s palace where he was warmly welcomed He received the ring and in addition a purple wedding cloak and a crown from Amphitrite to prove his words Theseus then emerged from the sea and gave the ring to Minos Theseus killed the Minotaur and in time succeeded his father Aegeus as king of Athens By an Amazon he had a son Hippolytus while his wife Phaedra Minos daughter gave him two sons br At some point Poseidon promised three favours to Theseus and he called upon Poseidon to fulfill one of those when Phaedra falsely accused Hippolytus of forcing himself on her Theseus not knowing the truth asked his father to destroy Hippolytus Poseidon granted his son s wish and as Hippolytus was driving by the sea Poseidon sent a terrifying sea monster to spook the man s horses which then dragged him to his death br br br Consort lovers victims and children br br Poseidon was said to have had many lovers of both sexes His consort was Amphitrite a nymph and ancient sea goddess daughter of Nereus and Doris In one account attributed to Eratosthenes Poseidon wished to wed Amphitrite but she fled from him and hid with Atlas Poseidon sent out many to find her and it was a dolphin who tracked her down The dolphin persuaded Amphitrite to accept Poseidon as her husband and eventually took charge of their wedding Poseidon then put him among the stars as a reward for his good services Oppian says that the dolphin betrayed Amphitrite s whereabouts to Poseidon and he carried off Amphitrite against her will to marry her Together they had a son named Triton a merman Poseidon was the father of many heroes He is thought to have fathered the famed Theseus Poseidon also had an affair with Alope his granddaughter through Cercyon his son and King of Eleusis begetting the Attic hero Hippothoon Cercyon had his daughter buried alive but Poseidon turned her into the spring Alope near Eleusis br A mortal woman named Cleito once lived on an isolated island Poseidon fell in love with the human mortal and created a dwelling sanctuary at the top of a hill near the middle of the island and surrounded the dwelling with rings of water and land to protect her She gave birth to five sets of twin boys the firstborn Atlas became the first ruler of Atlantis br Alebion and Bergion and Otos and Ephialtae the giants br br Not all of Poseidon s children were human His other children include Polyphemus the Cyclops and finally Amycus was the son of Poseidon and the Bithynian nymph Melia The philosopher Plato was held by his fellow ancient Greeks to have traced his descent to the sea God Poseidon through his father Ariston and his mythic predecessors the demigod kings Codrus and Melanthus br Poseidon also took the young Nerites the son of Nereus and Doris and thus brother to Amphitrite as a lover Nerites was also Poseidon s charioteer and impressed all marine creatures with his speed But one day the sun god Helios turned Nerites into a shellfish Aelian who recorded this tale as told by mariners says it is not clear why Helios did this but theorizes he might have been offended somehow or that he and Poseidon were rivals in love and Helios wanted Nerites to travel among the constellations instead of the sea monsters From the love between Poseidon and Nerites was born Anteros mutual love br Other male lovers included Pelops and Patroclus br br br Rape and assault victims br br A mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus with whom she had one son Aeson but loved Enipeus a river god She pursued Enipeus who refused her advances One day Poseidon filled with lust for Tyro disguised himself as Enipeus and from their union were born the heroes Pelias and Neleus twin boys br In an archaic myth Poseidon once pursued Demeter She spurned his advances turning herself into a mare so that she could hide in a herd of horses he saw through the deception and became a stallion captured and raped her Their child was a horse Arion which was capable of human speech According to Hesiod s Theogony Poseidon lay down in a soft meadow among spring flowers with the Gorgon Medusa and two offspring the winged horse Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor were born when the hero Perseus cut off Medusa s head br br Ovid however says that Medusa was originally a very beautiful maiden whom Poseidon raped inside the temple of Athena Athena furious over the sacrilege changed the beautiful girl into a monster Elsewhere in the Metamorphoses Ovid says that Poseidon seduced Medusa in the form of a bird br One day Poseidon spotted Caenis walking by the seashore caught her and raped her Having enjoyed her greatly he offered her a wish any wish Traumatized Caenis wished to be transformed into a man so that she would never experience assault again Poseidon fulfilled her request and changed her into a male warrior who then took the name Caeneus br Another time Poseidon once fell in love with a Phocian woman Corone the daughter of Coronaeus as she was walking along the shore He attempted to court her but she rejected him and ran away Poseidon then chased her down with the aim to rape her Athena witnessing all that took pity in the girl and changed her into a crow br When Zeus fell in love and pursued the goddess Asteria she transformed into a quail and flung herself into the sea to escape being raped by him Poseidon then equally rapacious picked up the chase where Zeus had left it and chased Asteria with the aim to force himself on her so Asteria had to transform for a second time to save herself this time into a small rocky island named Delos br br br List of offspring and their mothers br br br Genealogy br br br In literature and art br br In Greek art Poseidon rides a chariot that was pulled by a hippocampus or by horses that could ride on the sea He was associated with dolphins and three pronged fish spears tridents He lived in a palace on the ocean floor made of coral and gems br In the Iliad Poseidon favors the Greeks and on several occasion takes an active part in the battle against the Trojan forces However in Book XX he rescues Aeneas after the Trojan prince is laid low by Achilles br In the Odyssey Poseidon is notable for his hatred of Odysseus who blinded the god s son the Cyclops Polyphemus The enmity of Poseidon prevents Odysseus s return home to Ithaca for many years Odysseus is even told notwithstanding his ultimate safe return that to placate the wrath of Poseidon will require one more voyage on his part br br In the Aeneid Neptune is still resentful of the wandering Trojans but is not as vindictive as Juno and in Book I he rescues the Trojan fleet from the goddess s attempts to wreck it although his primary motivation for doing this is his annoyance at Juno s having intruded into his domain br A hymn to Poseidon included among the Homeric Hymns is a brief invocation a seven line introduction that addresses the god as both mover of the earth and barren sea god of the deep who is also lord of Mount Helicon and wide Aegae and specifies his twofold nature
