title: Hamartia
id: 1280581
The term hamartia derives from the Greek from hamart nein which means to miss the mark or to err It is most often associated with Greek tragedy although it is also used in Christian theology The term is often said to depict the flaws or defects of a character and portraying these as the reason of a potential downfall However other critics point to the term s derivation and say that it refers only to a tragic but random accident or mistake with devastating consequences but with no judgment implied as to the character br br br Definition br Hamartia as it pertains to dramatic literature was first used by Aristotle in his Poetics In tragedy hamartia is commonly understood to refer to the protagonist s error that leads to a chain of actions which culminate in a reversal of events from felicity to disaster br What qualifies as the error or flaw varies and can include an error resulting from ignorance an error of judgment an inherent flaw in the character or a wrongdoing The spectrum of meanings has invited debate among critics and scholars and different interpretations among dramatists br br br In Aristotle s Poetics br Hamartia is first described in the subject of literary criticism by Aristotle in his Poetics The source of hamartia is at the juncture between character and the character s actions or behaviors as described by Aristotle br br Character in a play is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents i e the sort of thing they seek or avoid br In his introduction to the S H Butcher translation of Poetics Francis Fergusson describes hamartia as the inner quality that initiates as in Dante s words a movement of spirit within the protagonist to commit actions which drive the plot towards its tragic end inspiring in the audience a build of pity and fear that leads to a purgation of those emotions or catharsis br Jules Brody however argues that it is the height of irony that the idea of the tragic flaw should have had its origin in the Aristotelian notion of hamartia Whatever this problematic word may be taken to mean it has nothing to do with such ideas as fault vice guilt moral deficiency or the like Hamartia is a morally neutral non normative term derived from the verb hamartanein meaning to miss the mark to fall short of an objective And by extension to reach one destination rather than the intended one to make a mistake not in the sense of a moral failure but in the nonjudgmental sense of taking one thing for another taking something for its opposite Hamartia may betoken an error of discernment due to ignorance to the lack of an essential piece of information Finally hamartia may be viewed simply as an act which for whatever reason ends in failure rather than success br In a Greek tragedy for a story to be of adequate magnitude it involves characters of high rank prestige or good fortune If the protagonist is too worthy of esteem or too wicked their change of fortune will not evoke the ideal proportion of pity and fear necessary for catharsis Here Aristotle describes hamartia as the quality of a tragic hero that generates that optimal balance br br br Tragic flaw tragic error and divine intervention br Aristotle mentions hamartia in Poetics He argues that it is a powerful device to have a story begin with a rich and powerful hero neither exceptionally virtuous nor villainous who then falls into misfortune by a mistake or error hamartia Discussion among scholars centers mainly on the degree to which hamartia is defined as tragic flaw or tragic error br br br Critical argument for flaw br Poetic justice describes an obligation of the dramatic poet along with philosophers and priests to see that their work promotes moral behavior th century French dramatic style honored that obligation with the use of hamartia as a vice to be punished Ph dre Racine s adaptation of Euripides Hippolytus is an example of French Neoclassical use of hamartia as a means of punishing vice Jean Racine says in his Preface to Ph dre as translated by R C Knight br br The failings of love are treated as real failings The passions are offered to view only to show all the ravage they create And vice is everywhere painted in such hues that its hideous face may be recognized and loathed br The play is a tragic story about a royal family The main characters respective vices rage lust and envy lead them to their tragic downfall br br br Critical argument for error br In her Modern Language Review article The Tragic Flaw Is it a Tragic Error Isabel Hyde traces the twentieth century history of hamartia as tragic flaw which she argues is an incorrect interpretation Hyde draws upon the language in Butcher s interpretation of Poetics regarding hamartia as both error and defect in character Hyde points out a footnote in which Butcher qualifies his second definition by saying it is not a natural expression to describe a flaw in behavior Hyde calls upon another description from A C Bradley s Shakespearean Tragedy of which she contends is misleading br br the comparatively innocent hero still shows some marked imperfection or defect irresolution precipitancy pride credulousness excessive simplicity excessive susceptibility to sexual emotion and the like his weakness or defect is so intertwined with everything that is admirable in him br Hyde goes on to elucidate interpretive pitfalls of treating hamartia as tragic flaw by tracing the tragic flaw argument through several examples from well known tragedies including Hamlet and Oedipus Rex br Hyde observes that students often state thinking too much as Hamlet s tragic flaw upon which his death in the story depends That idea does not however offer explanation for the moments when Hamlet does act impulsively and violently It also embarks down a trail of logic that suggests he ought to have murdered Claudius right away to avoid tragedy which Hyde asserts is problematic br In Oedipus Rex she observes that the ideas of Oedipus hasty behavior at the crossroads or his trust in his intellect as being the qualities upon which the change of fortune relies is incomplete Instead to focus on his ignorance of the true identity of his parents as the foundation of his downfall takes into account all of his decisions that lead to the tragic end Rather than a flaw in character error in Oedipus case based upon lack of information is the more complete interpretation br In his Classical World article Hamartia At and Oedipus Leon Golden compares scholarship that examines where to place hamartia s definition along a spectrum connecting the moral flaw and the intellectual error His goal is to revisit the role if any At or divine intervention plays in hamartia The Butcher translation of Poetics references hamartia as both a single great error and a single great defect in character prompting critics to raise arguments br Mid twentieth century scholar Phillip W Harsh sees hamartia as tragic flaw observing that Oedipus assumes some moral ownership of his demise when he reacts excessively with rage and murder to the encounter at the crossroads Van Braam on the other hand notes of Oedipus hamartia no specific sin attaching to him as an individual but the universally human one of blindly following the light of one s own intellect He adds that a defining feature of tragedy is that the sufferer must be the agent of his own suffering by no conscious moral failing on his part in order to create a tragic irony br O Hey s observations fall into this camp as well He notes that the term refers to an action that is carried out in good moral faith by the protagonist but as he has been deprived of key pieces of information the action brings disastrous results J M Bremer also conducted a thorough study of hamartia in Greek thought focusing on its usage in Aristotle and Homer His findings lead him like Hyde to cite hamartia as an intellectual error rather than a moral failing br br br Critical arguments on divine intervention br J M Bremer and Dawe both conclude that the will of the gods may factor into Aristotelian hamartia Golden disagrees Bremer observes that the Messenger in Oedipus Rex says He was raging one of the dark powers pointing the way someone something leading him on he hurled at the twin doors and bending the bolts back out of their sockets crashed through the chamber Bremer cites Sophocles mention of Oedipus being possessed by dark powers as evidence of guidance from either divine or daemonic force br Dawe s argument centers around tragic dramatists four areas from which a protagonist s demise can originate The first is fate the second is wrath of an angry god the third comes from a human enemy and the last is the protagonist s frailty or error Dawe contends that the tragic d nouement can be the result of a divine plan as long as plot action begets plot action in accordance with Aristotle br Golden cites Van Braam s notion of Oedipus committing a tragic error by trusting his own intellect in spite of Tiresias warning as the argument for human error over divine manipulation Golden concludes that hamartia principally refers to a matter of intellect although it may include elements of morality What his study asserts is separate from hamartia in a view that conflicts with Dawe s and Bremer s is the concept of divine retribution br br br In Christian theology br br Hamartia is also used in Christian theology because of its use in the Septuagint and New Testament The Hebrew chat and its Greek equivalent a t a hamartia both mean missing the mark or off the mark br There are four basic usages for hamartia br br Hamartia is sometimes used to mean acts of sin by omission or commission in thought and feeling or in speech and actions as in Romans all have sinned br Hamartia is sometimes applied to the fall of man from original righteousness that resulted in humanity s innate propensity for sin that is original sin For example as in Romans everyone is under the power of sin br A third application concerns the weakness of the flesh and the free will to resist sinful acts The original inclination to sin in mankind comes from the weakness of the flesh br Hamartia is sometimes personified For example Romans speaks of being enslaved to hamartia sin br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Bremer J M Hamartia Tragic Error in the Poetics
