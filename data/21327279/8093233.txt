called Rick Riordan Presents and was launched in March It is headed by Riordan s editor Stephanie Owens Lurie br Lurie said that Riordan had been approached about an imprint several years ago but initially dismissed the idea because of his heavy workload Later he reported back that he had been toying with the idea and was willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience She also said that the imprint planned to launch with two then undetermined books The point of making this announcement now is to get the word out about what we re looking for br The imprint will not publish books written by Riordan whose role will be closer to curator In an interview with the Iowa Gazette Riordan said Instead of me writing all of the mythologies we are going to look for authors who already are writing about that stuff If I feel like I can recommend them to my readers we re going to have them out here in the spotlight A focus will be placed on diverse mythology based fiction by new emerging and under represented authors Lurie expressed hopes that the imprint will help satisfy Riordan fans without asking the author to write more than his usual two books a year br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br Art at Our Doorstep
