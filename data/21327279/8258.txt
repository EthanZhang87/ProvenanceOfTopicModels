In Greek mythology Daedalus UK US Greek Latin Daedalus Etruscan Taitale was a skillful architect and craftsman seen as a symbol of wisdom knowledge and power He is the father of Icarus the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx Among his most famous creations are the wooden cow for Pasipha the Labyrinth for King Minos of Crete which imprisoned the Minotaur and wings that he and his son Icarus used to attempt to escape Crete It was during this escape that Icarus did not heed his father s warnings and flew too close to the sun the wax holding his wings together melted and Icarus fell to his death br br br Epigraphic evidence br The name Daidalos seems to be attested in Linear B a writing system used to record Mycenaean Greek The name appears in the form da da re jo de possibly referring to a sanctuary br br br Family br Daedalus s parentage was supplied as a later addition with various authors attributing different parents to him His father is claimed to be either Eupalamus Metion or Palamaon Similarly his mother was either Alcippe Iphinoe Phrasmede or Merope daughter of King Erechtheus Daedalus had two sons Icarus and Iapyx along with a nephew named either Talos Calos or Perdix br The Athenians rewrote the Cretan born Daedalus as an Athenian himself the grandson of the ancient king Erechtheus who only fled to Crete after killing his nephew br br br Inventor architect artist br A mythical craftsman named Daedalus is first mentioned in roughly BC on the Knossian Linear B tablets He is later mentioned by Homer as the creator of a dancing floor for Ariadne similar to that which Hephaestus placed on the Shield of Achilles It is clear that this Daedalus was not an original character of Homer s Rather Homer was referencing mythology that his audience was already familiar with br br Daedalus is not mentioned again in literature until the fifth century BC but he is widely praised as an inventor artist and architect though classical sources disagree on which inventions exactly are attributable to him In Pliny s Natural History he is credited with inventing carpentry including tools like the axe saw glue and more Supposedly he first invented masts and sails for ships for the navy of King Minos He is also said to have carved statues so spirited they appeared to be living and moving Pausanias in traveling around Greece attributed to Daedalus numerous archaic wooden cult figures see xoana that impressed him In fact so many other statues and artworks are attributed to Daedalus by Pausanias and various other sources that likely many of them were never made by him br Plato cited Daedalus s handiwork as a metaphor for genuine understanding of truth as opposed to belief that coincidentally happens to be true in a Socratic dialogue with Meno Socrates argues that while truth like one of Daedalus s moving statues is inherently valuable their animacy would mean they are worthless if the owner cannot shackle them in place to stop them from wandering off br Daedalus gave his name eponymously to many Greek craftsmen and many Greek contraptions and inventions that represented dextrous skill A specific sort of early Greek sculptures are named Daedalic sculpture in his honor In Boeotia there was a festival the Daedala in which a temporary wooden altar was fashioned and an effigy was made from an oak tree and dressed in bridal attire It was carried in a cart with a woman who acted as bridesmaid The image was called daedala Some sources claim that the daedala did not receive their name from Daedalus but the opposite Pausanias claims that Daedalus was not the name given to the inventor at birth but that he was named so later after the daedala br Some of the functions of Daedalus overlapped with those of Aristaeus Aristaeos another famous Greek inventor god But Aristaeos mostly concerned himself with the rural and agricultural arts br br br Mythology br br br Nephew br br Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival His sister had placed her son under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts as an apprentice His nephew is named variously as Perdix Talos or Calos although some sources say that Perdix was the name of Daedalus sister The nephew showed striking evidence of ingenuity Finding the spine of a fish on the seashore he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge and thus invented the saw He put two pieces of iron together connecting them at one end with a rivet and sharpening the other ends and made a pair of compasses Daedalus was so envious of his nephew s accomplishments that he attempted to murder him by throwing him down from the Acropolis in Athens Athena saved his nephew and turned him into a partridge Tried and convicted for this murder attempt Daedalus left Athens and fled to Crete br br br The Labyrinth br Daedalus created the Labyrinth on Crete in which the Minotaur was kept br br Poseidon had given a white bull to King Minos to use it as a sacrifice Instead the king kept the bull for himself and sacrificed another As revenge Poseidon with the help of Aphrodite made King Minos s wife Pasipha lust for the bull Pasipha asked Daedalus to help her Daedalus built a hollow wooden cow covered in real cow hide for Pasipha so she could mate with the bull As a result Pasipha gave birth to the Minotaur a creature with the body of a man but the head and tail of a bull King Minos ordered the Minotaur to be imprisoned and guarded in the Labyrinth built by Daedalus for that purpose br br In the story of the Labyrinth as told by the Hellenes the Athenian hero Theseus is challenged to kill the Minotaur finding his way back out with the help of Ariadne s thread It is Daedalus himself who gives Ariadne the clue as to how to escape the labyrinth br Ignoring Homer later writers envisaged the Labyrinth as an edifice rather than a single dancing path to the center and out again and gave it numerous winding passages and turns that opened into one another seeming to have neither beginning nor end Ovid in his Metamorphoses suggests that Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth so cunningly that he himself could barely escape it after he built it br br br Icarus br br The most familiar literary telling explaining Daedalus wings is a late one by Ovid in his Metamorphoses After Theseus and Ariadne eloped together Daedalus and his son Icarus were imprisoned by King Minos in the labyrinth that he had built He could not leave Crete by sea as King Minos kept a strict watch on all vessels permitting none to sail without being carefully searched Since Minos controlled the land routes as well Daedalus set to work to make wings for himself and his son Icarus Using bird feathers of various sizes thread and beeswax he shaped them to resemble a bird s wings When both were prepared for flight Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high because the heat of the sun would melt the beeswax holding his feathers together and the wings would break nor too low because the sea foam would soak the feathers and make them heavy and he would fall After Daedalus and Icarus had passed Samos Delos and Lebynthos Icarus disobeyed his father and began to soar upward toward the sun He flew too close to the sun Without any warning the sun melted the wax which held the feathers together and they fell off Icarus kept flapping his wings But he realized he had no feathers left He was only flapping his featherless arms The feathers one by one fell like snowflakes and down down and down he went into the sea where he sank to the bottom and drowned Seeing Icarus wings floating in the sea Daedalus wept cursed his art and after finding Icarus s dead body on an island shore buried Icarus s body on the island shore Then he named the island Icaria in the memory of his child The southeast end of the Aegean Sea where Icarus fell into the water was also called Mare Icarium or the Icarian Sea In a twist of fate a partridge presumably the nephew Daedalus murdered mocked Daedalus as he buried his son The fall and death of Icarus is seemingly portrayed as punishment for Daedalus s murder of his nephew br br br The shell riddle br After burying Icarus Daedalus traveled to Camicus in Sicily where he stayed as a guest under the protection of King Cocalus There Daedalus built a temple to Apollo and hung up his wings as an offering to the god In an invention of Virgil Aeneid VI Daedalus flies to Cumae and founds his temple there rather than in Sicily br Minos meanwhile searched for Daedalus by traveling from city to city asking a riddle He presented a spiral seashell and asked for a string to be run through it When he reached Camicus King Cocalus knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle accepted the shell and gave it to Daedalus Daedalus tied the string to an ant which lured by a drop of honey at one end walked through the seashell stringing it all the way through With the riddle solved Minos realized that Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and insisted he be handed over Cocalus agreed to do so but convinced Minos to take a bath first In the bath Cocalus daughters killed Minos possibly by pouring boiling water over his body In some versions it is Cocalus that kills Minos in the bath Other variants say that Daedalus himself poured the boiling water or that he had built the pipes that could supply hot water to the bath and this was used to instead pour boiling water on him br br br Death br At least two locations are associated with the death of Daedalus One version of the story says he retired to the Cretan colony of Telmessos ruled by Minos s estranged brother Sarpedon and while wandering outside the city he was bitten by a snake and died A town on this site Daidala is said to be named after him and is mentioned in Roman sources Another version of the story places his death on a small island in the Nile river where he was later worshipped br The anecdotes are literary and late However in the founding tales of the Greek colony of Gela founded in the s BC on the southwest coast of Sicily a tradition was preserved that the Greeks had seized cult images wrought by Daedalus from their local predecessors the Sicani br br br Later depictions in art and literature br Daedalus and the myths associated with him are often depicted in paintings sculptures and more by later artists The myth about his flight and the fall of Icarus is especially popular in depictions A few noteworthy pieces are included below br Depictions
