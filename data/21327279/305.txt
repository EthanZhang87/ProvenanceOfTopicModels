In Greek mythology Achilles KIL eez or Achilleus Greek translit Achille s was a hero of the Trojan War who was known as being the greatest of all the Greek warriors A central character in Homer s Iliad he was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus king of Phthia and famous Argonaut Achilles was raised in Phthia along with his childhood companion Patroclus and received his education by the centaur Chiron In the Iliad he is presented as the commander of the mythical tribe of the Myrmidons br Achilles most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of Troy Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris who shot him with an arrow Later legends beginning with Statius unfinished epic Achilleid written in the st century AD state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel According to that myth when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels leaving it untouched by the waters and thus his only vulnerable body part br Alluding to these legends the term Achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness which can lead to downfall especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution The Achilles tendon is named after him following the same legend br br br Etymology br Linear B tablets attest to the personal name Achilleus in the forms a ki re u and a ki re we the latter being the dative of the former The name grew more popular becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Achille a attested in Attica in the fourth century BC IG II and in the form Achillia on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an Amazon br Achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of chos distress pain sorrow grief and la s people soldiers nation resulting in a proto form Akh l u os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad and frequently by Achilles himself Achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of kl os glory usually in war Furthermore la s has been construed by Gregory Nagy following Leonard Palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster With this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership br Some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a Pre Greek language Achilles descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity see Worship and heroic cult below Robert S P Beekes has suggested a Pre Greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of and in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language br br br Birth and early years br br Achilles was the son of Thetis a Nereid and daughter of the Old Man of the Sea and Peleus the king of the Myrmidons Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetis s hand in marriage until Prometheus the fore thinker warned Zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by Themis goddess of divine law that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father For this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed Peleus br There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events In the Argonautica Zeus sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods Thetis although a daughter of the sea god Nereus was also brought up by Hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal br br According to the Achilleid written by Statius in the st century AD and to non surviving previous sources when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see Achilles heel Achilles tendon It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier In another version of this story Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage br br None of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability To the contrary in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded in Book the Paeonian hero Asteropaios son of Pelagon challenged Achilles by the river Scamander He was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each hand one grazed Achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood In the few fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle which describe the hero s death i e the Cypria the Little Iliad by Lesches of Pyrrha the Aethiopis and Iliupersis by Arctinus of Miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso br Peleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron who lived on Mount Pelion and was known as the most righteous of the Centaurs to be reared In some accounts Achilles original name was Ligyron and he was later named Achilles by his tutor Chiron According to Homer Achilles grew up in Phthia with his childhood companion Patroclus Homer further writes that Achilles taught Patroclus what he himself had been taught by Chiron including the medical arts Thetis foretold that her son s fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity Achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the Trojan War br br According to Photius the sixth book of the New History by Ptolemy Hephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus When she had Achilles Peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur Chiron Later Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into Achilles burnt foot br br br Physical description br In the account of Dares the Phrygian Achilles was described having a large chest a fine mouth and powerfully formed arms and legs His head was covered with long wavy chestnut colored hair Though mild in manner he was very fierce in battle His face showed the joy of a man richly endowed Homer described Achilles along with numerous other characters as being blond br br br Other names br Among the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following br br Pyrisous saved from the fire his first name which seems to favour the tradition in which his mortal parts were burned by his mother Thetis br Aeacides from his grandfather Aeacus br Aemonius from Aemonia a country which afterwards acquired the name of Thessaly br Aspetos inimitable or vast his name at Epirus br Larissaeus from Larissa also called Cremaste a town of Achaia Phthiotis in Thessaly br Ligyron his original name br Nereius from his mother Thetis one of the Nereids br Pelides from his father Peleus br Phthius from his birthplace Phthia br Podarkes swift footed literally defending with the foot from the verb to defend ward off Ptolemy Hephaestion alternatively says that it was due to the wings of Arke being attached to his feet br br br Hidden on Skyros br br Some post Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war Thetis or in some versions Peleus hid the young man dressed as a princess or at least a girl at the court of Lycomedes king of Skyros br There Achilles properly disguised lived among Lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name Pyrrha the red haired girl Cercysera or Aissa swift With Lycomedes daughter Deidamia with whom he had begun a relationship Achilles there fathered two sons Neoptolemus also called Pyrrhus after his father s possible alias and Oneiros According to this story Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles aid Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a pedlar selling women s clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods When Achilles instantly took up the spear Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign In another version of the story Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes women While the women fled in panic Achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away br br br In the Trojan War br br According to the Iliad Achilles arrived at Troy with ships each carrying Myrmidons He appointed five leaders each leader commanding Myrmidons Menesthius Eudorus Peisander Phoenix and Alcimedon br br br Telephus br When the Greeks left for the Trojan War they accidentally stopped in Mysia ruled by King Telephus In the resulting battle Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal Telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal Guided by the oracle he arrived at Argos where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy br According to other reports in Euripides lost play about Telephus he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound Achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge Alternatively Telephus held Orestes for ransom the ransom being Achilles aid in healing the wound Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed br br br Troilus br br According to the Cypria the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles wrath when the Achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by Achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like Pedasus and Lyrnessus where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis and killed Tenes a son of Apollo as well as Priam s son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios however the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer s Troilus and Criseyde and in William Shakespeare s Troilus and Cressida is a medieval invention br In Dares Phrygius Account of the Destruction of Troy the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe as well as in older accounts Troilus was a young Trojan prince the youngest of King Priam s and Hecuba s five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of Apollo Despite his youth he was one of the main Trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to Homer Prophecies linked Troilus fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him Yet Achilles struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace In this version of the myth Achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents Had Troilus lived to adulthood the First Vatican Mythographer claimed Troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in Plautus Bacchides br br br In the Iliad br br Homer s Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles deeds in the Trojan War Achilles wrath m nis Achill s is the central theme of the poem The first two lines of the Iliad read br br The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate Achilles death It begins with Achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon the commander of the Achaean forces Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave Her father Chryses a priest of Apollo begs Agamemnon to return her to him Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him Achilles does so and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father Agamemnon consents but then commands that Achilles slave Briseis the daughter of Briseus be brought to him to replace Chryseis Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves Briseis with the urging of his mother Thetis Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces At the same time burning with rage over Agamemnon s theft Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour br As the battle turns against the Greeks thanks to the influence of Zeus Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains Ajax and Phoenix They promise that if Achilles returns to battle Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he is planning to do br br The Trojans led by Hector subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles armour though Achilles remains at his camp Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy br After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus the son of Nestor Achilles grieves over his beloved companion s death His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles described in great detail in the poem br Enraged over the death of Patroclus Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus Zeus himself takes note of Achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself Finally Achilles finds his prey br br Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena in the form of Hector s favorite and dearest brother Deiphobus persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face After Hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable Wanting to go down fighting he charges at Achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses Accepting his fate Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion br At the onset of his duel with Hector Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn Orion s dog Sirius a sign of evil During the cremation of Patroclus he is compared to Hesperus the evening western star Venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus the morning eastern star also Venus has set descended br With the assistance of the god Hermes Argeiphontes Hector s father Priam goes to Achilles tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector s body so that he can be buried Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with a burial on the th in the tradition of Niobe s offspring The poem ends with a description of Hector s funeral with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come br br br Later epic accounts fighting Penthesilea and Memnon br br The Aethiopis th century BC and a work named Posthomerica composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century CE relate further events from the Trojan War When Penthesilea queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares arrives in Troy Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles After his temporary truce with Priam Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later Initially taken aback he did not fight as intensely as usual Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her br Following the death of Patroclus Nestor s son Antilochus becomes Achilles closest companion When Memnon son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia slays Antilochus Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing Memnon Consequently Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus except that Memnon unlike Hector was also the son of a goddess br Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliad s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles reaction to it The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis which was composed after the Iliad possibly in the th century BC The Aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors br br br Achilles and Patroclus br br The exact nature of Achilles relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times In the Iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures In th century BC Athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia which is the relationship between an older male and a younger one usually a teenager In Patroclus and Achilles case Achilles would have been the younger as Patroclus is usually seen as his elder In Plato s Symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover However ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship br br br Death br br The death of Achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions Starting with the oldest account In book of the Iliad Hector predicts with his last dying breath that Paris and Apollo will slay him at the Scaean Gates leading to Troy with an arrow to the heel according to Statius In book the sad spirit of dead Patroclus visits Achilles just as he drifts off into slumber requesting that his bones be placed with those of Achilles in his golden vase a gift of his mother br br In book of the Odyssey Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades One of these is Achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son s exploits in the Trojan war and Odysseus tells him of Neoptolemus actions br Book of Odyssey gives dead King Agamemnon s ghostly account of Achilles death the bleached bones from Achilles funeral pyre had been mixed with those of Patroclus and put into his mother s golden vase Also the bones of Antilochus who had become closer to Achilles than any other following Patroclus death were separately enclosed The customary funeral games of a hero were performed and a massive tomb or mound was built on the Hellespont for approaching seagoers to celebrate br Achilles was represented in the Aethiopis as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube Another version of Achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses Polyxena Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena s hand in marriage Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him According to some accounts he had married Medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius Argonautica rd century BC br br br Fate of Achilles armour br br Achilles armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax Ajax the greater They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners who after considering both men s presentations decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour Furious Ajax cursed Odysseus which earned him the ire of Athena who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades After a while when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide Odysseus eventually gave the armour to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades Odyssey Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus br The armour they fought for was made by Hephaestus and thus much stronger and more beautiful than any armour a mortal could craft Thetis had the gear made for Achilles because his first set was worn by Patroclus when he went to battle and taken by Hector when he killed Patroclus The Shield of Achilles was also made by the fire god His legendary spear was given to him by his mentor Chiron before he participated in the Trojan War It was called the Pelian Spear which allegedly no other man could wield br A relic claimed to be Achilles bronze headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis Lycia a port on the Pamphylian Gulf The city was visited in BC by Alexander the Great who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the Iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the nd century CE br br br Achilles Ajax and a game of petteia br Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions At some point in the war Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game petteia They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of Athena br br br Worship and heroic cult br br The tomb of Achilles extant throughout antiquity in Troad was venerated by Thessalians but also by Persian expeditionary forces as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla Achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades in Sparta which had a sanctuary in Elis and in Achilles homeland Thessaly as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum Locri and Croton accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero br The cult of Achilles is illustrated in the BC Polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of Polyxena near the tumulus of Achilles Strabo also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad br br Near the Sigeium is a temple and monument of Achilles and monuments also of Patroclus and Anthlochus The Ilienses perform sacred ceremonies in honour of them all and even of Ajax But they do not worship Hercules alleging as a reason that he ravaged their country br The spread and intensity of the hero s veneration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus today s Black Sea appears to have been remarkable An archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea today identified with Snake Island Ukrainian Zmiinyi near Kiliya Ukraine Early dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from Olbia the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards The cult was still thriving in the third century CE when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an Achilles Pont rch s roughly lord of the Sea or of the Pontus Euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates Hermes Agoraeus or Poseidon br Pliny the Elder AD in his Natural History mentions a port of the Ach i and an island of Achilles famous for the tomb of that man portus Achaeorum insula Achillis tumulo eius viri clara situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper Bug Estuary furthermore at Roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called Dromos Achilleos Achill s dr mos the Race course of Achilles and considered the place of the hero s exercise or of games instituted by him This last feature of Pliny s account is considered to be the iconic spit called today Tendra or Kosa Tendra and Kosa Djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay but which is hardly Roman miles c km away from the Dnieper Bug estuary as Pliny states To the Race course he gives a length of miles c km whereas the spit measures c km today br In the following chapter of his book Pliny refers to the same island as Achillea and introduces two further names for it Leuce or Macaron from Greek island of the blest The present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of Achillea or Leuce with today s Snake Island Pliny s contemporary Pomponius Mela c AD tells that Achilles was buried on an island named Achillea situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister adding to the geographical confusion Ruins of a square temple measuring meters to a side possibly that dedicated to Achilles were discovered by Captain Kritzikly Russian in on Snake Island A second exploration in showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple A fifth century BC black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in reads Glaukos son of Poseidon dedicated me to Achilles lord of Leuke In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC a statue is dedicated to Achilles lord of Leuke by a citizen of Olbia while in a further dedication the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island s cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra regional hero veneration br The heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on Leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic Aethiopis according to which after his untimely death Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Le k N sos White Island Already in the fifth century BC Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a bright island phaenn n sos of the Black Sea while in another of his works Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus Well known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles mak r n n soi or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus speaking of Achilles lord of Scythia and the opposition of North and South as evoked by Achilles fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death br The Periplus of the Euxine Sea c AD gives the following details br br It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea for her son Achilles who dwells there Here is his temple and his statue an archaic work This island is not inhabited and goats graze on it not many which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships sacrifice to Achilles In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts craters rings and precious stones offered to Achilles in gratitude One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin in which Achilles is praised and celebrated Some of these are worded in Patroclus honour because those who wish to be favored by Achilles honour Patroclus at the same time There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds which look after Achilles temple Every morning they fly out to sea wet their wings with water and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it And after they finish the sprinkling they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings Other people say still more that some of the men who reach this island come here intentionally They bring animals in their ships destined to be sacrificed Some of these animals they slaughter others they set free on the island in Achilles honour But there are others who are forced to come to this island by sea storms As they have no sacrificial animals but wish to get them from the god of the island himself they consult Achilles oracle They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair But in case the oracle denies them permission because there is an oracle here they add something to the price offered and if the oracle refuses again they add something more until at last the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient And then the victim doesn t run away any more but waits willingly to be caught So there is a great quantity of silver there consecrated to the hero as price for the sacrificial victims To some of the people who come to this island Achilles appears in dreams to others he would appear even during their navigation if they were not too far away and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships br The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes who likely lived during the first century CE wrote that the island was called Leuce because the wild animals which live there are white It is said that there in Leuce island reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour Similarly others relate the island s name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there Pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame In this island there is also Achilles temple and his statue Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing Pausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound Ammianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island br Strabo mentioned that the cape of the Racecourse of Achilles was sacred to Achilles and although it was treeless was called Alsos Alsos in Greek means grove br A number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles Herodotus Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town Ach lleion built by settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC close to the hero s presumed burial mound in the Troad Later attestations point to an Ach lleion in Messenia according to Stephanus Byzantinus and an Ach lleios in Laconia Nicolae Densu ianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta called Chilia presumably from an older Achileii though his conclusion that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law br The kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son Neoptolemus Alexander the Great son of the Epirote princess Olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy In AD the Roman Emperor Caracalla while on his way to war against Parthia emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles tumulus br br br Reception during antiquity br br br In Greek tragedy br br The Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles given the title Achilleis by modern scholars The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel Extant fragments of the Achilleis and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play The first part of the Achilleis trilogy The Myrmidons focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon only a few lines survive today In Plato s Symposium Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him br The tragedian Sophocles also wrote The Lovers of Achilles a play with Achilles as the main character Only a few fragments survive br Towards the end of the th century BC a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in Hecuba Electra and Iphigenia in Aulis br br br In Greek philosophy br br br Zeno br The philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed Achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions br br br Plato br In Hippias Minor a Socratic dialogue attributed to Plato an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates The two get into a discussion about lying They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying Socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point The two also reference Homer extensively Socrates and Hippias agree that Odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the Odyssey and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle was false intentionally Achilles like Odysseus told numerous falsehoods Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally br br br In Roman and medieval literature br The Romans who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy took a highly negative view of Achilles Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children Other writers such as Catullus Propertius and Ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on Achilles erotic career This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Beno t de Sainte Maure s Roman de Troie and Guido delle Colonne s Historia destructionis Troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the th century br Achilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon not as Hellene but as Scythian while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas his
