In Greek mythology Medusa Ancient Greek romanized M dousa lit guardian protectress also called Gorgo Ancient Greek or the Gorgon was one of the three Gorgons Medusa is generally described as a woman with living snakes in place of hair her appearance was so hideous that anyone who looked upon her was turned to stone Medusa and her Gorgon sisters Euryale and Stheno were usually described as daughters of Phorcys and Ceto of the three only Medusa was mortal br Medusa was beheaded by the Greek hero Perseus who then used her head which retained its ability to turn onlookers to stone as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield In classical antiquity the image of the head of Medusa appeared in the evil averting device known as the Gorgoneion br According to Hesiod and Aeschylus she lived and died on Sarpedon somewhere near Cisthene The nd century BC novelist Dionysios Skytobrachion puts her somewhere in Libya where Herodotus had said the Berbers originated her myth as part of their religion br br br Mythology br br The three Gorgons Medusa Stheno and Euryale were described by Hesiod and Apollodorus as offspring of the sea god Phorcys and his sister Ceto according to Hyginus however their parents were Gorgon and Ceto Their genealogy is shared with other sisters the Graeae as in Aeschylus s Prometheus Bound which places both trios of sisters far off on Kisthene s dreadful plain br br Near them their sisters three the Gorgons winged br With snakes for hair hatred of mortal man br While ancient Greek vase painters and relief carvers imagined Medusa and her sisters as having monstrous form sculptors and vase painters of the fifth century BC began to envisage her as being beautiful as well as terrifying In an ode written in BC Pindar already speaks of fair cheeked Medusa br In a late version of the Medusa myth by the Roman poet Ovid Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden but when Neptune the Roman equivalent of the Greek Poseidon mated with her in Minerva s temple Minerva being the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena Minerva punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into horrible snakes Although no earlier versions mention this ancient depictions of Medusa as a beautiful maiden instead of a horrid monster predate Ovid In classical Greek art the depiction of Medusa shifted from hideous beast to an attractive young woman both aggressor and victim a tragic figure in her death The earliest of those depictions comes courtesy of Polygnotus who drew Medusa as a comely woman sleeping peacefully as Perseus beheads her As the act of killing a beautiful maiden in her sleep is rather unheroic it is not clear whether those vases are meant to elicit sympathy for Medusa s fate or to mock the traditional hero br In most versions of the story she was beheaded by the hero Perseus who was sent to fetch her head by King Polydectes of Seriphus because Polydectes wanted to marry Perseus s mother The gods were well aware of this and Perseus received help He received a mirrored shield from Athena sandals with gold wings from Hermes a sword from Hephaestus and Hades s helm of invisibility Since Medusa was the only one of the three Gorgons who was mortal Perseus was able to slay her he did so while looking at the reflection from the mirrored shield he received from Athena During that time Medusa was pregnant by Poseidon When Perseus beheaded her Pegasus a winged horse and Chrysaor a giant wielding a golden sword sprang from her body br Jane Ellen Harrison argues that her potency only begins when her head is severed and that potency resides in the head she is in a word a mask with a body later appended the basis of the Gorgoneion is a cultus object a ritual mask misunderstood In the Odyssey xi Homer does not specifically mention the Gorgon Medusa br br Lest for my daring Persephone the dread br From Hades should send up an awful monster s grisly head br Harrison s translation states that the Gorgon was made out of the terror not the terror out of the Gorgon br According to Ovid in northwest Africa Perseus flew past the Titan Atlas who stood holding the sky aloft and transformed Atlas into a stone when Atlas tried to attack him In a similar manner the corals of the Red Sea were said to have been formed of Medusa s blood spilled onto seaweed when Perseus laid down the petrifying head beside the shore during his short stay in Ethiopia where he saved and wed his future wife the lovely princess Andromeda who was the most beautiful woman in the world at that time Furthermore the venomous vipers of the Sahara in the Argonautica Ovid s Metamorphoses and Lucan s Pharsalia were said to have grown from spilt drops of her blood The blood of Medusa also spawned the Amphisbaena a horned dragon like creature with a snake headed tail br Perseus then flew to Seriphos where his mother was being forced into marriage with the king Polydectes who was turned into stone by the head Then Perseus gave the Gorgon s head to Athena who placed it on her shield the Aegis br Some classical references refer to three Gorgons Harrison considered that the tripling of Medusa into a trio of sisters was a secondary feature in the myth br br The triple form is not primitive it is merely an instance of a general tendency which makes of each woman goddess a trinity which has given us the Horae the Charites the Semnai and a host of other triple groups It is immediately obvious that the Gorgons are not really three but one two The two unslain sisters are mere appendages due to custom the real Gorgon is Medusa br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Modern interpretations br br br Historical br br Several early classics scholars interpreted the myth of Medusa as a quasi historical based on or reconstructed from an event custom style etc in the past or sublimated memory of an actual invasion br According to Joseph Campbell br br The legend of Perseus beheading Medusa means specifically that the Hellenes overran the goddess s chief shrines and stripped her priestesses of their Gorgon masks the latter being apotropaic faces worn to frighten away the profane br That is to say there occurred in the early thirteenth century B C an actual historic rupture a sort of sociological trauma which has been registered in this myth much as what Freud terms the latent content of a neurosis is registered in the manifest content of a dream registered yet hidden registered in the unconscious yet unknown or misconstrued by the conscious mind br br br Psychoanalysis br In Sigmund Freud s Das Medusenhaupt Medusa s Head was published posthumously In Freud s interpretation To decapitate to castrate The terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something Numerous analyses have made us familiar with the occasion for this it occurs when a boy who has hitherto been unwilling to believe the threat of castration catches sight of the female genitals probably those of an adult surrounded by hair and essentially those of his mother In this perspective the ravishingly beautiful Medusa see above is the mother remembered in innocence before the mythic truth of castration dawns on the subject Classic Medusa in contrast is an Oedipal libidinous symptom Looking at the forbidden mother in her hair covered genitals so to speak stiffens the subject in illicit desire and freezes him in terror of the Father s retribution There are no recorded instances of Medusa turning a woman to stone br Archetypal literary criticism continues to find psychoanalysis useful Beth Seelig chooses to interpret Medusa s punishment as resulting from rape rather than the common interpretation of having willingly consented in Athena s temple as an outcome of the goddess unresolved conflicts with her own father Zeus br br br Feminism br In the th century feminists reassessed Medusa s appearances in literature and in modern culture including the use of Medusa as a logo by fashion company Versace The name Medusa itself is often used in ways not directly connected to the mythological figure but to suggest the gorgon s abilities or to connote malevolence despite her claimed origins as a beauty the name in common usage came to mean monster The book Female Rage Unlocking Its Secrets Claiming Its Power by Mary Valentis and Anne Devane notes that When we asked women what female rage looks like to them it was always Medusa the snaky haired monster of myth who came to mind In one interview after another we were told that Medusa is the most horrific woman in the world though none of the women we interviewed could remember the details of the myth br Medusa s visage has since been adopted by many women as a symbol of female rage one of the first publications to express this idea was a feminist journal called Women A Journal of Liberation in their issue one volume six for The cover featured the image of the Gorgon Medusa by Froggi Lupton which the editors on the inside cover explained can be a map to guide us through our terrors through the depths of our anger into the sources of our power as women br In issue three Fall for the magazine Woman of Power an article called Gorgons A Face for Contemporary Women s Rage appeared written by Emily Erwin Culpepper who wrote that The Amazon Gorgon face is female fury personified The Gorgon Medusa image has been rapidly adopted by large numbers of feminists who recognize her as one face of our own rage Griselda Pollock analyses the passage from horrorism to compassion in the figure of the Medusa through Adriana Cavarero s philosophy and Bracha Ettinger s art and Matrixial theory br Elana Dykewomon s collection of lesbian stories and poems They Will Know Me by My Teeth features a drawing of a Gorgon on its cover Its purpose was to act as a guardian for female power keeping the book solely in the hands of women Stephen Wilk author of Medusa Solving the Mystery of the Gorgon questioned Medusa s enduring status among the feminist movement He believes that one reason for her longevity may be her role as a protector fearsome and enraged Only the Gorgon has the savage threatening appearance to serve as an immediately recognized symbol of rage and a protector of women s secrets wrote Wilk br Even in contemporary pop culture Medusa has become largely synonymous with feminine rage Through many of her iterations Medusa pushes back against a story that seeks to place the male Perseus at its center blameless and heroic Author Sibylle Baumbach described Medusa as a multimodal image of intoxication petrifaction and luring attractiveness citing her seductive contemporary representation as well as her dimensionality as the reason for her longevity br Elizabeth Johnston s November Atlantic essay called Medusa the original Nasty Woman Johnston goes on to say that as Medusa has been repeatedly compared to Hillary Clinton during the presidential election she proves her merit as an icon finding relevance even in modern politics Medusa has since haunted Western imagination materializing whenever male authority feels threatened by female agency writes Johnston Beyond that Medusa s story is Johnston argues a rape narrative A story of victim blaming one that she says sounds all too familiar in a current American context br br Medusa is widely known as a monstrous creature with snakes in her hair whose gaze turns men to stone Through the lens of theology film art and feminist literature my students and I map how her meaning has shifted over time and across cultures In so doing we unravel a familiar narrative thread In Western culture strong women have historically been imagined as threats requiring male conquest and control and Medusa herself has long been the go to figure for those seeking to demonize female authority br br The Medusa story has also been interpreted in contemporary art as a classic case of rape victim blaming by the goddess Athena Inspired by the metoo movement contemporary figurative artist Judy Tak cs returns Medusa s beauty along with a hashtag stigmata in her portrait Me dusa too br Feminist theorist H l ne Cixous famously tackled the myth in her essay The Laugh of the Medusa She argues that men s retelling of the narrative turned Medusa into a monster because they feared female desire The Laugh of the Medusa is largely a call to arms urging women to reclaim their identity through writing as she rejects the patriarchal society of Western culture Cixous calls writing an act which will not only realize the decensored relation of woman to her sexuality to her womanly being giving her access to her native strength it will give her back her goods her pleasures her organs her immense bodily territories which have been kept under seal She claims we must kill the false woman who is preventing the live one from breathing Inscribe the breath of the whole woman Cixous wants to destroy the phallogocentric system and to empower women s bodies and language You only have to look at the Medusa straight on to see her writes Cixous And she s not deadly She s beautiful and she s laughing br br br Nihilism br Medusa has sometimes appeared as representing notions of scientific determinism and nihilism especially in contrast with romantic idealism In this interpretation of Medusa attempts to avoid looking into her eyes represent avoiding the ostensibly depressing reality that the universe is meaningless Jack London uses Medusa in this way in his novel The Mutiny of the Elsinore br br I cannot help remembering a remark of De Casseres It was over the wine in Mouquin s Said he The profoundest instinct in man is to war against the truth that is against the Real He shuns facts from his infancy His life is a perpetual evasion Miracle chimera and to morrow keep him alive He lives on fiction and myth It is the Lie that makes him free Animals alone are given the privilege of lifting the veil of Isis men dare not The animal awake has no fictional escape from the Real because he has no imagination Man awake is compelled to seek a perpetual escape into Hope Belief Fable Art God Socialism Immortality Alcohol Love From Medusa Truth he makes an appeal to Maya Lie br br br Art br br Medusa has been depicted in several works of art including br br
