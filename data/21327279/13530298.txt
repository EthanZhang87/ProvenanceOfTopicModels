Great Britain commonly shortened to Britain is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean off the north west coast of continental Europe consisting of the countries England Scotland and Wales With an area of km sq mi it is the largest of the British Isles the largest European island and the ninth largest island in the world It is dominated by a maritime climate with narrow temperature differences between seasons The island of Ireland with an area per cent that of Great Britain is to the west these islands along with over smaller surrounding islands and named substantial rocks form the British Isles archipelago br Connected to mainland Europe until years ago by a landbridge now known as Doggerland Great Britain has been inhabited by modern humans for around years In it had a population of about million making it the world s third most populous island after Honshu in Japan and Java in Indonesia and the most populated island outside of Asia br The term Great Britain can also refer to the political territory of England Scotland and Wales which includes their offshore islands This territory and Northern Ireland constitute the United Kingdom The single Kingdom of Great Britain resulted from the Acts of Union between the kingdoms of England which at the time incorporated Wales and Scotland br br br Terminology br br br Toponymy br br The archipelago has been referred to by a single name for over years the term British Isles derives from terms used by classical geographers to describe this island group By BC Greek geographers were using equivalents of Prettanik as a collective name for the British Isles However with the Roman conquest of Britain the Latin term Britannia was used for the island of Great Britain and later Roman occupied Britain south of Caledonia br The earliest known name for Great Britain is Albion Greek or insula Albionum from either the Latin albus meaning white possibly referring to the white cliffs of Dover the first view of Britain from the continent or the island of the Albiones The oldest mention of terms related to Great Britain was by Aristotle BC or possibly by Pseudo Aristotle in his text On the Universe Vol III To quote his works There are two very large islands in it called the British Isles Albion and Ierne br br The first known written use of the word Britain was an ancient Greek transliteration of the original Proto Celtic term in a work on the travels and discoveries of Pytheas that has not survived The earliest existing records of the word are quotations of the periplus by later authors such as those within Strabo s Geographica Pliny s Natural History and Diodorus of Sicily s Bibliotheca historica Pliny the Elder AD in his Natural History records of Great Britain Its former name was Albion but at a later period all the islands of which we shall just now briefly make mention were included under the name of Britanni br The name Britain descends from the Latin name for Britain Britannia or Britt nia the land of the Britons Old French Bretaigne whence also Modern French Bretagne and Middle English Bretayne Breteyne The French form replaced the Old English Breoton Breoten Bryten Breten also Breoton lond Breten lond Britannia was used by the Romans from the st century BC for the British Isles taken together It is derived from the travel writings of Pytheas around BC which described various islands in the North Atlantic as far north as Thule probably Norway br The peoples of these islands of Prettanike were called the Priteni or Pretani Priteni is the source of the Welsh language term Prydain Britain which has the same source as the Goidelic term Cruithne used to refer to the early Brythonic speaking inhabitants of Ireland The latter were later called Picts or Caledonians by the Romans Greek historians Diodorus of Sicily and Strabo preserved variants of Prettanike from the work of Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia who travelled from his home in Hellenistic southern Gaul to Britain in the th century BC The term used by Pytheas may derive from a Celtic word meaning the painted ones or the tattooed folk in reference to body decorations According to Strabo Pytheas referred to Britain as Bretannik which is treated a feminine noun Marcian of Heraclea in his Periplus maris exteri described the island group as the Prettanic Isles br br br Derivation of Great br br The Greco Egyptian scientist Ptolemy referred to the larger island as great Britain megale Brettania and to Ireland as little Britain mikra Brettania in his work Almagest AD In his later work Geography c AD he gave the islands the names Alwion Iwernia and Mona the Isle of Man suggesting these may have been the names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing Almagest The name Albion appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the Roman conquest of Britain after which Britain became the more commonplace name for the island br After the Anglo Saxon period Britain was used as a historical term only Geoffrey of Monmouth in his pseudohistorical Historia Regum Britanniae c refers to the br island of Great Britain as Britannia major Greater Britain to distinguish it from Britannia minor Lesser Britain the continental region which approximates to modern Brittany and had been settled in the fifth and sixth centuries by Celtic Briton migrants from Great Britain br The term Great Britain was first used officially in in the instrument drawing up the proposal for a marriage between Cecily daughter of Edward IV of England and James son of James III of Scotland which described it as this Nobill Isle callit Gret Britanee The Scottish philosopher and historian John Major Mair published his History of Great Britain both England and Scotland Historia majoris Britanniae tam Angliae quam Scotiae in While promoting a possible royal match in Lord Protector Somerset said that the English and Scots were like as twoo brethren of one Islande of great Britaynes again In James VI and I styled himself King of Great Brittaine France and Ireland br br br Modern use of the term Great Britain br Great Britain refers geographically to the island of Great Britain Politically it may refer to the whole of England Scotland and Wales including their smaller offshore islands It is not technically correct to use the term to refer to the whole of the United Kingdom which includes Northern Ireland though the Oxford English Dictionary states the term is also used loosely to refer to the United Kingdom br Similarly Britain can refer to either all islands in Great Britain the largest island or the political grouping of countries There is no clear distinction even in government documents the UK government yearbooks have used both Britain and United Kingdom br GB and GBR are used instead of UK in some international codes to refer to the United Kingdom including the Universal Postal Union international sports teams NATO and the International Organization for Standardization country codes ISO and ISO alpha whilst the aircraft registration prefix is G br On the Internet uk is the country code top level domain for the United Kingdom A gb top level domain was used to a limited extent but is now deprecated although existing registrations still exist mainly by government organizations and email providers the domain name registrar will not take new registrations br In the Olympics Team GB is used by the British Olympic Association to represent the British Olympic team The Olympic Federation of Ireland represents the whole island of Ireland and Northern Irish sportspeople may choose to compete for either team most choosing to represent Ireland br br br Political definition br br Politically Great Britain refers to the whole of England Scotland and Wales in combination but not Northern Ireland it includes islands such as the Isle of Wight Anglesey the Isles of Scilly the Hebrides and the island groups of Orkney and Shetland that are part of England Wales or Scotland It does not include the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands br The political union that joined the kingdoms of England and Scotland happened in when the Acts of Union ratified the Treaty of Union and merged the parliaments of the two nations forming the Kingdom of Great Britain which covered the entire island Before this a personal union had existed between these two countries since the Union of the Crowns under James VI of Scotland and I of England br br br History br br br Prehistoric period br br The oldest evidence for archaic humans in Britain are the Happisburgh footprints and associated stone tools found in Norfolk dating to around years ago Prior to years ago Britain formed a peninsular extension of mainland Europe until catastrophic flooding between then and years ago resulted in the creation of the English Channel and Britain becoming an island during warm interglacial periods like the Last Interglacial Eemian years ago though it remained connected to mainland Europe during glacial periods when sea levels were low Archaic humans repeatedly occupied Britain before abandoning the area during cooler periods Modern humans arrived in Britain about years ago as evidenced by remains found in Kents Cavern in Devon following the disappearance of Neanderthals Prior to years ago Britain retained a land connection to the continent with an area of mostly low marshland Doggerland joining it to what are now Denmark and the Netherlands br During the Mesolithic period Britain was inhabited by hunter gatherers Neolithic farmers of Anatolian origin arrived in Britain around BC replacing the pre existing hunter gatherers Around BC the Bronze Age Bell Beaker Culture arrived in Britain which genetic evidence suggests was associated with another episode of nearly complete population replacement Later significant migration to southern Britain around BC may have brought the Celtic languages to the island br During the Iron Age Britain was inhabited by various different Celtic tribes br br br Roman and medieval period br br The Romans conquered most of the island up to Hadrian s Wall in northern England and this became the Ancient Roman province of Britannia In the course of the years after the Roman Empire fell the Britons of the south and east of the island were assimilated or displaced by invading Germanic tribes Angles Saxons and Jutes often referred to collectively as Anglo Saxons At about the same time Gaelic tribes from Ireland invaded the north west absorbing both the Picts and Britons of northern Britain eventually forming the Kingdom of Scotland in the th century The south east of Scotland was colonised by the Angles and formed until a part of the Kingdom of Northumbria Ultimately the population of south east Britain came to be referred to as the English people so named after the Angles br Germanic speakers referred to Britons as Welsh This term came to be applied exclusively to the inhabitants of what is now Wales but it also survives in names such as Wallace and in the second syllable of Cornwall Cymry a name the Britons used to describe themselves is similarly restricted in modern Welsh to people from Wales but also survives in English in the place name of Cumbria The Britons living in the areas now known as Wales Cumbria and Cornwall were not assimilated by the Germanic tribes a fact reflected in the survival of Celtic languages in these areas into more recent times At the time of the Germanic invasion of southern Britain many Britons emigrated to the area now known as Brittany where Breton a Celtic language closely related to Welsh and Cornish and descended from the language of the emigrants is still spoken In the th century a series of Danish assaults on northern English kingdoms led to them coming under Danish control an area known as the Danelaw In the th century however all the English kingdoms were unified under one ruler as the kingdom of England when the last constituent kingdom Northumbria submitted to Edgar in In England was conquered by the Normans who introduced a Norman speaking administration that was eventually assimilated Wales came under Anglo Norman control in and was officially annexed to England in the th century br br br Early modern period br br On October King James who had succeeded separately to the two thrones of England and Scotland proclaimed himself King of Great Brittaine France and Ireland When James died in and the Privy Council of England was drafting the proclamation of the new king Charles I a Scottish peer Thomas Erskine st Earl of Kellie succeeded in insisting that it use the phrase King of Great Britain which James had preferred rather than King of Scotland and England or vice versa While that title was also used by some of James s successors England and Scotland each remained legally separate countries each with its own parliament until when each parliament passed an Act of Union to ratify the Treaty of Union that had been agreed the previous year This created a single kingdom with one parliament with effect from May The Treaty of Union specified the name of the new all island state as Great Britain while describing it as One Kingdom and the United Kingdom To most historians therefore the all island state that existed between and is either Great Britain or the Kingdom of Great Britain br br br Geography br br Great Britain lies on the European continental shelf part of the Eurasian Plate and off the north west coast of continental Europe separated from this European mainland by the North Sea and by the English Channel which narrows to km nmi mi at the Straits of Dover It stretches over about ten degrees of latitude on its longer north south axis and covers km sq mi excluding the much smaller surrounding islands The North Channel Irish Sea St George s Channel and Celtic Sea separate the island from the island of Ireland to its west The island is since joined via one structure with continental Europe the Channel Tunnel the longest undersea rail tunnel in the world The island is marked by low rolling countryside in the east and south while hills and mountains predominate in the western and northern regions It is surrounded by over smaller islands and islets The greatest distance between two points is km mi between Land s End Cornwall and John o Groats Caithness miles km by road br The English Channel is thought to have been created between and years ago by two catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods caused by the breaching of the Weald Artois Anticline a ridge that held back a large proglacial lake now submerged under the North Sea Around years ago during the Devensian glaciation with its lower sea level Great Britain was not an island but an upland region of continental north western Europe lying partially underneath the Eurasian ice sheet The sea level was about metres ft lower than today and the bed of the North Sea was dry and acted as a land bridge now known as Doggerland to the Continent It is generally thought that as sea levels gradually rose after the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age Doggerland reflooded cutting off what was the British peninsula from the European mainland by around BC br br br Geology br br Great Britain has been subject to a variety of plate tectonic processes over a very extended period of time Changing latitude and sea levels have been important factors in the nature of sedimentary sequences whilst successive continental collisions have affected its geological structure with major faulting and folding being a legacy of each orogeny mountain building period often associated with volcanic activity and the metamorphism of existing rock sequences As a result of this eventful geological history the island shows a rich variety of landscapes br The oldest rocks in Great Britain are the Lewisian gneisses metamorphic rocks found in the far north west of the island and in the Hebrides with a few small outcrops elsewhere which date from at least My ago South of the gneisses are a complex mixture of rocks forming the North West Highlands and Grampian Highlands in Scotland These are essentially the remains of folded sedimentary rocks that were deposited between My and My ago over the gneiss on what was then the floor of the Iapetus Ocean br In the current era the north of the island is rising as a result of the weight of Devensian ice being lifted Counterbalanced the south and east is sinking generally estimated at mm inch per year with the London area sinking at double this partly due to the continuing compaction of the recent clay deposits br br br Fauna br br Animal diversity is modest as a result of factors including the island s small land area the relatively recent age of the habitats developed since the last glacial period and the island s physical separation from continental Europe and the effects of seasonal variability Great Britain also experienced early industrialisation and is subject to continuing urbanisation which have contributed towards the overall loss of species A DEFRA Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs study from suggested that species have become extinct in the UK during the th century about times the background extinction rate However some species such as the brown rat red fox and introduced grey squirrel are well adapted to urban areas br Rodents make up of the mammal species These include squirrels mice voles rats and the recently reintroduced European beaver There is also an abundance of European rabbit European hare shrews European mole and several species of bat Carnivorous mammals include the red fox Eurasian badger Eurasian otter weasel stoat and elusive Scottish wildcat Various species of seal whale and dolphin are found on or around British shores and coastlines The largest land based wild animals today are deer The red deer is the largest species with roe deer and fallow deer also prominent the latter was introduced by the Normans Sika deer and two more species of smaller deer muntjac and Chinese water deer have been introduced muntjac becoming widespread in England and parts of Wales while Chinese water deer are restricted mainly to East Anglia Habitat loss has affected many species Extinct large mammals include the brown bear grey wolf and wild boar the latter has had a limited reintroduction in recent times br There is a wealth of birdlife with species recorded of which breed on the island or remain during winter Because of its mild winters for its latitude Great Britain hosts important numbers of many wintering species particularly waders ducks geese and swans Other well known bird species include the golden eagle grey heron common kingfisher common wood pigeon house sparrow European robin grey partridge and various species of crow finch gull auk grouse owl and falcon There are six species of reptile on the island three snakes and three lizards including the legless slowworm One snake the adder is venomous but rarely deadly Amphibians present are frogs toads and newts There are also several introduced species of reptile and amphibian br br br Flora br br In a similar sense to fauna and for similar reasons the flora consists of fewer species compared to much larger continental Europe The flora comprises vascular plant species of which are native and have been introduced The island has a wide variety of trees including native species of birch beech ash hawthorn elm oak yew pine cherry and apple Other trees have been naturalised introduced especially from other parts of Europe particularly Norway and North America Introduced trees include several varieties of pine chestnut maple spruce sycamore and fir as well as cherry plum and pear trees The tallest species are the Douglas firs two specimens have been recorded measuring metres or feet The Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is the oldest tree in Europe br There are at least different species of wildflower Some species are particularly rare or vulnerable and are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act It is illegal to uproot any wildflowers without the landowner s permission br A vote in nominated various wildflowers to represent specific counties These include red poppies bluebells daisies daffodils rosemary gorse iris ivy mint orchids brambles thistles buttercups primrose thyme tulips violets cowslip heather and many more br There is also more than species of bryophyte including algae and mosses across the island The currently known species include mosses liverworts and hornworts br br br Fungi br There are many species of fungi including lichen forming species and the mycobiota is less poorly known than in many other parts of the world The most recent checklist of Basidiomycota bracket fungi jelly fungi mushrooms and toadstools puffballs rusts and smuts published in accepts over species The most recent checklist of Ascomycota cup fungi and their allies including most lichen forming fungi published in accepts another species These two lists did not include conidial fungi fungi mostly with affinities in the Ascomycota but known only in their asexual state or any of the other main fungal groups Chytridiomycota Glomeromycota and Zygomycota The number of fungal species known very probably exceeds There is widespread agreement among mycologists that many others are yet to be discovered br br br Demographics br br br Settlements br London is the capital of England and the United Kingdom as a whole and is the seat of the United Kingdom s government Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and is the seat of the Scottish Government as well as the highest courts in Scotland The Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh is the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland Cardiff is the capital city of Wales and is the seat of the Welsh Government br br Largest urban areas br br br Language br br In the Late Bronze Age Britain was part of a culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age held together by maritime trading which also included Ireland France Spain and Portugal In contrast to the generally accepted view that Celtic originated in the context of the Hallstatt culture since John T Koch and others have proposed that the origins of the Celtic languages are to be sought in Bronze Age Western Europe especially the Iberian Peninsula Koch et al s proposal has failed to find wide acceptance among experts on the Celtic languages br All the modern Brythonic languages Breton Cornish Welsh are generally considered to derive from a common ancestral language termed Brittonic British Common Brythonic Old Brythonic or Proto Brythonic which is thought to have developed from Proto Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the th century AD Brythonic languages were probably spoken before the Roman invasion at least in the majority of Great Britain south of the rivers Forth and Clyde though the Isle of Man later had a Goidelic language Manx Northern Scotland mainly spoke Pritennic which became Pictish which may have been a Brythonic language During the period of the Roman occupation of Southern Britain AD to c Common Brythonic borrowed a large stock of Latin words Approximately of these Latin loan words have survived in the three modern Brythonic languages Romano British is the name for the Latinised form of the language used by Roman authors br British English is spoken in the present day across the island and developed from the Old English brought to the island by Anglo Saxon settlers from the mid th century Some million people speak Scots which was indigenous language of Scotland and has become closer to English over centuries An estimated people speak Welsh an official language in Wales In parts of north west Scotland Scottish Gaelic remains widely spoken There are various regional dialects of English and numerous languages spoken by some immigrant populations br br br Religion br br Christianity has been the largest religion by number of adherents since the Early Middle Ages it was introduced under the ancient Romans developing as Celtic Christianity According to tradition Christianity arrived in the st or nd century The most popular form is Anglicanism known as Episcopalism in Scotland Dating from the th century Reformation it regards itself as both Catholic and Reformed The Head of the Church is the monarch of the United Kingdom as the Supreme Governor It has the status of established church in England There are just over million adherents to Anglicanism in Britain today although only around one million regularly attend services The second largest Christian practice is the Latin Church of the Catholic Church which traces its history to the th century with Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission It was the main religion for around a thousand years There are over million adherents today million Catholics in England and Wales and in Scotland although fewer than a million Catholics regularly attend mass br br The Church of Scotland a form of Protestantism with a Presbyterian system of ecclesiastical polity is the third most numerous on the island with around million members Introduced in Scotland by clergyman John Knox it has the status of national church in Scotland The monarch of the United Kingdom is represented by a Lord High Commissioner Methodism is the fourth largest and grew out of Anglicanism through John Wesley It gained popularity in the old mill towns of Lancashire and Yorkshire also amongst tin miners in Cornwall The Presbyterian Church of Wales which follows Calvinistic Methodism is the largest denomination in Wales There are other non conformist minorities such as Baptists Quakers the United Reformed Church a union of Congregationalists and English Presbyterians Unitarians The first patron saint of Great Britain was Saint Alban He was the first Christian martyr dating from the Romano British period condemned to death for his faith and sacrificed to the pagan gods In more recent times some have suggested the adoption of St Aidan as another patron saint of Britain From Ireland he worked at Iona amongst the D l Riata and then Lindisfarne where he restored Christianity to Northumbria br The three constituent countries of the United Kingdom have patron saints Saint George and Saint Andrew are represented in the flags of England and Scotland respectively These two flags combined to form the basis of the Great Britain royal flag of Saint David is the patron saint of Wales There are many other British saints Some of the best known are Cuthbert Columba Patrick Margaret Edward the Confessor Mungo Thomas More Petroc Bede and Thomas Becket br Numerous other religions are practised The census recorded that Islam had around million adherents excluding Scotland with about More than million people excluding Scotland s about believe in Hinduism Sikhism or Buddhism religions that developed in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia Judaism figured slightly more than Buddhism at the census having adherents excluding Scotland s about Jews have inhabited Britain since However those resident and open about their religion were expelled from England in replicated in some other Catholic countries of the era Jews were permitted to re establish settlement as of in the interregnum which was a peak of anti Catholicism Most Jews in Great Britain have ancestors who fled for their lives particularly from th century Lithuania and the territories occupied by Nazi Germany br br br See also br br List of islands of England br List of islands of Scotland br List of islands of Wales br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br br Coast
