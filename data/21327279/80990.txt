The Gorgons GOR g nz Ancient Greek in Greek mythology are three monstrous sisters Stheno Euryale and Medusa said to be the daughters of Phorcys and Ceto They lived near their sisters the Graeae and were able to turn anyone who looked at them to stone Euryale and Stheno were immortal but Medusa was not and was slain by the hero Perseus br Gorgons were dread monsters with terrifying eyes who instilled fear in any who saw them A Gorgon head was displayed on Athena s aegis giving it the power both to protect her from any weapon and instill great fear in any enemy Gorgon blood was said to have both the power to heal and harm br Representations of full bodied Gorgons and the Gorgon face called a gorgoneion pl gorgoneia were popular subjects in Ancient Greek Etruscan and Roman iconography While Archaic Gorgons and gorgoneia are universally depicted as hideously ugly over time they came to be portrayed as beautiful young women br br br Family br According to Hesiod and Apollodorus the Gorgons were daughters of the primordial sea god Phorcys and the sea monster Ceto and the sisters of three other daughters of Phorcys and Ceto the Graeae However according to Hyginus they were daughters of the Gorgon an offspring of Typhon and Echidna and Ceto while Euripides in his tragedy Ion has the Gorgon being the offspring of Gaia spawned by Gaia to be an ally for her children the Giants in their war against the Olympian gods Medusa had two offspring by Poseidon the winged horse Pegasus and the warrior Chrysaor br br br Mythology br br br Dwelling place br Where the Gorgons were supposed to live varies in the ancient sources According to Hesiod the Gorgons lived far to the west beyond Oceanus the Titan and world circling river near its springs at the edge of night where the Hesperides and the Graeae live The Cypria apparently had the Gorgons living in Oceanus on a rocky island named Sarpedon Aeschylus s Prometheus Bound places them in the far east across the surging sea on the Gorgonean plains of Cisthene where the Graeae live while his lost play Phorkides another name for the Graeae apparently placed them at Lake Tritonis a mythological lake set somewhere in westernmost North Africa And the fifth century BC poet Pindar has Perseus apparently on his quest for the Gorgon head visit the Hyperboreans usually considered to dwell in the far north However whether Pindar means to imply that the Gorgons lived near the Hyperboreans is unclear br br br Petrification br Pherecydes tells us that Medusa s face turned men to stone and Pindar describes Medusa s severed head as stony death In Prometheus Bound it says that no mortal can look at them and live According to Apollodorus all three of the Gorgons could turn to stone anyone who saw them br br br Perseus br br Stheno and Euryale were immortal whereas Medusa was mortal According to Apollodorus version of their story Perseus was ordered by Polydectes his enemy to bring back the head of Medusa So guided by Hermes and Athena he sought out the sisters of the Gorgons the Graeae who had only one eye and one tooth which they shared Perseus managed to steal their eye and tooth and refused to return them unless they would show him the way to the nymphs which they did Perseus got from the nymphs winged sandals which allowed him to fly and the cap of Hades which made him invisible He also received an adamantine sickle harp from Hermes Perseus then flew to Oceanus found the Gorgons asleep And when Perseus managed to behead Medusa by looking at her reflection in his bronze shield Pegasus and Chrysaor sprang from Medusa s neck and Stheno and Euryale chased after him but were unable to see him because he was wearing Hades cap of invisiblity When Perseus brought back the Gorgon head as ordered with averted eyes he showed the head to Polydectes who was turned to stone Perseus returned the things he had acquired from the nymphs and Hermes but gave the Gorgon head to Athena br br br Athena s Gorgon aegis br br According to Apollodorus after Perseus gave the Gorgon head to Athena she inserted the Gorgon s head in the middle of her shield apparently a reference to Athena s aegis In the Iliad the aegis is a device usually associated with Athena which was decorated with a Gorgon head Athena wore it in battle as a shield which neither Apollo s spear or even Zeus thunderbolt could pierce According to the Iliad Hephaestus made the aegis for Zeus while according to a Hesiod fragment Metis made it for Athena before Athena was born br However Euripides in his tragedy Ion has a character say that Athena s aegis was made from the skin of the Gorgon the offspring of Gaia who Gaia had brought forth as an ally for her children the Giants and who Athena had killed during the Gigantomachy In the same play Euripides has Creusa describe a weaving she made like an aegis bordered with serpents with a Gorgon in the middle He also mentions Athena s Gorgon faced shield in his tragedy Electra br In vase painting Athena is often shown wearing her aegis fringed with snake heads br br br Gorgon blood br In some accounts the blood of the Gorgon any Gorgon was said to have both the power to heal and harm According to Euripides Ion Athena gave two drops of blood from the Gorgon she slew for her aegis to Erichthonius one of which wards off diseases and nourishes life while the other kills as it is poison from the Gorgon serpents While according to Apollodorus Athena gave Asclepius some of the blood the Gorgon and while he used the blood that flowed from the veins on the left side for the bane of mankind he used the blood that flowed from the right side for salvation and by that means he raised the dead br br br Etymology br The name Gorgon is associated with the Ancient Greek adjective gorg s which of an eye or look means grim fierce awesome dazzling and is thought to derive from the Sanskrit stem gar The stem has connotations of noise and Germanic and Romance languages have many derivatives from this stem referring to the throat e g gorge or the guttural sounds produced in the throat e g gargle gurgle It has been understood as meaning to growl roar or howl while Thalia Feldman suggests that the closest meaning might be the onomatopoeic grrr of a growling beast br br br Literary descriptions br The earliest literary accounts of Gorgons occur in works by Hesiod and Homer c BC Hesiod provides no physical description of the Gorgons other than to say that the two Gorgons Sthenno and Euryale did not grow old Homer mentions only the Gorgon otherwise unnamed giving brief descriptions of her and her head In the Iliad she is called a dread monster and the image of her head which appears along with several other terrifying images on Athena s aegis and Agamemnon s shield is described as dread and awful and grim of aspect glaring terribly Already in the Iliad the Gorgon s glaring eyes were a notably fearsome feature As Hector pursues the fleeing Achaeans exulting in his might ever slaying the hindmost Homer describes the Trojan hero as having eyes like the eyes of the Gorgon And in the Odyssey Odysseus although determined steadfastly to stay in the underworld so as to meet other great men among the dead is seized by such fear at the mere thought that he might encounter there the head of the Gorgon that awful monster leaves straightway br The Hesiodic Shield of Heracles c late seventh mid sixth century BC describes the Gorgons chasing Perseus as being dreadful and unspeakable with two snakes wrapped around their waists and that upon the terrible heads of the Gorgons rioted great Fear perhaps a reference to snakes writhing about their heads Pindar makes snakes for hair explicit saying that Perseus Gorgon head shimmered with hair made of serpents and that the Gorgons chasing Perseus also had horrible snaky hair so too in Prometheus Bound where all three Gorgons are described as winged as well as snake haired The Gorgon s reputation for ugliness was such that the Athenian comic playwright Aristophones could in BC ridicule the women of the Athenian deme Teithras by referring to them as Gorgons br The mythographer Apollodorus gives the most detailed description br br the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons and great tusks like swine s and brazen hands and golden wings by which they flew br While such descriptions emphasize the hideous physical features of the Gorgon by the fifth century BC Pindar can also describe his snake haired Medusa as beautiful And the Roman poet Ovid tells us that Medusa was originally a beautiful maiden but because of a sexual encounter with Neptune the Roman equivalent of the Greek Poseidon in Minerva s temple Minerva being the Roman equivalent of the Greek Athena Minerva punished Medusa by transforming her beautiful hair into horrible snakes br br br Iconography br Gorgons were a popular subject in ancient Greek Etruscan and Roman art with over six hundred representations cataloged in the Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae LIMC In addition to the many examples found on vase paintings Gorgons occur in a wide variety of other contexts including architectural ornamentation shield devices and coins Some representations show full bodied Gorgons while others called gorgoneia show only the face or head of a Gorgon such as those described in the Iliad as appearing on Athena s aegis and Agamemnon s shield The earliest representations of both types are found from roughly the same time period the mid seventh century BC br Archaic Gorgons typically have snaky hair either with snake like curls Figs or actual snakes protruding from their heads Figs The faces of Archaic Gorgons are particularly distinctive typically with large menacing eyes tripartite scroll like volute noses wide mouths with rictus like grins or grimaces lolling tongues fangs and or tusks Figs and sometimes beards Figs Aside from its particular monstrousness the most distinctive feature of archaic representations of Gorgons is that the head is always facing frontally en face with its large fierce eyes glaring directly at the viewer br Consistent with the change in literary descriptions seen in the works of Pindar and Ovid mentioned above beginning in the fifth century BC representations of Gorgons and gorgoneia transition from hideous monsters to beautiful young women with such representations becoming typical in the fourth century BC One of the earliest such beautiful Gorgons mid fifth century BC is a red figure pelike Fig which shows Perseus with head turned away about to behead a sleeping Medusa While gorgoneia continue to be ubiquitous through the end of antiquity after the fourth century BC full bodied Gorgons ceased to be represented br br br Full bodied Gorgons br Full bodied Gorgons are usually shown in connection with the Perseus Medusa story The earliest representations mid seventh century BC of such Gorgons are a Boeotian relief pithos Fig which depicts Perseus with head turned away decapitating a Gorgon and the Eleusis Amphora Fig which shows two Gorgons chasing Perseus fleeing with a severed Gorgon head That the Perseus on the pithos averts his gaze shows that already in these earliest images it was understood that looking directly at the Gorgon s face was deadly Of particular interest is the famous Medusa pediment early sixth century BC from the temple of Artemis in Corfu Fig which shows a winged Medusa in the characteristic Knielauf kneeling running position with two snakes wrapped around her waist like the Gorgons described in the Hesiodic Shield of Heracles br Although the Gorgon being beheaded on the Boeotian pithos is depicted as a female centaur with neither wings nor snakes present and the Gorgons on the Eleusis Amphora have wingless wasp shaped bodies with cauldron like heads by the end of the seventh century BC humanoid bodies with wings and snakes around their head necks or waist such as depicted on the Medusa pediment become typical Unlike the depictions of gods and heroes which are usually shown in profile Archaic Gorgons even when their bodies are presented in profile usually running their heads are as noted above always turned frontally displaying their full face directly gazing at the viewer br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Gorgoneia br Of the depictions of ancient Greek demons the gorgoneion is by far the most frequently occurring Thought to have had an apotropaic protective function gorgoneia are often found on architectural elements such as temple pediments and ornamental antefixes and acroteria or decorating various round objects such as shields coins and the bottoms of bowls and cups As with full bodied Gorgons the earliest representations are found from the mid sixth century BC The earliest example of a beautiful gorgoneion is the Medusa Rondanini Fig which is thought to be a Roman copy of a Greek original dated to either the fifth century BC or the Hellenistic period br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Possible origins br br There has been considerable and wide ranging speculation concerning the possible origins of the story of Perseus and the Gorgons as well as gorgoneia the representations of Gorgon faces The origins of the Perseus Gorgon story and gorgoneia even with respect to each other are uncertain The Perseus Gorgon story might have come first inspiring the development of gorgoneia or gorgoneia might have come first in which case the Perseus story might have served an etiological function as an origin myth developed as a way to explain where gorgoneia had come from It is also possible that the Perseus story and gorgoneia developed independently but later converged Since the earliest literary and iconographic evidence of both the Perseus story and gorgoneia are roughly contemporaneous such evidence seems unable to definitively distinguish between any of these three scenarios br It is possible that the mythology and or the iconography of Gorgons were subject to Near Eastern influence In particular elements of full bodied Gorgon iconography seem to have been borrowed from that of the Mesopotamian Lamashtu Mesopotamian depictions of Gilgamesh slaying Humbaba may have influenced the Perseus Gorgon story while gorgoneia may be connected to images of Humbaba br br br Perseus and the Gorgons br br The Gorgon as Mistress of Animals in the Medusa pediment from the temple of Artemis in Corfu Fig shows affinities with images of Lamashtu As Walter Burkert has noted Lamashtu has several characteristic iconographic elements which include an animalistic head atop a humanoid body often in the Knielauf kneeling running position with the presence of snakes a horse or ass animal offspring and sometimes in the Mistress of Animals configuration All of these elements are present for example in the Medusa pediment br Images which show Perseus with head turned away decapitating Medusa Fig resemble Mesopotamian depictions of Gilgamesh slaying the wild man Humbaba Such depictions can show Gilgamesh with head turned away looking behind him for a goddess to pass him a weapon This suggests the possibility that Greeks misinterpreted or reinterpreted these Mesopotamian images giving rise through a process that Burkert has described as a creative misunderstanding to the myth of the Gorgon s petrifying gaze br br br The gorgoneion br The consensus among classical scholars seems to be that the function of a gorgoneion was apotropaic as a device an apotropaion to ward away unwanted things and which was in origin a dancer worn mask The classic formulation of this view is that of Jane Ellen Harrison the gorgoneion as a ritual mask misunderstood br br in her essence Medusa is a head and nothing more her potency only begins when her head is severed and that potency resides in the head she is in a word a mask with a body later appended The primitive Greek knew that there was in his ritual a horrid thing called a Gorgoneion a grinning mask with glaring eyes and protruding beast like tusks and pendent tongue How did this Gorgoneion come to be A hero had slain a beast called the Gorgon and this was its head Though many other associations gathered round it the basis of the Gorgoneion is a cultus object a ritual mask misunderstood The ritual object comes first then the monster is begotten to account for it then the hero is supplied to account for the slaying of the monster br That gorgoneia were used as apotropaic shield devices at least seems evident from Agamemnon s gorgoneion shield which Homer describes in the Iliad as displaying the Gorgon grim of aspect glaring terribly and about her were Terror and Rout Supporting the view that gorgoneia originated as masks are two groups of seventh century BC terracotta gorgonion like masks a group of wearable helmet masks from Tiryns and another group of non wearable votive masks from the Sanctuary of Orthia at Sparta which share some features with the typical earliest representations of Gorgon faces If such masks were in fact intended to represent the face of a Gorgon then they would show that Gorgons or gorgoneia played a role in some kind of ritualistic or dramatic practice or performance br The gorgonesque votive masks from Sparta have deep S shaped furrows on either side of wide mouthed grimaces Such features resemble those on the much earlier terracotta plaques depicting Humbaba br br br In popular culture br br br Notes br br br br Aeschylus Fragments edited and translated by Alan H Sommerstein
