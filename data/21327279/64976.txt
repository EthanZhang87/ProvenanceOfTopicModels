title: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
id: 64976
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by executive dysfunction occasioning symptoms of inattention hyperactivity impulsivity and emotional dysregulation that are excessive and pervasive impairing in multiple contexts and otherwise age inappropriate br ADHD symptoms arise from executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation is often considered a core symptom Difficulties with self regulation such as time management inhibition and sustained attention may result in poor professional performance relationship difficulties and numerous health risks collectively predisposing to a diminished quality of life and a direct average reduction in life expectancy of years ADHD is associated with other neurodevelopmental and mental disorders as well as some non psychiatric disorders which can cause additional impairment especially in modern society br Although people with ADHD struggle to persist on tasks with temporally delayed consequences they may be able to maintain an unusually prolonged level of attention for tasks they do find intrinsically interesting or immediately rewarding this is known as hyperfocus more colloquially or perseverative responding This is a mental state in which a person is completely absorbed in a task to the point of apparently ignoring or tuning out everything else often with difficulty disengaging and can be related to risks such as for internet addiction and types of offending behaviour br ADHD represents the extreme lower end of the continuous dimensional trait bell curve of executive functioning and self regulation which is supported by twin brain imaging and molecular genetic studies br The precise causes of ADHD are unknown in the majority of cases For most people with ADHD many genetic and environmental risk factors accumulate to cause the disorder The environmental risks for ADHD are biological and most often exert their effects in the prenatal period However in rare cases a single event might cause ADHD such as traumatic brain injury exposure to biohazards during pregnancy a major genetic mutation or extreme environmental deprivation very early in life There is no biologically distinct adult onset ADHD except for when ADHD occurs after traumatic brain injury br br br Signs and symptoms br Inattention hyperactivity restlessness in adults disruptive behaviour and impulsivity are common in ADHD Academic difficulties are frequent as are problems with relationships The signs and symptoms can be difficult to define as it is hard to draw a line at where normal levels of inattention hyperactivity and impulsivity end and significant levels requiring interventions begin br According to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM and its text revision DSM TR symptoms must be present for six months or more to a degree that is much greater than others of the same age This requires at least six symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity impulsivity for those under and at least five symptoms for those years or older The symptoms must be present in at least two settings e g social school work or home and must directly interfere with or reduce quality of functioning Additionally several symptoms must have been present before age twelve According to the DSM and DSM TR the required age of onset of symptoms is currently years However research indicates the age of onset should not be interpreted as a prerequisite for diagnosis given contextual exceptions br br br Presentations br ADHD is divided into three primary presentations br br predominantly inattentive ADHD PI or ADHD I br predominantly hyperactive impulsive ADHD PH or ADHD HI br combined presentation ADHD C br The table Symptoms lists the symptoms for ADHD I and ADHD HI from two major classification systems Symptoms which can be better explained by another psychiatric or medical condition which an individual has are not considered to be a symptom of ADHD for that person In DSM subtypes were discarded and reclassified as presentations of the disorder that change over time br br Girls and women with ADHD tend to display fewer hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms but more symptoms of inattention and distractibility br Symptoms are expressed differently and more subtly as the individual ages Hyperactivity tends to become less overt with age and turns into inner restlessness difficulty relaxing or remaining still talkativeness or constant mental activity in teens and adults with ADHD Impulsivity in adulthood may appear as thoughtless behaviour impatience irresponsible spending and sensation seeking behaviours while inattention may appear as becoming easily bored difficulty with organization remaining on task and making decisions and sensitivity to stress br Although not listed as an official symptom for this condition emotional dysregulation or mood lability is generally understood to be a common symptom of ADHD People with ADHD of all ages are more likely to have problems with social skills such as social interaction and forming and maintaining friendships This is true for all presentations About half of children and adolescents with ADHD experience social rejection by their peers compared to of non ADHD children and adolescents People with attention deficits are prone to having difficulty processing verbal and nonverbal language which can negatively affect social interaction They may also drift off during conversations miss social cues and have trouble learning social skills br Difficulties managing anger are more common in children with ADHD as are delays in speech language and motor development Poorer handwriting is more common in children with ADHD Poor handwriting in many situations can be a symptom of ADHD in itself due to decreased attentiveness When this is a pervasive problem it may also be attributable to dyslexia or dysgraphia There is significant overlap in the symptomatologies of ADHD dyslexia and dysgraphia and in people diagnosed with dyslexia experience co occurring ADHD Although it causes significant difficulty many children with ADHD have an attention span equal to or greater than that of other children for tasks and subjects they find interesting br br br Comorbidities br br br Psychiatric comorbidities br In children ADHD occurs with other disorders about two thirds of the time br Other neurodevelopmental conditions are common comorbidities Autism spectrum disorder ASD co occurring at a rate of in those with ADHD affects social skills ability to communicate behaviour and interests Both ADHD and ASD can be diagnosed in the same person Learning disabilities have been found to occur in about of children with ADHD Learning disabilities can include developmental speech and language disorders and academic skills disorders ADHD however is not considered a learning disability but it very frequently causes academic difficulties Intellectual disabilities and Tourette s syndrome are also common br ADHD is often comorbid with disruptive impulse control and conduct disorders Oppositional defiant disorder ODD occurs in about of children with an inattentive presentation and of those with a combined presentation It is characterised by angry or irritable mood argumentative or defiant behaviour and vindictiveness which are age inappropriate Conduct disorder CD occurs in about of adolescents with ADHD It is characterised by aggression destruction of property deceitfulness theft and violations of rules Adolescents with ADHD who also have CD are more likely to develop antisocial personality disorder in adulthood Brain imaging supports that CD and ADHD are separate conditions wherein conduct disorder was shown to reduce the size of one s temporal lobe and limbic system and increase the size of one s orbitofrontal cortex whereas ADHD was shown to reduce connections in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex more broadly Conduct disorder involves more impairment in motivation control than ADHD Intermittent explosive disorder is characterised by sudden and disproportionate outbursts of anger and co occurs in individuals with ADHD more frequently than in the general population br Anxiety and mood disorders are frequent comorbidities Anxiety disorders have been found to occur more commonly in the ADHD population as have mood disorders especially bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder Boys diagnosed with the combined ADHD subtype are more likely to have a mood disorder Adults and children with ADHD sometimes also have bipolar disorder which requires careful assessment to accurately diagnose and treat both conditions br Sleep disorders and ADHD commonly co exist They can also occur as a side effect of medications used to treat ADHD In children with ADHD insomnia is the most common sleep disorder with behavioural therapy being the preferred treatment Problems with sleep initiation are common among individuals with ADHD but often they will be deep sleepers and have significant difficulty getting up in the morning Melatonin is sometimes used in children who have sleep onset insomnia Specifically the sleep disorder restless legs syndrome has been found to be more common in those with ADHD and is often due to iron deficiency anemia However restless legs can simply be a part of ADHD and requires careful assessment to differentiate between the two disorders Delayed sleep phase disorder is also a common comorbidity of those with ADHD br There are other psychiatric conditions which are often co morbid with ADHD such as substance use disorders Individuals with ADHD are at increased risk of substance abuse This is most commonly seen with alcohol or cannabis The reason for this may be an altered reward pathway in the brains of ADHD individuals self treatment and increased psychosocial risk factors This makes the evaluation and treatment of ADHD more difficult with serious substance misuse problems usually treated first due to their greater risks Other psychiatric conditions include reactive attachment disorder characterised by a severe inability to appropriately relate socially and cognitive disengagement syndrome a distinct attention disorder occurring in of ADHD cases as a comorbidity regardless of the presentation a subset of cases diagnosed with ADHD PIP have been found to have CDS instead Individuals with ADHD are three times more likely to develop and be diagnosed with an eating disorder compared to those without ADHD conversely individuals with eating disorders are two times more likely to have ADHD than those without eating disorders br br br Trauma br ADHD trauma and Adverse Childhood Experiences are also comorbid which could in part be potentially explained by the similarity in presentation between different diagnoses The symptoms of ADHD and PTSD can have significant behavioural overlap in particular motor restlessness difficulty concentrating distractibility irritability anger emotional constriction or dysregulation poor impulse control and forgetfulness are common in both This could result in trauma related disorders or ADHD being mis identified as the other Additionally traumatic events in childhood are a risk factor for ADHD it can lead to structural brain changes and the development of ADHD behaviours Finally the behavioural consequences of ADHD symptoms cause a higher chance of the individual experiencing trauma and therefore ADHD leads to a concrete diagnosis of a trauma related disorder br br br Non psychiatric br br Some non psychiatric conditions are also comorbidities of ADHD This includes epilepsy a neurological condition characterised by recurrent seizures There are well established associations between ADHD and obesity asthma and sleep disorders and an association with celiac disease Children with ADHD have a higher risk for migraine headaches but have no increased risk of tension type headaches In addition children with ADHD may also experience headaches as a result of medication br A review reported that several neurometabolic disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism converge on common neurochemical mechanisms that interfere with biological mechanisms also considered central in ADHD pathophysiology and treatment This highlights the importance of close collaboration between health services to avoid clinical overshadowing br In June Neuroscience Biobehavioral Reviews published a systematic review of studies that all confirmed or implied elevated accident proneness in ADHD patients and whose data suggested that the type of accidents or injuries and overall risk changes in ADHD patients over the lifespan In January Accident Analysis Prevention published a meta analysis of studies examining the relative risk of traffic collisions for drivers with ADHD finding an overall relative risk estimate of without controlling for exposure a relative risk estimate of when controlling for publication bias a relative risk estimate of when controlling for exposure and a relative risk estimate of for ADHD drivers with oppositional defiant disorder and or conduct disorder comorbidities br br br Problematic digital media use br br br Suicide risk br Systematic reviews conducted in and found strong evidence that ADHD is associated with increased suicide risk across all age groups as well as growing evidence that an ADHD diagnosis in childhood or adolescence represents a significant future suicidal risk factor Potential causes include ADHD s association with functional impairment negative social educational and occupational outcomes and financial distress A meta analysis indicated a significant association between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours suicidal attempts ideations plans and completed suicides across the studies examined the prevalence of suicide attempts in individuals with ADHD was compared to in individuals without ADHD and the findings were substantially replicated among studies which adjusted for other variables However the relationship between ADHD and suicidal spectrum behaviours remains unclear due to mixed findings across individual studies and the complicating impact of comorbid psychiatric disorders There is no clear data on whether there is a direct relationship between ADHD and suicidality or whether ADHD increases suicide risk through comorbidities br br br IQ test performance br Certain studies have found that people with ADHD tend to have lower scores on intelligence quotient IQ tests The significance of this is controversial due to the differences between people with ADHD and the difficulty determining the influence of symptoms such as distractibility on lower scores rather than intellectual capacity In studies of ADHD higher IQs may be over represented because many studies exclude individuals who have lower IQs despite those with ADHD scoring on average nine points lower on standardised intelligence measures However other studies contradict this saying that in individuals with high intelligence there is an increased risk of a missed ADHD diagnosis possibly because of compensatory strategies in said individuals br Studies of adults suggest that negative differences in intelligence are not meaningful and may be explained by associated health problems br br br Causes br ADHD arises from brain maldevelopment especially in the prefrontal executive networks that can arise either from genetic factors different gene variants and mutations for building and regulating such networks or from acquired disruptions to the development of these networks and regions involved in executive functioning and self regulation Their reduced size functional connectivity and activation contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD as well as imbalances in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems that mediate these brain regions br Genetic factors play an important role ADHD has a heritability rate of The remaining of variance is mediated by de novo mutations and non shared environmental factors that provide for or produce brain injuries there is no significant contribution of the rearing family and social environment Very rarely ADHD can also be the result of abnormalities in the chromosomes br br br Genetics br br In November Biological Psychiatry published a literature review by psychiatrists Joseph Biederman and Thomas Spencer on the pathophysiology of ADHD that found the average heritability estimate of ADHD from twin studies to be while a subsequent family twin and adoption studies literature review published in Molecular Psychiatry in April by psychologists Stephen Faraone and Henrik Larsson that found an average heritability estimate of Additionally evolutionary psychiatrist Randolph M Nesse has argued that the male to female sex ratio in the epidemiology of ADHD suggests that ADHD may be the end of a continuum where males are overrepresented at the tails citing clinical psychologist Simon Baron Cohen s suggestion for the sex ratio in the epidemiology of autism as an analogue br Natural selection has been acting against the genetic variants for ADHD over the course of at least years indicating that it was not an adaptative trait in ancient times The disorder may remain at a stable rate by the balance of genetic mutations and removal rate natural selection across generations over thousands of years these genetic variants become more stable decreasing disorder prevalence Throughout human evolution the EFs involved in ADHD likely provide the capacity to bind contingencies across time thereby directing behaviour toward future over immediate events so as to maximise future social consequences for humans br ADHD has a high heritability of meaning that of the presence of ADHD in the population is due to genetic factors There are multiple gene variants which each slightly increase the likelihood of a person having ADHD it is polygenic and thus arises through the accumulation of many genetic risks each having a very small effect The siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder br The association of maternal smoking observed in large population studies disappears after adjusting for family history of ADHD which indicates that the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ADHD is due to familial or genetic factors that increase the risk for the confluence of smoking and ADHD br ADHD presents with reduced size functional connectivity and activation as well as low noradrenergic and dopaminergic functioning in brain regions and networks crucial for executive functioning and self regulation Typically a number of genes are involved many of which directly affect brain functioning and neurotransmission Those involved with dopamine include DAT DRD DRD TAAR MAOA COMT and DBH Other genes associated with ADHD include SERT HTR B SNAP GRIN A ADRA A TPH and BDNF A common variant of a gene called latrophilin is estimated to be responsible for about of cases and when this variant is present people are particularly responsive to stimulant medication The repeat variant of dopamine receptor D DRD R causes increased inhibitory effects induced by dopamine and is associated with ADHD The DRD receptor is a G protein coupled receptor that inhibits adenylyl cyclase The DRD R mutation results in a wide range of behavioural phenotypes including ADHD symptoms reflecting split attention The DRD gene is both linked to novelty seeking and ADHD The genes GFOD and CDH show strong genetic associations with ADHD CHD s association with ASD schizophrenia bipolar disorder and depression make it an interesting candidate causative gene Another candidate causative gene that has been identified is ADGRL In zebrafish knockout of this gene causes a loss of dopaminergic function in the ventral diencephalon and the fish display a hyperactive impulsive phenotype br For genetic variation to be used as a tool for diagnosis more validating studies need to be performed However smaller studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in genes related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission or the SNARE complex of the synapse can reliably predict a person s response to stimulant medication Rare genetic variants show more relevant clinical significance as their penetrance the chance of developing the disorder tends to be much higher However their usefulness as tools for diagnosis is limited as no single gene predicts ADHD ASD shows genetic overlap with ADHD at both common and rare levels of genetic variation br br br Environment br In addition to genetics some environmental factors might play a role in causing ADHD Alcohol intake during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders which can include ADHD or symptoms like it Children exposed to certain toxic substances such as lead or polychlorinated biphenyls may develop problems which resemble ADHD Exposure to the organophosphate insecticides chlorpyrifos and dialkyl phosphate is associated with an increased risk however the evidence is not conclusive Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy can cause problems with central nervous system development and can increase the risk of ADHD Nicotine exposure during pregnancy may be an environmental risk br Extreme premature birth very low birth weight and extreme neglect abuse or social deprivation also increase the risk as do certain infections during pregnancy at birth and in early childhood These infections include among others various viruses measles varicella zoster encephalitis rubella enterovirus At least of children with a traumatic brain injury later develop ADHD and about of cases are due to brain damage br Some studies suggest that in a small number of children artificial food dyes or preservatives may be associated with an increased prevalence of ADHD or ADHD like symptoms but the evidence is weak and may only apply to children with food sensitivities The European Union has put in place regulatory measures based on these concerns In a minority of children intolerances or allergies to certain foods may worsen ADHD symptoms br Individuals with hypokalemic sensory overstimulation are sometimes diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD raising the possibility that a subtype of ADHD has a cause that can be understood mechanistically and treated in a novel way The sensory overload is treatable with oral potassium gluconate br br Research does not support popular beliefs that ADHD is caused by eating too much refined sugar watching too much television bad parenting poverty or family chaos however they might worsen ADHD symptoms in certain people br The youngest children in a class have been found to be more likely to be diagnosed as having ADHD possibly due to them being developmentally behind their older classmates One study showed that the youngest children in fifth and eight grade was nearly twice as likely to use stimulant medication than their older peers br In some cases an inappropriate diagnosis of ADHD may reflect a dysfunctional family or a poor educational system rather than any true presence of ADHD in the individual In other cases it may be explained by increasing academic expectations with a diagnosis being a method for parents in some countries to get extra financial and educational support for their child Behaviours typical of ADHD occur more commonly in children who have experienced violence and emotional abuse br br br Pathophysiology br Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain s neurotransmitter systems particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine The dopamine and norepinephrine pathways that originate in the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus project to diverse regions of the brain and govern a variety of cognitive processes The dopamine pathways and norepinephrine pathways which project to the prefrontal cortex and striatum are directly responsible for modulating executive function cognitive control of behaviour motivation reward perception and motor function these pathways are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of ADHD Larger models of ADHD with additional pathways have been proposed br br br Brain structure br br In children with ADHD there is a general reduction of volume in certain brain structures with a proportionally greater decrease in the volume in the left sided prefrontal cortex The posterior parietal cortex also shows thinning in individuals with ADHD compared to controls Other brain structures in the prefrontal striatal cerebellar and prefrontal striatal thalamic circuits have also been found to differ between people with and without ADHD br The subcortical volumes of the accumbens amygdala caudate hippocampus and putamen appears smaller in individuals with ADHD compared with controls Structural MRI studies have also revealed differences in white matter with marked differences in inter hemispheric asymmetry between ADHD and typically developing youths br Function MRI fMRI studies have revealed a number of differences between ADHD and control brains Mirroring what is known from structural findings fMRI studies have showed evidence for a higher connectivity between subcortical and cortical regions such as between the caudate and prefrontal cortex The degree of hyperconnectivity between these regions correlated with the severity of inattention or hyperactivity Hemispheric lateralization processes have also been postulated as being implicated in ADHD but empiric results showed contrasting evidence on the topic br br br Neurotransmitter pathways br Previously it had been suggested that the elevated number of dopamine transporters in people with ADHD was part of the pathophysiology but it appears the elevated numbers may be due to adaptation following exposure to stimulant medication Current models involve the mesocorticolimbic dopamine pathway and the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system ADHD psychostimulants possess treatment efficacy because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems There may additionally be abnormalities in serotonergic glutamatergic or cholinergic pathways br br br Executive function and motivation br The symptoms of ADHD arise from a deficiency in certain executive functions e g attentional control inhibitory control and working memory Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviours that facilitate the attainment of one s chosen goals The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organised time keeping excessive procrastination maintaining concentration paying attention ignoring distractions regulating emotions and remembering details People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long term memory and deficits in long term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood Conversely brain maturation trajectories potentially exhibiting diverging longitudinal trends in ADHD may support a later improvement in executive functions after reaching adulthood br ADHD has also been associated with motivational deficits in children Children with ADHD often find it difficult to focus on long term over short term rewards and exhibit impulsive behaviour for short term rewards br br br Paradoxical reaction to neuroactive substances br Another sign of the structurally altered signal processing in the central nervous system in this group of people is the conspicuously common paradoxical reaction c of patients These are unexpected reactions in the opposite direction as with a normal effect or otherwise significant different reactions These are reactions to neuroactive substances such as local anesthetic at the dentist sedative caffeine antihistamine weak neuroleptics and central and peripheral painkillers Since the causes of paradoxical reactions are at least partly genetic it may be useful in critical situations for example before operations to ask whether such abnormalities may also exist in family members br br br Diagnosis br ADHD is diagnosed by an assessment of a person s behavioural and mental development including ruling out the effects of drugs medications and other medical or psychiatric problems as explanations for the symptoms ADHD diagnosis often takes into account feedback from parents and teachers with most diagnoses begun after a teacher raises concerns While many tools exist to aide in the diagnosis of ADHD their validity varies in different populations and a reliable and valid diagnosis requires confirmation by a clinician while supplemented by standardized rating scales and input from multiple informants across various settings br The most commonly used rating scales for diagnosing ADHD are the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment ASEBA and include the Child Behavior Checklist CBCL used for parents to rate their child s behaviour the Youth Self Report Form YSR used for children to rate their own behaviour and the Teacher Report Form TRF used for teachers to rate their pupil s behaviour Additional rating scales that have been used alone or in combination with other measures to diagnose ADHD include the Behavior Assessment System for Children BASC Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Second Edition BRIEF Revised Conners Rating Scale CRS R Conduct Hyperactive Attention Problem Oppositional Symptom scale CHAOS Developmental Behavior Checklist Hyperactivity Index DBC HI Parent Disruptive Behavior Disorder Ratings Scale DBDRS Diagnostic Infant and Preschool Assessment DIPA L Pediatric Symptom Checklist PSC Social Communication Questionnaire SCQ Social Responsiveness Scale SRS Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behavior Rating Scale SWAN and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale br The ASEBA BASC CHAOS CRS and Vanderbilt diagnostic rating scales allow for both parents and teachers as raters in the diagnosis of childhood and adolescent ADHD Adolescents may also self report their symptoms using self report scales from the ASEBA SWAN and the Dominic Interactive for Adolescents Revised DIA R br Based on a systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute PCORI rating scales based on parent report teacher report or self assessment from the adolescent have high internal consistency as a diagnostic tool meaning that the items within the scale are highly interrelated The reliability of the scales between raters i e their degree of agreement however is poor to moderate making it important to include information from multiple raters to best inform a diagnosis br Imaging studies of the brain do not give consistent results between individuals thus they are only used for research purposes and not a diagnosis A systematic review concluded that the use of biomarkers such as blood or urine samples electroencephalogram EEG markers and neuroimaging such as MRIs in diagnosis for ADHD remains unclear studies showed great variability did not assess test retest reliability and were not independently replicable br In North America and Australia DSM criteria are used for diagnosis while European countries usually use the ICD The DSM IV criteria for diagnosis of ADHD is times more likely to diagnose ADHD than is the ICD criteria ADHD is alternately classified as neurodevelopmental disorder or a disruptive behaviour disorder along with ODD CD and antisocial personality disorder A diagnosis does not imply a neurological disorder br Associated conditions that should be screened for include anxiety depression ODD CD and learning and language disorders Other conditions that should be considered are other neurodevelopmental disorders tics and sleep apnea br Self rating scales such as the ADHD rating scale and the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale are used in the screening and evaluation of ADHD Electroencephalography is not accurate enough to make an ADHD diagnosis br Very few studies have been conducted on diagnosis of ADHD on children younger than years of age and those that have were found in a systematic review to be of low or insufficient strength of evidence br br br Classification br br br Diagnostic and Statistical Manual br As with many other psychiatric disorders a formal diagnosis should be made by a qualified professional based on a set number of criteria In the United States these criteria are defined by the American Psychiatric Association in the DSM Based on the DSM criteria published in and the DSM TR criteria published in there are three presentations of ADHD br br ADHD predominantly inattentive presentation presents with symptoms including being easily distracted forgetful daydreaming disorganization poor sustained attention and difficulty completing tasks br ADHD predominantly hyperactive impulsive presentation presents with excessive fidgeting and restlessness hyperactivity and difficulty waiting and remaining seated br ADHD combined presentation is a combination of the first two presentations br This subdivision is based on presence of at least six in children or five in older teenagers and adults out of nine long term lasting at least six months symptoms of inattention hyperactivity impulsivity or both To be considered several symptoms must have appeared by the age of six to twelve and occur in more than one environment e g at home and at school or work The symptoms must be inappropriate for a child of that age and there must be clear evidence that they are causing social school or work related problems br The DSM and the DSM TR also provide two diagnoses for individuals who have symptoms of ADHD but do not entirely meet the requirements Other Specified ADHD allows the clinician to describe why the individual does not meet the criteria whereas Unspecified ADHD is used where the clinician chooses not to describe the reason br br br International Classification of Diseases br In the eleventh revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD by the World Health Organization the disorder is classified as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with the code A The defined subtypes are similar to those of the DSM predominantly inattentive presentation A predominantly hyperactive impulsive presentation A combined presentation A However the ICD includes two residual categories for individuals who do not entirely match any of the defined subtypes other specified presentation A Y where the clinician includes detail on the individual s presentation and presentation unspecified A Z where the clinician does not provide detail br In the tenth revision ICD the symptoms of hyperkinetic disorder were analogous to ADHD in the ICD When a conduct disorder as defined by ICD is present the condition was referred to as hyperkinetic conduct disorder Otherwise the disorder was classified as disturbance of activity and attention other hyperkinetic disorders or hyperkinetic disorders unspecified The latter was sometimes referred to as hyperkinetic syndrome br br br Social construct theory br The social construct theory of ADHD suggests that because the boundaries between normal and abnormal behaviour are socially constructed i e jointly created and validated by all members of society and in particular by physicians parents teachers and others it then follows that subjective valuations and judgements determine which diagnostic criteria are used and thus the number of people affected Thomas Szasz a supporter of this theory has argued that ADHD was invented and then given a name br br br Adults br br Adults with ADHD are diagnosed under the same criteria including that their signs must have been present by the age of six to twelve The individual is the best source for information in diagnosis however others may provide useful information about the individual s symptoms currently and in childhood a family history of ADHD also adds weight to a diagnosis While the core symptoms of ADHD are similar in children and adults they often present differently in adults than in children for example excessive physical activity seen in children may present as feelings of restlessness and constant mental activity in adults br Worldwide it is estimated that of adults have persistent ADHD where the individual currently meets the criteria and there is evidence of childhood onset and of adults have symptomatic ADHD meaning that they currently meet the criteria for ADHD regardless of childhood onset In this was million and million affected adults respectively Around of children with ADHD continue to meet full DSM IV TR criteria at years of age and still experience some symptoms As of most adults remain untreated Many adults with ADHD without diagnosis and treatment have a disorganised life and some use non prescribed drugs or alcohol as a coping mechanism Other problems may include relationship and job difficulties and an increased risk of criminal activities Associated mental health problems include depression anxiety disorders and learning disabilities br Some ADHD symptoms in adults differ from those seen in children While children with ADHD may climb and run about excessively adults may experience an inability to relax or may talk excessively in social situations Adults with ADHD may start relationships impulsively display sensation seeking behaviour and be short tempered Addictive behaviour such as substance abuse and gambling are common This led to those who presented differently as they aged having outgrown the DSM IV criteria The DSM criteria does specifically deal with adults unlike that of DSM IV which does not fully take into account the differences in impairments seen in adulthood compared to childhood br For diagnosis in an adult having symptoms since childhood is required Nevertheless a proportion of adults who meet the criteria for ADHD in adulthood would not have been diagnosed with ADHD as children Most cases of late onset ADHD develop the disorder between the ages of and may therefore be considered early adult or adolescent onset ADHD br br br Differential diagnosis br br The DSM provides potential differential diagnoses potential alternate explanations for specific symptoms Assessment and investigation of clinical history determines which is the most appropriate diagnosis The DSM suggests ODD intermittent explosive disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders such as stereotypic movement disorder and Tourette s disorder in addition to specific learning disorder intellectual developmental disorder ASD reactive attachment disorder anxiety disorders depressive disorders bipolar disorder disruptive mood dysregulation disorder substance use disorder personality disorders psychotic disorders medication induced symptoms and neurocognitive disorders Many but not all of these are also common comorbidities of ADHD The DSM TR also suggests post traumatic stress disorder br Symptoms of ADHD such as low mood and poor self image mood swings and irritability can be confused with dysthymia cyclothymia or bipolar disorder as well as with borderline personality disorder Some symptoms that are due to anxiety disorders personality disorder developmental disabilities or intellectual disability or the effects of substance abuse such as intoxication and withdrawal can overlap with ADHD These disorders can also sometimes occur along with ADHD Medical conditions which can cause ADHD type symptoms include hyperthyroidism seizure disorder lead toxicity hearing deficits hepatic disease sleep apnea drug interactions untreated celiac disease and head injury br Primary sleep disorders may affect attention and behaviour and the symptoms of ADHD may affect sleep It is thus recommended that children with ADHD be regularly assessed for sleep problems Sleepiness in children may result in symptoms ranging from the classic ones of yawning and rubbing the eyes to hyperactivity and inattentiveness Obstructive sleep apnea can also cause ADHD type symptoms br br br Management br br The management of ADHD typically involves counseling or medications either alone or in combination On average treatment with medication substantially improves long term outcomes and completely eliminates some elevated risks such as obesity Medications used include stimulants atomoxetine alpha adrenergic receptor agonists and sometimes antidepressants In those who have trouble focusing on long term rewards a large amount of positive reinforcement improves task performance Medications are the most effective treatment and any side effects are typically mild and easy to resolve although any improvements will be reverted if medication is ceased ADHD stimulants also improve persistence and task performance in children with ADHD To quote one systematic review recent evidence from observational and registry studies indicates that pharmacological treatment of ADHD is associated with increased achievement and decreased absenteeism at school a reduced risk of trauma related emergency hospital visits reduced risks of suicide and attempted suicide and decreased rates of substance abuse and criminality Data also suggest that combining medication with CBT is a good idea although CBT is substantially less effective it can help address problems that reside after medication has been optimised br br br Behavioural therapies br There is good evidence for the use of behavioural therapies in ADHD They are the recommended first line treatment in those who have mild symptoms or who are preschool aged Psychological therapies used include psychoeducational input behavior therapy cognitive behavioral therapy interpersonal psychotherapy family therapy school based interventions social skills training behavioural peer intervention organization training and parent management training Neurofeedback has greater treatment effects than non active controls for up to months and possibly a year following treatment and may have treatment effects comparable to active controls controls proven to have a clinical effect over that time period Despite efficacy in research there is insufficient regulation of neurofeedback practice leading to ineffective applications and false claims regarding innovations Parent training may improve a number of behavioural problems including oppositional and non compliant behaviours br There is little high quality research on the effectiveness of family therapy for ADHD but the existing evidence shows that it is similar to community care and better than placebo ADHD specific support groups can provide information and may help families cope with ADHD br Social skills training behavioural modification and medication may have some limited beneficial effects in peer relationships Stable high quality friendships with non deviant peers protect against later psychological problems br br br Digital interventions br Several clinical trials have investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics particularly Akili Interactive Labs s video game based digital therapeutic AKL T marketed as EndeavourRx The pediatric STARS ADHD randomized double blind parallel group controlled trial demonstrated that AKL T significantly improved performance on the Test of Variables of Attention an objective measure of attention and inhibitory control compared to a control group after four weeks of at home use A subsequent pediatric open label study STARS Adjunct published in Nature Portfolio s npj Digital Medicine evaluated AKL T as an adjunctive treatment for children with ADHD who were either on stimulant medication or not on stimulant pharmacotherapy Results showed improvements in ADHD related impairment measured by the Impairment Rating Scale and ADHD symptoms after weeks of treatment with effects persisting during a week pause and further improving with an additional treatment period Notably the magnitude of the measured improvement was similar for children both on and off stimulants In AKL T received marketing authorization for pediatric ADHD from the FDA becoming the first game based therapeutic granted marketing authorization by the FDA for any type of condition br In addition to pediatric populations a study STARS ADHD Adults published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry investigated the efficacy and safety of AKL T in adults with ADHD After weeks of at home treatment with AKL T participants showed significant improvements in objective measures of attention TOVA Attention Comparison Score reported ADHD symptoms ADHD RS IV inattention subscale and total score and reported quality of life AAQoL Notably the magnitude of improvement in attention was nearly seven times greater than that reported in pediatric trials The treatment was well tolerated with high compliance and no serious adverse events br br br Medication br The medications for ADHD appear to alleviate symptoms via their effects on the pre frontal executive striatal and related regions and networks in the brain usually by increasing neurotransmission of norepinephrine and dopamine br br br Stimulants br Methylphenidate and amphetamine or its derivatives are often first line treatments for ADHD About per cent respond to the first stimulant tried and as few as per cent respond to neither amphetamines nor methylphenidate Stimulants may also reduce the risk of unintentional injuries in children with ADHD Magnetic resonance imaging studies suggest that long term treatment with amphetamine or methylphenidate decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD A review found the greatest short term benefit with methylphenidate in children and amphetamines in adults Studies and meta analyses show that amphetamine is slightly to modestly more effective than methylphenidate at reducing symptoms and they are more effective pharmacotherapy for ADHD than agonists but methylphenidate has comparable efficacy to non stimulants such as atomoxetine br Safety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators e g the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency the developers of evidence based international guidelines e g the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines e g the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council These professional groups unanimously conclude based on the scientific evidence that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first line treatment for ADHD br The likelihood of developing insomnia for ADHD patients taking stimulants has been measured at between and per cent for different medications and may be a main reason for discontinuation Other side effects such as tics decreased appetite and weight loss or emotional lability may also lead to discontinuation Stimulant psychosis and mania are rare at therapeutic doses appearing to occur in approximately of individuals within the first several weeks after starting amphetamine therapy The safety of these medications in pregnancy is unclear Symptom improvement is not sustained if medication is ceased br The long term effects of ADHD medication have yet to be fully determined although stimulants are generally beneficial and safe for up to two years for children and adolescents A meta analysis found no statistically significant association between ADHD medications and the risk of cardiovascular disease CVD across age groups although the study suggests further investigation is warranted for patients with preexisting CVD as well as long term medication use Regular monitoring has been recommended in those on long term treatment There are indications suggesting that stimulant therapy for children and adolescents should be stopped periodically to assess continuing need for medication decrease possible growth delay and reduce tolerance Although potentially addictive at high doses stimulants used to treat ADHD have low potential for abuse Treatment with stimulants is either protective against substance abuse or has no effect br The majority of studies on nicotine and other nicotinic agonists as treatments for ADHD have shown favorable results however no nicotinic drug has been approved for ADHD treatment Caffeine was formerly used as a second line treatment for ADHD but research indicates it has no significant effects in reducing ADHD symptoms Caffeine appears to help with alertness arousal and reaction time but not the type of inattention implicated in ADHD sustained attention persistence Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine do not affect ADHD symptoms br Modafinil has shown some efficacy in reducing the severity of ADHD in children and adolescents It may be prescribed off label to treat ADHD br br br Non stimulants br Two non stimulant medications atomoxetine and viloxazine are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD br Atomoxetine due to its lack of addiction liability may be preferred in those who are at risk of recreational or compulsive stimulant use although evidence is lacking to support its use over stimulants for this reason Atomoxetine alleviates ADHD symptoms through norepinephrine reuptake and by indirectly increasing dopamine in the pre frontal cortex sharing of the brain regions with stimulants in their produced effects Atomoxetine has been shown to significantly improve academic performance Meta analyses and systematic reviews have found that atomoxetine has comparable efficacy equal tolerability and response rate to methylphenidate in children and adolescents In adults efficacy and discontinuation rates are equivalent br Analyses of clinical trial data suggests that viloxazine is about as effective as atomoxetine and methylphenidate but with fewer side effects br Amantadine was shown to induce similar improvements in children treated with methylphenidate with less frequent side effects A retrospective study showed showed that amantadine may serve as an effective adjunct to stimulants for ADHD related symptoms and appears to be a safer alternative to second or third generation antipsychotics br Bupropion is also used off label by some clinicians due to research findings It is effective but modestly less than atomoxetine and methylphenidate br There is little evidence on the effects of medication on social behaviours Antipsychotics may also be used to treat aggression in ADHD br Alpha a agonists br Two alpha a agonists extended release formulations of guanfacine and clonidine are approved by the FDA and in other countries for the treatment of ADHD effective in children and adolescents but effectiveness has still not been shown for adults They appear to be modestly less effective than the stimulants amphetamine and methylphenidate and non stimulants atomoxetine and viloxazine at reducing symptoms but can be useful alternatives or used in conjunction with a stimulant These medications act by adjusting the alpha a ports on the outside of noradrenergic nerve cells in the pre frontal executive networks so the information electrical signal is less confounded by noise br br br Guidelines br Guidelines on when to use medications vary by country The United Kingdom s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends use for children only in severe cases though for adults medication is a first line treatment Conversely most United States guidelines recommend medications in most age groups Medications are especially not recommended for preschool children Underdosing of stimulants can occur and can result in a lack of response or later loss of effectiveness This is particularly common in adolescents and adults as approved dosing is based on school aged children causing some practitioners to use weight based or benefit based off label dosing instead br br br Exercise br Although exercise is good for all humans it does not reduce the symptoms of ADHD The conclusion by the International Consensus Statement is based on two meta analyses one of studies with children and the other of studies and participants The former review initially suggested statistically significant effects until Vysniauske and colleagues controlled for problems with confounding Based on a systematic literature review and meta analysis commissioned by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute PCORI seven studies were identified that report on the effectiveness of physical exercise for treating ADHD symptoms The type and amount of exercise varied widely across studies from martial arts interventions to treadmill training to table tennis or aerobic exercise Effects reported were not replicated causing the authors to conclude that there is insufficient evidence that exercise intervention is an effective form of treatment for ADHD symptoms br br br Diet br Dietary modifications are not recommended as of by the American Academy of Pediatrics the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality due to insufficient evidence br A meta analysis found less than a third of children with ADHD see some improvement in symptoms with free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring These benefits may be limited to children with food sensitivities or those who are simultaneously being treated with ADHD medications This review also found that evidence does not support removing other foods from the diet to treat ADHD A review found that an elimination diet results in a small overall benefit in a minority of children such as those with allergies A review stated that the use of a gluten free diet as standard ADHD treatment is not advised A review showed that a few foods elimination diet may help children too young to be medicated or not responding to medication while free fatty acid supplementation or decreased eating of artificial food colouring as standard ADHD treatment is not advised Chronic deficiencies of iron magnesium and iodine may have a negative impact on ADHD symptoms There is a small amount of evidence that lower tissue zinc levels may be associated with ADHD In the absence of a demonstrated zinc deficiency which is rare outside of developing countries zinc supplementation is not recommended as treatment for ADHD However zinc supplementation may reduce the minimum effective dose of amphetamine when it is used with amphetamine for the treatment of ADHD br br br Prognosis br ADHD persists into adulthood in about of cases Those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature thus compensating to some extent for their previous symptoms Children with ADHD have a higher risk of unintentional injuries Effects of medication on functional impairment and quality of life e g reduced risk of accidents have been found across multiple domains Rates of smoking among those with ADHD are higher than in the general population at about br It affects about of children when diagnosed via the DSM IV criteria and when diagnosed via the ICD criteria Rates are similar between countries and differences in rates depend mostly on how it is diagnosed ADHD is diagnosed approximately twice as often in boys as in girls and times more often in men than in women although the disorder is overlooked in girls or diagnosed in later life because their symptoms sometimes differ from diagnostic criteria About of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have ADHD in adulthood with of adults estimated to have ADHD which began in childhood In adults hyperactivity is usually replaced by inner restlessness and adults often develop coping skills to compensate for their impairments The condition can be difficult to tell apart from other conditions as well as from high levels of activity within the range of normal behaviour ADHD has a negative impact on patient health related quality of life that may be further exacerbated by or may increase the risk of other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression br Individuals with ADHD are significantly overrepresented in prison populations Although there is no generally accepted estimate of ADHD prevalence among inmates a meta analysis estimated a prevalence of and a larger meta analysis estimated the frequency to be ADHD is more common among longer term inmates a study at Norrt lje Prison a high security prison in Sweden found an estimated ADHD prevalence of br br br Epidemiology br br ADHD is estimated to affect about of people aged and under when diagnosed via the DSM IV criteria When diagnosed via the ICD criteria rates in this age group are estimated around Children in North America appear to have a higher rate of ADHD than children in Africa and the Middle East this is believed to be due to differing methods of diagnosis rather than a difference in underlying frequency The same publication which describes this difference also notes that the difference may be rooted in the available studies from these respective regions as far more studies were from North America than from Africa and the Middle East As of it was estimated to affect million people globally If the same diagnostic methods are used the rates are similar between countries ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls This may reflect either a true difference in underlying rate or that women and girls with ADHD are less likely to be diagnosed Studies from multiple countries have reported that children born closer to the start of the school year are more frequently diagnosed with and medicated for ADHD than their older classmates br Rates of diagnosis and treatment have increased in both the United Kingdom and the United States since the s Prior to it was rare for children to be diagnosed with ADHD while in the s rates were about This is believed to be primarily due to changes in how the condition is diagnosed and how readily people are willing to treat it with medications rather than a true change in how common the condition is It was believed changes to the diagnostic criteria in with the release of the DSM would increase the percentage of people diagnosed with ADHD especially among adults br Despite showing a higher frequency of symptoms associated with ADHD non white children in the United States are less likely than white children to be diagnosed or treated for ADHD a finding that is often explained by bias among health professionals as well as parents who may be reluctant to acknowledge that their child has ADHD br Crosscultural differences in diagnosis of ADHD can also be attributed to the long lasting effects of harmful racially targeted medical practices Medical pseudosciences particularly those that targeted African American populations during the period of slavery in the US lead to a distrust of medical practices within certain communities The combination of ADHD symptoms often being regarded as misbehaviour rather than as a psychiatric condition and the use of drugs to regulate ADHD result in a hesitancy to trust a diagnosis of ADHD Cases of misdiagnosis in ADHD can also occur due to stereotyping of non caucasian individuals Due to ADHD s subjectively determined symptoms medical professionals may diagnose individuals based on stereotyped behaviour or misdiagnose due to differences in symptom presentation between caucasian and non caucasian individuals br br br History br br Hyperactivity has long been part of the human condition Sir Alexander Crichton describes mental restlessness in his book An inquiry into the nature and origin of mental derangement written in He made observations about children showing signs of being inattentive and having the fidgets The first clear description of ADHD is credited to George Still in during a series of lectures he gave to the Royal College of Physicians of London He noted both nature and nurture could be influencing this disorder br ADHD was officially known as attention deficit disorder ADD from to prior to the s it was known as hyperkinetic reaction of childhood Symptoms similar to those of ADHD have been described in medical literature dating back to the th century br Alfred Tredgold proposed an association between brain damage and behavioural or learning problems which was able to be validated by the encephalitis lethargica epidemic from through br The terminology used to describe the condition has changed over time and has included minimal brain dysfunction in the DSM I hyperkinetic reaction of childhood in the DSM II and attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity in the DSM III In this was changed to ADHD in the DSM III R and in the DSM IV in split the diagnosis into three subtypes ADHD inattentive type ADHD hyperactive impulsive type and ADHD combined type These terms were kept in the DSM in and in the DSM TR in Prior to the DSM terms included minimal brain damage in the s br In Benzedrine became the first amphetamine medication approved for use in the United States Methylphenidate was introduced in the s and enantiopure dextroamphetamine in the s The use of stimulants to treat ADHD was first described in Charles Bradley gave the children with behavioural disorders Benzedrine and found it improved academic performance and behaviour br Once neuroimaging studies were possible studies conducted in the s provided support for the pre existing theory that neurological differences particularly in the frontal lobes were involved in ADHD During this same period a genetic component was identified and ADHD was acknowledged to be a persistent long term disorder which lasted from childhood into adulthood br ADHD was split into the current three sub types because of a field trial completed by Lahey and colleagues br br br Controversy br br ADHD its diagnosis and its treatment have been controversial since the s The controversies involve clinicians teachers policymakers parents and the media Positions range from the view that ADHD is within the normal range of behaviour to the hypothesis that ADHD is a genetic condition Other areas of controversy include the use of stimulant medications in children the method of diagnosis and the possibility of overdiagnosis In the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence while acknowledging the controversy states that the current treatments and methods of diagnosis are based on the dominant view of the academic literature In Keith Conners one of the early advocates for recognition of the disorder spoke out against overdiagnosis in a New York Times article In contrast a peer reviewed medical literature review indicated that ADHD is underdiagnosed in adults br Individuals with ADHD may face misconceptions and stigma in response to this a global team of scientists curated the International Consensus Statement br The diagnosis of ADHD has been criticised as being subjective because it is not based on a biological test The International Consensus Statement on ADHD concluded that this criticism is unfounded on the basis that ADHD meets standard criteria for validity of a mental disorder established by Robins and Guze They attest that the disorder is considered valid because well trained professionals in a variety of settings and cultures agree on its presence or absence using well defined criteria and the diagnosis is useful for predicting a additional problems the patient may have e g difficulties learning in school b future patient outcomes e g risk for future drug abuse c response to treatment e g medications and psychological treatments and d features that indicate a consistent set of causes for the disorder e g findings from genetics or brain imaging and that professional associations have endorsed and published guidelines for diagnosing ADHD br With widely differing rates of diagnosis across countries states within countries races and ethnicities some suspect factors other than the presence of the symptoms of ADHD are playing a role in diagnosis such as cultural norms Some sociologists consider ADHD to be an example of the medicalization of deviant behaviour that is the turning of the previously non medical issue of school performance into a medical one Most healthcare providers accept ADHD as a genuine disorder at least in the small number of people with severe symptoms Among healthcare providers the debate mainly centers on diagnosis and treatment in the much greater number of people with mild symptoms br The nature and range of desirable endpoints of ADHD treatment vary among diagnostic standards for ADHD In most studies the efficacy of treatment is determined by reductions in ADHD symptoms However some studies have included subjective ratings from teachers and parents as part of their assessment of ADHD treatment efficacies By contrast the subjective ratings of children undergoing ADHD treatment are seldom included in studies evaluating the efficacy of ADHD treatments br There have been notable differences in the diagnosis patterns of birthdays in school age children Those born relatively younger to the school starting age than others in a classroom environment are shown to be more likely diagnosed with ADHD Boys who were born in December in which the school age cut off was December were shown to be more likely to be diagnosed and to be treated than others born in January Girls born in December had a diagnosis percentage of and treatment more than ones born the following month Children who were born at the last days of a calendar year were reported to have significantly higher levels of diagnosis and treatment for ADHD than children born at the first days of a calendar year The studies suggest that ADHD diagnosis is prone to subjective analysis br A meta analysis by Storeb and colleagues and Ki ubakaran and colleagues perpetuated controversy and stigma in media reports by raising substantial doubts about the efficacy of methylphenidate for reducing symptoms of ADHD However that meta analysis used an idiosyncratic application of the Cochrane RoB for assessing evidence quality and made systematic errors that led to false results which furthermore were inadmissibly clinically interpreted The data summated in the International Consensus Statement on ADHD is clear methylphenidate is not only more efficacious than placebo it is among the most efficacious drugs in all of medicine br br br Research directions br br br Possible positive traits br Possible positive traits of ADHD are a new avenue of research and therefore limited br A review found that creativity may be associated with ADHD symptoms particularly divergent thinking and quantity of creative achievements but not with the disorder of ADHD itself i e it has not been found to be increased in people diagnosed with the disorder only in people with subclinical symptoms or those that possess traits associated with the disorder Divergent thinking is the ability to produce creative solutions which differ significantly from each other and consider the issue from multiple perspectives Those with ADHD symptoms could be advantaged in this form of creativity as they tend to have diffuse attention allowing rapid switching between aspects of the task under consideration flexible associative memory allowing them to remember and use more distantly related ideas which is associated with creativity and impulsivity which causes people with ADHD symptoms to consider ideas which others may not have However people with ADHD may struggle with convergent thinking which is a cognitive process through which a set of obviously relevant knowledge is utilised in a focused effort to arrive at a single perceived best solution to a problem br A article suggested that historical documentation supported Leonardo da Vinci s difficulties with procrastination and time management as characteristic of ADHD and that he was constantly on the go but often jumping from task to task br br br Possible biomarkers for diagnosis br Reviews of ADHD biomarkers have noted that platelet monoamine oxidase expression urinary norepinephrine urinary MHPG and urinary phenethylamine levels consistently differ between ADHD individuals and non ADHD controls These measurements could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ADHD but more research is needed to establish their diagnostic utility Urinary and blood plasma phenethylamine concentrations are lower in ADHD individuals relative to controls and the two most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD amphetamine and methylphenidate increase phenethylamine biosynthesis in treatment responsive individuals with ADHD Lower urinary phenethylamine concentrations are also associated with symptoms of inattentiveness in ADHD individuals br br br See also br Directed attention fatigue a
