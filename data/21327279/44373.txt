Triton Greek translit Tr t n is a Greek god of the sea the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite Triton lived with his parents in a golden palace on the bottom of the sea Later he is often depicted as having a conch shell he would blow like a trumpet br Triton is usually represented as a merman with the upper body of a human and the tailed lower body of a fish At some time during the Greek and Roman era Triton s became a generic term for a merman mermen in art and literature In English literature Triton is portrayed as the messenger or herald for the god Poseidon br Triton of Lake Tritonis of ancient Libya is a namesake mythical figure that appeared and aided the Argonauts Moreover according to Apollonius Rhodius he married the Oceanid of the said region Libya br br br Sea god br Triton was the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite according to Hesiod s Theogony He was the ruler possessor of the depths of the sea who is either dreadful or mighty according to the epithet given him by Hesiod br Triton dwelt with his parents in underwater golden palaces Poseidon s golden palace was located at Aegae on Euboea in one passage of Homer s Iliad br Unlike his father Poseidon who is always fully anthropomorphic in ancient art this has only changed in modern popular culture Triton s lower half is that of a fish while the top half is presented in a human figure br br Triton in later times became associated with possessing a conch shell which he blew like a trumpet to calm or raise the waves He was trumpeter and bugler to Oceanus and Poseidon Its sound was so cacophonous that when loudly blown it put the giants to flight who imagined it to be the roar of a dark wild beast br The original Greek Triton only sometimes bore a trident In literature Triton carries a trident in Accius s Medea fragment br Triton is sea hued according to Ovid and his shoulders barnacled with sea shells Ovid actually here calls Triton cerulean in color to choose a cognate rendering to the original language Latin caeruleus Ovid also includes Triton among other deities Proteus Aegaeon Doris of being this blue color with green viridis hair as well describing the steed Triton rides as cerulean br br br Libyan lake god br br There is also Triton the god of Lake Tritonis of Ancient Libya encountered by the Argonauts This Triton is treated as a separate deity in some references He had a different parentage as his father was Poseidon but his mother Europa according to the Greek writers of this episode br This Triton first appeared in the guise of Eurypylus before eventually revealing his divine nature This local deity has thus been euhemeristically rationalized as then ruler over Libya by Diodorus Siculus br Triton Eurypylus welcomed the Argonauts with a guest gift of a clod of earth which was a pledge that the Greeks would be granted the land of Cyrene Libya in the future The Argo had been driven ashore in the Syrtes Gulf of Syrtes Minor according to some and Triton guided them through the lake s marshy outlet back to the Mediterranean br One of the works which recounts this adventure is Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica rd century BC the first work in written literature that describes a Triton as fish tailed br br br Triton with men and heroes br br In Virgil s Aeneid book it is told that Triton killed Misenus son of Aeolus by drowning him after he challenged the gods to play as well as he did br br br Iconography of Triton duels br Herakles wrestling Triton is a common theme in Classical Greek art particularly black figure pottery but no literature survives that tells the story In fewer examples the Greek pottery depicting apparently the same motif are labeled Nereus or Old Man of the Sea instead and among these Nereus struggle with Herakles is attested in literature Pseudo Apollodorus Bibliotheca Old Man of the Sea is a generic term applicable to Nereus who was also frequently depicted as half fishlike One explanation is that some vase painters developed the convention of depicting Nereus as a fully human form so that Triton had to be substituted in the depiction of the sea monster wrestling Herakles And Nereus appears as a spectator in some examples of this motif br In the red figure period the Triton Herakles theme became completely outmoded supplanted by such scenes as Theseus s adventures in Poseidon s golden mansion embellished with the presence of Triton Again extant literature describing the adventure omits any mention of Triton but placement of Triton in the scene is not implausible br br br Further genealogy br br Triton was the father of a daughter named Pallas and foster parent to the goddess Athena according to Pseudo Apollodorus s Bibliotheca Elsewhere in the Bibliotheca there appears a different Pallas Giant a male figure overcome by Athena br Athena bears the epithet Tritogeneia Triton born and while this is suggestive of Triton s daughter being Athena the appellation is otherwise explainable in several ways e g as Athena s birth from Zeus s head taking place at the River Triton or Lake Tritonis br Triton also had a daughter named Triteia According to Pausanias writing in the nd century CE one origin story of the city of Triteia held that this was an eponymous city after Triteia founded by her and Ares s son named Melanippus Black Horse br br br Tritons br br At some time during the Greco Roman period Tritons in the plural came to be used a generic term for mermen br br br Hellenistic and Roman art br Greek pottery depicting a half human half fish being bearing an inscription of Triton is popular by the th century BC It has also been hypothesized that by this time Triton has become a generic term for a merman br Furthermore Tritons in groups or multitudes began to be depicted in Classical Greek art by around the th century BC Among these is the work by Greek sculptor Scopas d BC which was later removed to Rome The sirens of Homer s Odyssey were sometimes being depicted not as human headed birds but as tritonesses by around this time as seen in a bowl dated to the rd century BC and this is explained as a conflation with Odysseus s Scylla and Charybdis episode br Though not a contemporaneous inscription or commentary Pliny d CE commented on the work that there are Nereids riding on dolphins and also Tritons in this sculpture br In later Greek periods into the Roman period Tritons were depicted as ichthyocentaurs i e merman with a horse s forelegs in place of arms The earliest known examples are from the nd century BC The term Ichthyocentaur did not originate in Ancient Greece and only appeared in writing in the Byzantine period th century Centaur Triton is another word for a Triton with horse legs br br Besides examples in which the horse like forelimbs have been replaced by wings there are other examples where the forelegs have several clawed digits somewhat like lions as in one relief at the Glyptothek in Munich Germany A Triton with a lower extremity like a lobster or crayfish in a fresco unearthed from Herculanum has been mentioned br Double tailed tritons began to be depicted by the late nd century BC such as in the Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus Rumpf thought that might be the earliest example of a Triton with two fish tails Triton mit zwei Fischschw nzen However the double tailed tritonesses in Damophon s sculptures at Lycosura predates it and even this is doubted to be the first example Lattimore believed the two tailed triton should be dated to the th century BC and speculated that Skopas was the one to devise it br As aforementioned there is the female version of the half human half fishlike being sometimes called a tritoness or a female triton br br br Literature in the Roman period br br The first literary attestation of Tritons Latin Tr t n s in the plural was Virgil s Aeneid c BC In the st century CE another Latin poet Valerius Flaccus wrote in Argonautica that there was a huge Triton at each side of Neptune s chariot holding the reins of horses And Statius st century makes a Triton figurehead adorn the prow of the Argo br Trions and nereids appear as marine retinues Latin marinum obsequium to the goddess Venus in Apuleius s Metamorphoses or The Golden Ass br br br Pausanias br Tritons Greek romanized Tr t nes were described in detail in the nd century CE by Pausanias ix br br The Tritons have the following appearance On their heads they grow hair like that of marsh frogs Greek plants of the Ranunculus or buttercup genus not only in color but in the impossibility of separating one hair from another The rest of their body is rough with fine scales just as is the shark Under their ears they have gills and a man s nose but the mouth is broader and the teeth are those of a beast Their eyes seem to me blue and they have hands fingers and nails like the shells of the murex Under the breast and belly is a tail like a dolphin s instead of feet br Pausanias was basing his descriptions on a headless Triton exhibited in Tanagra and another curiosity in Rome These Tritons were preserved mummies or taxidermied real animals or humans or fabrication made to appear as such The Tanagran Triton was seen by Aelian who described it as an embalmed or stuffed mummy Greek While Pausanias related a legend around the Tanagran Triton that its head was cut off J G Frazer conjectured that such a cover story had to be invented after a sea mammal s carcass with a severed or severely mutilated head was passed off as a Triton br br br Renaissance br br Triton was referred to as trumpeter of Neptune Neptuni tubicen in Cristoforo Landino d s commentary on Virgil this phrasing later appeared in the gloss for Triton in Marius Nizolius s Thesaurus and Konrad Gesner s book br Triton makes appearance in English literature as the messenger for the god Poseidon In Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queene Triton blew his trompet shrill before Neptune and Amphitrite And in Milton Lycidas v The Herald of the Sea refers to Triton br Gianlorenzo Bernini sculpted the Neptune and Triton fountain now in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Triton Fountain in Bernini Square Rome There is differing opinion on what earlier works he may have drawn from near contemporary works or examples from antiquity He may have been influenced by Battista di Domenico Lorenzi s Alpheus and Arethusa or his Triton blowing the conch late s or Stoldo Lorenzi s Neptune fountain But Rudolf Wittkower has cautioned against exaggerating the influences of Florentine fountains It has been pointed out that Bernini had access to the Papal collection of genuine Greco Roman sculptures and worked with restoring ancient fragments although it is unclear if any Triton was among these It is within the realm of possibilities that Bernini might have used as his model the ancient Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus which does include Triton in its composition The Triton of this altar the Stoldo Lorenzi Triton and the Bernini Triton are all double tailed like a pair of human legs br br br Romantic era br In Wordsworth s sonnet The World Is Too Much with Us c published the poet regrets the prosaic humdrum modern world yearning for br br
