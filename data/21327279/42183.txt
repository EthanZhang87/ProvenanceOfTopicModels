In Greek mythology Chiron KY r n also Cheiron or Kheiron Ancient Greek romanized Khe r n lit hand was held to be the superlative centaur amongst his brethren since he was called the wisest and justest of all the centaurs br br br Biography br br Chiron was notable throughout Greek mythology for his youth nurturing nature His personal skills tend to match those of his foster father Apollo who taught the young centaur the art of medicine herbs music archery hunting gymnastics and prophecy and made him rise above his beastly nature Chiron was known for his knowledge and skill with medicine and thus was credited with the discovery of botany and pharmacy the science of herbs and medicine br Like satyrs centaurs were notorious for being wild lusty overly indulgent drinkers and carousers violent when intoxicated and generally uncultured delinquents Chiron by contrast was intelligent civilized and kind because he was not related directly to the other centaurs due to his parentage He was the son of the Titan Cronus and the Oceanid Philyra and thus possible brother to Dolops and Aphrus the ancestor and eponym of the Aphroi i e the native Africans Chiron lived predominantly on Mount Pelion there he married the nymph Chariclo who bore him three daughters Hippe also known as Melanippe meaning the black mare or Euippe good mare Ende s and Ocyrhoe and one son Carystus A different source also stated that his wife was called Nais while a certain Aristaeus was called his son br Like the other centaurs Chiron was later expelled by the Lapithae from his home but sacrifices were offered to him there by the Magnesians until a very late period and the family of the Cheironidae in that neighbourhood who were distinguished for their knowledge of medicine were regarded as his descendants br br br Physical appearance br br Although a centaur Chiron s physical appearance often differs somewhat from other centaurs demonstrating his status and heritage In traditional Greek representations of Chiron his front legs are human rather than equine This is in contrast to the traditional representation of centaurs which have the entire lower body of a horse This clearly sets Chiron apart from the other centaurs making him easily identifiable This difference may also have highlighted Chiron s unique lineage being the son of Cronus Chiron is often depicted carrying a branch with dead hares he has caught hanging from it Chiron is also often depicted wearing clothes demonstrating he is more civilised and unlike a normal centaur the only other occasional exceptions to this rule are the centaurs Nessus and Pholus br The Education of Achilles wall painting from the basilica in Herculaneum top right is one of the most common Roman depictions of Chiron as he teaches Achilles the lyre In this version we see Chiron with a fully equine lower body in contrast to the ancient Greek representations In addition to this reconfiguration Chiron s appearance is further altered with his ears Whereas previously human Chiron s ears now match those of a satyr folded over at the top This rendering creates a more bestial version of Chiron much more akin to a standard centaur It may be possible that due to the rise of written sources Roman artists were inspired by written descriptions of Chiron simply using the word centaur rather than having available traditional visual representations This may then not be a deliberate reworking of the Chiron myth on the part of the Romans but simply a lost nuance of the character in its migration from Greece to Rome As F Kelsey writes The Chiron of our painting has a body like that of the other centaurs but the prominence of the human element in his nature is no less marked he is the wise and gentle teacher the instructor of an art Chiron has retained an element of clothing and gained a laurel wreath suggesting the artist wished to portray nobility or even divinity more consistent with the traditional view It has also been suggested that this fresco is a reproduction of an actual statue in the Roman forum br br br Mythology br br br Early years br According to an archaic myth Chiron was sired by the Titan Cronus when he had taken the form of a horse and impregnated the nymph Philyra In another version his mother was the nymph Na s br Chiron s lineage was different from other centaurs who were born from Ixion consigned to a fiery wheel and Nephele cloud which in the Olympian telling Zeus invented to look like Hera br Soon after giving birth to Chiron Philyra abandoned her child out of shame and disgust Chiron effectively orphaned was later found by the god Apollo who took him under his wing and taught him the art of music lyre archery medicine and prophecy Apollo s twin sister Artemis trained him in archery and hunting Chiron s uniquely peaceful character kindness and intelligence are attributed to Apollo and Artemis br Some sources speculate that Chiron was originally a Thessalian god later subsumed into the Greek pantheon as a centaur br A great healer astrologer and respected oracle Chiron was said to be the first among centaurs and highly revered as a teacher and tutor Among his pupils were many culture heroes Asclepius Aristaeus Actaeon Achilles Jason Medus br There is also a persistent link with Peleus throughout Chiron s myth This can be explained that the latter was the grandfather of Peleus through his daughter Endeis who married the king of Aegina Aeacus Chiron saved the life of Peleus when Acastus tried to kill him by taking his sword and leaving him out in the woods to be slaughtered by the centaurs Chiron retrieved the sword for Peleus Chiron then explained to Peleus how to capture the nymph Thetis leading to their marriage br Chiron is also connected with the story of the Argonauts whom he received kindly when they came to his residence on their voyage for many of the heroes were his friends and pupils br br br Students br br Chiron was a renowned mentor and brought up some future heroes such as br br Achilles The son of the Argonaut Peleus and the Nereid Thetis Peleus had a friendly relationship with Chiron who had already saved him from Acastus and a band of murderous centaurs and later restored the sight of Phoenix a blind friend of Peleus When Achilles was old enough Peleus brought him to Chiron who received him as a disciple and fed him the innards of lions and boars and bear marrow In some accounts Achilles was previously called Ligyron and Chiron gave him his new name Later in his life Achilles taught Patroclus what Chiron had taught him including the medical arts br Aristaeus Although his mother Cyrene lived in Libya Aristaeus father Apollo brought him on Mount Pelion to be reared by Chiron Aristaeus would later become in his life a god of certain rustic arts such as beekeeping and cheesemaking Moreover he is the protagonist of a creation myth regarding the Etesian winds br Actaeon The son of Autono and Aristeus an aforementioned student of Chiron He became an excellent hunter thanks to the centaur s lessons In his adulthood as he was hunting in the woods he saw the virgin goddess Artemis bathing She punished Actaeon for seeing her naked body by turning him into a stag His hunting dogs did not recognize him and devoured him Ignorant of what they had done the hunting dogs came to the cave of Chiron seeking their master and the Centaur fashioned an image of Actaeon in order to soothe their grief br Asclepius The Greek God of Doctors Artemis killed Asclepius mother Coronis after her lover Apollo discovered she was cheating on him But Coronis had conceived a son to him and before her body had been consumed by the funerary pyre he saved the child Asclepius and brought him to Chiron who reared him and taught him the art of healing When Chiron s daughter Ocyrhoe saw him she prophesied his destiny and death Because of this Zeus turned her into a mare In fact Asclepius would later die because of his hubris he had become such a skilled medic he could resurrect the dead and Zeus would end up killing him for this after getting a complaint from Hades Though Zeus would later revive him as a God to avoid any feuds with Apollo br Jason The leader of the Argonauts was in some versions raised by Chiron Jason s father Aeson had been locked up by his brother Pelias yet he managed to conceive a son with a woman named Alcimede When Alcimede delivered Jason she pretended he was a stillborn to escape Pelias notice and then gave him to Chiron Jason s son Medus will also become one of the centaur s students br Medus Alternatively called Medeus or Polyxenus his mother was Medea but accounts differ about his father who may be either Jason an Asian king or Aegeus of Athens Just like his father he was reared by Chiron Later in his life he would become the first king of the Medes br Patroclus is also numbered amongst the students by Statius a roman poet of the st century AD in his unfinished work the Achilleid although Homer clearly contradicts him br According to Ptolemy Hephaestion probably the same as Ptolemaeus Chennus a writer and playwright whose works are now lost Chiron was also the mentor of the god Dionysus who became the centaur s eromenos and learned from him chants and dances and of a youth named Cocytus the latter supposedly cured Adonis when he was wounded by a wild boar using the medical techniques learned from his teacher It is worthy of note that Ptolemy s account only survived thanks to Photios I s summary of his works Photios I an ecumenical patriarch of the th century AD harshly criticized Ptolemy denouncing him for seemingly distorting inventing and misinterpreting myths Considering little is known about Ptolemy and his works are not preserved it is unknown whether he was simply reporting alternative versions of myths or making them up br br br Death br br His nobility is further reflected in the story of his death as Prometheus sacrificed his life allowing mankind to obtain the use of fire As the son of Cronus he was immortal so it was left to Heracles to arrange a bargain with Zeus to exchange Chiron s immortality for the life of Prometheus who had been chained to a rock where an eagle pecked out his regenerating liver for his transgressions Chiron was pierced with an arrow belonging to Heracles that had been treated with the blood of the Hydra or in other versions poison that Chiron had given to the hero when he had been under the honorable centaur s tutelage According to a Scholium on Theocritus this had taken place during the visit of Heracles to the cave of Pholus on Mount Pelion in Thessaly during his fourth labour defeating the Erymanthian Boar While they were at supper Heracles asked for some wine to accompany his meal Pholus who ate his food raw was taken aback He had been given a vessel of sacred wine by Dionysus sometime earlier to be kept in trust by the centaurs until the right time for its opening At Heracles prompting Pholus was forced to produce the vessel of sacred wine The hero gasping for wine grabbed it from him and forced it open Thereupon the vapors of the sacred wine wafted out of the cave and intoxicated the wild centaurs led by Nessus who had gathered outside They attacked with stones and fir trees the cave which was located in the neighbourhood of Malea Heracles was forced to shoot many arrows poisoned with the blood of the Hydra to drive them back During the assault Chiron was hit in the thigh by one of the poisoned arrows After the centaurs had fled Pholus emerged from the cave to observe the destruction Being of a philosophical frame of mind he pulled one of the arrows from the body of a dead centaur and wondered how such a little thing as an arrow could have caused so much death and destruction In that instant he let slip the arrow from his hand and it dropped and hit him in the hoof killing him instantly This however is open to controversy because Pholus shared the civilized centaur form with Chiron in some art images and thus would have been immortal br Ironically Chiron the master of the healing arts could not heal himself and willingly gave up his immortality For this reason his half brother Zeus took pity on him and thus placed him among the stars in the sky to be honored The Greeks identified him as the constellation Centaurus br In Ovid s poem Fasti Ovid has the hero Hercules visiting Chiron s home on Pelion while the child Achilles is there While Chiron is examining Hercules weapons one of the arrows dipped in Lernaean hydra venom falls on Chiron s left foot and poisons him br br And while the old man fingered the shafts clotted with poison one of the arrows fell out of the quiver and stuck in his left foot Chiron groaned and drew the steel from his body br Chiron then tries to use herbs to heal himself but fails After nine days with a weeping Achilles looking on Chiron passes into the stars becoming a constellation br br br The Precepts of Chiron br br A didactic poem Precepts of Chiron has been lost However fragments in heroic hexameters that survive in quotations are considered to belong to it The common thread in the fragments which may reflect in some degree the Acharnian image of Chiron and his teaching is that it is expository rather than narrative and suggests that rather than recounting the inspiring events of archaic times as men like Nestor or Glaucus might do Chiron taught the primeval ways of mankind the gods and nature beginning with the caution First whenever you come to your house offer good sacrifices to the eternal gods br br br Statius Achilleid br br The Achilleid was to be an epic poem on the life of Achilles However its author Statius died during the writing of the second book late in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Domitian The Achilleid shows the relationship between Chiron and his charge Achilles During Book One the close relationship between Chiron and Achilles is made clear when Thetis spends the evening with them in Chiron s cave on Mount Pelion before leaving with Achilles Chiron is shown in a paternal capacity rather than that of merely a teacher and is depicted as far from animal Night draws to slumber The huge Centaur collapses on stone and Achilles fondly twines himself about his shoulders though his mother is there preferring the familiar bosom Here Statius is showing a loving relationship between the two characters which the traditional view of Chiron never explored Later when describing what he ate when growing up Achilles refers to Chiron as a parent thus that father of mine used to feed me the Latin used here is pater so we may judge this an accurate translation This further demonstrates the nature of the loving relationship between Chiron and Achilles Statius here may be continuing a theme started by Ovid in Fasti several years earlier br In Fasti on Chiron s death Achilles says Live I beg you don t leave me dear father pater this would suggest that in Rome the reconfiguration of Chiron s myth was as a loving and loved foster parent rather than simply teacher Chiron s relationship with his pupil is used to demonstrate a Roman longing for the father son relationship br br In addition to Chiron s loving characteristics developed in Book One Book Two of The Achilleid has Achilles describe many tasks Chiron would make him perform during his heroic education including standing in fast flowing rivers I stood but the angry river and the mist of his broad rush took me back He bore down on me with savage threats and scolded to shame me I did not leave till ordered There is a clear contrast here in the hardship and insults Chiron is directing at his pupil compared to his previous kindness However this duality can be seen as a demonstration of a traditional Roman education especially a noble one learning both military and refined arts Centaurs in antiquity were often remembered for their battle with the Lapiths Statius deliberately disassociates Chiron from this story with his description of Chiron s cave on Pelion Here are no darts that have tasted human blood no ash trees fractured in festive combats nor mixing bowls shattered upon kindred foes Instead of combat the emphasis is that Chiron s weapons are only used for hunting and there are no signs of savage behaviour In addition to Achilles descriptions of the physical lessons Chiron gives him he also refers to a more cultured education He fixed in my mind the precepts of sacred justice Statius creates an image of Chiron that is not only a loving father but a strict and wise teacher disassociated with the bestial aspects of centaurs br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
