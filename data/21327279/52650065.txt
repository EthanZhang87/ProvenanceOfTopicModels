social issues gender fluidity disability and race and religion calling the book a surefire hit Kirkus Reviews gave The Hammer of Thor a starred review and praised the interposed religious and sexual complexity in the Norse mythological world introduced using characters such as Alex and Samirah while also writing that Magnus is a distinct character when compared with Riordan s other protagonists Hypable praised the depth of the storyline the characters diversity particularly Alex Fierro and the familial love between the characters br Todd Kleiboer of The East Texan the student newspaper of Texas A M University Commerce claimed that although Riordan does well to include such diverse characters as the Muslim Samirah and genderfluid Alex the author runs the risk of making his readers believe such characters are representative of their group by portraying only one example of each type of person He continues Young adult readers may have no contact with the Muslim or transgender population outside of literature and most will take Samirah or Alex as representatives However Riordan counters this by portraying characters that do not fall into stereotypes and perhaps illuminate the diversity of people on Midgard or Earth br Despite the praise for Riordan s new diversity reviewers criticized other aspects of the novel Claire Yu of the Central Times said in her review I want to thank Rick Riordan for giving us such a diverse set of characters and how he emphasizes on the importance of other cultures but also said she feels the special something of Riordan s typical humor writing is missing from the book She calls the plot repetitive and not filled with the same energy and vigour as its predecessors Fantasy Literature similarly praised the book s sensitive approach to delicate issues and its continuation of Riordan s humorous style but criticized the book for its small part in expanding the over reaching plot of the series Common Sense Media which gave the book four stars out of five praised the continued inclusion of diverse characters and storylines but criticized the lack of character development for Magnus br The Hammer of Thor won the Stonewall Book Award for Children s Literature which are granted to works of merit for children or teenagers relating to LGBTQ experience The award was granted for the depiction of the genderfluid teenage character Alex Fierro When asked about his decision to include Alex Riordan said There s lots of kinds of kids out there and my feeling is that all of them deserve to be able to see themselves in stories An official announcement by the American Library Association said Alex is a hero and represents the expansive possibilities of gender for future generations The novel was also nominated for Best Middle Grade Children s Book of in the Goodreads Choice Awards and ended in third place behind The Hidden Oracle another book by Riordan and Pax br br br Sequel br br The sequel The Ship of the Dead was
