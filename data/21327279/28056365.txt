and origins br After realizing how many Greek and Roman myths he had left untouched as well the immense success of the original series Riordan began writing a second series using inspiration for his storyline from experiences that he and his children had while playing video and role playing games such as World of Warcraft and Scion After creating the storyline Riordan created three new main characters Jason Piper and Leo but continued to use the previous main characters such as Annabeth and Grover as secondary characters br br Unlike the Percy Jackson the Olympians series which uses first person narration solely from Percy s point of view the second series is told in third person with the point of view alternating between various main characters In The Lost Hero those characters are Jason Piper and Leo Although initially uncertain how fans would react Riordan later found that they enjoyed the new format as it allowed them to learn more about each character br Riordan says that It was my way of letting them revisit that world in a fresh twist but also to catch up with Percy and Annabeth and the rest of the gang from the first series He also decided to include the Roman gods after many readers requested that Riordan write a new series on Roman gods who are the Roman equivalent of the Greek gods with some minor changes in personality He pondered on how the Roman aspect of the gods would be after moving from Greece to Rome to America After a while playing with that idea gave me the idea for the new series br br br Publishing history br The Lost Hero the first
