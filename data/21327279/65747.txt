Praetor PREE t r Classical Latin prae t r also pretor was the title granted by the government of ancient Rome to a man acting in one of two official capacities i the commander of an army and ii as an elected magistratus magistrate assigned to discharge various duties The functions of the magistracy the praetura praetorship are described by the adjective itself the praetoria potestas praetorian power the praetorium imperium praetorian authority and the praetorium ius praetorian law the legal precedents established by the praetores praetors Praetorium as a substantive denoted the location from which the praetor exercised his authority either the headquarters of his castra the courthouse tribunal of his judiciary or the city hall of his provincial governorship The minimum age for holding the praetorship was during the Roman Republic but it was later changed to in the early Empire br br br History of the title br The status of the praetor in the early republic is unclear The traditional account from Livy claims that the praetorship was created by the Sextian Licinian Rogations in BC but it was well known both to Livy and other Romans in the late republic that the chief magistrates were first called praetor For example Festus refers to the praetors who are now consuls br The form of the republic changed substantially over its history and the accounts of the republic s development in the early imperial period are marred with anachronisms projecting then current practices into the past In the earliest periods of the republic praetor may not have meant anything more than leader in the most basic sense deriving from praeire to proceed or praeesse to be preeminent These early praetors may have simply been clan leaders leading military forces privately and free from state control with a multitude of private leaders leading private armies br These early military leaders were eventually institutionalised into fixed magistrate bodies elected by the people with clear state control over military activities This was also probably assisted by the use of recuperatores to mediate disputes and fetial priests to control the declaration of war The effect to make it more difficult for private individuals to start wars against Rome s neighbours Reforms in BC also may have required for the first time that all military commanders be confirmed by a popular assembly representing the Roman people br The emergence of the classical praetorship was a long process that had been underway by BC This was when the Sextian Licinian Rogations were passed giving the Roman people substantially more power over the selection of their military commanders While Livy claims that the rogations created the praetorship in BC to relieve the consuls of their judicial responsibilities few modern historians would accept this account as written Beyond the ancient knowledge that a title of praetor dated to the beginning of the republic what became the classical praetorship was initially a military office with imperium and virtually identical in authority and capacity to the consulship Furthermore a fully formed praetorship without colleague as Livy s account implies would be a tremendous violation of Roman practice in which all regular magistracies were created in colleges consisting of at least two br Scholars increasingly view the rogations as establishing a college of three and only three praetors two of whom eventually developed into the historical consuls What became the classical praetorship in its early years also was not viewed as being less than the consuls as it was common practice for men to hold the praetorship after a consulship since doing so was simply a method of holding imperium for a second year br Livy reports that until BC the praetor was chosen only from among the patricians In that year eligibility for the praetura was opened to the plebeians and one of them Quintus Publilius Philo won the office br Only in the years after the election of three military leaders did a clear distinction emerge between what became the consuls and what became the praetors due to the normal Roman practice to reserve one commander in or near the city for purposes of defence and eventually for civilian administration The glory and prestige won by the praetors fighting foreign wars then still in Italy is what led to the higher prestige of the consulship Only in BC with the passage of the lex Villia annalis was holding the praetorship after the consulship prohibited Even after the consulship emerged from the praetorship with higher prestige and desirability praetorian imperium was still not legally distinct or inferior to consular imperium until the very end of the republic br Starting in BC praetors started to be prorogued allowing former praetors to act in the place of a praetor ie pro praetore with power only to conduct war in his assigned provincia with no other concerns or duties Prorogation in effect granted private individuals a legally fictitious power to act in the place of the normal magistrates allowing them to continue to act within their assigned task provincia Prorogation allowed a magistrate whose imperium did not expire with his term until crossing the pomerium or being stripped by the people to continue in his assigned task or provincia br br br Praetura br The elected praetor was a curule magistrate exercised imperium and consequently was one of the magistratus majores He had the right to sit in the sella curulis and wear the toga praetexta He was attended by six lictors A praetor was a magistrate with imperium within his own sphere subject only to the veto of the consuls who outranked him br The potestas and imperium power and authority of the consuls and the praetors under the Republic should not be exaggerated They did not use independent judgment in resolving matters of state Unlike today s executive branches they were assigned high level tasks directly by senatorial decree under the authority of the SPQR br Livy describes the assignments given to either consuls or praetors in some detail As magistrates they had standing duties to perform especially of a religious nature However a consul or praetor could be taken away from his current duties at any time to head a task force and there were many especially military Livy mentions that among other tasks these executive officers were told to lead troops against perceived threats domestic or foreign investigate possible subversion raise troops conduct special sacrifices distribute windfall money appoint commissioners and even exterminate locusts Praetors could delegate at will The one principle that limited what could be assigned to them was that their duties must not concern them with minima little things They were by definition doers of maxima This principle of Roman law became a principle of later European law Non curat minima praetor that is the details do not need to be legislated they can be left up to the courts br br br Praetors and their duties br br br Republican br A second praetorship was created around BC more clearly separating this office from that of the consulship There were two reasons for this to relieve the weight of judicial business and to give the Republic a magistrate with imperium who could field an army in an emergency when both consuls were fighting a far off war br br br Praetor peregrinus br By the end of the First Punic War a fourth magistrate entitled to hold imperium appears the praetor qui inter peregrinos ius dicit the praetor who administers justice among foreigners Although in the later Empire the office was titled praetor inter cives et peregrinos among citizens and foreigners that is having jurisdiction in disputes between citizens and noncitizens by the time of the rd century BC Rome s territorial annexations and foreign populations were unlikely to require a new office dedicated solely to this task T Corey Brennan in his two volume study of the praetorship argues that during the military crisis of the s the second praetorship was created to make another holder of imperium available for command and provincial administration inter peregrinos During the Hannibalic War the praetor peregrinus was frequently absent from Rome on special missions The urban praetor more often remained in the city to administer the judicial system br br br Praetor urbanus br The praetor urbanus presided in civil cases between citizens The Senate required that some senior officer remain in Rome at all times This duty now fell to the praetor urbanus In the absence of the consuls he was the senior magistrate of the city with the power to summon the Senate and to organize the defense of the city in the event of an attack He was not allowed to leave the city for more than ten days at a time He was therefore given appropriate duties in Rome He superintended the Ludi Apollinares and was also the chief magistrate for the administration of justice and promulgated the Praetor s Edict These Edicts were statements of praetor s policy as to judicial decisions to be made during his term of office The praetor had substantial discretion regarding his Edict but could not legislate In a sense the continuing Edicts came to form a corpus of precedents The development and improvement of Roman Law owes much to the wise use of this praetorial discretion br br br Additional praetors br br The expansion of Roman authority over other lands required the addition of praetors Two were created in BC for the administration of Sicily and Sardinia and two more when the two Hispanic provinces were formed in BC The dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla transferred administration of the provinces to former consuls and praetors simultaneously increasing the number of praetors elected each year to eight as part of his constitutional reforms Julius Caesar raised the number to ten then fourteen and finally to sixteen br br br Imperial br Augustus made changes that were designed to reduce the Praetor to being an imperial administrator rather than a magistrate The electoral body was changed to the Senate which was now an instrument of imperial ratification To take a very simplistic view the establishment of the principate can be seen as the restoration of monarchy under another name The Emperor therefore assumed the powers once held by the kings but he used the apparatus of the republic to exercise them For example the emperor presided over the highest courts of appeal br The need for administrators remained just as acute After several changes Augustus fixed the number at twelve Under Tiberius there were sixteen As imperial administrators their duties extended to matters that the republic would have considered minima Two praetors were appointed by Claudius for matters relating to Fideicommissa trusts when the business in that department of the law had become considerable but Titus reduced the number to one and Nerva added a Praetor for the decision of matters between the fiscus treasury and individuals Marcus Aurelius appointed a Praetor for matters relating to tutela guardianship br br br Praetors as judges br Roman court cases fell into the two broad categories of civil or criminal trials The involvement of a Praetor in either was as follows br br br Actions br In an actio which was civil the Praetor could either issue an interdictum interdict forbidding some circumstance or appoint a iudex judge Proceedings before the praetor were technically said to be in iure At this stage the Praetor would establish a formula directing the iudex as to the remedy to be given if he found that certain circumstances were satisfied for instance Let X be iudex If it appears that the defendant ought to pay sesterces to the plaintiff let the iudex condemn the defendant to pay sesterces to the plaintiff If it does not so appear let the plaintiff absolve him After they were handed over to the iudex they were no longer in iure before the Praetor but apud iudicem The iudicium of the iudex was binding By the time of Diocletian however this two stage process had largely disappeared and the Praetor would either hear the whole case in person or appoint a delegate a iudex pedaneus taking steps for the enforcement of the decision the formula was replaced by an informal system of pleadings br During the time of the Roman Republic the Urban Praetor allegedly issued an annual edict usually on the advice of jurists since the Praetor himself was not necessarily educated in the law setting out the circumstances under which he would grant remedies The legal provisions arising from the Praetor s Edict were known as ius honorarium in theory the Praetor did not have power to alter the law but in practice the Edict altered the rights and duties of individuals and was effectively a legislative document In the reign of Hadrian however the terms of the Edict were made permanent and the Praetor s de facto legislative role was abolished br br br Quaestiones perpetuae br The Praetors also presided at the quaestiones perpetuae which were criminal proceedings so called because they were of certain types with a Praetor being assigned to one type on a permanent basis The Praetors appointed judges who acted as jurors in voting for guilt or innocence The verdict was either acquittal or condemnation br These quaestiones looked into crimina publica crimes against the public such as were worthy of the attention of a Praetor The penalty on conviction was usually death but sometimes other severe penalties were used In the late Republic the public crimes were br br Repetundae br Ambitus br Majestas br Peculatus br Falsum br De Sicariis et Veneficis br De Patricidis br The last three were added by the Dictator Sulla in the early st century BC br br br Outdoor actions br When the Praetor administered justice in a tribunal he sat on a sella curulis which was that part of the court reserved for the Praetor and his assessors and friends as opposed to the subsellia the part occupied by the iudices judges and others who were present In court the Praetor was referred to as acting e tribunali or ex superiore loco lit from a raised platform or from a higher place but he could also perform ministerial acts out of court in which case he was said to be acting e plano or ex aequo loco lit from the flat ground or from an equal or level place For instance he could in certain cases give validity to the act of manumission when he was out of doors such as on his way to the bath or to the theatre br br br Later Roman era br By AD the praetors responsibilities had been reduced to a purely municipal role Their sole duty was to manage the spending of money on the exhibition of games or on public works However with the decline of the other traditional Roman offices such as that of tribune the praetorship remained an important portal through which aristocrats could gain access to either the Western or Eastern senates The praetorship was a costly position to hold as praetors were expected to possess a treasury from which they could draw funds for their municipal duties br br br Byzantine Empire br Like many other Roman institutions the praetor Greek prait r survived in the Eastern Roman Empire br Emperor Justinian I r undertook a major administrative reform beginning in which involved the reunification of civil and military authority in the hands of the governor in certain provinces and the abolition of the dioceses The Diocese of Thrace had already been abolished by the end of the th century by Anastasius and its vicarius became the new praetor Justinianus of Thrace with authority over all the former Thracian provinces except for Lower Moesia and Scythia Minor which became part of the quaestura exercitus Similarly the governors of Pisidia and Lycaonia as well as Paphlagonia enlarged by merging it with Honorias were upgraded to praetores Justiniani and received the rank of vir spectabilis In addition in Constantinople he replaced the praefectus vigilum who was hitherto responsible for security by a praetor populi in Greek prait r t n d m n with wide ranging police powers br In the early th century the prait r was a junior administrative official in the themata subordinate to the governing strat gos Gradually however the civil functionaries assumed greater power and by the late th century the praitores or kritai judges were placed at the head of the civil administration of a thema This division of civil and military duties was often abandoned in the th century when the posts of civil prait r and military doux were frequently held in tandem The provincial post fell out of use after the collapse of the Empire in br According to Helene Ahrweiler Emperor Nikephoros II r reinstituted a praetor in Constantinople as a high ranking judge He is possibly identical to the Palaiologan era post of the prait r tou dem u whose holders are attested until According to the Book of Offices of pseudo Kodinos compiled around the same time the prait r tou dem u occupied the th place in the imperial hierarchy between the megas tzaousios and the logothet s t n oikeiak n but held no official function His court uniform consisted of a gold brocaded hat skiadion a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a plain smooth wooden staff dikanikion br br br Modern era br Classical Latin Praetor became medieval Latin Pretor Praetura Pretura etc During the interwar period the counties of Romania were divided into a various numbers of pl i singular plas headed by a Pretor appointed by the Prefect The institution headed by the Pretor was called Pretur Currently this office has survived only in the Republic of Moldova where praetors are the heads of Chi in u s
