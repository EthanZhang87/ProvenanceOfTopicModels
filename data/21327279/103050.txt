In Greek mythology Iapetus eye AP ih t s Ancient Greek romanized Iapet s also Japetus is a Titan the son of Uranus and Gaia and father of Atlas Prometheus Epimetheus and Menoetius He was also called the father of Buphagus and Anchiale in other sources br Iapetus was linked to Japheth Hebrew one of the sons of Noah and a progenitor of mankind in biblical accounts The practice by early historians and biblical scholars of identifying various historical nations and ethnic groups as descendants of Japheth together with the similarity of their names led to a fusion of their identities from the early modern period to the present br br br Mythology br Iapetus the Piercer is the one Titan mentioned by Homer in the Iliad as being in Tartarus with Cronus He is a brother of Cronus who ruled the world during the Golden Age but is now locked up in Tartarus along with Iapetus where neither breeze nor light of the sun reaches them br Iapetus wife is usually described as a daughter of Oceanus and Tethys named either Clymene according to Hesiod and Hyginus or Asia according to Apollodorus br In Hesiod s Works and Days Prometheus is addressed as son of Iapetus and no mother is named However in Hesiod s Theogony Clymene is listed as Iapetus wife and the mother of Prometheus In Aeschylus s play Prometheus Bound Prometheus is son of the goddess Themis with no father named but still with at least Atlas as a brother However in Horace s Odes in Ode Horace writes audax Iapeti genus Ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit The bold offspring of Iapetus i e Prometheus brought fire to peoples by wicked deceit br Hesiod and other Greek scholars regarded the sons of Iapetus as mankind s ancestors and as such some of humanity s worst qualities were said to have been inherited from these four gods each of whom were described with a particular moral fault that often led to their own downfall For instance sly and clever Prometheus could perhaps represent crafty scheming the inept and guileless Epimetheus foolish stupidity the enduring strongest and powerful Atlas excessive daring and the arrogant Menoetius rash violence br Iapetus as the progenitor of mankind has been equated with Japheth the son of Noah based on the similarity of their names and the tradition reported by Josephus Antiquities of the Jews which made Japheth the ancestor of the Japhetites i e the Indo European speaking peoples Iapetus was linked to Japheth by th century theologian Matthew Poole and more recently by Robert Graves and by John Pairman Brown br br br Genealogy br br br Notes br br br br
