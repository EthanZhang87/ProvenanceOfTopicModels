head to the docks at the nearby fictional city of San Alejandro for their end of year trials on board the school yacht the Varuna named for Varuna the Hindu god of the sea which will determine their future at the school The trials are supervised by Dr Theodosius Hewett their elderly Theoretical Marine Science teacher br Shortly after leaving the campus Ana and her classmates see torpedoes fired from a submarine at the base of the bluff on which their school sits collapsing the buildings into the ocean Dr Hewett after launching drones to survey the wreckage orders the freshmen back onto the bus then onto the Varuna and out to sea telling them that this is the work of a rival school Land Institute and that it is better for their own safety if the world believes them dead as well He

The abduction is foiled with the aid of a friendly bottlenose dolphin Ana named Socrates who knocks her would be abductor Caleb South out of the water When interrogated Caleb proudly admits that he and his classmates destroyed Harding Pencroft and says that they were protecting the legacy of an outlaw and selfishly hoarding technology that could greatly benefit the world Hewett has him thrown overboard in his flotation vest and wet suit plus water wings which are a form of hazing for inept students at Harding Pencroft to join his classmates who have been set adrift in a pontoon with their hands bound br Hewett explains to Ana and her classmates that Jules Verne s novels Leagues Under the Seas and The Mysterious Island are actually somewhat fictionalized accounts of real events based on interviews Verne conducted with real people involved in these events and that Ana is descended from Captain Nemo Prince Dakkar of Bundelkhand Hewett tells them that Nemo was a genius who developed technology far ahead of his time and Harding Pencroft Academy and Land Institute have been battling over this technology ever since then and their rivalry has now erupted into actual warfare In Nemo s submarine the Nautilus he waged a guerrilla war on the colonial powers of the late th century seeking their destruction as vengeance for the murder of his wife and eldest son by the British following his participation in the Indian Rebellion of against British rule br After Pierre Aronnax Ned Land and Aronnax s servant Conseil escaped Captain Nemo they founded Land Institute in an attempt to save the world order from Nemo by acquiring or duplicating his inventions and technology Cyrus Harding and Bonaventure Pencroft whose encounter with Nemo was described in The Mysterious Island told their story to Verne in an attempt to change Nemo s image and protect his legacy and founded Harding Pencroft Academy in accordance with Nemo s last wish that his inventions not be misused for greed and power by the world s governments and corporations or by Land Institute br The freshman trials were intended to be the ninth graders introduction to Nemo s technology but Hewett feels that under the circumstances he must now tell them everything Ana s friend and classmate Ester Harding an orphan who is Cyrus Harding s fourth great granddaughter had been given the information months before but was sworn to secrecy by the Harding Pencroft Academy board of trustees under penalty of disinheritance Long before the development of modern genetic science Captain Nemo had learned how to biometrically link his greatest inventions to his own genes so that they might only be operated by himself or his direct descendants which means that only Ana who is Captain Nemo s fourth great granddaughter and it is believed last surviving direct descendant may now operate them br Unbeknownst to the students Hewett is suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer and he is found comatose in his cabin on the morning of their second day at sea Ana takes command of the Varuna and uses one of Nemo s inventions to determine their destination a remote uncharted Pacific atoll named Lincoln Island where Cyrus Harding Bonaventure Pencroft and their companions were marooned and where Captain Nemo died aboard the Nautilus Along the way they learn from data extracted from the drones Hewett launched after the school s destruction that Dev had broadcast a warning over its public address system to evacuate In order to approach Lincoln Island which is heavily defended and concealed from detection by a cloaking device they must decipher a code transmitted to them by Lincoln Island staff and send back a similarly coded message br Upon their arrival at Lincoln Island they are greeted by the island s caretakers a couple named Luca Barsanti who is descended from the Italian inventor Eugenio Barsanti and his wife Ophelia Artemesia and Jupiter an orangutan who has learned to cook by watching The Great British Bake Off and quite well the students discover Dr Hewett begins to receive treatment with Captain Nemo s medical technology Luca and Ophelia introduce the students to the Nautilus which save for some relatively minor internal water damage is almost intact after sitting dormant at the bottom of a nearby lagoon for approximately years after Captain Nemo died in the command chair br Ana learns that the Nautilus is a specimen of artificial intelligence so advanced as to be sentient and that Ana s parents who died shortly before she entered eighth grade discovered the Nautilus and were electrocuted in a rash attempt to board it Ana boards it without incident by introducing herself and asking for permission speaking in her and Captain Nemo s ancestral language of Bundeli She then awakens the ship s advanced functions by playing a pipe organ Captain Nemo had installed on the bridge br Ana and her classmates exploration of the Nautilus is suddenly interrupted by the discovery that the Land Institute seniors who attacked their school have followed them to Lincoln Island in their submarine the Aronnax and a battle ensues During the battle Ana and the others discover to their horror that her brother Dev has turned traitor and is collaborating with Land Institute and is commanding the Aronnax from which he had broadcast the warning to evacuate after Harding Pencroft Academy s defenses had been hacked and brought down Ana discovers that Dev has hidden a tracking device in the necklace he gave her and immediately destroys it then uses the Nautilus s advanced propulsion systems to flee br Two hours later they find themselves in the western Pacific approximately miles east of Davao City Philippines near the Palau Trench west of Koror City Palau There while making repairs on the Nautilus they meet a giant octopus the crew names Romeo Ana befriends him with the help of a keytar and the Nautilus artificial intelligence They speed back to Lincoln Island where a battle with the Aronnax immediately ensues The battle ends with the Aronnax broken to pieces by the giant octopus and its crew plucked from the ocean and locked up in improvised jail cells and a brawl between Ana and Dev which ends with her knocking him unconscious by shooting him with rubber bullets br The novel ends with the Harding Pencroft ninth graders Luca and Ophelia and a recovering Dr
