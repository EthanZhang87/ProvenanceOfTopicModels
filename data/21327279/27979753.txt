Riordan the idea for The Kane Chronicles series came from his realization that the only ancient history subject more popular than Ancient Greece was that of Ancient Egypt He had already written and published several books in the Percy Jackson the Olympians series which dealt with the interaction between Greek mythology and the modern world The idea of having two multiracial siblings narrate the book also came from his experience as a teacher Carter and Sadie Kane the titular characters were inspired by two siblings he taught as well as the fact that Ancient Egypt was a multicultural society br In an interview with Publishers Weekly at the BEA Show where Riordan signed copies of the novel he said that Ancient Egypt fascinates kids He did extensive research so that The magic the spells the shabti are all grounded in reality In another interview Riordan objected to the longstanding Western tradition of separating Egyptian history from the history of other African societies saying it was important to firmly put Egypt back into the realm of African history The Red Pyramid was the first time Riordan used alternating points of view because it was very important that both genders have protagonists they can identify with br br br Release br The Red Pyramid had a first printing of one million copies The series was planned to consist of one book per year to build anticipation The
