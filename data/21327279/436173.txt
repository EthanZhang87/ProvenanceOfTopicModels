Ogygia Ancient Greek romanized gyg y or gyg y a is an island mentioned in Homer s Odyssey Book V as the home of the nymph Calypso the daughter of the Titan Atlas In Homer s Odyssey Calypso detained Odysseus on Ogygia for seven years and kept him from returning to his home of Ithaca wanting to marry him br Athena complained about Calypso s actions to Zeus who sent the messenger Hermes to Ogygia to order Calypso to release Odysseus Hermes is Odysseus s great grandfather on his mother s side through Autolycos Calypso finally though reluctantly instructed Odysseus to build a small raft gave him food and wine and let him depart the island br The Odyssey describes Ogygia as follows br br and he Hermes found her within A great fire was burning in the hearth and from afar over the isle there was a fragrance of cleft cedar and juniper as they burned But she within was singing with a sweet voice as she went to and fro before the loom weaving with a golden shuttle Round about the cave grew a luxuriant wood alder and poplar and sweet smelling cypress wherein birds long of wing were wont to nest owls and falcons and sea crows with chattering tongues who ply their business on the sea And right there about the hollow cave ran trailing a garden vine in pride of its prime richly laden with clusters And fountains four in a row were flowing with bright water hard by one another turned one this way one that And round about soft meadows of violets and parsley were blooming br br br Location br br Ogygia or Phaeacia has been associated with the putative sunken Atlantis A long standing tradition begun by Euhemerus in the late th century BC and supported by Callimachus endorsed by modern Maltese tradition identifies Ogygia with the island of Gozo the second largest island in the Maltese archipelago br Aeschylus calls the Nile Ogygian and Eustathius the Byzantine grammarian said that Ogygia was the earliest name for Egypt while other suggested locations for Ogygia include the Ionian Sea br br Maps of historians and geographers like Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d Anville Philipp Cl ver Petrus Bertius and Aaron Arrowsmith refer to Ogygia as an island northwest of Corfu Ionian Islands Greece which adds fuel to modern Greek tradition that Ogygia is indeed the same island as the island of Othonoi br V B rnard identified Perejil as the location of the mythical island of Ogygia br br br Geographical account by Strabo br Approximately seven centuries after Homer the Alexandrian geographer Strabo criticized Polybius on the geography of the Odyssey Strabo proposed that Scheria and Ogygia were located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean br br At another instance he Polybius suppresses statements For Homer says also Now after the ship had left the river stream of Oceanus and In the island of Ogygia where is the navel of the sea where the daughter of Atlas lives and again regarding the Phaiakians Far apart we live in the wash of the waves the farthermost of men and no other mortals are conversant with us All these clearly suggest that he composed them to take place in the Atlantic Ocean br br br Geographical account by Plutarch br Plutarch also gives an account of the location of Ogygia br br First I will tell you the author of the piece if there is no objection who begins after Homer s fashion with an isle Ogygian lies far out at sea distant five days sail from Britain going westwards and three others equally distant from it and from each other are more opposite to the summer visits of the sun in one of which the barbarians fable that Cronus is imprisoned by Zeus whilst his son lies by his side as though keeping guard over those islands and the sea which they call the Sea of Cronus The great continent by which the great sea is surrounded on all sides they say lies less distant from the others but about five thousand stadia from Ogygia for one sailing in a rowing galley for the sea is difficult of passage and muddy through the great number of currents and these currents issue out of the great land and shoals are formed by them and the sea becomes clogged and full of earth by which it has the appearance of being solid br The passage of Plutarch has created some controversy W Hamilton indicated the similarities of Plutarch s account on the great continent and Plato s location of Atlantis in Timaeus E A Kepler in his Kepleri Astronomi Opera Omnia estimated that the great continent was America and attempted to locate Ogygia and the surrounding islands Ruaidhr Flaithbheartaigh used Ogygia as a synonym for Ireland in the title of his Irish history Ogygia Seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia Ogygia Or a Chronological Account of Irish Events Wilhelm von Christ was convinced that the continent was America and states that in the st century sailors traveling through Iceland Greenland and the Baffin Region Qikiqtaaluk reached the North American coast br br br Primeval Ogygia br Ogygia is associated with the Ogygian deluge and with the mythological figure Ogyges in the sense that the word Ogygian means primeval primal and at earliest dawn which would suggest that Homer s Ogygia was a primeval island However Ogyges as a primeval aboriginal ruler was usually sited in Boeotia where he founded Thebes there naming it Ogygia at the time br In another account of Ogyges he brought his people to the area first known as Acte That land was subsequently called Ogygia in his honor but ultimately known as Attica br Ogygia is used by Roderick O Flaherty as an allegory for Ireland in his book published in as Ogygia seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia etc in translated into English by Rev James Hely as Ogygia or a Chronological account of Irish Events collected from Very Ancient Documents faithfully compared with each other supported by the Genealogical Chronological Aid of the Sacred and Profane Writings of the Globe br br br Namesake br Ogygia Island in Antarctica is named after the mythical island br br br In popular culture br Ogygia appears in the books The Battle of the Labyrinth The House of Hades and The Blood of Olympus of Rick Riordan s Camp Half Blood Chronicles Main characters Percy Jackson and Leo Valdez land on the island in The Battle of the Labyrinth and The House of Hades respectively where they remain trapped for a while until Calypso falls in love with them which summons a magical raft to take the heroes away In The Blood of Olympus Leo returns to Ogygia to rescue Calypso using a magical astrolabe that had been created by Odysseus for just such a purpose
