Heracles HERR kleez Greek lit glory fame of Hera born Alcaeus Alkaios or Alcides Alkeid s was a divine hero in Greek mythology the son of Zeus and Alcmene and the foster son of Amphitryon He was a descendant and half brother as they are both sired by the god Zeus of Perseus He was the greatest of the Greek heroes the ancestor of royal clans who claimed to be Heracleidae and a champion of the Olympian order against chthonic monsters In Rome and the modern West he is known as Hercules with whom the later Roman emperors in particular Commodus and Maximian often identified themselves Details of his cult were adapted to Rome as well br br br Origin br Many popular stories were told of his life the most famous being The Twelve Labours of Heracles Alexandrian poets of the Hellenistic age drew his mythology into a high poetic and tragic atmosphere His figure which initially drew on Near Eastern motifs such as the lion fight was widely known br Heracles was the greatest of Hellenic chthonic heroes but unlike other Greek heroes no tomb was identified as his Heracles was both hero and god as Pindar says heros theos at the same festival sacrifice was made to him first as a hero with a chthonic libation and then as a god upon an altar thus he embodies the closest Greek approach to a demi god br The core of the story of Heracles has been identified by Walter Burkert as originating in Neolithic hunter culture and traditions of shamanistic crossings into the netherworld It is possible that the myths surrounding Heracles were based on the life of a real person or several people whose accomplishments became exaggerated with time br br br Hero or god br Heracles role as a culture hero whose death could be a subject of mythic telling see below was accepted into the Olympian Pantheon during Classical times This created an awkwardness in the encounter with Odysseus in the episode of Odyssey XI called the Nekuia where Odysseus encounters Heracles in Hades br br Ancient critics were aware of the problem of the aside that interrupts the vivid and complete description in which Heracles recognizes Odysseus and hails him and some modern critics deny that the verse s beginning in Fagles translation His ghost I mean was part of the original composition once people knew of Heracles admission to Olympus they would not tolerate his presence in the underworld remarks Friedrich Solmsen noting that the interpolated verses represent a compromise between conflicting representations of Heracles br br br Cult br The ancient Greeks celebrated the festival of the Heracleia which commemorated the death of Heracles on the second day of the month of Metageitnion which would fall in late July or early August What is believed to be an Egyptian Temple of Heracles in the Bahariya Oasis dates to BCE A reassessment of Ptolemy s descriptions of the island of Malta attempted to link the site at Ras ir Ra eb with a temple to Heracles but the arguments are not conclusive Several ancient cities were named Heraclea in his honor A very small island close to the island of Lemnos was called Neai from which means I dive swim because Heracles swam there According to the Greek legends the Herculaneum in Italy was founded by him br Several poleis provided two separate sanctuaries for Heracles one recognizing him as a god the other only as a hero Sacrifice was made to him as a hero and as a god within the same festival This ambiguity helped create the Heracles cult especially when historians e g Herodotus and artists encouraged worship such as the painters during the time of the Peisistratos who often presented Heracles entering Olympus in their works br Some sources explained that the cult of Heracles persisted because of the hero s ascent to heaven and his suffering which became the basis for festivals ritual rites and the organization of mysteries There is the observation for example that sufferings pathea gave rise to the rituals of grief and mourning which came before the joy in the mysteries in the sequence of cult rituals Also like the case of Apollo the cult of Heracles had been sustained through the years by absorbing local cult figures such as those who share the same nature He was also constantly invoked as a patron for men especially the young ones For example he was considered the ideal in warfare so he presided over gymnasiums and the ephebes or those men undergoing military training br There were ancient towns and cities that also adopted Heracles as a patron deity contributing to the spread of his cult There was the case of the royal house of Macedonia which claimed lineal descent from the hero primarily for purposes of divine protection and legitimator of actions br The earliest evidence that shows the worship of Heracles in popular cult was in th century BCE and via an ancient inscription from Phaleron After the th century BCE Heracles became identified with the Phoenician God Melqart br Oitaeans worshiped Heracles and called him Cornopion because he helped them get rid of locusts which they called cornopes while the citizens of Erythrae at Mima called him Ipoctonus because he destroyed the vine eating ips a kind of cynips wasp there br br br Character br br Extraordinary strength courage ingenuity and sexual prowess with both males and females were among the characteristics commonly attributed to him Heracles used his wits on several occasions when his strength did not suffice such as when laboring for the king Augeas of Elis wrestling the giant Antaeus or tricking Atlas into taking the sky back onto his shoulders Together with Hermes he was the patron and protector of gymnasia and palaestrae His iconographic attributes are the lion skin and the club These qualities did not prevent him from being regarded as a playful figure who used games to relax from his labors and played a great deal with children By conquering dangerous archaic forces he is said to have made the world safe for mankind and to be its benefactor Heracles was an extremely passionate and emotional individual capable of doing both great deeds for his friends such as wrestling with Thanatos on behalf of Prince Admetus who had regaled Heracles with his hospitality or restoring his friend Tyndareus to the throne of Sparta after he was overthrown and being a terrible enemy who would wreak horrible vengeance on those who crossed him as Augeas Neleus and Laomedon all found out to their cost There was also a coldness to his character which was demonstrated by Sophocles depiction of the hero in The Trachiniae Heracles threatened his marriage with his desire to bring two women under the same roof one of them was his wife Deianeira br In the works of Euripides involving Heracles his actions were partly driven by forces outside rational human control By highlighting the divine causation of his madness Euripides problematized Heracles character and status within the civilized context This aspect is also highlighted in Hercules Furens where Seneca linked the hero s madness to an illusion and a consequence of Heracles refusal to live a simple life as offered by Amphitryon It was indicated that he preferred the extravagant violence of the heroic life and that its ghosts eventually manifested in his madness and that the hallucinatory visions defined Heracles character br br br Mythology br br br Birth and childhood br br A major factor in the well known tragedies surrounding Heracles is the hatred that the goddess Hera wife of Zeus had for him Heracles was the son of the affair Zeus had with the mortal woman Alcmene When Zeus desired Alcmene he decided to make one night last three by ordering Helios the god of the sun not to rise for three days so he would have more time with Alcmene Zeus made love to her after disguising himself as her husband Amphitryon home early from war Amphitryon did return later the same night and Alcmene became pregnant with his son at the same time a case of heteropaternal superfecundation where a woman carries twins sired by different fathers Thus Heracles very existence proved at least one of Zeus many illicit affairs and Hera often conspired against Zeus mortal offspring as revenge for her husband s infidelities His twin mortal brother son of Amphitryon was Iphicles father of Heracles charioteer Iolaus br br On the night Heracles and Iphicles were to be born Hera knowing of her husband Zeus adultery persuaded Zeus to swear an oath that the child born that night to a member of the House of Perseus would become High King Hera did this knowing that while Heracles was to be born a descendant of Perseus so too was Eurystheus Once the oath was sworn Hera hurried to Alcmene s dwelling and slowed the birth of Heracles and Iphicles by forcing Ilithyia goddess of childbirth to sit cross legged with her clothing tied in knots thereby causing the twins to be trapped in the womb Meanwhile Hera caused Eurystheus to be born prematurely making him High King in place of Heracles She would have permanently delayed Heracles birth had she not been fooled by Galanthis Alcmene s servant who lied to Ilithyia saying that Alcmene had already delivered the baby Upon hearing this she jumped in surprise loosing the knots and inadvertently allowing Alcmene to give birth to Heracles and Iphicles br br Fear of Hera s revenge led Alcmene to expose the infant Heracles but he was taken up and brought to Hera by his half sister Athena who played an important role as protectress of heroes Hera did not recognize Heracles and nursed him out of pity Heracles suckled so strongly that he caused Hera pain and she pushed him away Her milk sprayed across the heavens and there formed the Milky Way But with divine milk Heracles had acquired supernatural powers Athena brought the infant back to his mother and he was subsequently raised by his parents br The child was originally given the name Alcides by his parents it was only later that he became known as Heracles He was renamed Heracles in an unsuccessful attempt to mollify Hera with Heracles meaning Hera s pride or glory He and his twin were just eight months old when Hera sent two giant snakes into the children s chamber Iphicles cried from fear but his brother grabbed a snake in each hand and strangled them He was found by his nurse playing with them on his cot as if they were toys Astonished Amphitryon sent for the seer Tiresias who prophesied an unusual future for the boy saying he would vanquish numerous monsters br br br Youth br br After killing his music tutor Linus with a lyre he was sent to tend cattle on a mountain by his foster father Amphitryon Here according to an allegorical parable The Choice of Heracles invented by the sophist Prodicus c BCE and reported in Xenophon s Memorabilia he was visited by two allegorical figures Vice and Virtue who offered him a choice between a pleasant and easy life or a severe but glorious life he chose the latter This was part of a pattern of ethicizing Heracles over the th century BCE br Later in Thebes Heracles married King Creon s daughter Megara br br br Labours of Heracles br br In a fit of madness induced by Hera Heracles killed his children and Megara After his madness had been cured with hellebore by Antikyreus the founder of Antikyra he realized what he had done and fled to the Oracle of Delphi Unbeknownst to him the Oracle was guided by Hera He was directed to serve King Eurystheus for ten years and perform any task Eurystheus required of him Eurystheus decided to give Heracles ten labours but after completing them Heracles was cheated by Eurystheus when he added two more resulting in the Twelve Labors of Heracles If he succeeded he would be purified of his sin and as myth says he would become a god and be granted immortality br Other traditions place Heracles madness at a later time and relate the circumstances differently In some traditions there was only a divine reason for Heracles twelve labours Zeus in his desire not to leave Heracles the victim of Hera s jealousy made her promise that if Heracles executed twelve great works in the service of Eurystheus he should become immortal In the play Herakles by Euripides Heracles is driven to madness by Hera and kills his children after his twelve labours br Despite the difficulty Heracles accomplished these tasks but Eurystheus in the end did not accept the success the hero had with two of the labours the cleansing of the Augean stables because Heracles was going to accept pay for the labour and the killing of the Lernaean Hydra as Heracles nephew Iolaus had helped him burn the stumps of the multiplying heads br Eurystheus set two more tasks fetching the Golden Apples of Hesperides and capturing Cerberus In the end with ease the hero successfully performed each added task bringing the total number of labours up to twelve br Not all versions and writers give the labours in the same order The Bibliotheca gives the following order br br Slay the Nemean Lion br Heracles defeated a lion that was attacking the city of Nemea with his bare hands After he succeeded he wore the skin as a cloak to demonstrate his power over the opponent he had defeated br Slay the nine headed Lernaean Hydra br A fire breathing monster with multiple serpent heads When one head was cut off two would grow in its place It lived in a swamp near Lerna Hera had sent it in hopes it would destroy Heracles home city because she thought it was invincible With help from his nephew Iolaus he defeated the monster and dipped his arrows in its poisoned blood thus envenomizing them br Capture the Golden Hind of Artemis br Not to kill but to catch this hind that was sacred to Artemis A different but still difficult task It cost time but having chased it for a year Heracles wore out the Hind Artemis intervened but as soon as Heracles explained the situation to her she allowed him to take it and he presented it alive to Eurystheus br Capture the Erymanthian Boar br A fearsome marauding boar on the loose Eurystheus set Heracles the Labour of catching it and bringing it to Mycenae Again a time consuming task but the tireless hero found the beast captured it and brought it to its final spot Patience is the heroic quality in the third and fourth Labours br Clean the Augean stables in a single day br The Augean stables were the home of cattle with poisoned faeces which Augeas had been given by his father Helios Heracles was given the near impossible task of cleaning the stables of the diseased faeces He accomplished it by digging ditches on both sides of the stables moving them into the ditches and then diverting the rivers Alpheios and Pineios to wash the ditches clean br Slay the Stymphalian Birds br These aggressive man eating birds were terrorizing a forest near Lake Stymphalia in northern Arcadia Heracles scared them with a rattle given to him by Athena to frighten them into flight away from the forest allowing him to shoot many of them with his bow and arrow and bring back this proof of his success to Eurystheus br Capture the Cretan Bull br The harmful bull father of the Minotaur was laying waste to the lands round Knossos on Crete It embodied the rage of Poseidon at having his gift the Bull to Minos diverted from the intention to sacrifice it to himself Heracles captured it and carried it on his shoulders to Eurystheus in Tiryns Eurystheus released it when it wandered to Marathon which it then terrorized until killed by Theseus br Steal the Mares of Diomedes br Stealing the horses from Diomedes stables that had been trained by their owner to feed on human flesh was his next challenge Heracles task was to capture them and hand them over to Eurystheus He accomplished this task by feeding King Diomedes to the animals before binding their mouths shut br Obtain the girdle of Hippolyta Queen of the Amazons br Hippolyta was an Amazon queen and she had a girdle given to her by her father Ares Heracles had to retrieve the girdle and return it to Eurystheus He and his band of companions received a rough welcome because ordered by Hera the Amazons were supposed to attack them however against all odds Heracles completed the task and secured the girdle for Eurystheus br Obtain the cattle of the monster Geryon br The next challenge was to capture the herd guarded by a two headed dog called Orthrus which belonged to Geryon a giant with three heads and six arms who lived in Erytheia While travelling to Erytheia he passed through the Libyan desert and was so annoyed by the heat he shot an arrow at Helios the sun Helios impressed lent him his giant cup which Heracles used to find Orthrus the herdsman Erytion and the owner Geryon He killed the first two with his club and the third with a poisoned arrow Heracles then herded the cattle and with difficulty took them to Eurystheus br Steal the golden apples of the Hesperides br These sacred fruits were protected by Hera who had set Ladon a fearsome hundred headed dragon as the guardian Heracles had to first find where the garden was he asked Nereus for help He came across Prometheus on his journey Heracles shot the eagle eating at his liver and in return he helped Heracles with knowledge that his brother would know where the garden was His brother Atlas offered him help with the apples if he would hold up the heavens while he was gone Atlas tricked him and did not return Heracles returned the trickery and managed to get Atlas taking the burden of the heavens once again and returned the apples to Mycenae br Capture and bring back Cerberus br His last labour and undoubtedly the riskiest Eurystheus was so frustrated that Heracles was completing all the tasks that he had given him that he imposed one he believed to be impossible Heracles had to go down into the underworld of Hades and capture the ferocious three headed dog Cerberus who guarded the gates He used the souls to help convince Hades to hand over the dog He agreed to give him the dog if he used no weapons to obtain him Heracles succeeded and took the creature back to Mycenae causing Eurystheus to be fearful of the power and strength of this hero br br br Further adventures br After completing these tasks Heracles fell in love with Princess Iole of Oechalia King Eurytus of Oechalia promised his daughter Iole to whoever could beat his sons in an archery contest Heracles won but Eurytus abandoned his promise Heracles advances were spurned by the king and his sons except for one Iole s brother Iphitus Heracles killed the king and his sons excluding Iphitus and abducted Iole Iphitus became Heracles best friend However once again Hera drove Heracles mad and he threw Iphitus over the city wall to his death Once again Heracles purified himself through three years of servitude this time to Queen Omphale of Lydia br br br Omphale br br Omphale was a queen or princess of Lydia As penalty for a murder imposed by Xenoclea the Delphic Oracle Heracles was to serve as her slave for a year He was forced to do women s work and to wear women s clothes while she wore the skin of the Nemean Lion and carried his olive wood club After some time Omphale freed Heracles and married him Some sources mention a son born to them who is variously named It was at that time that the cercopes mischievous wood spirits stole Heracles weapons He punished them by tying them to a stick with their faces pointing downward br br br Hylas br While walking through the wilderness Heracles was set upon by the Dryopes In Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica it is recalled that Heracles had mercilessly slain their king Theiodamas over one of the latter s bulls and made war upon the Dryopes because they gave no heed to justice in their lives After the death of their king the Dryopes gave in and offered him Prince Hylas He took the youth on as his weapons bearer Years later Heracles and Hylas joined the crew of the Argo As Argonauts they only participated in part of the journey In Mysia Hylas was kidnapped by the nymphs of a local spring Heracles searched for a long time but Hylas had fallen in love with the nymphs and never showed up again In other versions he simply drowned Either way the Argo set sail without them br br br Rescue of Prometheus br Hesiod s Theogony and Aeschylus Prometheus Unbound both tell that Heracles shot and killed the eagle that tortured Prometheus which was his punishment by Zeus for stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals Heracles freed the Titan from his chains and his torments Prometheus then made predictions regarding further deeds of Heracles br br br Heracles constellation br On his way back to Mycenae from Iberia having obtained the Cattle of Geryon as his tenth labour Heracles came to Liguria in North Western Italy where he engaged in battle with two giants Albion and Bergion or Dercynus sons of Poseidon The opponents were strong Heracles was in a difficult position so he prayed to his father Zeus for help Under the aegis of Zeus Heracles won the battle It was this kneeling position of Heracles when he prayed to his father Zeus that gave the name Engonasin derived from meaning on his knees or the Kneeler br to the constellation known as Heracles constellation The story among others is described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus br br br Heracles sack of Troy br br Before Homer s Trojan War Heracles had made an expedition to Troy and sacked it Previously Poseidon had sent a sea monster Greek k t s Latin cetus to attack Troy The story is related in several digressions in the Iliad and is found in pseudo Apollodorus Bibliotheke This expedition became the theme of the Eastern pediment of the Temple of Aphaea Laomedon planned on sacrificing his daughter Hesione to Poseidon in the hope of appeasing him Heracles happened to arrive along with Telamon and Oicles and agreed to kill the monster if Laomedon would give him the horses received from Zeus as compensation for Zeus kidnapping Ganymede Laomedon agreed Heracles killed the monster but Laomedon went back on his word Accordingly in a later expedition Heracles and his followers attacked Troy and sacked it Then they slew all Laomedon s sons present there save Podarces who was renamed Priam who saved his own life by giving Heracles a golden veil Hesione had made Telamon took Hesione as a war prize and they had a son Teucer br br br Colony at Sardinia br After Heracles had performed his Labours gods told him that before he passed into the company of the gods he should create a colony at Sardinia and make his sons whom he had with the daughters of Thespius the leaders of the settlement When his sons became adults he sent them together with Iolaus to the island br br br Other adventures br br Heracles defeated the Bebryces ruled by King Mygdon and gave their land to Prince Lycus of Mysia son of Dascylus br He killed the robber Termerus br Heracles visited Evander with Antor who then stayed in Italy br Heracles killed King Amyntor of Ormenium for not allowing him into his kingdom He also killed King Emathion of Arabia br Heracles kills the Egyptian King Busiris and his followers after they attempt to sacrifice him to the gods br Heracles killed Lityerses after beating him in a contest of harvesting br Heracles killed Periclymenus at Pylos br Heracles killed Syleus for forcing strangers to hoe a vineyard br Heracles rivaled with Lepreus and eventually killed him br Heracles founded the city Tarentum modern Taranto in Italy br Heracles learned music from Linus and Eumolpus but killed him after Linus corrected his mistakes and caned him with rods He learned how to wrestle from Autolycus He killed the famous boxer Eryx of Sicily in a match br Heracles was an Argonaut He killed Alastor and his brothers br br When Hippocoon overthrew his brother Tyndareus as King of Sparta Heracles reinstated the rightful ruler and killed Hippocoon and his sons br Heracles killed Cycnus the son of Ares The expedition against Cycnus in which Iolaus accompanied Heracles is the ostensible theme of a short epic attributed to Hesiod Shield of Heracles br When Ares tried to avenge Cycnus Heracles defeated him with the help of Athena br Heracles killed the Giants Alcyoneus and Porphyrion br Heracles killed Antaeus the giant who was immortal while touching the earth by picking him up and holding him in the air while strangling him br Pygmies tried to kill Heracles because they were brothers of Antaeus and wanted to avenge Antaeus s death but failed br Heracles went to war with Augeias after he denied him a promised reward for clearing his stables Augeias remained undefeated due to the skill of his two generals the Molionides and after Heracles fell ill his army was badly beaten Later however he was able to ambush and kill the Molionides and thus march into Elis sack it and kill Augeias and his sons br Heracles visited the house of Admetus on the day Admetus wife Alcestis had agreed to die in his place Admetus not wanting to turn Heracles away nor wanting to burden him with his sadness welcomes him and instructs the servants not to inform Heracles of what has occurred Heracles thus unaware of Alcestis s fate enjoys the hospitality of Admetus s house drinking and revelling which angers the servants who wish to mourn as is their right One scolds the guest and Heracles is ashamed of his actions By hiding beside the grave of Alcestis Heracles was able to surprise Death when he came to collect her and by squeezing him tight until he relented was able to persuade Death to return Alcestis to her husband br Heracles challenged wine god Dionysus to a drinking contest and lost resulting in his joining the Thiasus for a period br Heracles also appears in Aristophanes The Frogs in which Dionysus seeks out the hero to find a way to the underworld Heracles is greatly amused by Dionysus appearance and jokingly offers several ways to commit suicide before finally offering his knowledge of how to get to there br Heracles appears as the ancestral hero of Scythia in Herodotus text While Heracles is sleeping out in the wilderness a half woman half snake creature steals his horses Heracles eventually finds the creature but she refuses to return the horses until he has sex with her After doing so he takes back his horses but before leaving he hands over his belt and bow and gives instructions as to which of their children should found a new nation in Scythia br In the fifth book of the New History ascribed by Photius to Ptolemy Hephaestion mention that Heracles did not wear the skin of the Nemean lion but that of a certain Lion giant killed by Heracles whom he had challenged to single combat br Heracles fought and killed Cacus br Heracles fought with the Sicani people killing many including the famous Leucaspis br Heracles encountered Scylla during a journey to Sicily and slew her br br br Death br br This is described in Sophocles s Trachiniae and in Ovid s Metamorphoses Book IX Having wrestled and defeated Achelous god of the Acheloos river Heracles takes Deianira as his wife Travelling to Tiryns a centaur Nessus offers to help Deianira across a fast flowing river while Heracles swims it However Nessus is true to the archetype of the mischievous centaur and tries to steal Deianira away while Heracles is still in the water Angry Heracles shoots him with his arrows dipped in the poisonous blood of the Lernaean Hydra Thinking of revenge Nessus gives Deianira his blood soaked tunic before he dies telling her it will excite the love of her husband br Several years later rumor tells Deianira that she has a rival for the love of Heracles Deianira remembering Nessus words gives Heracles the bloodstained shirt Lichas the herald delivers the shirt to Heracles However it is still covered in the Hydra s blood from Heracles arrows and this poisons him tearing his skin and exposing his bones Before he dies Heracles throws Lichas into the sea thinking he was the one who poisoned him according to several versions Lichas turns to stone becoming a rock standing in the sea named for him Heracles then uproots several trees and builds a funeral pyre on Mount Oeta which Poeas father of Philoctetes lights As his body burns only his immortal side is left Through Zeus apotheosis Heracles rises to Olympus as he dies br No one but Heracles friend Philoctetes Poeas in some versions would light his funeral pyre in an alternative version it is Iolaus who lights the pyre For this action Philoctetes or Poeas received Heracles bow and arrows which were later needed by the Greeks to defeat Troy in the Trojan War br Philoctetes confronted Paris and shot a poisoned arrow at him The Hydra poison subsequently led to the death of Paris The Trojan War however continued until the Trojan Horse was used to defeat Troy br According to Herodotus Heracles lived years before Herodotus own time c BCE br br br Godhood br After his death in the pyre Heracles ascended to Olympus as a god and having finally reconciled with Hera he got her daughter Hebe as his fourth and final wife They had two sons together Alexiares and Anicetus br When Typhon attacked Olympus all gods transformed into animals and ran terrified to Egypt Heracles became a fawn br In the Dialogues of the Gods a satirical work by Lucian of Samosata Heracles and another recently deified mortal Asclepius fight over which gets the most prestigious seat on the table of the gods each arguing that they are the one who deserve it Zeus intervenes and rules in favour of Asclepius reasoning that the best seat should go to the one who became a god first br Heracles also appears to Philoctetes stranded and abandoned by the other Greeks on Lemnos island and through his deus ex machina intervention Philoctetes is convinced to join the other Greeks at Troy where he kills Paris with Heracles s arrows br br br Christian chronology br In Christian circles a Euhemerist reading of the widespread Heracles cult was attributed to a historical figure who had been offered cult status after his death Thus Eusebius Preparation of the Gospel reported that Clement could offer historical dates for Heracles as a king in Argos from the reign of Heracles in Argos to the deification of Heracles himself and of Asclepius there are comprised thirty eight years according to Apollodorus the chronicler and from that point to the deification of Castor and Pollux fifty three years and somewhere about this time was the capture of Troy br br Readers with a literalist bent following Clement s reasoning have asserted from this remark that since Heracles ruled over Tiryns in Argos at the same time that Eurystheus ruled over Mycenae and since at about this time Linus was Heracles teacher one can conclude based on Jerome s date in his universal history his Chronicon given to Linus notoriety in teaching Heracles in BCE that Heracles death and deification occurred years later in approximately BCE br br br Lovers br br br Women br br br Marriages br During the course of his life Heracles married four times br br Heracles waged a victorious war against the kingdom of Orchomenus in Boeotia and married his first wife Megara daughter of Creon king of Thebes But he killed their children in a fit of madness sent by Hera and consequently was obliged to become the servant of Eurystheus According to Pseudo Apollodorus Bibliotheca Megara was unharmed According to Hyginus Fabulae Heracles also killed Megara br br His second wife was Omphale the Lydian queen to whom he was delivered as a slave Hyginus Fabulae br His third marriage was to Deianira for whom he had to fight the river god Achelous upon Achelous defeat Heracles removed one of his horns and gave it to some nymphs who turned it into the cornucopia Soon after they wed Heracles and Deianira had to cross a river and a centaur named Nessus offered to help Deianira across but then attempted to rape her Enraged Heracles shot the centaur from the opposite shore with a poisoned arrow tipped with the Lernaean Hydra s blood and killed him As he lay dying Nessus plotted revenge told Deianira to gather up his blood and spilled semen and if she ever wanted to prevent Heracles from having affairs with other women she should apply them to his vestments Nessus knew that his blood had become tainted by the poisonous blood of the Hydra and would burn through the skin of anyone it touched Later when Deianira suspected that Heracles was fond of Iole she soaked a shirt of his in the mixture creating the poisoned shirt of Nessus Heracles servant Lichas brought him the shirt and he put it on Instantly he was in agony the cloth burning into him As he tried to remove it the flesh ripped from his bones Heracles chose a voluntary death asking that a pyre be built for him to end his suffering After death the gods transformed him into an immortal or alternatively the fire burned away the mortal part of the demigod so that only the god remained After his mortal parts had been incinerated he could become a full god and join his father and the other Olympians on Mount Olympus br His fourth marriage was to Hebe his last wife br br br Affairs br An episode of his female affairs that stands out was his stay at the palace of Thespius king of Thespiae who wished him to kill the Lion of Cithaeron As a reward the king offered him the chance to perform sexual intercourse with all fifty of his daughters in one night Heracles complied and they all became pregnant and all bore sons This is sometimes referred to as his Thirteenth Labour Many of the kings of ancient Greece traced their lines to one or another of these notably the kings of Sparta and Macedon br Yet another episode of his female affairs that stands out was when he carried away the oxen of Geryon he also visited the country of the Scythians Once there while asleep his horses suddenly disappeared When he woke and wandered about in search of them he came into the country of Hylaea He then found the dracaena of Scythia sometimes identified as Echidna in a cave When he asked whether she knew anything about his horses she answered that they were in her own possession but that she would not give them up unless he would consent to stay with her for a time Heracles accepted the request and became by her the father of Agathyrsus Gelonus and Scythes The last of them became king of the Scythians according to his father s arrangement because he was the only one among the three brothers that was able to manage the bow which Heracles had left behind and to use his father s girdle br Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that Heracles and Lavinia daughter of Evander had a son named Pallas br br br Men br br As a symbol of masculinity and warriorship Heracles also had a number of male lovers Plutarch in his Eroticos maintains that Heracles male lovers were beyond counting Of these the one most closely linked to Heracles is the Theban Iolaus According to a myth thought to be of ancient origins Iolaus was Heracles charioteer and squire Heracles in the end helped Iolaus find a wife Plutarch reports that down to his own time male couples would go to Iolaus s tomb in Thebes to swear an oath of loyalty to the hero and to each other He also mentions Admetus known in myth for assisting the Calydonian boar hunt as one of Heracles s male lovers br One of Heracles male lovers and one represented in ancient as well as modern art is Hylas who sailed with Heracles on the Argo br Another reputed male lover of Heracles is Elacatas who was honored in Sparta with a sanctuary and yearly games Elacatea The myth of their love is an ancient one br Abdera s eponymous hero Abderus was another of Heracles lovers He was said to have been entrusted with and slain by the carnivorous mares of Thracian Diomedes Heracles founded the city of Abdera in Thrace in his memory where he was honored with athletic games br Another myth is that of Iphitus br Another story is the one of his love for Nireus who was the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion Iliad But Ptolemy adds that certain authors made Nireus out to be a son of Heracles br Pausanias makes mention of Sostratus a youth of Dyme Achaea as a lover of Heracles Sostratus was said to have died young and to have been buried by Heracles outside the city The tomb was still there in historical times and the inhabitants of Dyme honored Sostratus as a hero The youth seems to have also been referred to as Polystratus br A series of lovers are only known in later literature Among these are Eurystheus Adonis Corythus Argus and Nestor who was said to have been loved for his wisdom In the account of Ptolemaeus Chennus Nestor s role as lover explains why he was the only son of Neleus to be spared by the hero br A scholiast commenting on Apollonius Argonautica lists the following male lovers of Heracles Hylas Philoctetes Diomus Perithoas and Phrix after whom a city in Libya was named Diomus is also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium as the eponym of the deme Diomeia of the Attic phyle Aegeis Heracles is said to have fallen in love with Diomus when he was received as guest by Diomus father Collytus Perithoas and Phrix are otherwise unknown and so is the version that suggests a sexual relationship between Heracles and Philoctetes br br br Children br br All of Heracles marriages and almost all of his heterosexual affairs resulted in births of a number of sons and at least four daughters br One of the most prominent is Hyllus the son of Heracles and Deianeira or Melite The term Heracleidae although it could refer to all of Heracles children and further descendants is most commonly used to indicate the descendants of Hyllus in the context of their lasting struggle for return to Peloponnesus out of where Hyllus and his brothers the children of
