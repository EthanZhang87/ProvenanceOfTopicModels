Hades Greek translit H id s Attic Greek h i d s later h d s in the ancient Greek religion and mythology is the god of the dead and the king of the underworld with which his name became synonymous Hades was the eldest son of Cronus and Rhea although this also made him the last son to be regurgitated by his father He and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated their father s generation of gods the Titans and claimed joint rulership over the cosmos Hades received the underworld Zeus the sky and Poseidon the sea with the solid earth long the province of Gaia available to all three concurrently In artistic depictions Hades is typically portrayed holding a bident br and wearing his helm with Cerberus the three headed guard dog of the underworld standing at his side br Roman era mythographers eventually equated the Etruscan god Aita br and the Roman gods Dis Pater and Orcus with Hades and merged all these figures into Pluto a Latinisation of Plouton Greek translit Plo t n itself a euphemistic title meaning the rich one often given to Hades br br br Name br br The origin of Hades name is uncertain but has generally been seen as meaning the unseen one since antiquity An extensive section of Plato s dialogue Cratylus is devoted to the etymology of the god s name in which Socrates is arguing for a folk etymology not from unseen but from his knowledge eidenai of all noble things Modern linguists have proposed the Proto Greek form Awides unseen The earliest attested form is A d s which lacks the proposed digamma Martin Litchfield West argues instead for an original meaning of the one who presides over meeting up from the universality of death br br In Homeric and Ionic Greek he was known as d s Other poetic variations of the name include A d ne s and the inflected forms dos gen di dat and da acc whose reconstructed nominative case s is however not attested The name as it came to be known in classical times was H id s Later the iota became silent then a subscript marking and finally omitted entirely br Perhaps from fear of pronouncing his name around the th century BC the Greeks started referring to Hades as Plouton Plo t n plu t n with a root meaning wealthy considering that from the abode below i e the soil come riches e g fertile crops metals and so on Plouton became the Roman god who both rules the underworld and distributed riches from below This deity was a mixture of the Greek god Hades and the Eleusinian icon Ploutos and from this he also received a priestess which was not previously practiced in Greece More elaborate names of the same genre were Ploutod t s plu to do t s or Ploutodot r plu to do t r meaning giver of wealth br Epithets of Hades include Agesander a g san dros and Agesilaos a ge si la os both from g lead carry or fetch and an r man or laos men or people describing Hades as the god who carries away all Nicander uses the form Hegesilaus h ge si la os br He was also referred to as Zeus katachthonios zdeu s ka ta k t o ni os meaning the Zeus of the underworld by those avoiding his actual name as he had complete control over the underworld br br br Mythology br br br Early years br br In Greek mythology Hades the god of the Greek underworld was the first born son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea He had three older sisters Hestia Demeter and Hera as well as a younger brother Poseidon all of whom had been swallowed whole by their father as soon as they were born Zeus was the youngest child and through the machinations of their mother Rhea he was the only one that had escaped this fate Upon reaching adulthood Zeus managed to force his father to disgorge his siblings After their release the six younger gods along with allies they managed to gather challenged the elder gods for power in the Titanomachy a divine war The war lasted for ten years and ended with the victory of the younger gods Following their victory according to a single famous passage in the Iliad Book XV ln Hades and his two brothers Poseidon and Zeus drew lots for realms to rule Zeus received the sky Poseidon received the seas and Hades received the underworld the unseen realm to which the souls of the dead go upon leaving the world as well as any and all things beneath the earth br Hades obtained his wife and queen Persephone through abduction at the behest of Zeus This myth is the most important one Hades takes part in it also connected the Eleusinian Mysteries with the Olympian pantheon particularly as represented in the Homeric Hymn to Demeter which is the oldest story of the abduction most likely dating back to the beginning of the th century BC Helios told the grieving Demeter that Hades was not an unworthy groom or son in law given his status among the gods as her own brother and king on his own right br br But Goddess give up your strong grief let go br of your infinite anger Hades isn t an unsuitable br son in law among the gods Lord of the Many Dead br your own brother from the same seed As for honor br he won the third share back when the division was made br and now lives among those whom he was allotted to rule br br br King of the underworld br br Despite modern connotations of death as evil Hades was actually more altruistically inclined in mythology Hades was portrayed as passive and never portrayed negatively his role was often maintaining relative balance That said he was also depicted as cold and stern and he held all of his subjects equally accountable to his laws Any other individual aspects of his personality are not given as Greeks refrained from giving him much thought to avoid attracting his attention br br Hades ruled the dead assisted by others over whom he had complete authority The House of Hades was described as full of guests though he rarely left the underworld He cared little about what happened in the world above as his primary attention was ensuring none of his subjects ever left his domain br He strictly forbade his subjects to leave his domain and would become quite enraged when anyone tried to leave or if someone tried to steal the souls from his realm His wrath was equally terrible for anyone who tried to cheat death or otherwise crossed him as Sisyphus and Pirithous found out to their sorrow While usually indifferent to his subjects Hades was very focused on the punishment of these two people particularly Pirithous as he entered the underworld in an attempt to steal Persephone for himself and consequently was forced onto the Chair of Forgetfulness Another myth is about the Greek god Asclepius who was originally a demigod son of Apollo and Coronis a Thessalian princess During his lifetime he became a famous and talented physician who eventually was able to bring the dead back to life Feeling cheated Hades persuaded Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt After his death Asclepius was brought to Olympus where he became a god Hades was only depicted outside of the underworld once in myth and even that is believed to have been an instance where he had just left the gates of the underworld which was when Heracles shot him with an arrow as Hades was attempting to defend the city of Pylos After he was shot however he traveled to Olympus to heal Besides Heracles the only other living people who ventured to the underworld were also heroes Odysseus Aeneas accompanied by the Sibyl Orpheus to whom Hades showed uncharacteristic mercy at Persephone s urging who was moved by Orpheus music Theseus with Pirithous and in a late romance Psyche None of them were pleased with what they witnessed in the realm of the dead In particular the Greek war hero Achilles whom Odysseus conjured with a blood libation said br br br Abduction of Persephone br br The consort of Hades was Persephone daughter of Zeus and Demeter Persephone did not submit to Hades willingly but was abducted by him while picking flowers in the fields of Nysa her father Zeus had previously given Persephone to Hades to be his wife as is stated in the first lines of the Homeric Hymn to Demeter In protest of his act Demeter cast a curse on the land and there was a great famine though one by one the gods came to request she lift it lest mankind perish and cause the gods to be deprived of their receiving gifts and sacrifices Demeter asserted that the earth would remain barren until she saw her daughter again Zeus then sends for his son Hermes and instructs him to go down to the underworld in hopes that he may be able to convince Hades to allow Persephone to return to Earth so that Demeter might see Persephone and cause the famine to stop Hermes obeys and goes down to Hades realm wherein he finds Hades seated upon a couch Persephone seated next to him Hermes relays Zeus message and Hades complies saying br br Go now Persephone to your dark robed mother go and feel kindly in your heart towards me be not so exceedingly cast down for I shall be no unfitting husband for you among the deathless gods that am own brother to father Zeus And while you are here you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall have the greatest rights among the deathless gods those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts shall be punished for evermore br Afterwards Hades readies his chariot but not before he secretly gives Persephone a pomegranate seed to eat Hermes takes the reins and he and Persephone make their way to the Earth above coming to a halt in front of Demeter s temple at Eleusis where the goddess has been waiting Demeter and Persephone run towards each other and embrace one another happy that they are reunited Demeter however suspects that Persephone may have eaten food while down in the underworld and so she questions Persephone saying br br My child tell me surely you have not tasted any food while you were below Speak out and hide nothing but let us both know For if you have not you shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and your father the dark clouded son of Cronos and be honored by all the deathless gods but if you have tasted food you must go back again beneath the secret places of the earth there to dwell a third part of the seasons every year yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods But when the earth shall bloom with the fragrant flowers of spring in every kind then from the realm of darkness and gloom thou shalt come up once more to be a wonder for gods and mortal men And now tell me how he rapt you away to the realm of darkness and gloom and by what trick did the strong Host of Many beguile you br br Persephone does admit that she ate the food of the dead as she tells Demeter that Hades gave her a pomegranate seed and forced her to eat it Persephone s eating the pomegranate seed binds her to Hades and the underworld much to the dismay of Demeter Zeus however had previously proposed a compromise to which all parties had agreed of the year Persephone would spend one third with her husband br It is during this time when Persephone is down in the underworld with her husband that winter falls upon the earth an aspect of sadness and mourning br br br Visitors in the underworld br The hero Orpheus once descended into the underworld in search of his late wife Eurydice who died when a snake bit her So lovely was the music he played that it charmed even Hades as well as his wife Persephone who allowed him to take Eurydice to the land of the living as long as he did not look back at her on his way out br In another story Theseus and Pirithous pledged to kidnap and marry daughters of Zeus Theseus chose Helen and together they kidnapped her and decided to hold onto her until she was old enough to marry Pirithous chose Persephone They left Helen with Theseus mother Aethra and traveled to the underworld Hades knew of their plan to capture his wife so he pretended to offer them hospitality and set a feast as soon as the pair sat down snakes coiled around their feet and held them there Theseus was eventually rescued by Heracles but Pirithous was either trapped as punishment for daring to seek the wife of a god for his own or killed by Cerberus depending on the version of the story br br Sisyphus was a mortal king from Corinth who was punished in Tartarus for revealing to the river god Asopus the whereabouts of his daughter Aegina after Zeus abducted her and for trying to cheat death as well Zeus angry at Sisyphus for revealing the secret sent Thanatos to Sisyphus but he cleverly cast Death into his own bonds and as a result no one could die until Ares freed Thanatos and delivered Sisyphus to him But still Sisyphus ordered his wife Merope not to perform any funeral rites for him and what else was accustomed as tribute to the underworld gods before he was brought to Hades After some time that Merope had not offered proper honours Hades learnt of this and allowed Sisyphus to return to the world of the living so that he could punish his wife with the understanding that he would return afterwards Sisyphus however never returned as promised until years later when he died of old age Hades punished Sisyphus by making him roll a boulder up a hill in the underworld but every time he reached the top the boulder would roll down again and again In another version it is Persephone who lets him out br Heracles final labour was to capture Cerberus First Heracles went to Eleusis to be initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries He did this to absolve himself of guilt for killing the centaurs and to learn how to enter and exit the underworld alive He found the entrance to the underworld at Taenarum Athena and Hermes helped him through and back from Hades Heracles asked Hades for permission to take Cerberus Hades agreed as long as Heracles did not harm Cerberus When Heracles dragged the dog out of Hades he passed through the cavern Acherusia br In the myth of Admetus and Alcestis after Alcestis chose to die in place of her husband Admetus in order to save him Heracles brought her back from the dead by fighting and defeating Hades In other versions like Euripides play Alcestis Heracles fought Thanatos instead At another time Heracles sieged the town of Pylos and during the fight he wounded Hades who had sided with the Pylians In great pain Hades went to Olympus to be healed by the physician of the gods Paean br br br Lovers of Hades br Leuce was the most beautiful of the nymphs and a daughter of Oceanus Hades fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld She lived out the span of her life in his realm and when she died the god sought consolation by creating a suitable memorial of their love in the Elysian Fields where the pious spend their afterlife he brought a white tree into existence It was this tree with which Heracles crowned himself to celebrate his return from the underworld br Minthe was a nymph of the river Cocytus who became Hades mistress A jealous Persephone trampled the nymph under her foot transforming her into garden mint in the process According to a scholiast on Nicander Hades turned his dead lover into the mint herb after Persephone tore her into pieces for sleeping with him In another version Hades had kept Minthe as his mistress before he married Persephone and set her aside afterwards Minthe boasted of being more beautiful than Persephone and that Hades would soon take her back In anger over the hubris directed toward her daughter Demeter trampled Minthe and turned her into mint br Theophile was a girl who claimed that Hades loved her and that she was better than Persephone br br br Other works br br Once when a plague hit Aonia a region in Boeotia the people consulted an oracle and the god replied to them that they needed to make an appeal to the gods of the Underworld and sacrifice two willing young maidens to appease the anger of Hades and Persephone The girls that were chosen were Menippe and Metioche the daughters of Orion who solemnly offered their lives in order to save their countrymen After invoking the chthonic deities three times they took their own lives with the shuttles of their looms Hades and Persephone then took pity in both of them and transformed their corpses into comets br In some versions Hades is considered the master of the goddesses of Fate not his brother Zeus and the god who designates the end and origin of all things and orders the alternation of birth and destruction the arbiter of life and death This relationship is very clear in Roman epics like Statius s Thebaid where they are mentioned taking souls to be judged by Hades and inflicting severe punishments or in Claudian s De raptu Proserpinae where they appear begging their master not to release the Titans and saying everything they do is for him after Hades threatens Zeus to release the Titans against him if he does not give him a wife br Hades is considered the father of the Furies in some versions but the mother s identity varies in Virgil s Aeneid their mother is the night goddess Nyx and in the Orphic Hymns their mother is Persephone by Hades One of the rare occasions when he appears interacting with them is in Statius s Thebaid when Hades orders Tisiphone to punish humans for having invaded the underworld He is said to hate Alecto even though she is one of his children br In contrast to many of his other classical representations the satirical author Lucian of Samosata presents Hades in a more positive and even comic way In his Dialogues of the Dead he is represented trying to solve problems of some famous mythological figures and one of the most outstanding dialogues is with Protesilaus one of the Greek heroes killed in the Trojan War In this conversation Protesilaus asks him to be reunited with his still living lover and brings up as example that Hades did the same for Admetus and Alcestis Orpheus and Eurydice and that he himself also knows what being in love is like Hades is skeptical but Persephone manages to persuade him br According to Hesiod when the monstrous Typhon attacked the Olympian gods Hades is said to have trembled in fear in the underworld while Zeus fought Typhon above br In one of Plato s dialogues Socrates talks about Hades as a figure capable of making everyone fall by his enchantments and that is why no one ever leaves the underworld including the sirens br br br Cult and epithets br br Hades as the god of the dead was a fearsome figure to those still living in no hurry to meet him they were reluctant to swear oaths in his name and averted their faces when sacrificing to him Since to many simply to say the word Hades was frightening euphemisms were pressed into use Since precious minerals come from under the earth i e the underworld ruled by Hades he was considered to have control of these as well and as such the Greeks referred to him as Greek Plouton Latin PLVTO Pluto the rich one This title is derived from the word Ploutos Ancient Greek romanized Plo tos lit wealth riches plu tos Sophocles explained the notion of referring to Hades as Plouton with these words the gloomy Hades enriches himself with our sighs and our tears In addition he was called Clymenus Kl menos infamous kly me nos Polydegmon Polyd gmon host of many po ly deg m n and perhaps Eubuleus Euboule s good counsel eu bu leu s all of them euphemisms for a name that was unsafe to pronounce which evolved into epithets br He spent most of the time in his dark realm Formidable in battle he proved his ferocity in the famous Titanomachy the battle of the Olympians versus the Titans which established the rule of Zeus br Feared and loathed Hades embodied the inexorable finality of death Why do we loathe Hades more than any god if not because he is so adamantine and unyielding The rhetorical question is Agamemnon s Hades was not however an evil god for although he was stern cruel and unpitying he was still just Hades ruled the underworld and was therefore most often associated with death and feared by men but he was not Death itself it is Thanatos son of Nyx and Erebus who is the actual personification of death although Euripides play Alkestis states fairly clearly that Thanatos and Hades were one and the same deity and gives an interesting description of Hades as being dark cloaked and winged moreover Hades was also referred to as Hesperos Theos god of death darkness br When the Greeks propitiated Hades they banged their hands on the ground to be sure he would hear them Black animals such as sheep were sacrificed to him While some suggest the very vehemence of the rejection of human sacrifice expressed in myth might imply an unspoken memory of some distant past there is no direct evidence of such a turn The blood from all chthonic sacrifices including those to propitiate Hades dripped into a pit or cleft in the ground The person who offered the sacrifice had to avert his face br One ancient source says that he possessed the Cap of invisibility His chariot drawn by four black horses made for a fearsome and impressive sight These beasts were variously named as according to Claudian Orphnaeus Aethon Nycteus and Alastor while other authors listed also Nonius Ametheus Abastor Abetor and Metheus His other ordinary attributes were the narcissus and cypress plants the Key of Hades and Cerberus the three headed dog In certain portraits snakes also appeared to be attributed to Hades as he was occasionally portrayed to be either holding them or accompanied by them This is believed to hold significance as in certain classical sources Hades ravished Kore in the guise of a snake who went on to give birth to Zagreus Dionysus While bearing the name Zeus Zeus Olympios the great king of the gods noticeably differs from the Zeus Meilichios a decidedly chthonian character often portrayed as a snake and as seen beforehand they cannot be different manifestations of the same god in fact whenever another Zeus is mentioned this always refers to Hades Zeus Meilichios and Zeus Eubouleus are often referred to as being alternate names for Hades br The philosopher Heraclitus unifying opposites declared that Hades and Dionysus the very essence of indestructible life zo are the same god Among other evidence Karl Ker nyi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn To Demeter votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine as she states that it would be against themis for her to drink wine which is the gift of Dionysus after Persephone s abduction because of this association indicating that Hades may in fact have been a cover name for the underworld Dionysus He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as Chthonios the subterranean Eubouleus Good Counselor and Euclius glorious or renowned br br Evidence for a cult connection is quite extensive particularly in southern Italy especially when considering the death symbolism included in Dionysian worship statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis gives further evidence as the statue bears a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus also known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the underworld The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness br Both Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus The Orphics in particular believed that Zeus and Hades were the same deity and portrayed them as such This nature and aspect of Hades and Zeus displayed in the Orphic stories is the explanation for why both Hades and Zeus are considered to be the father of Orphic Dionysus Zagreus Orphics also described Zagreus as the son of Hades while also regarding Zagreus as an aspect of Dionysus The role of unifying Hades Zeus and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the shining realm of Zeus and the dark realm of Hades that lay beneath the Earth br Among the other appellations under which Hades or Pluto is generally known are the following br In Greek br br Adesius his name in Latium It is expressive of the grace br Agelastus from his melancholy countenance br Agesilaus expressive of his attracting all people to his empire br Agetes or Hegetes a name assigned to him by Pindar as to one who conducts br Aidoneus as used by Plutarch in a euhemerised version of the story of Pirithous s failed abduction of Persephone in which the god is recast as a king of the Molossians br Axiocersus or the shorn god a name of Pluto in the mysteries of the Cabiri he was there represented as without hair br Iao his name at Clares a town of Ionia br Moiragetes his name as guide of the Fates br Ophieus his name as the blind god among the Messenians it was derived from their dedicating certain Augurs to him whom they deprived of sight at the moment of their birth br In Latin or Etruscan br br Altor from alo to nourish br Februus from Februa signifying the sacrifices and purifications adopted in funeral rites br Feralis Deus the dismal or cruel god br Lactum his name among the Sarmatians br Larthy Tytiral sovereign of Tartarus his name in Etruria br Mantus or Manus the diminutive of Summanus an Etruscan epithet br Niger Deus black god his epithet as god of the Infernal Regions br Opertus the concealed br Postulio a name assigned to him by Varro under which he was worshipped on the shores of the lake Curtius from the circumstance of the earth s having opened at that spot and of the Aruspices having presumed that the King of Death thus asked for postula I ask sacrifices br Profundus Jupiter deep or lower Jove from his being sovereign of the deep or infernal regions br Quietalis from quies rest br Rusor because all things return eventually to the earth br Salutaris Divus a name assigned to him when he restored the dead to life Whenever the gods wished to re animate a body Pluto let fail some drops of nectar from his urn upon the favoured person this may account for bis being sometimes represented with an inverted vase br Saturnius from his father Saturn br Soranus his name among the Sabines in the temple dedicated to him on Mount Soracte br Stygius from the river Styx br Summanus from summus manium prince of the dead br Tellumo a name derived from those treasures which Pluto possesses in the recesses of the earth Tellumo denotes according to Varro the creative power of the earth in opposition to Tellus the productive br Uragus expressive of bis power over fire br Urgus from urgeo to impel br In Egypt br br Amenthes a name of Pluto among the Egyptians Plutarch informs us that the word Amenthes has a reference to the doctrines of the metempsychosis and signifies the place which gives and receives on the belief that some vast gulf was assigned as a receptacle to the souls which were about to animate new bodies br br br Artistic representations br br Hades was depicted infrequently in artwork as well as mythology because the Greeks were so afraid of him His artistic representations which are generally found in Archaic pottery are not even concretely thought of as the deity however at this point in time it is heavily believed that the figures illustrated are indeed Hades He was later presented in the classical arts in the depictions of the Rape of Persephone Within these illustrations Hades was often young yet he was also shown as varying ages in other works Due to this lack of depictions there were not very strict guidelines when representing the deity On pottery he has a dark beard and is presented as a stately figure on an ebony throne His attributes in art include a bident less commonly a scepter a helm cornucopias roosters and a key They key plays a doubly symbolic role in that it represents his control over the underworld and acts as a reminder that the gates of the underworld were always locked so that souls could not leave Even if the doors were open Cerberus the three headed guard dog of the underworld ensured that while all souls were allowed to enter into the underworld freely none could ever escape Cerberus is a very integral symbol of Hades so much so that when Cerberus is depicted the depiction very rarely portrays him without Hades Sometimes artists painted Hades as looking away from the other gods as he was disliked by them as well as humans br As Pluto he was regarded in a more positive light He holds a cornucopia representing the gifts he bestows upon people as well as fertility which he becomes connected to br br br Realm of Hades br br In older Greek myths the realm of Hades is the misty and gloomy abode of the dead also called Erebus where all mortals go when they die Very few mortals could leave Hades once they entered The exceptions Heracles and Theseus are heroic Even Odysseus in his Nekyia Odyssey xi calls up the spirits of the departed rather than descend to them Later Greek philosophy introduced the idea that all mortals are judged after death and are either rewarded or cursed br There were several sections of the realm of Hades including Elysium the Asphodel Meadows and Tartarus The mythographer Apollodorus describes Tartarus as a gloomy place in Hades as far distant from Earth as Earth is distant from the sky Greek mythographers were not perfectly consistent about the geography of the afterlife A contrasting myth of the afterlife concerns the Garden of the Hesperides often identified with the Isles of the Blessed where the blessed heroes may dwell br In Roman mythology the entrance to the underworld located at Avernus a crater near Cumae was the route Aeneas used to descend to the realm of the dead By synecdoche Avernus could be substituted for the underworld as a whole The di inferi were a collective of underworld divinities br For Hellenes the deceased entered the underworld by crossing the Styx ferried across by Charon kair on who charged an obolus a small coin for passage placed in the mouth of the deceased by pious relatives Paupers and the friendless gathered for a hundred years on the near shore according to Book VI of Vergil s Aeneid Greeks offered propitiatory libations to prevent the deceased from returning to the upper world to haunt those who had not given them a proper burial The far side of the river was guarded by Cerberus the three headed dog defeated by Heracles Roman Hercules Passing beyond Cerberus the shades of the departed entered the land of the dead to be judged br The five rivers of the realm of Hades and their symbolic meanings are Acheron the river of sorrow or woe Cocytus lamentation Phlegethon fire Lethe oblivion and Styx hate the river upon which even the gods swore and in which Achilles was dipped to render him invincible The Styx forms the boundary between the upper and lower worlds See also Eridanos br The first region of Hades comprises the Fields of Asphodel described in Odyssey xi where the shades of heroes wander despondently among lesser spirits who twitter around them like bats Only libations of blood offered to them in the world of the living can reawaken in them for a time the sensations of humanity br Beyond lay Erebus which could be taken for a euphonym of Hades whose own name was dread There were two pools that of Lethe where the common souls flocked to erase all memory and the pool of Mnemosyne memory where the initiates of the Mysteries drank instead In the forecourt of the palace of Hades and Persephone sit the three judges of the underworld Minos Rhadamanthus and Aeacus There at the trivium sacred to Hecate where three roads meet souls are judged returned to the Fields of Asphodel if they are neither virtuous nor evil sent by the road to Tartarus if they are impious or evil or sent to Elysium Islands of the Blessed with the blameless heroes br In the Sibylline oracles a curious hodgepodge of Greco Roman and Judaeo Christian elements Hades again appears as the abode of the dead and by way of folk etymology it even derives Hades from the name Adam the first man saying it is because he was the first to enter there Owing to its appearance in the New Testament of the Bible Hades also has a
