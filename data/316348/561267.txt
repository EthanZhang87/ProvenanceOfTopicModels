potion took effect for example if Creel touches the metal titanium his body clothes and wrecking ball takes on its appearance and properties He can absorb sufficient mass from a large object e g a building to attain the same height While in different alternate forms he still maintains his intellect capacity for speech and full physical movement although his first attempt at absorbing water
