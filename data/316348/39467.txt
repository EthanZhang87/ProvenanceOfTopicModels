Steffens returned to Copenhagen after a long visit to Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling in Germany He was full of new romantic ideas His lectures at the university in which Goethe and Schiller were revealed to the Danish public for the first time created a great sensation Steffens and Oehlenschl ger met one day resulting in a conversation of sixteen hours After Oehlenschl ger returned home he wrote at a sitting his poem Guldhornene in a manner totally new to Danish literature The result of his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems published in now
