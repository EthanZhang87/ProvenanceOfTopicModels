Thor from Old Norse rr is a prominent god in Germanic paganism In Norse mythology he is a hammer wielding god associated with lightning thunder storms sacred groves and trees strength the protection of humankind hallowing and fertility Besides Old Norse rr the deity occurs in Old English as unor Thunor in Old Frisian as Thuner in Old Saxon as Thunar and in Old High German as Donar all ultimately stemming from the Proto Germanic theonym un a raz meaning Thunder br Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples from the Roman occupation of regions of Germania to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period to his high popularity during the Viking Age when in the face of the process of the Christianization of Scandinavia emblems of his hammer Mj lnir were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity br Narratives featuring Thor are most prominently attested in Old Norse where Thor appears throughout Norse mythology In stories recorded in medieval Iceland Thor bears at least fifteen names is the husband of the golden haired goddess Sif and the lover of the j tunn J rnsaxa With Sif Thor fathered the goddess and possible valkyrie r r with J rnsaxa he fathered Magni with a mother whose name is not recorded he fathered M i and he is the stepfather of the god Ullr Thor is the son of Odin and J r by way of his father Odin he has numerous brothers including Baldr Thor has two servants j lfi and R skva rides in a cart or chariot pulled by two goats Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj str whom he eats and resurrects and is ascribed three dwellings Bilskirnir r heimr and r vangr Thor wields the hammer Mj lnir wears the belt Megingj r and the iron gloves J rngreipr and owns the staff Gr arv lr Thor s exploits including his relentless slaughter of his foes and fierce battles with the monstrous serpent J rmungandr and their foretold mutual deaths during the events of Ragnar k are recorded throughout sources for Norse mythology br Into the modern period Thor continued to be acknowledged in folklore throughout Germanic speaking Europe Thor is frequently referred to in place names the day of the week Thursday bears his name modern English Thursday derives from Old English unresd unor s day and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today particularly in Scandinavia Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture Like other Germanic deities veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in Heathenry br br The name Thor is derived from Norse mythology Its medieval Germanic equivalents or cognates are Donar Old High German unor Old English Thuner Old Frisian Thunar Old Saxon and rr Old Norse the latter of which inspired the form Thor Though Old Norse rr has only one syllable it too comes from an earlier Proto Norse two syllable form which can be reconstructed as unarr and or unurr evidenced by the poems Hymiskvi a and rsdr pa and modern Elfdalian t osdag Thursday through the common Old Norse development of the sequence unr to r br All these forms of Thor s name descend from Proto Germanic but there is debate as to precisely what form the name took at that early stage The form unraz has been suggested and has the attraction of clearly containing the sequence unr needed to explain the later form rr The form unuraz is suggested by Elfdalian t osdag Thursday and by a runic inscription from around from Hallbj ns in Sundre Gotland which includes the sequence unur urus Finally unaraz is attractive because it is identical to the name of the ancient Celtic god Taranus by metathesis switch of sounds of an earlier Tonaros attested in the dative tanaro and the Gaulish river name Tanarus and further related to the Latin epithet Tonans attached to Jupiter via the common Proto Indo European root for thunder s tenh According to scholar Peter Jackson those theonyms may have emerged as the result of the fossilization of an original epithet or epiclesis i e invocational name of the Proto Indo European thunder god Perkwunos since the Vedic weather god Parjanya is also called stanayitn Thunderer The potentially perfect match between the thunder gods Tonaros and unaraz which both go back to a common form ton a ros t ros is notable in the context of early Celtic Germanic linguistic contacts especially when added to other inherited terms with thunder attributes such as Meldunjaz meldo from meldh lightning hammer i e Perkwunos weapon and Fergunja Fercuny from perkwun iy wooded mountains i e Perkwunos realm br The English weekday name Thursday comes from Old English unresd g meaning day of unor with influence from Old Norse rsdagr The name is cognate with Old High German Donarestag All of these terms derive from a Late Proto Germanic weekday name along the lines of unaresdagaz Day of un a raz a calque of Latin Iovis dies Day of Jove cf modern Italian gioved French jeudi Spanish jueves By employing a practice known as interpretatio germanica during the Roman period ancient Germanic peoples adopted the Latin weekly calendar and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own br Beginning in the Viking Age personal names containing the theonym rr are recorded with great frequency whereas no examples are known prior to this period rr based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization similar to the widespread Viking Age practice of wearing Thor s hammer pendants br br The earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans and in these works Thor is frequently referred to via a process known as interpretatio romana where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non Roman god as a Roman deity as either the Roman god Jupiter also known as Jove or the Greco Roman god Hercules br The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian Tacitus s late first century work Germania where writing about the religion of the Suebi a confederation of Germanic peoples he comments that among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him on fixed days human as well as other sacrificial victims Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind and adds that a portion of the Suebi also venerate Isis In this instance Tacitus refers to the god Odin as Mercury Thor as Hercules and the god T r as Mars and the identity of the Isis of the Suebi has been debated In Thor s case the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor s hammer and Hercules club In his Annals Tacitus again refers to the veneration of Hercules by the Germanic peoples he records a wood beyond the river Weser in what is now northwestern Germany as dedicated to him A deity known as Hercules Magusanus was venerated in Germania Inferior due to the Roman identification of Thor with Hercules Rudolf Simek has suggested that Magusanus was originally an epithet attached to the Proto Germanic deity unraz br br The first recorded instance of the name of the god appears upon the Nordendorf fibulae a piece of jewelry created during the Migration Period and found in Bavaria The item bears an Elder Futhark inscribed with the name onar i e Donar the southern Germanic form of Thor s name br Around the second half of the th century Old English texts mention Thunor unor which likely refers to a Saxon version of the god In relation Thunor is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss Jupiter the god may be referenced in the poem Solomon and Saturn where the thunder strikes the devil with a fiery axe and the Old English expression unorr d thunder ride may refer to the god s thunderous goat led chariot br A th century AD codex from Mainz Germany known as the Old Saxon Baptismal Vow records the name of three Old Saxon gods UU den Old Saxon Wodan Saxn te and Thunaer by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally converting to Christianity br According to a near contemporary account the Christian missionary Saint Boniface felled an oak tree dedicated to Jove in the th century the Donar s Oak in the region of Hesse Germany br The Kentish royal legend probably th century contains the story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as unores hl we Old English Thunor s mound Gabriel Turville Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god s name br br In the th century chronicler Adam of Bremen records in his Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum that a statue of Thor who Adam describes as mightiest sits in the Temple at Uppsala in the center of a triple throne flanked by Woden and Fricco located in Gamla Uppsala Sweden Adam details that Thor they reckon rules the sky he governs thunder and lightning winds and storms fine weather and fertility and that Thor with his mace looks like Jupiter Adam details that the people of Uppsala had appointed priests to each of the gods and that the priests were to offer up sacrifices In Thor s case he continues these sacrifices were done when plague or famine threatened Earlier in the same work Adam relays that in an English preacher Wulfred was lynched by assembled Germanic pagans for profaning a representation of Thor br Two objects with runic inscriptions invoking Thor date from the th century one from England and one from Sweden The first the Canterbury Charm from Canterbury England calls upon Thor to heal a wound by banishing a thurs The second the Kvinneby amulet invokes protection by both Thor and his hammer br On four or possibly five runestones an invocation to Thor appears that reads May Thor hallow these runes this monument The invocation appears thrice in Denmark DR DR and DR and a single time in V sterg tland VG Sweden A fifth appearance may possibly occur on a runestone found in S dermanland Sweden S but the reading is contested br Pictorial representations of Thor s hammer appear on a total of five runestones found in Denmark DR and DR and in the Swedish counties of V sterg tland VG and S dermanland S and S It is also seen on runestone DR The design is believed to be a heathen response to Christian runestones which often have a cross at the centre One of the stones S shows a face or mask above the hammer Anders Hultg rd has argued that this is the face of Thor At least three stones depict Thor fishing for the serpent J rmungandr the H rdum stone in Thy Denmark the Altuna Runestone in Altuna Sweden and the Gosforth Cross in Gosforth England Sune Lindqvist argued in the s that the image stone Ardre VIII on Gotland depicts two scenes from the story Thor ripping the head of Hymir s ox and Thor and Hymir in the boat but this has been disputed br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In the th century more than a century after Norway was officially Christianized Thor was still being invoked by the population as evidenced by a stick bearing a runic message found among the Bryggen inscriptions in Bergen Norway On the stick both Thor and Odin are called upon for help Thor is asked to receive the reader and Odin to own them br br In the Poetic Edda compiled during the th century from traditional source material reaching into the pagan period Thor appears or is mentioned in the poems V lusp Gr mnism l Sk rnism l H rbar slj Hymiskvi a Lokasenna rymskvi a Alv ssm l and Hyndlulj br br In the poem V lusp a dead v lva recounts the history of the universe and foretells the future to the disguised god Odin including the death of Thor Thor she foretells will do battle with the great serpent during the immense mythic war waged at Ragnar k and there he will slay the monstrous snake yet after he will only be able to take nine steps before succumbing to the venom of the beast br br Afterwards says the v lva the sky will turn black before fire engulfs the world the stars will disappear flames will dance before the sky steam will rise the world will be covered in water and then it will be raised again green and fertile br br In the poem Gr mnism l the god Odin in disguise as Gr mnir and tortured starved and thirsty imparts in the young Agnar cosmological lore including that Thor resides in r heimr and that every day Thor wades through the rivers K rmt and rmt and the two Kerlaugar There Gr mnir says Thor sits as judge at the immense cosmological world tree Yggdrasil br In Sk rnism l the god Freyr s messenger Sk rnir threatens the fair Ger r with whom Freyr is smitten with numerous threats and curses including that Thor Freyr and Odin will be angry with her and that she risks their potent wrath br Thor is the main character of H rbar slj where after traveling from the east he comes to an inlet where he encounters a ferryman who gives his name as H rbar r Odin again in disguise and attempts to hail a ride from him The ferryman shouting from the inlet is immediately rude and obnoxious to Thor and refuses to ferry him At first Thor holds his tongue but H rbar r only becomes more aggressive and the poem soon becomes a flyting match between Thor and H rbar r all the while revealing lore about the two including Thor s killing of several j tnar in the east and women on Hlesey now the Danish island of L s In the end Thor ends up walking instead br br Thor is again the main character in the poem Hymiskvi a where after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey they have an urge to drink They sh ake the twigs and interpret what they say The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at gir s home Thor arrives at gir s home and finds him to be cheerful looks into his eyes and tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods Annoyed gir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere However T r tells Thor that he may have a solution east of liv gar lives Hymir and he owns such a deep kettle br So after Thor secures his goats at Egil s home Thor and T r go to Hymir s hall in search of a cauldron large enough to brew ale for them all They arrive and T r sees his nine hundred headed grandmother and his gold clad mother the latter of which welcomes them with a horn After Hymir who is not happy to see Thor comes in from the cold outdoors T r s mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron Thor eats a big meal of two oxen all the rest eat but one and then goes to sleep In the morning he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to go fishing the following evening and that he will catch plenty of food but that he needs bait Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture which he expects should not be a problem for Thor Thor goes out finds Hymir s best ox and rips its head off br After a lacuna in the manuscript of the poem Hymiskvi a abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat out at sea Hymir catches a few whales at once and Thor baits his line with the head of the ox Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent J rmungandr bites Thor pulls the serpent on board and violently slams him in the head with his hammer J rmungandr shrieks and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another lacuna appears in the manuscript br After the second lacuna Hymir is sitting in the boat unhappy and totally silent as they row back to shore On shore Hymir suggests that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm Thor picks both the boat and the whales up and carries it all back to Hymir s farm After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir s head on T r s mother s suggestion Thor and T r are given the cauldron T r cannot lift it but Thor manages to roll it and so with it they leave Some distance from Hymir s home an army of many headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two but are killed by the hammer of Thor Although one of his goats is lame in the leg the two manage to bring the cauldron back have plenty of ale and so from then on return to T r s for more every winter br br In the poem Lokasenna the half god Loki angrily flites with the gods in the sea entity gir s hall Thor does not attend the event however as he is away in the east for unspecified purposes Towards the end of the poem the flyting turns to Sif Thor s wife whom Loki then claims to have slept with The god Freyr s servant Beyla interjects and says that since all of the mountains are shaking she thinks that Thor is on his way home Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel to which Loki responds with insults br Thor arrives and tells Loki to be silent and threatens to rip Loki s head from his body with his hammer Loki asks Thor why he is so angry and comments that Thor will not be so daring to fight the wolf Fenrir when it eats Odin a reference to the foretold events of Ragnar k Thor again tells him to be silent and threatens to throw him into the sky where he will never be seen again Loki says that Thor should not brag of his time in the east as he once crouched in fear in the thumb of a glove a story involving deception by the magic of tgar a Loki recounted in the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning which he comments was hardly like Thor Thor again tells him to be silent threatening to break every bone in Loki s body Loki responds that he intends to live a while yet and again insults Thor with references to his encounter with tgar a Loki Thor responds with a fourth call to be silent and threatens to send Loki to Hel At Thor s final threat Loki gives in commenting that only for Thor will he leave the hall for I know alone that you do strike and the poem continues br br In the comedic poem rymskvi a Thor again plays a central role In the poem Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer Mj lnir is missing Thor turns to Loki and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen The two go to the dwelling of the goddess Freyja and so that he may attempt to find Mj lnir Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak Freyja agrees and says she would lend it to Thor even if it were made of silver or gold and Loki flies off the feather cloak whistling br In J tunheimr the j tunn rymr sits on a barrow plaiting golden collars for his female dogs and trimming the manes of his horses rymr sees Loki and asks what could be amiss among the sir and the elves why is Loki alone in J tunheimr Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the sir that Thor s hammer Mj lnir is gone rymr says that he has hidden Mj lnir eight leagues beneath the earth from which it will be retrieved but only if Freyja is brought to him as his wife Loki flies off the feather cloak whistling away from J tunheimr and back to the court of the gods br Thor asks Loki if his efforts were successful and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as tales often escape a sitting man and the man lying down often barks out lies Loki states that it was indeed an effort and also a success for he has discovered that rymr has the hammer but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to rymr as his wife The two return to Freyja and tell her to put on a bridal head dress as they will drive her to J tunheimr Freyja indignant and angry goes into a rage causing all of the halls of the sir to tremble in her anger and her necklace the famed Br singamen falls from her Freyja pointedly refuses br As a result the gods and goddesses meet and hold a thing to discuss and debate the matter At the thing the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that in place of Freyja Thor should be dressed as the bride complete with jewels women s clothing down to his knees a bridal head dress and the necklace Br singamen Thor rejects the idea yet Loki interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj lnir Loki points out that without Mj lnir the j tnar will be able to invade and settle in Asgard The gods dress Thor as a bride and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid and that the two shall drive to J tunheimr together br After riding together in Thor s goat driven chariot the two disguised arrive in J tunheimr rymr commands the j tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches for Freyja has arrived to be his wife rymr recounts his treasured animals and objects stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth br Early in the evening the disguised Loki and Thor meet with rymr and the assembled j tnar Thor eats and drinks ferociously consuming entire animals and three casks of mead rymr finds the behavior at odds with his impression of Freyja and Loki sitting before rymr and appearing as a very shrewd maid makes the excuse that Freyja s behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive rymr then lifts Freyja s veil and wants to kiss her Terrifying eyes stare back at him seemingly burning with fire Loki says that this is because Freyja has not slept for eight nights in her eagerness br The wretched sister of the j tnar appears asks for a bridal gift from Freyja and the j tnar bring out Mj lnir to sanctify the bride to lay it on her lap and marry the two by the hand of the goddess V r Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer takes hold of it strikes rymr beats all of the j tnar kills their older sister and so gets his hammer back br br In the poem Alv ssm l Thor tricks a dwarf Alv ss to his doom upon finding that he seeks to wed his daughter unnamed possibly r r As the poem starts Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and apparently realizes that the bride is his daughter Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone and that the dwarf must seek his consent To do so Thor says Alv ss must tell him what he wants to know about all of the worlds that the dwarf has visited In a long question and answer session Alv ss does exactly that he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world and gives an amount of cosmological lore br However the question and answer session turns out to be a ploy by Thor as although Thor comments that he has truly never seen anyone with more wisdom in their breast Thor has managed to delay the dwarf enough for the Sun to turn him to stone day dawns on you now dwarf now sun shines on the hall br In the poem Hyndlulj Freyja offers to the j tunn woman Hyndla to bl t sacrifice to Thor so that she may be protected and comments that Thor does not care much for j tunn women br br The prologue to the Prose Edda euhemerises Thor as a prince of Troy and the son of Menon by Troana a daughter of Priam Thor also known as Tror is said to have married the prophetess Sibyl identified with Sif Thor is further said here to have been raised in Thrace by a chieftain named Lorikus whom he later slew to assume the title of King of Thrace to have had a pale complexion and hair fairer than gold and to have been strong enough to lift ten bearskins In later sagas he is described as red bearded but there is no evidence for a red beard in the Eddas br The name of the sir is explained as men from Asia Asgard being the Asian city i e Troy Alternatively Troy is in Tyrkland Turkey i e Asia Minor and Asialand is Scythia where Thor founded a new city named Asgard Odin is a remote descendant of Thor removed by twelve generations who led an expedition across Germany Denmark and Sweden to Norway br In the Prose Edda Thor is mentioned in all four books Prologue Gylfaginning Sk ldskaparm l and H ttatal br In Heimskringla composed in the th century by Snorri Sturluson Thor or statues of Thor are mentioned in Ynglinga saga H konar saga g a lafs saga Tryggvasonar and l fs saga helga In Ynglinga saga chapter a heavily euhemerized account of the gods is provided where Thor is described as having been a gothi a pagan priest who was given by Odin who himself is explained away as having been an exceedingly powerful magic wielding chieftain from the east a dwelling in the mythical location of r vangr in what is now Sweden The saga narrative adds that numerous names at the time of the narrative popularly in use were derived from Thor br br Around the th century folk traditions and iconography of the Christianizing king Olaf II of Norway Saint Olaf c absorbed elements of both Thor and Freyr After Olaf s death his cult had spread quickly all over Scandinavia where many churches were dedicated to him as well as to other parts of Northern Europe His cult distinctively mixed both ecclesiastical and folk elements From Thor he inherited the quick temper physical strength and merits as a giant slayer Early depictions portray Olaf as clean shaven but after he appears with a red beard For centuries Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of trolls and giants and as a protector against malicious forces br br Tales about Thor or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor continued into the modern period particularly in Scandinavia Writing in the th century scholar Jacob Grimm records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god such as the Norwegian Thorsvarme Thor s warmth for lightning and the Swedish godgubben far The good old fellow is taking a ride as well as the word tord n Thor s rumble or Thor s thunder when it thunders Grimm comments that at times Scandinavians often no longer liked to utter the god s real name or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness In Sweden it was probably as a euphemism that people referred to thunder as the ride of the god s kia OWN ss ekja resulting in the modern Swedish word for thunder ska br Thor remained pictured as a red bearded figure as evident by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as Thor med sit lange sk g Thor with his long beard and the North Frisian curse diis ruadhiiret donner regiir let red haired thunder see to that br A Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away trolls and j tnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales and may be a late reflection of Thor s role in fighting such beings In connection the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes br In the Netherlands The Sagas of Veluwe has a story called Ontstaan van het Uddeler en Bleeke meer which features Thor and his fight with the Winter Giants br br Around pendants in distinctive shapes representing the hammer of Thor have been unearthed in what are today the Nordic countries England northern Germany the Baltic countries and Russia Most have very simple designs in iron or silver Around have more advanced designs with ornaments The pendants have been found in a variety of contexts including at urban sites and in hoards and occur in a variety of shapes Similarly coins featuring depictions of the hammer have also been discovered br The Eyrarland Statue a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri Iceland dating from around the th century may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The swastika symbol has been identified as representing the hammer or lightning of Thor Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson comments on the usage of the swastika as a symbol of Thor br br The protective sign of the hammer was worn by women as we know from the fact that it has been found in women s graves It seems to have been used by the warrior also in the form of the swastika Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire and to have been linked with the sun wheel It may have been on account of Thor s association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor When we find it on the pommel of a warrior s sword and on his sword belt the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God s protection br br Swastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age such as the rd century V rl se Fibula DR EM from Zealand Denmark the Gothic spearhead from Brest Litovsk Belarus numerous Migration Period bracteates cremation urns from early Anglo Saxon England the th century S b sword from Sogn Norway and the th century Snoldelev Stone DR from Rams Denmark br br Numerous place names in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name rr The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of rr as a personal name element Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements v signifying the location of a v a type of pagan Germanic shrine h f a structure used for religious purposes see heathen hofs and lundr a holy grove The place name rslundr is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland such as Coill Tomair whereas rshof appears particularly often in southern Norway Tors Thor s Island appears on the Swedish west coast Thor also appears in many place names in Uppland br In English place names Old English Thunor in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name later introduced to the Danelaw left comparatively few traces Examples include Thundersley from Thunores hl w and Thurstable Old English Thunor s pillar F M Stenton noted that such place names were apparently restricted to Saxon and Jutish territory and not found in Anglian areas br In what is now Germany locations named after Thor are sparsely recorded but a number of locations called Donnersberg German Donner s mountain may derive their name from the deity Donner the southern Germanic form of the god s name br In as late as the th century in Iceland a specific breed of fox was known as holta rr Thor of the holt likely due to the red coat of the breed In Sweden in the th century smooth wedge shaped stones found in the earth were called Thorwiggar Thor s wedges according to a folk belief that they were once hurled at a troll by the god Thor Compare Thunderstones Similarly meteorites may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight On the Swedish island of Gotland a species of beetle Scarab us stercorarius was named after the god the Thorbagge When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over Thor s favor may be gained In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization where the insect came to be known as Thordedjefvul or Thordyfvel both meaning Thor devil br In the northwest of Spain there is a river called Tor o in the municipality of C rmenes Le n that take name from the god Thor br br Thor closely resembles other Indo European deities associated with the thunder the Celtic Taranis the Estonian Taara or Tharapita the Baltic Perk nas the Slavic Perun and particularly the Hindu Indra whose thunderbolt weapon the vajra is an obvious parallels noted already by Max M ller Scholars have compared Indra s slaying of Vritra with Thor s battle with J rmungandr Although in the past it was suggested that Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia these Indo European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto Indo European deity br In Georges Dum zil s trifunctional hypothesis of Indo European religion Thor represents the second function that of strength Dum zil notes that as a result of displacements he does not lead armies most of the functions of Indra have been in effect taken over by Odin Many scholars have noted the association of Thor with fertility particularly in later folklore and in the reflex of him represented by the Sami Hora galles Good man Thor For Dum zil this is the preservation by peasants of only the side effect of the god s atmospheric battles the fertilizing rain Others have emphasized Thor s close connection to humanity in all its concerns Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson summarizes br br The cult of Thor was linked with men s habitation and possessions and with the well being of the family and community This included the fruitfulness of the fields and Thor although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round In our own times little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring Thor s marriage with Sif of the golden hair about which we hear little in the myths seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile In this way Thor as well as Odin may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age br br In modern times Thor continues to be referred to in art and fiction Starting with F J Klopstock s ode to Thor Wir und Sie Thor has been the subject of poems in several languages including Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl ger s epic poem Thors reise til Jotunheim and by the same author three more poems Hammeren hentes Thors fiskeri and Thor bes ger Hymir
