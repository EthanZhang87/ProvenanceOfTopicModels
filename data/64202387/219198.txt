Camera and Game Boy Printer br Tanaka s soundtrack credits include Metroid Kid Icarus Super Mario Land Tetris Mother Dr Mario and EarthBound He was the president and executive director of Creatures from to before resigning and becoming creative fellow in the company br br br Biography br br br Early life br Born to a schoolteacher mother who had Tanaka undergo piano lessons Tanaka recounted that he first began paying serious attention to music while in elementary school and attempted to form a band during that time His first band was formed when he was in middle school a Beatles and Elton John cover group which sometimes performed concerts at his school He has held a longstanding obsession with reggae music In his teens he was also in a reggae band which was known variously by the names the Shampoos or Roots Rockers For the music event Reggae Sunsplash held in Osaka the Shampoos were an opening act for Sly and Robbie on more than one occasion Tanaka did meet the duo during those times On The Shampoos Tanaka described it as an obscure local band which did gigs in Tokyo about once or twice a year and that it was never a formal thing br br br Employment at Nintendo br In after graduating from university with a degree in electronic engineering Tanaka successfully applied for a job at Nintendo as a sound designer He did not initially want to be an engineer but Nintendo were accordingly scouting for different sounds or toys or something at the time I thought toys would be relatively stress free so I applied The first game Tanaka worked on was Space Firebird where Tanaka was composer and constructed a new sound chip for particular sound effects Following this Tanaka worked on Donkey Kong providing the sound effects for Mario s footsteps and jumps Usually the same sound effect was repeated across many different actions but Tanaka s approach differed where he invented subtle variations He attempted to insert voice synthesis for the game s damsel in distress but the idea was vetoed by then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi s daughter who did not feel that the sample sounded like the exclamation help me Tanaka noted that he learned a lot from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto due to his perfectionism and level of commitment br Donkey Kong was the first game where Tanaka acted both as composer and sound effects designer His approach to game composition carried on from his dub obsession For instance if you listen to the music in Wrecking Crew you could recognize that some parts are drum and bass only So that turned out to be an idea for working around the limitations of the game software I figured that to get the most out of the game music a dub based structure would be a really great solution I d play the melody in some parts then cut it off and insert a part with just drums and bass and vice versa No one else was doing it but it was what I wanted to do Tanaka described what he remembered as a typical day at Nintendo in the brief period following the release of the Famicom home game console br br Everything just stayed the same From morning to night we made new circuits and developed software We had computers for work but they were TTY devices they had no monitors Back and forth morning to night Sometimes designing hardware and sometimes creating software Back and forth for me at least I d work from AM to as late as or in the morning They didn t make us do it It was just fun We talk about the history of games but for me the history of games and computers overlap If anything I think it was more of the history of the evolution of computers I studied all about computers after I joined Nintendo I think our generation of Nintendo employees were all the same We learned as we went built our own systems and built them again For instance we made our own development tools So everything was handmade It was really fun There was a continuous stream of new jobs and you d go from one to the next br While working full time at Nintendo on two or three games a year and sometimes two simultaneously Tanaka continued playing gigs in Osaka and Tokyo with the Shampoos Sometime in the late s they recorded the rpm Thunder Dub which prominently sampled the opening drumbeat from the Beatles Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band Reprise Tanaka did not personally see a difference between the music he composed for video games and the music he composed in his off time For Metroid Tanaka acknowledged that games were becoming more complex and his scores were becoming more like a film s desiring in Metroid not to repeat the same game melody cliches although he recalls that the game s soundtrack was not well received within Nintendo because of its dark atmosphere He was inspired by the film Birdy to create a game score that was dark until the very end where the player would finally receive music with a strong melody Despite disapproval from his Nintendo colleagues Tanaka was allowed full creative freedom on projects and even had a fluctuating role in influencing some games content and play style He remembers Nintendo s strict repeated criticisms over the amount of fun a game would have but that there was no financial pressure in creating games nor were there sales quotas to meet At the time of Dr Mario Tanaka began observing an increasing number of serious game composers who had graduated from music schools Dr Mario was thus the first time Tanaka had asserted his musical personality in a game br br Tanaka was one of about five or six Nintendo based developers who designed the Game Boy researching and creating its audio hardware He was inspired to develop the Game Boy Camera from a product called ViewCam that was popular at the time Tanaka also ran experiments on the possibility of watching television via the Game Boy br br br Creatures Inc br At the advice of EarthBound co worker Tsunekazu Ishihara Tanaka would join Creatures as a guest composer where he would end up composing dozens of songs for the first Japanese Pok mon anime and various Pok mon promotional releases Despite the fact that his themes were not used in the West they inspired best selling singles and albums in Japan due to their popularity there Tanaka was eventually forbidden by Nintendo to continue to write more songs for the anime due to their policy of not allowing employees to work for other companies so he resigned at Nintendo and joined Creatures full time in br Tanaka succeeded Ishihara to become the president of Creatures in while Ishihara continued as CEO Starting in the late s Tanaka began to perform at Japanese dance clubs under the name Chip Tanaka The moniker was suggested by a foreign acquaintance as Tanaka thought Hip Tanaka was too attached to his time at Nintendo br After the death of Satoru Iwata in Tanaka wrote a tribute track titled Dedicated to Satoru Iwata In April Tanaka announced he was stepping down as president and executive director of Creatures but would remain as a Creative Fellow br br br Influences br Tanaka has said that his tastes in his youth were typical of the time listening to artists such as the Beatles and the Carpenters His first exposure to dub music was through the album Negrea Love Dub by Linval Thompson while eating pasta at a restaurant with live music in Kyoto It was the record s use of exaggerated tape delay which astounded Tanaka who stopped eating every time he heard it occur I thought Is this music sick But the more I listened to it that groove with the bass line and the mixer I think the mixer takes full control of it directly and instinctively When I felt it I thought This is amazing I was totally hooked Tanaka explained his fascination with reggae music and his application for it in his game scores It wasn t proactive on my part I was a music lover that happened to be working at Nintendo The reason I like reggae especially dub is because there actually is vocal and guitar on it let s say but in the essence it s strictly driven by drums and bass That s what I love about it the most I think I like how there s this raw aspect to it The gritty raw quality of the sound let s say That really caught my ears And that deep bass sound the buuu That was something I never heard before in rock music It drove me like no other genre in music br Among specific musical influences Tanaka has cited Brian Wilson Randy Newman Stackridge Yabby U the Flying Lizards Prince Lalo Rodriguez My Bloody Valentine Frank Zappa Keiichi Suzuki Hal Willner s various artists compilations Sly Dunbar Jah Wobble and the Slits The hip in Hip Tanaka came from hip hop with his favorite artist of the genre being A Tribe Called Quest br br br Works br br br br br br External links br Official website in Japanese br Hirokazu Tanaka
