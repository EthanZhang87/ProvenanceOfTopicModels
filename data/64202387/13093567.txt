title: Minus World
id: 13093567
The Minus World Japanese is a glitched level found in the video game Super Mario Bros It can be encountered by maneuvering the protagonist Mario in a particular way to trick the game into sending him to the wrong area Players who enter this area are greeted with an endless looping water level in the original Famicom NES cartridge versions while the version released for the Famicom Disk System sends them to a sequence of three different levels this difference is due to the data being arranged in different ways between the two versions It gained exposure in part thanks to the magazine Nintendo Power discussing how the glitch is encountered Super Mario Bros creator Shigeru Miyamoto denied that the addition of the Minus World was intentional though he later commented that the fact that it does not crash the game could make it count as a game feature br The existence and revelation of this glitch led to rumors being spread about further secrets existing in Super Mario Bros It is recognized as one of the greatest secrets and glitches in video game history with the term Minus World coming to refer to areas in games that exist outside of normal parameters such as in The Legend of Zelda Frog Fractions designer Jim Stormdancer cited it as inspiration for making Frog Fractions the way he did while Spelunky creator Derek Yu talked about his nostalgia for Minus World lamenting a lack of mystique found in modern games References to the Minus World can be found in both Super Paper Mario and Super Meat Boy br br br Summary br The Minus World is accessed from World In order to encounter it players must exploit a glitch in order to maneuver Mario through the bricks separating the normal exit from the Warp Zone area So long as players do not lock the screen in position players can make Mario enter the first Warp Pipe before the Welcome to Warp Zone text is revealed However if the glitch is performed carefully players can make it to the other pipes The second pipe will lead to world while the third will also lead to the minus world The console did not have a method to check for collisions between tiles and the task of checking all points around a tile for possible collision points was too difficult for the console s MOS Technology To compensate for this the designers put boundary boxes around objects and compare a limited number of collision boundaries Mario s sprite has two points one on each foot each detecting his collision with the floor The game would normally eject Mario in the opposite direction he is going if he is considered inside a block which can be averted by crouching while jumping into it and at the exact right moment pushing left causing him to be ejected on the other side of the wall The game then erroneously sets the far left and far right Warp Pipes to send him to World When players successfully pull this off they are presented with a screen reading World and then Mario is put in a water level that loops the end with the beginning and as a result cannot be beaten It is a copy of the stage World aside from the looping Despite the appearance and the popular name Minus World it is not in fact a negative level number Rather the level is identified in the internal memory as World but when it displayed a blank tile is shown as is the tile number for a blank space The reason the glitch occurs is because of a misread byte br The Japanese version of the game on the Famicom Disk System has a different result from performing the glitch instead of looping after Mario reaches the end of the level it goes through three different levels until players reach the goal and the game ending The Japanese levels start with an underwater level as well with floating Princess Peach and Bowser sprites at multiple points The reason why the two versions Minus Worlds differ is due to the North American version using a cartridge and the Japanese version using a disk Cartridges and disks arrange data in different ways resulting in the different versions sending the offset the Warp Pipe receives arriving at a different byte in the programming br br br History br When Super Mario Bros creator Shigeru Miyamoto was asked about the Minus World he denied authorship and said that it was not intended When asked later about the Minus World Miyamoto commented that while it was a glitch the fact that it does not crash the game makes it a feature as well Since its discovery the Minus World has resulted in people believing that Super Mario Bros designers hid secret levels for skilled players to find It was featured in the third issue of Nintendo Power describing it as an endless water world from which no one has ever escaped This appearance provided photographic evidence of the glitch br br br Reception br The Minus World was an incredible phenomenon and has become well known over time according to Screen Rant becoming a part of the video game design lexicon Siliconera staff called it legendary while Game Informer writer Ian Boudreau called it one of gaming s most famous glitches Kotaku writer Jason Schreier wrote that it was seared into video game history Nintendo Life writer Gavin Lane called it one of the most famous of Nintendo s glitches Edge staff discussed how its impact was purely symbolic and contextual discussing it as the glitch with the most lasting influence They felt that it was so appealing because it was relatively easy to accomplish suggesting that its early popularity influenced the trend of secret levels Both Screen Rant and GamesRadar made note of the fact that it is an infinite water level with Screen Rant calling it every gamer s worst nightmare GamesRadar Justin Towell called it one of the greatest video game secrets According to a game play counselor for Nintendo the Minus World was one of the most often requested tricks by callers br br br Legacy br The term Minus World has become a term to refer to an area outside of the parameters of the game with The Escapist identifying the Super Mario Bros instance as one of the first and most classic examples Glitches in other games have been referred to as a Minus World including the first The Legend of Zelda Frog Fractions and Frog Fractions designer Jim Stormdancer cited moments like the Minus World as his inspiration for creating these games wanting to recapture the sense of mystery these moments evoked Derek Yu creator of Spelunky discussed how he holds nostalgia for the Minus World calling it an incredible piece of lore for Super Mario Bros while lamenting how modern games lack that kind of mystique br The video game Super Paper Mario featured an area called The Underwhere which acts as a purgatory and is called World by one of its residents in reference to the glitch The video game Super Meat Boy features levels called Minus Warp Zones which make reference to the glitch br br br
