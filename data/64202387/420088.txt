title: Social mobility
id: 420088
Social mobility is the movement of individuals families households or other categories of people within or between social strata in a society It is a change in social status relative to one s current social location within a given society This movement occurs between layers or tiers in an open system of social stratification Open stratification systems are those in which at least some value is given to achieved status characteristics in a society The movement can be in a downward or upward direction Markers for social mobility such as education and class are used to predict discuss and learn more about an individual or a group s mobility in society br br br Typology br Mobility is most often quantitatively measured in terms of change in economic mobility such as changes in income or wealth Occupation is another measure used in researching mobility which usually involves both quantitative and qualitative analysis of data but other studies may concentrate on social class Mobility may be intragenerational within the same generation or intergenerational between different generations Intragenerational mobility is less frequent representing rags to riches cases in terms of upward mobility Intergenerational upward mobility is more common where children or grandchildren are in economic circumstances better than those of their parents or grandparents In the US this type of mobility is described as one of the fundamental features of the American Dream even though there is less such mobility than almost all other OECD countries br Mobility can also be defined in terms of relative or absolute mobility Absolute mobility looks at a person s progress in the areas of education health housing income job opportunities and other factors and compares it to some starting point usually the previous generation As technological advancements and economic development increase so do income levels and the conditions in which most people live In absolute terms people around the world on average are living better today than yesterday and in that sense have experienced absolute mobility Relative mobility looks at the mobility of a person in comparison to the mobility of others in the same cohort In more advanced economies and OECD countries there is more space for absolute mobility than for relative mobility because a person from an average status background may remain average thus no relative mobility but still increase their living standards because the average is increasing over time br There is also an idea of stickiness concerning mobility This is when an individual is no longer experiencing relative mobility and it occurs mostly at the ends At the bottom end of the socioeconomic ladder parents cannot provide their children with the necessary resources or opportunity to enhance their lives As a result they remain on the same ladder rung as their parents On the opposite side of the ladder the high socioeconomic status parents have the necessary resources and opportunities to ensure their children also remain in same ladder rung as them br br br Social status and social class br Social mobility is highly dependent on the overall structure of social statuses and occupations in a given society The extent of differing social positions and the manner in which they fit together or overlap provides the overall social structure of such positions Add to this the differing dimensions of status such as Max Weber s delineation of economic stature prestige and power and we see the potential for complexity in a given social stratification system Such dimensions within a given society can be seen as independent variables that can explain differences in social mobility at different times and places in different stratification systems In addition the same variables that contribute as intervening variables to the valuation of income or wealth and that also affect social status social class and social inequality do affect social mobility These include sex or gender race or ethnicity and age br Education provides one of the most promising chances of upward social mobility and attaining a higher social status regardless of current social standing However the stratification of social classes and high wealth inequality directly affects the educational opportunities and outcomes In other words social class and a family s socioeconomic status directly affect a child s chances for obtaining a quality education and succeeding in life By age five there are significant developmental differences between low middle and upper class children s cognitive and noncognitive skills br br Among older children evidence suggests that the gap between high and low income primary and secondary school students has increased by almost percent over the past thirty years These differences persist and widen into young adulthood and beyond Just as the gap in K test scores between high and low income students is growing the difference in college graduation rates between the rich and the poor is also growing Although the college graduation rate among the poorest households increased by about percentage points between those born in the early s and those born in the early s over this same period the graduation rate increased by almost percentage points for the wealthiest households br Average family income and social status have both seen a decrease for the bottom third of all children between and The th percentile of children and their families have seen up to a decrease in average family income The wealth gap between the rich and the poor the upper and lower class continues to increase as more middle class people get poorer and the lower class get even poorer As the socioeconomic inequality continues to increase in the United States being on either end of the spectrum makes a child more likely to remain there and never become socially mobile br br A child born to parents with income in the lowest quintile is more than ten times more likely to end up in the lowest quintile than the highest as an adult percent versus percent And a child born to parents in the highest quintile is five times more likely to end up in the highest quintile than the lowest percent versus percent br This may be partly due to lower and working class parents where neither is educated above high school diploma level spending less time on average with their children in their earliest years of life and not being as involved in their children s education and time out of school This parenting style known as accomplishment of natural growth differs from the style of middle class and upper class parents with at least one parent having higher education known as cultural cultivation More affluent social classes are able to spend more time with their children at early ages and children receive more exposure to interactions and activities that lead to cognitive and non cognitive development things like verbal communication parent child engagement and being read to daily These children s parents are much more involved in their academics and their free time placing them in extracurricular activities which develop not only additional non cognitive skills but also academic values habits and abilities to better communicate and interact with authority figures Enrollment in so many activities can often lead to frenetic family lives organized around transporting children to their various activities Lower class children often attend lower quality schools receive less attention from teachers and ask for help much less than their higher class peers br The chances for social mobility are primarily determined by the family a child is born into Today the gaps seen in both access to education and educational success graduating from a higher institution is even larger Today while college applicants from every socioeconomic class are equally qualified of all entering freshmen classes at top tier American institutions belong to the uppermost socioeconomic quartile A family s class determines the amount of investment and involvement parents have in their children s educational abilities and success from their earliest years of life leaving low income students with less chance for academic success and social mobility due to the effects that the common parenting style of the lower and working class have on their outlook on and success in education br br br Class cultures and social networks br These differing dimensions of social mobility can be classified in terms of differing types of capital that contribute to changes in mobility Cultural capital a term first coined by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu distinguishes between the economic and cultural aspects of class Bourdieu described three types of capital that place a person in a certain social category economic capital social capital and cultural capital Economic capital includes economic resources such as cash credit and other material assets Social capital includes resources one achieves based on group membership networks of influence relationships and support from other people Cultural capital is any advantage a person has that gives them a higher status in society such as education skills or any other form of knowledge Usually people with all three types of capital have a high status in society Bourdieu found that the culture of the upper social class is oriented more toward formal reasoning and abstract thought The lower social class is geared more towards matters of facts and the necessities of life He also found that the environment in which a person develops has a large effect on the cultural resources that a person will have br The cultural resources a person has obtained can heavily influence a child s educational success It has been shown that students raised under the concerted cultivation approach have an emerging sense of entitlement which leads to asking teachers more questions and being a more active student causing teachers to favor students raised in this manner This childrearing approach which creates positive interactions in the classroom environment is in contrast with the natural growth approach to childrearing In this approach which is more common amongst working class families parents do not focus on developing the special talents of their individual children and they speak to their children in directives Due to this it is rarer for a child raised in this manner to question or challenge adults and conflict arises between childrearing practices at home and school Children raised in this manner are less inclined to participate in the classroom setting and are less likely to go out of their way to positively interact with teachers and form relationships However the greater freedom of working class children gives them a broader range of local playmates closer relationships with cousins and extended family less sibling rivalry fewer complaints to their parents of being bored and fewer parent child arguments br In the United States links between minority underperformance in schools have been made with a lacking in the cultural resources of cultural capital social capital and economic capital yet inconsistencies persist even when these variables are accounted for Once admitted to institutions of higher education African Americans and Latinos continued to underperform relative to their white and Asian counterparts earning lower grades progressing at a slower rate and dropping out at higher rates More disturbing was the fact that these differentials persisted even after controlling for obvious factors such as SAT scores and family socioeconomic status br The theory of capital deficiency is among the most recognized explanations for minority underperformance academically that for whatever reason they simply lack the resources to find academic success One of the largest factors for this aside from the social economic and cultural capital mentioned earlier is human capital This form of capital identified by social scientists only in recent years has to do with the education and life preparation of children Human capital refers to the skills abilities and knowledge possessed by specific individuals This allows college educated parents who have large amounts of human capital to invest in their children in certain ways to maximize future success from reading to them at night to possessing a better understanding of the school system which causes them to be less deferential to teachers and school authorities Research also shows that well educated black parents are less able to transmit human capital to their children when compared to their white counterparts due to a legacy of racism and discrimination br br br Markers br br br Health br The term social gradient in health refers to the idea that the inequalities in health are connected to the social status a person has Two ideas concerning the relationship between health and social mobility are the social causation hypothesis and the health selection hypothesis These hypotheses explore whether health dictates social mobility or whether social mobility dictates quality of health The social causation hypothesis states that social factors individual behavior and the environmental circumstances determine an individual s health Conversely the health selection hypothesis states that health determines what social stratum an individual will be in br There has been a lot of research investigating the relationship between socioeconomic status and health and which has the greater influence on the other A recent study has found that the social causation hypothesis is more empirically supported than the health selection hypothesis Empirical analysis shows no support for the health selection hypothesis Another study found support for either hypotheses depends on which lens the relationship between SES and health is being looked through The health selection hypothesis is supported when people looking at SES and health through labor market lens One possible reason for this is health dictates an individual s productivity and to a certain extent if the individual is employed While the social causation hypothesis is supported when looking at health and socioeconomic status relationship through an education and income lenses br br br Education br The systems of stratification that govern societies hinder or allow social mobility Education can be a tool used by individuals to move from one stratum to another in stratified societies Higher education policies have worked to establish and reinforce stratification Greater gaps in education quality and investment in students among elite and standard universities account for the lower upward social mobility of the middle class and or low class Conversely the upper class is known to be self reproducing since they have the necessary resources and money to afford and get into an elite university This class is self reproducing because these same students can then give the same opportunities to their children Another example of this is high and middle socioeconomic status parents are able to send their children to an early education program enhancing their chances at academic success in the later years br br br Housing br Mixed housing is the idea that people of different socioeconomic statuses can live in one area There is not a lot of research on the effects of mixed housing However the general consensus is that mixed housing will allow individuals of low socioeconomic status to acquire the necessary resources and social connections to move up the social ladder Other possible effects mixed housing can bring are positive behavioral changes and improved sanitation and safer living conditions for the low socioeconomic status residents This is because higher socioeconomic status individuals are more likely to demand higher quality residencies schools and infrastructure This type of housing is funded by profit nonprofit and public organizations br The existing research on mixed housing however shows that mixed housing does not promote or facilitate upward social mobility Instead of developing complex relationships among each other mixed housing residents of different socioeconomic statuses tend to engage in casual conversations and keep to themselves If noticed and unaddressed for a long period of time this can lead to the gentrification of a community br Outside of mixed housing individuals with a low socioeconomic status consider relationships to be more salient than the type of neighborhood they live to their prospects of moving up the social ladder This is because their income is often not enough to cover their monthly expenses including rent The strong relationships they have with others offers the support system they need in order for them to meet their monthly expenses At times low income families might decide to double up in a single residency to lessen the financial burden on each family However this type of support system that low socioeconomic status individuals have is still not enough to promote upward relative mobility br br br Income br Economic and social mobility are two separate entities Economic mobility is used primarily by economists to evaluate income mobility Conversely social mobility is used by sociologists to evaluate primarily class mobility How strongly economic and social mobility are related depends on the strength of the intergenerational relationship between class and income of parents and kids and the covariance between parents and children s class position br Additionally economic and social mobility can also be thought of as following the Great Gatsby curve This curve demonstrates that high levels of economic inequality fosters low rates of relative social mobility The culprit behind this model is the Economic Despair idea which states that as the gap between the bottom and middle of income distribution increases those who are at the bottom are less likely to invest in their human capital as they lose faith in their ability and fair chance to experience upward mobility An example of this is seen in education particularly in high school drop outs Low income status students who no longer see value in investing in their education after continuously failing to upgrade their social status br br br Race br Race as an influencer on social mobility stems from colonial times There has been discussion as to whether race can still hinder an individual s chances at upward mobility or whether class has a greater influence A study performed on the Brazilian population found that racial inequality was only present for those who did not belong to the high class status Meaning race affects an individual s chances at upward mobility if they do not begin at the upper class population Another theory concerning race and mobility is as time progresses racial inequality will be replaced by class inequality However other research has found that minorities particularly African Americans are still being policed and observed more at their jobs than their white counterparts The constant policing has often led to the frequent firing of African Americans In this case African Americans experience racial inequality that stunts their upward social mobility br br br Gender br Women in comparison to men experience less social mobility One possible reason for this is the poor quality or lack of education that females receive In countries like India it is common for educated women not use their education to move up the social ladder due to cultural and traditional customs They are expected to become homemakers and leave the bread winning to the men Additionally women around the world are denied an education as their families may find it more economically beneficial to invest in the education and wellbeing of their males instead of their females In the parent s eyes the son will be the one who provides for them in their old age while the daughter will move away with her husband The son will bring an income while the daughter might require a dowry to get married Moreover when women do enter the workforce they are highly unlikely to earn the same pay as their male counterparts Furthermore women can even differ in pay among each other due to race To combat these gender disparities the UN has made it one of their goals on the Millennium Development Goals reduce gender inequality This goal is accused of being too broad and having no action plan br br br Patterns of mobility br br While it is generally accepted that some level of mobility in society is desirable there is no consensus agreement upon how much social mobility is good for or bad for a society There is no international benchmark of social mobility though one can compare measures of mobility across regions or countries or within a given area over time While cross cultural studies comparing differing types of economies are possible comparing economies of similar type usually yields more comparable data Such comparisons typically look at intergenerational mobility examining the extent to which children born into different families have different life chances and outcomes br br In a study for which the results were first published in Wilkinson and Pickett conduct an exhaustive analysis of social mobility in developed countries In addition to other correlations with negative social outcomes for societies having high inequality they found a relationship between high social inequality and low social mobility Of the eight countries studied Canada Denmark Finland Sweden Norway Germany the UK and the US the US had both the highest economic inequality and lowest economic mobility In this and other studies in fact the US has very low mobility at the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder with mobility increasing slightly as one goes up the ladder At the top rung of the ladder however mobility again decreases br One study comparing social mobility between developed countries found that the four countries with the lowest intergenerational income elasticity i e the highest social mobility were Denmark Norway Finland and Canada with less than of advantages of having a high income parent passed on to their children br br Studies have also found a clear negative relationship between income inequality and intergenerational mobility Countries with low levels of inequality such as Denmark Norway and Finland had some of the greatest mobility while the two countries with the high level of inequality Chile and Brazil had some of the lowest mobility br In Britain much debate on social mobility has been generated by comparisons of the National Child Development Study NCDS and the Birth Cohort Study BCS which compare intergenerational mobility in earnings between the and the UK cohorts and claim that intergenerational mobility decreased substantially in this year period These findings have been controversial partly due to conflicting findings on social class mobility using the same datasets and partly due to questions regarding the analytical sample and the treatment of missing data UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown has famously said that trends in social mobility are not as we would have liked br Along with the aforementioned Do Poor Children Become Poor Adults study The Economist also stated that evidence from social scientists suggests that American society is much stickier than most Americans assume Some researchers claim that social mobility is actually declining A German study corroborates these results In spite of this low mobility Americans have had the highest belief in meritocracy among middle and high income countries A study of social mobility among the French corporate class has found that class continues to influence who reaches the top in France with those from the upper middle classes tending to dominate despite a longstanding emphasis on meritocracy br Thomas Piketty finds that wealth income ratios today seem to be returning to very high levels in low economic growth countries similar to what he calls the classic patrimonial wealth based societies of the th century wherein a minority lives off its wealth while the rest of the population works for subsistence living br Social mobility can also be influenced by differences that exist within education The contribution of education to social mobility often gets neglected in social mobility research although it really has the potential to transform the relationship between origins and destinations Recognizing the disparities between strictly location and its educational opportunities highlights how patterns of educational mobility are influencing the capacity for individuals to experience social mobility There is some debate regarding how important educational attainment is for social mobility A substantial literature argues that there is a direct effect of social origins DESO which cannot be explained by educational attainment However other evidence suggests that using a sufficiently fine grained measure of educational attainment taking on board such factors as university status and field of study education fully mediates the link between social origins and access to top class jobs br The patterns of educational mobility that exist between inner city schools versus schools in the suburbs is transparent Graduation rates supply a rich context to these patterns In the school year Detroit Public Schools observed a graduation rate of whereas Grosse Pointe High School Detroit suburb observed an average graduation rate of A similar phenomena was observed in Los Angeles California as well as in New York City Los Angeles Senior High School inner city observed a graduation rate of and San Marino High School suburb observed a graduation rate of New York City Geographic District Number Two inner city observed a graduation rate of and Westchester School District suburb observed a graduation rate of These patterns were observed across the country when assessing the differences between inner city graduation rates and suburban graduation rates br The economic grievance thesis argues that economic factors such as deindustrialisation economic liberalisation and deregulation are causing the formation of a left behind precariat with low job security high inequality and wage stagnation who then support populism Some theories only focus on the effect of economic crises or inequality Another objection for economic reasons is due to the globalization that is taking place in the world today In addition to criticism of the widening inequality caused by the elite the widening inequality among the general public caused by the influx of immigrants and other factors due to globalization is also a target of populist criticism br The evidence of increasing economic disparity and volatility of family incomes is clear particularly in the United States as shown by the work of Thomas Piketty and others Commentators such as Martin Wolf emphasize the importance of economics They warn that such trends increase resentment and make people susceptible to populist rhetoric Evidence for this is mixed At the macro level political scientists report that xenophobia anti immigrant ideas and resentment towards out groups tend to be higher during difficult economic times Economic crises have been associated with gains by far right political parties However there is little evidence at the micro or individual level to link individual economic grievances and populist support Populist politicians tend to put pressure on central bank independence br br br Influence of intelligence and education br Social status attainment and therefore social mobility in adulthood are of interest to psychologists sociologists political scientists economists epidemiologists and many more The reason behind the interest is because it indicates access to material goods educational opportunities healthy environments and economic growth br Researchers did a study that encompassed a wide range of data of individuals in lifetime in childhood and during mid adulthood Most of the Scottish children who were born in participated in the Scottish Mental Survey which was conducted under the auspices of the Scottish Council for Research in Education SCRE and obtained the data of psychometric intelligence of Scottish pupils The number of children who took the mental ability test based on the Moray House tests was They were between age and The tests covered general spatial and numerical reasoning br At midlife period a subset of the subjects participated in one of the studies which were large health studies of adults and were carried out in Scotland in the s and s The particular study they took part in was the collaborative study of men and women conducted between and in Scotland Participants completed a questionnaire participant s address father s occupation the participant s own first regular occupation the age of finishing full time education number of siblings and if the participant was a regular car driver and attended a physical examination measurement of height Social class was coded according to the Registrar General s Classification for the participant s occupation at the time of screening his first occupation and his father s occupation Researchers separated into six social classes were used br A correlation and structural equation model analysis was conducted In the structural equation models social status in the s was the main outcome variable The main contributors to education and first social class were father s social class and IQ at age which was also found in a Scandinavian study This effect was direct and also mediated via education and the participant s first job br Participants at midlife did not necessarily end up in the same social class as their fathers There was social mobility in the sample of men were upwardly mobile were downward mobile and were socially stable IQ at age had a graded relationship with participant s social class The same effect was seen for father s occupation Men at midlife social class I and II the highest more professional also had the highest IQ at age Height at midlife years of education and childhood IQ were significantly positively related to upward social mobility while number of siblings had no significant effect For each standard deviation increase in IQ score at the age the chances of upward social mobility increases by with a confidence After controlling the effect of independent variables only IQ at age was significantly inversely related to downward movement in social mobility More years of education increase the chance that a father s son will surpass his social class whereas low IQ makes a father s son prone to falling behind his father s social class br br Higher IQ at age was also significantly related to higher social class at midlife higher likelihood car driving at midlife higher first social class higher father s social class fewer siblings higher age of education being taller and living in a less deprived neighbourhood at midlife IQ was significantly more strongly related to the social class in midlife than the social class of the first job br Finally height education and IQ at age were predictors of upward social mobility and only IQ at age and height were significant predictors of downward social mobility Number of siblings was not significant in either of the models br Another research looked into the pivotal role of education in association between ability and social class attainment through three generations fathers participants and offspring using the SMS Lothian Birth Cohort educational data childhood ability and late life intellectual function data It was proposed that social class of origin acts as a ballast restraining otherwise meritocratic social class movement and that education is the primary means through which social class movement is both restrained and facilitated therefore acting in a pivotal role br It was found that social class of origin predicts educational attainment in both the participant s and offspring generations Father s social class and participant s social class held the same importance in predicting offspring educational attainment effect across two generations Educational attainment mediated the association of social class attainments across generations father s and participants social class participant s and offspring s social class There was no direct link between social classes across generations but in each generation educational attainment was a predictor of social class which is consistent with other studies Also participant s childhood ability moderately predicted their educational and social class attainment and Participant s educational attainment was strongly linked with the odds of moving downward or upward on the social class ladder For each SD increase in education the odds of moving upward on the social class spectrum were times greater the downward ones were times greater Offspring s educational attainment was also strongly linked with the odds of moving upward or downward on the social class ladder For each SD increase in education the odds of moving upward were times greater the downward ones were times greater In conclusion education is very important because it is the fundamental mechanism functioning both to hold individuals in their social class of origin and to make it possible for their movement upward or downward on the social class ladder br In the Cohort it was found that regarding whole generations not individuals the social mobility between father s and participant s generation is of the participant generation have moved upward in relation to their fathers had moved downwards and had remained stable in their social class There was a lack of social mobility in the offspring generation as a whole However there was definitely individual offspring movement on the social class ladder had higher social class attainment than their participant parents grandparents moved downward and stayed stable Participant s childhood mental ability was linked to social class in all three generations A very important pattern has also been confirmed average years of education increased with social class and IQ br There were some great contributors to social class attainment and social class mobility in the twentieth century Both social class attainment and social mobility are influenced by pre existing levels of mental ability which was in consistence with other studies So the role of individual level mental ability in pursuit of educational attainment professional positions require specific educational credentials Furthermore educational attainment contributes to social class attainment through the contribution of mental ability to educational attainment Even further mental ability can contribute to social class attainment independent of actual educational attainment as in when the educational attainment is prevented individuals with higher mental ability manage to make use of the mental ability to work their way up on the social ladder This study made clear that intergenerational transmission of educational attainment is one of the key ways in which social class was maintained within family and there was also evidence that education attainment was increasing over time Finally the results suggest that social mobility moving upward and downward has increased in recent years in Britain Which according to one researcher is important because an overall mobility of about is needed to keep the distribution of intelligence relatively constant from one generation to the other within each occupational category br Researchers looked into the effects elitist and non elitist education systems have on social mobility Education policies are often critiqued based on their impact on a single generation but it is important to look at education policies and the effects they have on social mobility In the research elitist schools are defined as schools that focus on providing its best students with the tools to succeed whereas an egalitarian school is one that predicates itself on giving equal opportunity to all its students to achieve academic success br When private education supplements were not considered it was found that the greatest amount of social mobility was derived from a system with the least elitist public education system It was also discovered that the system with the most elitist policies produced the greatest amount of utilitarian welfare Logically social mobility decreases with more elitist education systems and utilitarian welfare decreases with less elitist public education policies br When private education supplements are introduced it becomes clear that some elitist policies promote some social mobility and that an egalitarian system is the most successful at creating the maximum amount of welfare These discoveries were justified from the reasoning that elitist education systems discourage skilled workers from supplementing their children s educations with private expenditures br The authors of the report showed that they can challenge conventional beliefs that elitist and regressive educational policy is the ideal system This is explained as the researchers found that education has multiple benefits It brings more productivity and has a value which was a new thought for education This shows that the arguments for the regressive model should not be without qualifications Furthermore in the elitist system the effect of earnings distribution on growth is negatively impacted due to the polarizing social class structure with individuals at the top with all the capital and individuals at the bottom with nothing br Education is very important in determining the outcome of one s future It is almost impossible to achieve upward mobility without education Education is frequently seen as a strong driver of social mobility The quality of one s education varies depending on the social class that they are in The higher the family income the better opportunities one is given to get a good education The inequality in education makes it harder for low income families to achieve social mobility Research has indicated that inequality is connected to the deficiency of social mobility In a period of growing inequality and low social mobility fixing the quality of and access to education has the possibility to increase equality of opportunity for all Americans br One significant consequence of growing income inequality is that by historical standards high income households are spending much more on their children s education than low income households With the lack of total income low income families cannot afford to spend money on their children s education Research has shown that over the past few years families with high income has increased their spending on their children s education High income families were paying per year and now it has increased up to nearly which is seven times more than what low income families pay for their kids education The increase in money spent on education has caused an increase in college graduation rates for the families with high income The increase in graduation rates is causing an even bigger gap between high income children and low income children Given the significance of a college degree in today s labor market rising differences in college completion signify rising differences in outcomes in the future br Family income is one of the most important factors in determining the mental ability intelligence of their children With such bad education that urban schools are offering parents of high income are moving out of these areas to give their children a better opportunity to succeed As urban school systems worsen high income families move to rich suburbs because that is where they feel better education is if they do stay in the city they put their children to private schools Low income families do not have a choice but to settle for the bad education because they cannot afford to relocate to rich suburbs The more money and time parents invest in their child plays a huge role in determining their success in school Research has shown that higher mobility levels are perceived for locations where there are better schools br br br See also br Asset poverty br Cycle of poverty br Desert
