Rainbow Road is the name of several levels featured in the Mario Kart racing game series developed and published by Nintendo Usually presented as a rainbow coloured racing course suspended in space Rainbow Road is widely recognized as one of the most iconic staple elements of the Mario Kart video game series br br br Characteristics br Rainbow Road customarily appears as the final brand new track of each game and the final race of the special cup It typically is among the most difficult to complete since most Rainbow Road tracks often have little to no guardrails to prevent the player from falling off the edges of the track and oftentimes feature tight curves steep slopes and wavy grounds Most Rainbow Road courses have been revised to be featured more than once throughout the series the original one appearing in four distinct games and the second one three times br br br Appearances br Rainbow Road appears as the final level of every major Mario Kart game except Mario Kart Arcade GP DX br br br Super Mario Kart br Rainbow Road originally appeared as the final level of the Special Cup in Super Mario Kart and is the only course in the game not to have numbered variants since it appears only once It lacks guardrails completely and is filled with sharp degree turns with a few jumping blocks on the track s surface Since floor behaviour is dictated by tile type in the original Mario Kart the slightest black tile would send the racer off the track forcing its player to wisely search the apex in every curve Highly favoring the high speed heavy characters Bowser and Donkey Kong Jr this track saw all lap records performed with these two characters br Rainbow Road also features Star Thwomps which unlike the regular Thwomps met in Bowser s Castle levels can deal more damage and spin racers out on the ground br This track was later remade in Mario Kart Super Circuit as an Extra track in Mario Kart as a retro track in Mario Kart as part of the Legend of Zelda x Mario Kart DLC pack and in Mario Kart Tour making it tied with Super Mario Kart s Mario Circuit for having the most appearances in the series The remakes in Mario Kart and onward replaced the yellow bumps with ramps following Mario Kart Wii s addition of the Jump Boost feature in the series had the Star Thwomps create ripples on the track for racers to make stunts off of and added a ramp in the last fork of the road for an additional shortcut option br br br Mario Kart br The next Rainbow Road featured in Mario Kart as the final track of the Special Cup It is not only the longest track in the game but also the longest track of the entire Mario Kart series with each lap taking around two minutes to complete without the use of shortcuts Unlike other incarnations of the course this version is completely covered in star shaped guardrails While racing players can see neon light pictures of all playable characters of the game and avoid Chain Chomps scattered throughout the course This version s main melody is also incorporated into the music for the Mario Kart Double Dash and Mario Kart versions of Rainbow Road becoming the officious Rainbow road theme The level also appeared in F Zero X s Joker Cup If the player had the DD expansion features they could also listen to a rock remix of the original melody br The track was later remade in Mario Kart as the final track of the Lightning Cup with drastic visual and gameplay overhauls No longer set in black background but sky high above the original course Toad Harbor at night the track is now broken into three sections of a lap instead of three whole laps incorporates the game s hang glider and anti gravity mechanics and most of the guardrails have been removed The Chain Chomps now bounce on the track and create ripples and there is a flying train operated and ridden by Toads that toss coins toward the racers The neon lights of the characters are replaced with fireworks drawing their faces as they explode br br br Mario Kart Super Circuit br For a return to the original flat format despite allowing doubled map size introduced in Super Mario Kart the final track of Mario Kart Super Circuit Game Boy Advance lines the course with jumping humps giving players a chance to get back on the course or take shortcuts with a Mushroom On top of the boost panels and ramps littered throughout the course there are also falling stars that can harm players and Thunder Clouds that can shrink them if they come into contact The background features Bowser s flying castle from Paper Mario br br br Mario Kart Double Dash br The Rainbow Road in Mario Kart Double Dash for the GameCube goes largely downhill before the players enter a helix filled with dash panels and a large pipe that launches players to the top similar to the game s DK Mountain track The track takes place above this game s Mushroom City at night and features floating sculptures of items that can rain Star power ups that racers can pick up The track s music which features a remix of Mario Kart s Rainbow Road near the end would be featured in every Super Smash Bros title going forward beginning with Super Smash Bros Brawl br br br Mario Kart Arcade GP br Namco s arcade game Mario Kart Arcade GP features a final cup inspired by Rainbow Road called the Rainbow Cup The Rainbow Cup features two courses called Rainbow Coaster and Rainbow Downhill Similar to the version both tracks are completely covered in guardrails making it impossible for racers to fall off The first half of the course appears to take place at a space station and features floating sculptures of items similar to the Double Dash version For the second half racers are warped to another world In the first two variants it takes place in the sky that features Toads on floating islands flowers and beanstalks in the background The second two variants take the racers to a more aquatic environment with coral and Warp Pipes surrounding the racetrack For the cup s challenge game the player has to defeat a robotic version of Mario called Robo Mario in a race br In the game s follow up Mario Kart Arcade GP the track underwent a couple of changes The tracks now had three laps instead of two and the second variant of the two courses replaced the aquatic theme with a sky temple setting br br br Mario Kart DS br The track s incarnation in Mario Kart DS is largely similar to the version in Mario Kart Double Dash with its sharp turns helix and dash panels What distinguishes it from previous versions is that it features a vertical loop and corkscrew which were the first and only inversions on a track in Mario Kart history before Mario Kart introduced anti gravity Rainbow Road DS is also the only Rainbow Road in the series whose layout could theoretically work as a roller coaster layout with a curved initial climb a downfall larger than the loop and other hilltops each slightly less tall than the previous one so that a train could pass each and return to the start on its own br br br Mario Kart Wii br In Mario Kart Wii the track is located above Earth s atmosphere sending racers burning down toward the planet if they fall off The course is heavily inspired by Super Mario Galaxy as there are Star Bits floating throughout the track and the climax features a Launch Star that launches players upwards similar to the Mario Kart Double Dash version It also features many ramps that racers can perform tricks or take shortcuts on as it was the first game in the series to introduce tricks The track was later remade for Mario Kart Tour with mostly visual improvements and for Mario Kart Deluxe featuring its anti gravity mechanic throughout the track br br br Mario Kart br For the first time in the series Mario Kart broke the Rainbow Road track into three sections rather than three whole laps It takes place in outer space where racers will avoid asteroids drive on the rings of Saturn and avoid low gravity Chain Chomps on the moon The climax features a turning tunnel with dash panels that give players the option to go back on the road or take a glide ramp The track was later remade for Mario Kart Tour and Mario Kart Deluxe with the latter featuring the game s anti gravity mechanic on the moon br The course was also featured as a stage in Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS Fighters battle on a flat platform that travels throughout the course similar to the F Zero stages and avoid racing Shy Guys competing in a race br br br Mario Kart Mario Kart Deluxe br In Mario Kart as well as Mario Kart Deluxe the track uses three whole laps again instead of lap sections and there is again a planet in the background with a higher resolution than the one from Mario Kart Wii This track is the first one to exploit the idea of gliding upon solar panels on a space station giving a plausible explanation to the track s premise of a rainbow colored track suspended in outer space The ground uses quadratic tiles in resemblance to the original Rainbow Road Super Mario Kart At the start finish line the track crosses through a space craft filled with Toads who sit on tribunes as on a normal racetrack Several more space ships carry parts of the track most notably the one with two circular conveyor belt rotating rings in opposing directions which can speed up or slow down the vehicle that drives upon As with other Mario Kart tracks Rainbow Road s surface is wildly twisted forcing racers to make use of the new anti gravity feature At a location two separated parts of the track cross nearby in different angles and distant parts of the track can be seen ahead from far away According to Mario Kart Deluxe producer Kosuke Yabuki the development team s goal was to create a version of Rainbow Road with a near future aesthetic when anti gravity controls were added br br br Mario Kart Tour br Mario Kart Tour features two courses based on the original Rainbow Road from Super Mario Kart Labeled as remix courses abbreviated to RMX courses these courses use a different layout compared to the original and feature new mechanics such as gliding and bouncy mushroom platforms These courses are named RMX Rainbow Road and and share their music with the course they are based on br br br The Super Mario Bros Movie br The course makes an appearance in s The Super Mario Bros Movie as The Secret Path on which Mario Princess Peach Toad Donkey Kong and the Kong Army battle Bowser s army as they unsuccessfully attempt to storm his castle Mario and Donkey Kong are thrown off the course by a Koopa General with a blue shell in a kamikaze attack When developing the film directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic sought to recreate Rainbow Road s sense of danger and challenge as they described it as The most unforgiving course in the series The Rainbow Road scene in the film was the most ambitious animation sequence that Illumination had undertaken compared to their previous films br br br Other appearances br Rainbow Road and variations of the course has made several appearances in other Mario and Nintendo related titles including F Zero X Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS Mario Hoops on Super Mario Galaxy and Paper Mario Color Splash It also appears during the climax of the Universal Studios ride Mario Kart Bowser s Challenge br br br Cultural impact br Rainbow Road is referenced as a part of an Easter egg included in the programming of Tesla electric vehicles According to Tesla CEO Elon Musk once a Tesla car s autopilot mode is activated four times in quick succession the gray road shown on the vehicle s instrument cluster would transform into a colorful path resembling Rainbow Road with a cowbell tune playing in the background while this mode is turned on In commemoration of Mario Day celebrations for March Hot Wheels released a Mario Kart track set based on the course on June br To coincide with the th Anniversary of Super Mario Bros an ice cream cake inspired by the track was released by Cold Stone Creamery from September to December br br br Reception br Rainbow Road has received a generally positive attention for its memorable music and unique visuals as well
