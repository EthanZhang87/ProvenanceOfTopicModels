Mario Bros about Birdo s gender did not receive attention until some time after the game s release Writer Lorenzo Fantoni suggested that this was because few people read the manual or because no one cared about Birdo s gender at the time Fantoni also compared the Captain Rainbow scene to the later bathroom debates regarding trans people Fantoni also suggests that Nintendo does not know what to do with Birdo and that changes to Birdo s character are made to match present day morals Numerous petitions from fans have called for Nintendo to recognize the transgender status of the character Jake Hall of TechRadar noted Birdo s ongoing popularity in online communities He noted how Birdo s status as a transgender icon stemmed from the fact that Birdo served as a comforting character sought out by transgender communities in order to have a visible icon stating that it helped to celebrate how transgender communities have always existed The book Greatest Video Game Characters noted Birdo s storyline in Captain Rainbow analyzing how it represented the struggles of transgender people in real life for proper representation They also noted that by showing how Birdo was accepted as female by the characters of the Mario universe it emphasized hope for proper inclusion and representation in the real world However it criticized how by proving Birdo was female in Captain Rainbow and via how Birdo had to partake in stereotypically feminine actions in order to be accepted as female it reinforced the concept of gender being a forced binary choice on transgender people instead of transgender people being allowed to make the choice of who they were for themselves br Author Sam Greer was critical of Birdo s portrayal stating that her gender had become a running joke and was the subject of much derision and stereotyping Stacey Henley of TheGamer noted how Birdo was a highly important character for transgender representation as she represented the struggles and stereotypes of transgender

Jennifer Unkle criticized Birdo as a caricatured trans person and as an example of Nintendo s poor handling of gender identity in general Zackari Greif of Game Rant also criticized Nintendo s handling of the character citing multiple occasions where Birdo was referred to with male pronouns instead of female ones as well as how Birdo is constantly referred to as Birdo and not Birdetta which is stated to be Birdo s preferred name in the Super Mario Bros manual He felt that Birdo needed consistent and proper respectful treatment as a trans woman in the games as a result The book Queerness in Play noted how Birdo remained an important and iconic transgender character in video gaming noting how the ignorance towards Birdo s gender in games served as a degree of transphobia It compared Birdo to androgynous character Kirby comparing how Kirby s lack of gender related signifiers made him a comforting character who was superior to humanity while Birdo s embracement of them led to Birdo being viewed as threatening mystery due to being more human like in how she expressed her gender Due to a lack of acknowledgement towards Birdo s gender status many speculated that the gender issue was retconned to make her a cisgender female while video game developer Jennifer Diane Reitz suggested that she may have undergone gender affirming surgery br br br
