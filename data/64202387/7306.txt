ColecoVision is a second generation home video game console developed by Coleco and launched in North America in August It was released a year later in Europe by CBS Electronics as the CBS ColecoVision br The console offered a closer experience to more powerful arcade video games compared to competitors such as the Atari and Intellivision The initial catalog of twelve games on ROM cartridge included the first home version of Nintendo s Donkey Kong as the pack in game Approximately games were published between and including Sega s Zaxxon and some ports of lesser known arcade games that found a larger audience on the console such as Lady Bug Cosmic Avenger and Venture br Coleco released a series of hardware add ons and special controllers to expand the capabilities of the console Expansion Module allowed the system to play Atari cartridges A later module converted ColecoVision into the Coleco Adam home computer br ColecoVision was discontinued in when Coleco withdrew from the video game market Coleco had already contemplated shifting focus to their Cabbage Patch Kids success after the costly failure of their Coleco Adam computer br br br Development br Coleco entered the video game market in during the dedicated game home console period with their line of Telstar consoles When that market became oversaturated over the next few years the company nearly went bankrupt but found a successful product through handheld electronic games with products that beat out those of the current market leader Mattel The company also developed a line of miniaturized tabletop arcade video games with licensed rights from arcade game makers including Sega Bally Midway and Nintendo Coleco was able to survive on sales of their electronic games through to but that market itself began to wane and Coleco president Arnold Greenberg was still interested in producing a home video game console br According to Eric Bromley who led the engineering for the ColecoVision Greenberg had wanted to get into the programmable home console market with arcade quality games but the cost of components had been a limiting factor As early as Bromley had drawn out specifications for a system using a Texas Instruments video and a General Instrument audio chip but could not get the go ahead due to the cost of RAM Around Bromley saw an article in The Wall Street Journal that asserted the price of RAM had fallen and after working the cost numbers Bromley found the system cost fell within their cost margins Within ten minutes of reporting this to Greenberg they had established the working name ColecoVision for the console as they began a more thorough design which the marketing department never was able to surpass br Coleco recognized that licensed conversion of arcade games had worked for Atari in selling the Atari VCS so they had approached Nintendo around for potential access to their arcade titles Bromley described a tense set of meetings with Nintendo s president Hiroshi Yamauchi under typical Japanese customs where he sought to negotiate for game rights though Yamauchi only offered seemingly obscure titles After a meal with Yamauchi during one day Bromley excused himself to the restroom and happened upon one of the first Donkey Kong cabinets which had yet to be released to Western countries Knowing this game would likely be a hit Bromley arranged a meeting the following day with Yamauchi and requested the exclusive rights to Donkey Kong Yamauchi offered them if only they could provide upfront by that day and gave them per unit sold Greenberg agreed though as in Japanese custom Bromley did not have a formal contract from Nintendo on his return By the time of that year s Consumer Electronics Show which Yamauchi was attending Bromley found out from Yamauchi s daughter and translator that he had apparently given the rights to Atari With Yamauchi s daughter s help Bromley was able to commit Yamauchi to sign a formal contract to affirm the rights to Coleco Coleco s announcement that they would bundle Donkey Kong with the console was initially met with surprise and skepticism with journalists and retailers questioning why they would give away their most anticipated home video game with the console br br br Release br br The ColecoVision was released in August By Christmas Coleco had sold more than units in part on the strength of Donkey Kong as the bundled game ColecoVision s main competitor was the less commercially successful Atari Sales quickly passed million in early br The ColecoVision was distributed by CBS Electronics outside of North America and was branded the CBS ColecoVision In Europe the console was released in July nearly one year after the North American release Sega Enterprises attempted a Japanese version of the console but it was retooled into the SG before release br By the beginning of quarterly sales of the ColecoVision had dramatically decreased In January Coleco discontinued the Adam which was a home computer expansion for ColecoVision By mid Coleco planned to withdraw from the video game market and the ColecoVision was officially discontinued by October Total sales are uncertain but were ultimately in excess of million consoles with the console continuing to sell modestly up until its discontinuation br In Spectravideo announced the SV ColecoVision Video Game Adapter for its SV computer The company stated that the product allowed users to enjoy the entire library of exciting ColecoVision video game cartridges br br br Hardware br br ColecoVision is based around the Zilog Z CPU and a variant of the Texas Instruments TMS video chip that was introduced in br On NTSC ColecoVision consoles all first party cartridges and most third party software titles feature a second pause before presenting the game select screen CBS Electronics reduced this pause in the BIOS to seconds for their PAL and SECAM ColecoVision consoles br br br Expansion Modules and accessories br From its introduction Coleco touted the ColecoVision s hardware expandability by highlighting the Expansion Module Interface on the front of the unit These hardware expansion modules and accessories were sold separately br br br Atari expansion br Expansion Module makes the ColecoVision compatible with Atari cartridges and controllers It leveraged the fact that the used largely off the shelf components and was effectively a complete set of electronics including a reverse engineered equivalent of the s sole custom chip the TIA The ColecoVision console did not do any translation or processing of the game code on the cartridges it only provided power and clock input to and audio video output from the expansion module which was otherwise entirely self contained and could be thought of as the first Atari clone console Functionally this gave the ColecoVision the largest software library of any console of its day The expansion module prompted legal action from Atari Coleco and Atari settled out of court with Coleco becoming licensed under Atari s patents The royalty based license also applied to Coleco s Gemini game system a stand alone clone of the br br br Driving controller br Expansion Module is a driving controller steering wheel gas pedal that comes packaged with the cartridge Turbo The gas pedal is merely a simple on off switch Although Coleco
