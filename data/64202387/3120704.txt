It marks the second time the Mario universe is developed into a livable place as the comic was made after Nintendo Comic Systems and before Super Mario RPG The only other pre story Mario is within the

and treats the social anxiety of a Boo a ghost enemy in the video game series that covers its face whenever the player is facing it br When the comic originally ran it ran alongside a just as long serial based on The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past Both serials were later reprinted in separate trade paperbacks published at the time of the magazine s fiftieth issue br In Super Mario

Mario and Luigi entering the Mushroom Castle basement where Mario gets right to work singing as he does so Just then gigantic pipes start popping up in the basement and in the courtyard Various enemies from Super Mario World pop out of the pipes and attack the guards but the Mario Bros fight back Bowser comes out of the largest of the pipes in his Koopa Clown Car and proposes marriage to Princess Toadstool known as Princess Peach in most modern English Mario media He then leaves her one week to decide on his proposal but she rallies her troops and takes off after him br Mario and Luigi chase after The Princess and soon find a large egg which cracks open to reveal a grateful Yoshi Mario and Luigi felt afraid thinking that the Yoshi might eat them until they found that he is a friendly dinosaur when they saw him eat the Wiggler Yoshi takes them to the nearby Yoshi Village where they meet Friendly Floyd and discover Yoshi s backstory Toad arrives to inform the pair that Toadstool has been captured br In a nearby tower surrounded by a lake the Koopalings are contacted by Bowser who informs them of his decision to make The Princess their stepmother and then orders the Koopalings to make sure she doesn t escape She soon does using a cape she finds that gives her the ability to fly br On the other side of the lake the Mario Bros Toad and Yoshi are trying to figure out a way to get to the tower Mario rescues Luigi from a Bullet Bill which takes Mario across the lake The Princess lands unconscious by Luigi and Mario lands dazed in the clutches of the Koopalings br Luigi poses as The Princess using a mask and is brought to Bowser The real Princess wakes up now dressed as Luigi and is also determined to rescue Mario Luigi offers to order the Koopalings a pizza and then calls up Yoshi and Toad who show up dressed as pizza delivery boys But out of the boxes come The Princess and Floyd bearing a pack of bombs that Floyd had with him Luigi runs off to rescue his brother Eventually The Princess s bomb is accidentally lit from the Reznors blowing up the tower and sending all the good guys flying back over to the other side of the moat br Floyd parts ways with the heroes who feel victorious due to Bowser s apparent defeat Mario realises there s no way to reach the entry pipe in the sky Toad takes The Princess cape to fly up to the pipe and send for a rescue party Shortly afterward some odd looking Mushroomites show up with a rope ladder The leader cuts the portion of the ladder with the Mario Brothers and it is revealed that Bowser and the Koopas have taken control of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Princess Was Once again Kidnapped br The Mario Bros and Yoshi give chase after the Koopas saucer but Bowser responds by sending down Koopa Paratroopas to attack them Mario fights back and Yoshi eats each Paratroopa until finally he swallows a Blue Koopa Shell and grows wings The trio eventually crash land in front of a Ghost House Luigi dashes into the house smelling cheese and Mario follows when a metal door comes down leaving Yoshi locked out br Mario and Luigi are surrounded by Boos eventually meeting Big Boo They escape through a door and when the Boos follow they find Mario dressed as a psychiatrist and Luigi as a nurse Mario consults the Big Boo who confesses that his fear of humans stems from bad childhood experiences Now feeling better the Big Boo and his buddies let Mario and Luigi out of the house and tell them how to get to Bowser s castle br The Mario Bros and Yoshi make it to the Koopa conquered Mushroom Kingdom and find that practically every enemy character from the classic Mario games are gathering for Bowser s marriage The trio use available pipes and Mario gets separated from the other two br Bowser uses Magikoopa to hypnotize the Princess into loving him but just as the ceremony begins Mario comes out and attacks Bowser He is astonished to hear Princess Toadstool declaring her apparent love for Bowser but he refuses to let that stop him and he attempts to carry her out while Bowser orders his men to seize him br Down in the basement Luigi and Yoshi come upon the captured Yoshis who are now all trapped in eggs They get to work setting the Yoshis free Just when the ceremony gets underway again Luigi and the Yoshis come stampeding in trampling all of Bowser s minions This breaks the spell on The Princess who then proceeds to untie Mario Bowser tries to hide in his wedding cake which the Yoshis begin devouring The Yoshis are freed and peace returns to the Mushroom Kingdom br br br

concluded the epic with a ten page story loosely based on Super Mario Land Golden Coins which ran in their January issue and was later reprinted in the graphic novel This comic was last seen in the Greed School part of the official North American Wario Land website In this story Mario receives a letter from his childhood playmate Wario who is inviting him over to his castle to catch up on things What Mario does not know though is that Wario is secretly plotting revenge for how much of a bully Mario was to him in their childhood In the road between his house and Wario s castle Mario encounters several of the bosses from the game but does not suspect that they re out to eliminate him Eventually he reaches the castle and finds a giant Wario waiting to pummel him In the fight that ensues Mario finds that Wario s new size is thanks to a plug on his overalls which he then pulls off deflating Wario to his normal size which is apparently the same size as Mario Wario is upset about Mario bullying him again but Mario realizing this apologizes The story ends on them playing cowboys again with Wario once again vowing to get even br A year later immediately following a comic adaptation of Star Fox another Mario vs Wario comic ran in the magazine entitled Mario vs Wario The Birthday Bash The sequel was published in the January issue of the magazine Here Mario and Wario who is now drawn in his official size from the games are invited to Princess Toadstool s birthday party and they both recall of the Princess infatuation with a super deformed doll in the likeness of Samus Aran perhaps foreshadowing the Super Metroid comic adaptation that started in the next issue Wario heads off to the toy shop only to find that some guy with a big black moustache already bought the last Samus doll there was Being Mario s sinister counterpart Wario thinks Mario was the customer buys a jack in the box and has it wrapped in the same packaging At the party Wario sees that Mario s gift looks just like his and switches the gifts when Mario isn t looking However when Wario presents Mario s gift to The Princess she opens it up to find it s a jack in the box which apparently scares her Then when Mario presents his gift Wario claims it to be his gift but it is also a jack in the box A big fistfight emerges between Mario and Wario until they finally realize that neither of them ever had the Samus doll and Luigi reveals he bought it for The Princess This second Mario vs Wario comic is the only installment of Super Mario Adventures that has never been reprinted br br br See also br br
