In New York Harbor filmmaker Carl Denham known for wildlife films in remote exotic locations is chartering Captain Englehorn s ship the Venture for his new project However he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose In the streets of New York City he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the thrill of a lifetime The Venture sets off during which Denham reveals that their destination is in fact an uncharted island with a mountain the shape of a skull He alludes to a mysterious entity named Kong rumored to dwell on the island The crew arrive and anchor offshore They encounter a native village separated from the rest of the island by an enormous stone wall with a large wooden gate They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the bride of Kong The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony When he sees the blonde haired Ann he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the golden woman They refuse him and return to the ship br That night after the ship s first mate Jack Driscoll admits his love for Ann the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the gate and onto an altar where she is offered to Kong who is revealed to be a giant gorilla like beast Kong carries a terrified Ann away as Denham Jack and some volunteers give chase The men encounter living dinosaurs a charging Stegosaurus which they manage to kill but run into an aggressive Brontosaurus and eventually Kong himself leaving Jack and Denham as the only survivors After Kong slays a Tyrannosaurus rex to save Ann Jack continues to follow them while Denham returns to the village Upon arriving in Kong s mountain lair Ann is menaced by a serpent like Elasmosaurus which Kong also kills When a Pteranodon tries to fly away with Ann and is killed by Kong Jack saves her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge When Kong starts pulling them back up the two drop into the water below they flee through the jungle back to the village where Denham Englehorn and the surviving crewmen await Kong following breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village Onshore Denham determined to bring Kong back alive renders him unconscious with a gas bomb br Shackled in chains Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as Kong the Eighth Wonder of the World Ann and Jack join him on stage surrounded by press photographers Kong believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack on Ann breaks loose as the audience flees in terror Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor but Kong scaling the building reclaims her He makes his way through the city with Ann in his grasp wrecking a crowded elevated train and begins climbing the Empire State Building Jack suggests to police for airplanes to shoot Kong off the building without hitting Ann Four biplanes take off seeing the planes arrive Jack becomes agitated for Ann s safety and rushes inside with Denham At the top Kong is shot at by the planes as he begins swatting at them Kong destroys one but is wounded by the gunfire After he gazes at Ann he is shot more loses

Icon From Fay Wray to Peter Jackson br br br Development br br King Kong producer Ernest B Schoedsack had earlier monkey experience directing Chang A Drama of the Wilderness also with Merian C Cooper and Rango both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings Capitalizing on this trend Congo Pictures released the hoax documentary Ingagi advertising the film as an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas Ingagi is now often recognized as a racial exploitation film as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas and baby offspring that looked more ape than human The film was an immediate hit and by some estimates it was one of the highest grossing films of the s at over million Although Cooper never listed Ingagi among his influences for King Kong it has long been held that RKO greenlighted Kong because of the bottom line example of Ingagi and the formula that gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits br br br Special effects br br King Kong is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects such as stop motion animation matte painting rear projection and miniatures all of which were conceived decades before the digital age br The numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting the Island were brought to life through the use of stop motion animation by Willis H O Brien and his assistant animator Buzz Gibson The stop motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop motion animation performance The iconic fight between Kong and the Tyrannosaurus took seven weeks to be completed O Brien s prot g Ray Harryhausen later worked with him on several films br The backdrop of the island seen when the Venture crew first arrives was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck Mario Larrinaga and Byron L Crabbe The scene was then composited with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors The background of the scenes in the jungle a miniature set was also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage br The most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live action footage interact with separately filmed stop motion animation to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image The most complex shots where the live action actors interacted with the stop motion animation were achieved via two different techniques the Dunning process and the Williams process in order to produce the effect of a traveling matte The Dunning process invented by cinematographer Carroll H Dunning employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into the black and white film Bi packing of the camera was used for these types of effects With it the special effects crew could combine two strips of different films at the same time creating the final composite shot in the camera It was used in the climactic scene where one of the planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall br On the other hand the Williams process invented by cinematographer Frank D Williams did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open The Williams process did not use bipacking but rather an optical printer the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image Through the use of the optical printer the special effects crew could film the foreground the stop motion animation the live action footage and the background and combine all of those elements into one single shot eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera br br Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop motion animation was rear screen projection The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and Fred Jackman who received a Special Achievement Oscar It was used in the scene where Kong and the Tyrannosaurus fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree The stop motion animation was filmed first Fay Wray then spent a twenty two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop motion battle She was sore for days after the shoot The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a Stegosaurus br O Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live action footage would then be projected A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll who is hiding in a cave The scene where Kong puts Ann at the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong s hand to projected footage of Ann sitting br The scene where Kong fights the Tanystropheus in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set stop motion animation for Kong background matte paintings real water foreground rocks with bubbling mud smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann br Over the years some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a gorilla suit However film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models except for the closeups of Kong s face and upper body which are dispersed throughout the film These shots were accomplished by filming a full size mechanical model of Kong s head and shoulders Operators could manipulate the eyes and mouth to simulate a living monster These shots can be identified immediately in two ways the action is very smooth not stop motion jittery and the footage is extremely sharp and clear because of the size of the subject being photographed br br br Post production br Murray Spivack provided the sound effects for the film Kong s roar was created by mixing the recorded vocals of captive lions and tigers subsequently played backward slowly Spivak himself provided Kong s love grunts by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed For the huge ape s footsteps Spivak stomped across a gravel filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant who had a microphone held to his back on the chest with a drumstick Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an air compressor for the former and his own vocals for the latter The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with puma growls while bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors Fay Wray herself provided all of her character s screams in a single recording session br The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music King Kong s score was the first feature length musical score written for an American talkie film the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music the first to mark the use of a piece orchestra and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks sound effects dialogue and music Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of leitmotifs Over the years Steiner s score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc br br br Release br br br Censorship and restorations br The Production Code s stricter decency rules were put into effect in Hollywood after the film s premiere and it was progressively censored further with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether for the rereleases These scenes were as follows br br The Brontosaurus mauling crewmen in the water chasing one up a tree and killing him br Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers br Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village br Kong biting a man in New York br Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death after realizing his mistake br An additional scene portraying giant insects spiders a reptile like predator and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong onto the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre Code standards though Cooper also thought it stopped the story and thus the scene was studio self censored prior to the original release The footage is considered lost with the exception of only a few stills and pre production drawings There is also claims that it was never filmed and was only in the script and novelization br RKO did not preserve copies of the film s negative or release prints with the excised footage and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years In a mm print including the censored footage was found in Philadelphia The cut scenes were added to the film restoring it to its original theatrical running time of minutes This version was re released to art houses by Janus Films in Over the next two decades Universal Studios undertook further photochemical restoration of King Kong This was based on a release print with missing censor cuts taken from a print which contained heavy vertical scratches from projection An original release print located in the UK in the s was found to contain the cut scenes in better quality After a year worldwide search for the best surviving materials a further fully digital restoration utilizing K resolution scanning was completed by Warner Bros in This restoration also had a minute overture added bringing the overall running time to minutes br Somewhat controversially King Kong was colorized for a Turner Home Entertainment video release The following year this colorized version was shown on Turner s TNT channel br br br Television br After the re release the film was sold to television first being

Mandell The Haver commentary was preserved in full on the FilmStruck streaming service King Kong had numerous VHS and LaserDisc releases of varying quality prior to receiving an official studio

scream and cry throughout the film in large part due to Kong s breakthrough special effects On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim br Variety thought the film was a powerful adventure The New York Times gave readers an enthusiastic account of the plot and thought the film a fascinating adventure John Mosher of The New Yorker called it ridiculous but wrote that there were many scenes in this picture that are certainly diverting The New York World Telegram said it was one of the very best of all the screen thrillers done with all the cinema s slickest camera tricks The Chicago Tribune called it one of the most original thrilling and mammoth novelties to emerge from a movie studio br On February Roger Ebert included King Kong in his Great Movies list writing that In modern times the movie has aged as critic James Berardinelli observes and advances in technology and acting have dated aspects of the production Yes but in the very artificiality of some of the special effects there is a creepiness that isn t there in today s slick flawless computer aided images Even allowing for its slow start wooden acting and wall to wall screaming there is something ageless and primeval about King Kong that still somehow works br br br Criticism of racism and sexism br In the th and early th century people of African descent were commonly represented visually as ape like a metaphor that fit racist stereotypes further bolstered by the emergence of scientific racism Early films frequently mirrored racial tensions While King Kong is often compared to the story of Beauty and the Beast many film scholars have argued that the film was a cautionary tale about interracial romance in which the film s carrier of blackness is not a human being but an ape br Cooper and Schoedsack rejected any allegorical interpretations insisting in interviews that the film s story contained no hidden meanings In an interview which was published posthumously Cooper actually explained the deeper meaning of the film The inspiration for the climactic scene came when as he was leaving his office in Manhattan he heard the sound of an airplane motor He reflexively looked up as the sun glinted off the wings of a plane flying extremely close to the tallest building in the city he realized if he placed the giant gorilla on top of the tallest building in the world and had him shot down by the most modern of weapons the armed airplane he would have a story of the primitive doomed by modern civilization br The film was initially banned in Nazi Germany with the censors describing it as an attack against the nerves of the German people and a violation of German race feeling However according to confidant Ernst Hanfstaengl Adolf Hitler was fascinated by the film and saw it several times br The film was later criticized for racist stereotyping of the natives and Charlie the Cook played by Victor Wong who upon discovering the kidnapping of Ann Darrow exclaims Crazy black man been here The film has been noted for its deception of Ann as a damsel in distress In her autobiography Wray even felt that Ann s screaming was too much However Nick Hilton in The Independent stated that the film may look a little foolish to us not to mention racist sexist and shall we say symbolically naive but it still packs a visceral wallop while Ryan Britt felt that critics were willing to overlook the film s problematic aspects as just unattractive byproducts of the era in which the film was made that the meta fictional aspects almost excuse some of the cultural insensitivity In an article entitled of The Most Racist Movies Ever Made described the film s natives as subhuman or primate not even have a distinct way of communicating The article also brought up the racial allegory between Kong and black men particular how Kong meets his demise due to his insatiable desire for a white woman br br br Legacy br br The film has since received some significant honors In Kong was named one of the best American films by the American Film Institute In a video game titled Donkey Kong starring a character with similarities to Kong was released In the film was deemed culturally historically and aesthetically significant by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry In the AFI ranked the film on its list of the greatest movies of all time br The film s stop motion effects by Willis H O Brien revolutionized special effects leaving a lasting impact on the film industry worldwide and inspired other genre films such as Mighty Joe Young The Beast from Fathoms Creature from the Black Lagoon Mothra and Jurassic Park The film was also one of the biggest inspirations for Godzilla with Tomoyuki Tanaka the creator of Godzilla stating I felt like doing something big That was my motivation I thought of different ideas I like monster movies and I was influenced by King Kong br Daiei Film the company which later produced Gamera and Daimajin and other tokusatsu films distributed the re released edition of King Kong in making it the first post war release of monster movies in Japan The company also distributed The Beast from Fathoms in Japan in and these distributions presumably influenced productions of both Godzilla and Gamera franchises br
