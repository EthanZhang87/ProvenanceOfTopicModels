Mario Luigi is a series of role playing video games published by Nintendo The series is a spin off from Nintendo s trademark Super Mario series and stars the titular characters Mario and Luigi The games stories typically follow the two exploring locales unique to the series on a quest to defeat an antagonist most of the time original It began in on the Game Boy Advance with Mario Luigi Superstar Saga with the latest original installment being Mario Luigi Brothership releasing for Nintendo Switch on November Two titles in the series Superstar Saga and Bowser s Inside Story were remade for the Nintendo DS br br br Gameplay br The gameplay of the Mario Luigi series consists of mostly role playing elements however the Mario Luigi games do differ from most other RPGs in its focus on controlling Mario and Luigi simultaneously During overworld sections the player controls Mario s movement with Luigi following closely Mario and Luigi s other actions are controlled individually with the A Mario and B Luigi buttons respectively in both the overworld and battle sections These controls are also used to explore the overworld to solve puzzles and find collectibles using various special moves that often have Mario and Luigi working together Like many other RPG series the Mario Luigi series contains a traditional turn based battle system It also uses Action Commands similarly to the Paper Mario franchise These actions consist of Mario s and Luigi s signature jumps as well as hammer attacks Unique to the series is the use of real time commands while an enemy is attacking so that if the player uses successful timing they can completely avoid an attack or even do damage to the enemy instead of getting hit This mechanism encourages the player to learn enemy s attack patterns and proper timing Some titles in the series feature additional characters alongside Mario and Luigi these include Baby Mario and Baby Luigi in Partners in Time Bowser in Bowser s Inside Story and Paper Mario in Paper Jam br br br Development br br br AlphaDream founding conception and first game br br AlphaDream was founded in by former employees from Square including Chihiro Fujioka director of Super Mario RPG and Tetsuo Mizuno Square s second president Square had previously developed Super Mario RPG the first role playing game RPG starring characters from the Mario series After a number of smaller games Mario Luigi Superstar Saga was their first game to be released outside of Japan br The Mario Luigi series took inspiration from Super Mario RPG when it came to turn based combat Yoshihiko Maekawa a producer at AlphaDream who also co directed Super Mario RPG noted how the latter was inspired by a children s toy in Japan where the player had to press buttons in time with music From there he conceptualized turn based mechanics that blended action with general RPG gameplay where the player had to make timed button presses to be more successful It was there the developers knew they were creating an RPG game that had a Mario feel Transitioning to the Mario Luigi series AlphaDream revisited the timed button pressing combat system making additions for the first game in the series Mario Luigi Superstar Saga Each game following they experimented more with the buttons available making further additions as the series progressed br When it came to characters in Mario franchise at the time they were generally underdeveloped Since Mario Luigi is mainly based on a text based story AlphaDream approached Nintendo with the mindset of revamping characters such as Luigi With Nintendo s approval and support the characters and their depth were developed from scratch br br br Nintendo DS era br Nintendo revealed Mario Luigi Partners in Time then called Mario Luigi at E where a playable demonstration of the game was available The demos consisted of three levels each accompanied with a tutorial to guide the player Each level had a different objective and represented the characters abilities in the game such as the use of the hammer Between the game s unveiling at E and its release Nintendo of America revealed details of the game relating to Partners in Time s plot and gameplay as well as the fact that it would be compatible with the Rumble Pak feature Partners in Time was first released in North America on November Mario Luigi Bowser s Inside Story was revealed to be in development in October in Japan at Nintendo s Tokyo Press Event At the time the game was called Mario Luigi RPG From there it was announced in North America and Europe at the E event and released in the fall of the same year br br br Nintendo DS era br With the introduction of three dimensional graphics on the Nintendo DS AlphaDream was given the opportunity to change their two dimensional sprites to D ones with the updated hardware However Maekawa believed the company not only got very good at designing sprites due to limited graphical capability on prior consoles but they also helped convey comical expressions so they were kept Instead the backgrounds were fit to D Akira Otani a producer of the series considered the animation to be the main reasoning for the extensive development process of Mario Luigi Dream Team He mentioned how it takes up to six people to design the animations for the characters alone br When it came to Mario Luigi Dream Team the underlying goal was to put emphasis more on Luigi as Maekawa considered to be lesser in depth even after his reworking on his character one of the first ideas for a gimmick suggested was having a large number of Luigis on screen at one time Due to advancing hardware the processing power of such a task would work well After the idea was determined they began coming up with ideas where having multiple Luigis would make sense and they stuck with the game taking place inside a dream Due to the limitless concept of a dream world coming up with level ideas was simple br According to the developers Mario Luigi Paper Jam was created not to make a crossover between the Mario Luigi and Paper Mario series but rather to introduce the gimmick of having a third character to control simultaneously When discussing the third character to control the third set of buttons it was brought up how two Marios would be an interesting concept While developing the game with supervision from Intelligent Systems the developers of the Paper Mario series they were keen not to sacrifice simplicity for extra content one of the ultimate goals of the Mario Luigi series For example when one of the prototypes of the game that involved rapid and sudden button presses was presented to Shigeru Miyamoto he directly turned the concept down and asked for it to be simpler br br br Remakes and studio closure br After Paper Jam AlphaDream began work on remakes of older games in the series Mario Luigi Superstar Saga Bowser s Minions is a remake of the first game that includes an additional mode Minion Quest The Search for Bowser which follows Captain Goomba and features a real time strategy battle system The main reason why Bowser s Inside Story Bowser Jr s Journey was released for the Nintendo DS and not the Nintendo Switch was for its use of dual screens similar to that of the Nintendo DS In addition timing reasons led the developers to choose the DS as they could easily build upon prior assets instead of creating the title from scratch Bowser Jr was the focus of the side story because they wanted to build the parent child narrative between him and Bowser They also decided to remake Bowser s Inside Story and skip Partners in Time due to the former being the most successful game in the series br br From to AlphaDream began searching for people to hire including graphic designers and production assistants with the intention of future games for the Nintendo Switch and smartphones Their most recent Mario Luigi game Mario Luigi Bowser s Inside Story Bowser Jr s Journey was selling poorly and is one of the worst selling Mario games in Japan to date Other release plans for the handheld were cancelled because of the low sales also marking the last Mario game on the console By March Yahoo Japan reported AlphaDream was million in debt US million due to development costs The company filed for bankruptcy in October Three months later in January Nintendo filed a trademark for the series in Argentina and while most assumed Nintendo was simply protecting their IP it also led to speculation that the series would hopefully continue on a later date br br br Nintendo Switch era br In June the sixth installment in the series Mario Luigi Brothership was announced set to release on November on the Nintendo Switch This is the first game not to be developed by the now defunct AlphaDream Nintendo nevertheless noted that some of the original developers from the franchise are involved in the development of Brothership br br br Reception br br All games in the series have received positive reception According to Metacritic the first and third games in the series received Universal acclaim while all others received Generally favorable reviews br br br Notes
