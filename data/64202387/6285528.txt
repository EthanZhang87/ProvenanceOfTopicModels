designer br Supervised by Gunpei Yokoi Miyamoto settled on a love triangle with the characters Bluto Popeye and Olive Oyl from the Popeye franchise but Nintendo was unable to obtain the license Bluto evolved into a gorilla an animal Miyamoto said was nothing too evil or repulsive He named the character Donkey Kong donkey to convey stubborn and kong to imply gorilla Popeye became Mario the new protagonist while Olive Oyl became Pauline the damsel in distress Miyamoto named Beauty and the Beast and the film King Kong as influences As he lacked programming expertise he consulted technicians on whether his concepts were possible Four programmers from Ikegami Tsushinki spent three months turning Miyamoto s concept into a finished game br Donkey Kong was one of the earliest platform games following Mario as he ascends a construction site to rescue Pauline from Donkey Kong It was released in July and became Nintendo s first major international success The windfall of million rescued

violated its trademark of King Kong The lawsuit failed when Nintendo s lawyer Howard Lincoln discovered that Universal had won a lawsuit years prior by declaring that King Kong was actually in the public domain The victory cemented Nintendo as a major force in the video game industry br br br Sequels and first hiatus br Miyamoto and his team used game mechanics and levels that could not be included in Donkey Kong as the basis for a sequel Miyamoto wanted to make Donkey Kong the protagonist but the sprite was too big to easily maneuver so he created a new character Donkey Kong Jr The team still wanted Donkey Kong on top of the screen so they conceived a plot in which Mario had caged him and Donkey Kong Jr had to save him To develop Donkey Kong Jr Nintendo reverse engineered Ikegami s Donkey Kong code making it the first game that Nintendo developed without outside help Following Donkey Kong Jr s release Ikegami sued Nintendo for copyright infringement In the Tokyo High Court ruled in favor of Ikegami and the companies reached a settlement br Donkey Kong released in features shooter gameplay that departs from its predecessors Instead of Mario the player controls

a demonstration Tim Stamper inspired by Mortal Kombat s use of digitized footage in place of hand drawn art suggested developing a platform game that used pre rendered D graphics br Nintendo granted the Stampers permission to use the Donkey Kong intellectual property some sources indicate that the Stampers obtained the license after Nintendo offered them its catalog of characters and they chose Donkey Kong though the designer Gregg Mayles recalled that it was Nintendo that requested a Donkey Kong game Nintendo figured licensing Donkey Kong posed minimal risk due to the franchise s dormancy Rare s reboot Donkey Kong Country featured side scrolling gameplay that Mayles based on the Super Mario series It was the first Donkey Kong game neither directed nor produced by Miyamoto though he provided support and contributed design ideas br Donkey Kong Country was one of the first games for a mainstream home video game console to use pre rendered graphics achieved through a compression

Donkey Kong Land Donkey Kong Land and Donkey Kong Land III which condensed the Country series gameplay for the handheld game console Rare s Game Boy programmer Paul Machacek chose to develop Land as

rescue Pauline from the Kongs The Game Boy game was the first Donkey Kong game to depict Donkey Kong wearing a red necktie bearing his initials DK br Beginning with Donkey Kong Country Donkey Kong s role shifted from the antagonist to the protagonist Rare s Kevin Bayliss redesigned him alongside the red tie from the Game Boy game he was given what GamesRadar described as menacing sunken eyes and a beak like muzzle and Bayliss designed him as blocky and muscular to make animating him easier Rare s games characterize him as the descendant of the Donkey Kong character from the arcade games who appears as the elderly Cranky Kong Cranky Kong provides scathing fourth wall breaking humor in which he unfavorably compares current games to older ones like the original Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Jr was retired and Nintendo s stance on whether Rare s Donkey Kong is a grown up Donkey Kong Jr or a separate character has been inconsistent br Rare s games moved the franchise s primary setting from a city to Donkey Kong Island an idyllic isle Because Donkey Kong did not have much of an established universe Rare was free to expand it with new characters Donkey Kong Country introduced Diddy Kong Donkey Kong s sidekick and nephew Diddy s design was based on a spider monkey he was created as a redesign of Donkey Kong Jr but retooled into a separate character at Nintendo s request Other supporting Kong characters that Rare introduced include Funky Kong a surfer Candy Kong Donkey Kong s girlfriend Dixie Kong Diddy s girlfriend Kiddy Kong a large toddler Tiny Kong Dixie s sister and Lanky Kong a buffoonish orangutan br The franchise s main antagonist is King K Rool an anthropomorphic reptilian introduced in Donkey Kong Country K Rool leads the Kremlings an army of crocodiles who seek to steal Donkey Kong s hoard of bananas Polygon summarized K Rool as an archetypal game villain who often wears disguises and invents strange gadgets for his elaborately evil schemes such as dressing as a pirate captain in Donkey Kong Country Other villains include the Tiki Tak Tribe a race of floating masks that play music to hypnotize animals into stealing the banana hoard and the Snowmads Viking invaders who summon a dragon to take over Donkey Kong Island br Mario the protagonist of the game went on to headline the Mario franchise Although the franchises largely remain separate they take place in the same fictional universe and Donkey Kong and other Donkey Kong characters frequently appear as playable characters in Mario spin offs such as Mario Kart Mario Party and Mario Tennis Two Rare characters Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel were introduced in Diddy Kong Racing ahead of starring in their own games Banjo Kazooie and Conker s Bad Fur Day br br br Gameplay br br br Original series br Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr are early examples of the platform game genre In both games the player must guide the playable character Mario in the first game Donkey Kong Jr in the second to scale four levels while avoiding obstacles The player jumps to dodge incoming obstacles such as barrels or cross gaps and climbs ladders or vines to reach the top of the level In the first game Mario can destroy obstacles by obtaining a hammer power up while in the second Donkey Kong Jr can do so by knocking pieces of fruit down from vines Points are awarded for dodging or destroying obstacles collecting items and completing stages quickly The player begins each game with three lives which they lose if they touch an obstacle or fall from a distance br Donkey Kong departs from this gameplay it is a shooter game in which the player controls Stanley an exterminator who must prevent Donkey Kong from stirring up insects in his greenhouse The player fires bug spray at Donkey Kong and enemy insects that attempt to steal Stanley s flowers They complete levels by spraying Donkey Kong enough to force him to the top of the screen or by killing all the insects br The Game Boy game begins with the four stages from the original Donkey Kong but after completing the fourth the player is presented with over additional stages that introduce puzzle platform gameplay in which Mario must scout each level within a time limit to locate a key Mario can pick up and throw objects and enemies similar to Super Mario Bros and perform acrobatics to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the levels This gameplay would serve as the basis for Mario vs Donkey Kong which introduces stages in which Mario must guide six Mini Mario toys to a toy box while protecting them from hazards Mario vs Donkey Kong s sequels make guiding the Mini Mario toys the focus with each stage requiring the player to do so with touchscreen controls This gameplay has been frequently compared to the strategy video game Lemmings br br br Donkey Kong Country br br The Donkey Kong Country series features platforming gameplay in which players complete side scrolling levels to progress reminiscent of Nintendo s Super Mario series The player begins in a world map that tracks their progress and provides access to the themed worlds and their levels They traverse the environment jump between platforms and avoid enemy and inanimate obstacles Each world ends with a boss fight with a large enemy The Country series is known for its high difficulty level and emphasis on momentum requiring players to react to oncoming obstacles quickly to maintain flow br Players control one of the various playable Kongs depending on the game Donkey Kong Diddy Kong Dixie Kong Kiddy Kong Cranky Kong and Funky Kong The Rare games each feature two protagonists with one protagonist carrying over to the sequel while another is introduced The Retro Studios games star Donkey Kong with other characters as his sidekicks Players primarily control one Kong with the second increasing their health In the Retro Studios games other characters ride on Donkey Kong s back to provide special abilities for instance Diddy s jetpack allows him to temporarily hover br Country s game mechanics include blasting out of barrel cannons vehicle sequences with minecarts and barrel themed rockets levels in which the characters and foreground environments appear as silhouettes and swinging vines Barrels return from the original series and can be used as weapons or broken to uncover power ups One barrel variant releases a partner Kong when thrown Each level contains collectibles such as bananas letters that spell out K O N G balloons and puzzle pieces These items can be found within the main level or by discovering hidden bonus stages where they are earned via completing a challenge br In certain levels the player can free an animal that provides the Kongs with special abilities similar to the Super Mario series Yoshi Recurring animal friends include Rambi a rhino that can charge into enemies and find hidden entrances Enguarde a swordfish that can defeat enemies underwater and Squawks a parrot who carries the Kongs or assists in finding collectibles Outside the main gameplay the Rare games world map contains areas where players can converse with non player characters such as Cranky who provide advice collectibles and save points The Retro Studios games feature shops run by Cranky in Returns and Funky in Tropical Freeze where the player can purchase items like power ups and lives br br br Other games br Some games without the Country branding contain similar gameplay The Donkey Kong Land trilogy condenses the SNES Country gameplay for the Game Boy with different level design that accounts for the system s low quality display Donkey Kong blends Country elements with collect a thon gameplay reminiscent of Super Mario and Banjo Kazooie while Jungle Beat s score attack emphasis challenges players to complete levels with as many points as possible DK King of Swing and DK Jungle Climber are aesthetically similar to the Country games but require players to use the shoulder buttons to grab and climb pegboards to reach the end of a level br Diddy Kong Racing and Donkey Kong Barrel Blast are kart racing games that play similarly to the Mario Kart series though Diddy Kong Racing features an adventure mode with boss fights and Barrel Blast has the player shake the Wii Remote and Nunchuk alternatively to accelerate The Donkey Konga trilogy was developed by the Taiko no Tatsujin developers and features the same gameplay the player must hit scrolling notes to the beat of the music with accurate timing with stylized notes corresponding to different buttons Players build combos by hitting two or more notes the combo ends when they miss a beat br br br Music br br The music for Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr was composed by Yukio Kaneoka one of Nintendo s earliest audio engineers Kaneoka wanted to take players on an adventure with a pretty melody which he compared to those in Walt Disney Productions films He faced resistance from the designers who wanted comical music to reflect the games tone Hirokazu Tanaka a sound engineer who later garnered recognition for his work on Nintendo s Metroid and Pok mon franchises also contributed br The Donkey Kong Country series features atmospheric music that mixes natural environmental sounds with melodic and percussive accompaniments It was primarily composed by David Wise who worked at Rare from to After Wise moved with a portion of the Diddy s Kong Quest team to work on Project Dream Eveline Novakovic who composed a portion of the first Country handled the majority of Dixie Kong s Double Trouble Wise composed a replacement soundtrack for the GBA port of Dixie Kong s Double Trouble after Rare had problems converting Novakovic s score Wise drew inspiration from Koji Kondo s Super Mario and Legend of Zelda music Tim and Geoff Follin s Plok soundtrack and s synthesizer heavy rock music dance music and film soundtracks He aimed to imitate the sound of the Korg Wavestation synthesizer Novakovic attempted to give levels a sense of purpose and drew inspiration from film composers such as Alan Silvestri and Klaus Doldinger br Graeme Norgate and Grant Kirkhope adapted Wise s Country soundtracks for the first two Donkey Kong Land games while Novakovic adapted the Dixie Kong s Double Trouble soundtrack for Donkey Kong Land III Novakovic was set to compose music for Donkey Kong but shifted to working on sound effects She was replaced by Kirkhope who composed alongside the Banjo Kazooie games and Perfect Dark Nintendo Life described Kirkhope s Donkey Kong score as closer in spirit to his work on Banjo Kazooie than Wise s Country music Donkey Kong s introduction features the DK Rap a comedy rap song which introduces the Kong characters It was written by Donkey Kong s director George Andreas scored and recorded by Kirkhope and performed by Andreas and Chris Sutherland with other Rare staff joining on the chorus br Wise was unavailable during the development of Donkey Kong Country Returns so Kenji Yamamoto took over At the request of Miyamoto and Iwata the Returns soundtrack mostly comprises rearrangements of tracks from the original Donkey Kong Country plus some new material by Yamamoto He focused on what Tanabe felt made Donkey Kong Country s music iconic such as piano arrangements and the bassline Wise left Rare during Returns development and collaborated with Yamamoto on the Tropical Freeze soundtrack Technological advances allowed Wise to achieve a s big band jazz sound that he had been unable to produce on the SNES Beyond the Country series Wise composed the Diddy Kong Racing soundtrack Other composers who have contributed to Donkey Kong games include Mahito Yokota who composed for Jungle Beat and Lawrence Schwedler who composed for Mario vs Donkey Kong br br br Other media br br br Crossovers br Donkey Kong is represented in every game in Nintendo s Super Smash Bros series of crossover fighting games Donkey Kong debuted in

NES which rejuvenated the crashed Western game industry and shifted the home console market s dominance from the US to Japan The NES was largely based on the Donkey Kong arcade hardware Nintendo took a Donkey Kong arcade cabinet to the semiconductor chip manufacturer Ricoh for analysis which led to Ricoh producing the NES s Picture Processing Unit br Donkey Kong inspired many games including clones such as Crazy Kong and Hard Hat Mack that featured a mix of running jumping and vertical traversal These were initially referred to as Donkey Kong type or Kong style games but eventually came to be known as platformers While Donkey Kong was not the first platform game VG wrote it was the first to matter by establishing the genre s template Furthermore Donkey Kong s spirited graphics humor and contextualization of the gameplay with a story distinguished it from contemporary arcade games Although text based adventure games and computer role playing video games preceded it Donkey Kong is regarded as the first game to use graphics to tell a story which GamesRadar said provided an unprecedented level of narrative depth br Donkey Kong Country s pre rendered graphics featured a level of detail unprecedented in console games at the time and inspired many imitators It inspired games such as BlueSky Software s Vectorman Naughty Dog s Crash Bandicoot HAL Laboratory s Kirby Super Star and Traveller s Tales and Sonic Team s Sonic D Blast Country s influence has carried into more modern games such as Mekazoo and Kaze and the Wild Masks the Australian Broadcasting Corporation credited it for demonstrating D games could remain relevant after the introduction of D Yooka Laylee and the Impossible Lair developed by Playtonic Games whose staff includes Rare alumni that worked on Country was noted for its gameplay similarities to Country though Playtonic declined to label it a spiritual successor br The Country games established Rare as a leading video game developer and set the standard for its work Country originated conventions characteristic of Rare s later output including an emphasis on collecting items irreverent humor visual appeal and tech demo like design Conversely Donkey Kong has been blamed for precipitating D platforming s decline in popularity for its excessive emphasis on collecting items Electronic Gaming Monthly wrote that whereas Super Mario had breathed life into the D platforming genre Donkey Kong had sucked it all out Jonas Kaerlev who developed the D platformer A Hat in Time said Donkey Kong gave the genre a reputation for tedium that contributed to a decline in interest br br br Cultural impact br br Donkey Kong is one of the most iconic video game characters and journalists have described him as a mascot for both Nintendo and the video game

game of all time while Polygon wrote that achieving the highest score is probably the most coveted arcade game world record The King of Kong a documentary film directed by Seth Gordon brought Donkey Kong s competitive culture to prominence It follows two players Steve Wiebe and Billy Mitchell in their respective attempts to obtain and maintain the world record The Telegraph described Donkey Kong competition as bitter and said the heated rivalries between players contribute to the game s lasting appeal The Donkey Kong Country games are also popular in the video game speedrunning community br
