What about the look Lauren Bacall had He described that combination as an ultimate male fantasy drawn by a cartoonist Before Zemeckis was brought on board as director Jessica had a different design

Novel br Jessica was an immoral up and coming star and former comic character with whom her estranged husband comic strip star Roger Rabbit became obsessed br Roger s wife Jessica is dramatically different between adaptations too Interestingly she has far more depth and dimension as a character in the movie than the novel at that In the novel she s a shameless golddigger that uses her looks and charisma to seduce men into giving her what she wants or pitting key political figures against each other Once one figure is out of the picture she monkey branches to someone else in order to gain their wealth power or whatever other effect Behind her charismatic glamour she s a petty and hard to please diva br br br Movie br She is re imagined in the film as a sultry but moral and kind hearted cartoon singer at a Los Angeles supper club called The Ink and Paint Club She is one of several suspects in the framing of her husband who is a famous cartoon star accused of murder She is voiced by Kathleen Turner Amy Irving was cast to sing Why Don t You Do Right a blues song made famous by Peggy Lee for Jessica s first scene in the movie According to animation director Richard Williams other than being a feisty redhead female human toon temptress she deeply loves her husband Roger She calls him her honey bunny and darling She claims that he makes her laugh is a better lover than a driver and that he is better than Goofy after Roger attempts to save her from Judge Doom and the Toon Patrol As proof of her love she tells Eddie that she will pay any price for Roger and she even helps prove him innocent by helping in the investigation br Even though she is a human Toon she is shown to have a few of the comedic cartoon antics typical of other Toons One such example was her cleavage having a hammerspace ability as one of the weasels searched her with obvious perverted intent for Marvin Acme s last will and testament only to comically get his hand caught in a bear trap with Valiant commenting on the event with a pun Nice booby trap Another could be her restrained wild take as she shouts Oh my God it s Dip seeing Judge Doom s scheme involving the Dip while a subtle effect was added by animator Russell Hall The bounce of Jessica s bosom was reversed from that of a real woman so that it would bounce up when a real woman s breasts bounce down and vice versa Furthermore when she blows kisses as seen to Eddie in one scene the lip kisses are also done in a cartoonish style br br br Shorts br After the film Jessica also appeared in the Roger Rabbit Baby Herman cartoons Tummy Trouble as a nurse Roller Coaster Rabbit as a damsel in distress and Trail Mix Up as a park ranger Although in Tummy Trouble and Roller Coaster Rabbit she rarely made impressions in Trail Mix Up

rate of film frames per second but visible when advancing through the film frame by frame Snopes examined it and reported that although a scene does exist where Jessica s dress is hiked up and her underwear disappears for a few frames it could be either intentional or a coloration error The scene drove sales of the LaserDisc release many retailers reported that due to reports on the nudity from media including CNN and newspapers their entire inventories of the LaserDisc release sold out in minutes Sources from Disney told Variety that the company was unlikely to do anything about the frames and that the film is not intended for children regardless br br br
