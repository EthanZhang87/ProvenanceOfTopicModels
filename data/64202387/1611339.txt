A stiletto heel or just stiletto is a shoe with a long thin high heel It is named after the stiletto dagger br Stiletto heels may vary in length from centimetres inch to cm inches or more if a platform sole is used and are sometimes defined as having a diameter at the ground of less than cm slightly less than half an inch Stiletto style heels cm in or shorter are called kitten heels br br br History br br High heeled shoes were worn by men and women courtiers until the French Revolution When high heels came back in style in the late s they were worn only by women The stiletto heel came with the advent of technology using a supporting metal shaft or stem embedded into the heel instead of wood or other weaker materials that required a wide heel Italian shoe designer Salvatore Ferragamo paved the way for stilettos by inventing the steel arch Some historians also credit him with inventing the stiletto heel while others credit French fashion designer Charles Jourdan French designers such as Roger Vivier and Andr Perugia popularized the stiletto design in the s which quickly spread across Europe and the United States br After an initial wave of popularity in the s the heels reached their most refined shape in the early s when the toes of the shoes which bore them became as slender and elongated as the stiletto heels themselves As a result of the overall sharpness of outline it was customary for women to refer to the whole shoe as a stiletto not just the heel via synecdoche pars pro toto Although they faded from the scene after the Beatles era began their popularity continued at street level and women stubbornly refused to give them up even after they could no longer readily find them in the mainstream shops A version of the stiletto heel was reintroduced in by Manolo Blahnik who dubbed his new heel the Needle Similar heels were stocked at the big Biba store in London by Russell Bromley and by smaller boutiques Old unsold stocks of pointed toe stilettos and contemporary efforts to replicate them lacking the true stiletto heel because of changes in the way heels were by then being mass produced were sold in street fashion markets and became popular with punks and with other fashion tribes of the late s until supplies of the inspirational original styles dwindled in the early s Subsequently round toe shoes with slightly thicker sometimes cone shaped semi stiletto heels often very high in an attempt to convey slenderness were frequently worn at the office with wide shouldered power suits The style survived through much of the s but almost completely disappeared during the s when professional and college age women took to wearing shoes with thick block heels The slender stiletto heel staged a major comeback after when young women adopted the style for dressing up office wear or adding a feminine touch to casual wear like jeans br br br Image br Stilettos like all similar high heeled shoes give the optical illusion of a longer slimmer leg a smaller foot and overall greater height They alter the wearer s posture and gait flexing the calf muscles and making the bust and buttocks more prominent br Stiletto heels are particularly associated with the image of the femme fatale They are often considered to be a seductive item of clothing and are even fetishized as an erotic object by some br br br Disadvantages br All high heels counter the natural functionality of the foot sometimes causing skeletal and muscular problems if users wear them excessively such shoes are a common cause of venous complaints such as pain fatigue and heavy feeling legs and have been found to provoke venous hypertension in the lower limbs Despite their impracticality and fluctuating demand they persist as a fashion option br Stiletto heels concentrate a large amount of force into a small area The great pressure under such a heel which is greater than that under the feet of an elephant can cause damage to carpets and floors The stiletto heel unless equipped with a heel stopper to enlarge the floor contact area can be impractical for outdoor wear on soft ground such as grass sand or mud or in environments where floor damage is unacceptable br br br br br br Bibliography br Bergstein Rachelle Women from the Ankle Down The Story of Shoes and How They Define Us Hardback New York HarperCollins pp ISBN br br br External links br Media related to Stilettos shoes at Wikimedia Commons
