levels as they jump between platforms and avoid obstacles They collect items ride minecarts and animals defeat enemies and bosses and find secret bonus stages In multiplayer modes two players work cooperatively or race each other br After developing Nintendo Entertainment System games in the s Rare a British studio founded by Tim and Chris Stamper purchased Silicon Graphics workstations to render D models Nintendo sought a game to compete with Sega s Aladdin and commissioned Rare to revive the dormant Donkey Kong franchise Rare assembled developers to work on Donkey Kong Country over months Donkey Kong Country was inspired by the Super Mario series and was one of the first home console games to feature pre rendered graphics achieved through a compression technique that converted D models into SNES sprites with little loss of detail It was the first Donkey Kong game neither produced nor directed by the series creator Shigeru Miyamoto though he contributed design ideas br Following its announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show in June Donkey Kong Country was highly anticipated and backed by a major marketing campaign that cost million in America alone It was released in November to acclaim critics hailed its visuals as groundbreaking and praised its gameplay and music Its quality and design were favourably compared to the Super Mario series Donkey Kong Country received several year end accolades and set the record for the fastest selling video game at the time With million copies sold worldwide it is the third bestselling SNES game and the bestselling Donkey Kong game Following the success Nintendo purchased a large minority stake in Rare which became a prominent second party developer for Nintendo during the late s br Donkey Kong Country re established Donkey Kong as a popular Nintendo franchise and helped maintain the SNES s popularity into the fifth generation of video game consoles It is considered one of the greatest video games of all time and has been ported to platforms such as the Game Boy Color Game Boy Advance and digital distribution services Rare followed it with two sequels for the SNES Donkey Kong Country Diddy s Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country Dixie Kong s Double Trouble and the Nintendo game Donkey Kong After a hiatus during which Rare was acquired by the Nintendo competitor Microsoft Retro Studios revived the series with Donkey Kong Country Returns for the Wii and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze for the Wii U br br br Gameplay br br Donkey Kong Country is a side scrolling platform game A reboot of the Donkey Kong franchise its story begins when King K Rool and his army of crocodiles the Kremlings steal the Kongs banana hoard The gorilla Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong set out to reclaim the hoard and defeat the Kremlings Donkey and Diddy serve as the player characters of the single player game they run alongside each other and the player can swap between them at will Donkey is stronger and can defeat enemies more easily Diddy is faster and more agile Both can walk run jump pick up and throw objects and roll Donkey can slap the terrain to defeat enemies or find items br The player begins in a world map that tracks their progress and provides access to the levels The player attempts to complete each level while traversing the environment jumping between platforms and avoiding enemy and inanimate obstacles Level themes include jungles underwater reefs caves mines mountains and factories Some feature unique game mechanics such as rideable minecarts blasting out of cannons resembling barrels and swinging ropes Each area ends with a boss fight with a large enemy Donkey and Diddy can defeat enemies by jumping on rolling into or throwing barrels at them If hit by an obstacle one of the Kongs runs off and the player automatically takes control of the other They will only be able to control that Kong unless they free the other Kong from a barrel br In certain levels the player can free an animal that provides the Kongs with special abilities similar to Yoshi from the Super Mario series Buddies include Rambi a rhino that can charge into enemies and find hidden entrances Enguarde a swordfish that can defeat enemies with its bill Squawks a parrot that carries a lantern Expresso an ostrich that flies and Winky a frog that can jump high Each level contains collectible bananas letters that spell out K O N G balloons and animal tokens These items can be found within the main level or by discovering hidden bonus stages where they are earned via solving puzzles The player starts with five lives Collecting bananas all the K O N G letters a balloon or three of the same animal token grants extra lives br The player can visit other members of the Kong family from the world map Funky Kong operates a flight service allowing the player to travel across different areas of Donkey Kong Island Cranky Kong the aged incarnation or father of Donkey Kong from the original Donkey Kong provides tips and fourth wall breaking humour and Candy Kong saves the player s progress The player can increase their completion percentage by finding bonus stages Reaching the maximum per cent results in a different ending The game also features two multiplayer game modes In the competitive Contest mode players take turns playing each level as quickly as possible In the cooperative Team mode they play as a tag team br br br Development br br br Background br br In the British game developers Tim and Chris Stamper established Rare Ltd The brothers previously founded the British computer game studio Ultimate Play the Game and founded Rare to focus on the burgeoning Japanese console market After Nintendo rejected their efforts to form a partnership in Chris Stamper studied the Nintendo Entertainment System NES hardware for six months Rare demonstrated it was possible to reverse engineer the NES and showed several tech demos to Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa impressed Arakawa granted Rare a Nintendo developer licence Rare developed more than NES games including the Battletoads series and ports of games such as Marble Madness br When Nintendo released their next console the Super Nintendo Entertainment System SNES in Rare decided to limit their output Around Rare invested their NES profit in Silicon Graphics Inc SGI Challenge workstations with Alias rendering software to render D models It was a significant risk as each workstation cost The move made Rare the most technologically advanced UK developer and situated them high in the international market br br br Conception br Though they had purchased the workstations to produce games for the Nintendo which was in development at the time Rare discovered it was possible to use them with the bit SNES Rare tested the SGI technology with Battletoads Arcade and began developing a boxing game Brute Force using PowerAnimator Around this time Nintendo was embroiled in a console war with Sega whose Mega Drive competed with the SNES Nintendo wanted a game to compete with Sega s Aladdin which featured graphics by Disney animators when Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln learned of Rare s SGI experiments during a trip to Europe br After impressing Nintendo with a demonstration of Brute Force Tim Stamper inspired by Mortal Kombat s use of digitised footage in place of hand drawn art suggested developing a platform game that used pre rendered graphics Nintendo granted the Stampers permission to use the Donkey Kong intellectual property The franchise had been largely dormant since the unsuccessful Donkey Kong so Nintendo figured that licensing it posed minimal risk Some sources indicate that the Stampers obtained the licence after Nintendo offered them their catalogue of characters and they chose Donkey Kong Conversely the lead designer Gregg Mayles recalled that it was Nintendo that requested a Donkey Kong game According to Mayles Nintendo codenamed the project Country based on Rare s location in Twycross leading to the title Donkey Kong Country br Rare assembled a team of the largest in their history at that point and development began Nintendo was sceptical of Rare s approach to graphics concerned it would make the game unplayable Early in development Mayles and other developers presented a demo to Nintendo staff in Japan One in attendance the Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi felt the game looked too D but Mayles said Donkey Kong s creator Shigeru Miyamoto was supportive and gave Rare his approval Donkey Kong Country was the first Donkey Kong game that was neither directed nor produced by Miyamoto who was working on Super Mario World Yoshi s Island Miyamoto was still involved with the project and Rare said he provided crucial input br Nintendo is usually highly protective of their intellectual properties but was relatively uninvolved with Donkey Kong Country leaving most of the work to Rare Programmer Brendan Gunn noted that the Stampers worked to shield the team from outside influence Rare spent months developing Donkey Kong Country from an initial concept to a finished game and according to product manager Dan Owsen people worked on it in total It cost an estimated US million to produce and Rare said that it had the most man hours ever invested in a video game at the time years The team worked hours every day of the week Gunn said that the team was under significant pressure from the Stampers and to finish the game in time for Thanksgiving due to Nintendo s competition with Sega br br br Design br br Rare drew inspiration from the Super Mario series Mayles citing Super Mario Bros as the primary influence on the level design Mayles wanted to make a game that was accessible but would flow seamlessly for a skilled player as such objects were placed so well timed players could continually move through a level Mayles noted that although the concept of speedrunning did not exist at the time the way the game was designed definitely supports it br The team designed levels using Post it Notes they would conceive a set piece such as swinging ropes create every variation they could think of drew them on Post it Notes and pieced them together Rare featured barrels as a primary game mechanic to pay homage to the original arcade game and included hidden collectibles like coins and balloons to add depth Diddy Kong originated from Rare s search for a game mechanic akin to Super Mario s power up system in that he would serve as the player s health Mayles said We thought a second character could perform this function look visually impressive and give the player a feeling that they were not alone br Donkey Kong Country did not have much scrapped content Gunn said he only regretted that Donkey Kong walks across dotted lines instead of paths on the world map which could not be implemented due to time constraints One scrapped idea a collectible that would evade the player by running or hiding served as the basis for the Jinjos in Rare s subsequent game Banjo Kazooie Reviewing Donkey Kong Country for release Nintendo directed Rare to reduce the difficulty to appeal to a broad audience reasoning that the secrets would provide sufficient challenge for hardcore gamers At this point Miyamoto made some last minute suggestions such as Donkey Kong s terrain slap that were incorporated Nintendo s Kensuke Tanabe flew to Twycross to localise the game with Rare br br br Characters br Kevin Bayliss was in charge of redesigning Donkey Kong He wanted a character that looked believable and could perform animations like pounding his chest His initial design was blocky and muscular to make Donkey Kong easy to animate but it became more cartoonish when Nintendo faxed reference material Some of Bayliss designs were in the style of his Battletoads work and the final design s eyes came from those of the Battletoads Miyamoto provided some suggestions including the red tie but left the design s specifics to Bayliss br Because Donkey Kong did not have much of an established universe Rare was free to expand it with new characters Mayles conceived Diddy as a redesign of Donkey Kong Jr Unlike the original Donkey Kong Jr Rare did not want Diddy to share his build with Donkey Kong so they based him on a spider monkey and made him agile to give him distinct moves Nintendo considered the redesign too great a departure and asked it to be reworked or presented as a new character Mayles felt the redesign suited the updated Donkey Kong universe so he chose to make it a new character Naming the character was a challenge and Rare dropped their preferred Dinky Kong due to legal problems br Rare staff spent hours at the nearby Twycross Zoo recording gorillas for reference which they described as a complete waste of time They found their movements unsuitable for a fast game and their noises too quiet to be captured by a microphone so they based Donkey Kong s running animation on a horse s gallop and had programmer Mark Betteridge provide Donkey and Diddy s voice clips Rare positioned Cranky Kong as the original Donkey Kong character from the arcade games but avoided mentioning this in the game and marketing materials out of fear that Nintendo would disapprove of the idea though it was mentioned in the instruction manual The antagonists the Kremlings were recycled from a cancelled Rare game Rare s initial story was extensive and spanned pages but Nintendo had it condensed to fit into an instruction manual br br br Graphics br br Donkey Kong Country was one of the first games for a mainstream home video game console to use pre rendered D graphics a technique used in the earlier Finnish game Stardust for the Amiga Rare developed a compression technique that allowed the team to incorporate more detail and animation for each sprite for a given memory footprint which better preserved the pre rendered graphics Nintendo and Rare called the technique Advanced Computer Modelling ACM Rare briefly feared competition from DMA Design s Uniracers which also featured pre rendered graphics but the staff was relieved upon learning that the player character was Uniracer s only element that was pre rendered br The artists began by modelling the characters in NURBS using PowerAnimator and adding textures They then created the animations and rendered them frame by frame before compressing them for the game The ACM process was handled by a designated computer that had a proprietary utility similar to Deluxe Paint Adapting to the cutting edge SGI workstations was difficult Gregg Mayles brother Steve said they had a steep learning curve The game was Rare s first to require multiple programmers and they worked with little guidance To help Nintendo provided Rare with research material regarding apes barrels and caves The pre rendered graphics allowed for variety and detail uncommon at the time and Tim Stamper constantly pushed the team to go further and incorporate weather and lighting effects br The ACM process pushed the SNES hardware to its limits Betteridge said Rare wanted to do everything they could with the hardware similar to what they had done with the NES game Battletoads A single SGI screen took up more memory than an entire SNES cartridge and Gregg Mayles described transferring the backgrounds into the game by splitting them into tiles as the bane of the project Models took hours to render so the team would leave the computers running overnight Sometimes artists would shut down other artists computers in the middle of the process so they could render their own models The SGI machines required a massive air conditioning unit to prevent overheating while the team worked in the summer heat without relief Programmer Chris Sutherland was responsible for implementing the graphics and found reducing the characters frames of animation challenging br br br Music br br David Wise composed most of the soundtrack Wise initially worked as a freelancer and assumed his music would be replaced by a Japanese composer because of the importance of Donkey Kong to Nintendo Rare asked Wise to record three jungle demo tunes that were merged to become the DK Island Swing the first level s track Wise was subsequently offered the job to produce the final score Before composing Wise was shown the graphics and given an opportunity to play the level they would appear in which gave him a sense of the music he would compose He then chose samples and optimised the music to work on the SNES s SPC sound chip Wise worked separately from the team in a former cattle shed visited occasionally by Tim Stamper br Donkey Kong Country features atmospheric music that mixes natural environmental sounds with prominent melodic and percussive accompaniments Its soundtrack attempts to evoke the environments and includes music from levels set in Africa inspired jungles caverns oceanic reefs frozen landscapes and industrial factories Wise cited Koji Kondo s music for the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games Tim and Geoff Follin s music for Plok synthesiser film soundtracks released in the early s and rock and dance music from the same decade as influences and wanted to imitate the sound of the Korg Wavestation synthesiser Wise wanted to compose in the style of s jazz but was restricted by the SPC s limitations he used a lot of small samples and made the soundtrack very synthesised to work around them br Since Donkey Kong Country featured advanced pre rendered graphics Wise wanted to push the limits in terms of audio to create equally impressive music and make the most of the small space he was working with Aquatic Ambience the music that plays in the underwater levels took five weeks to compose Wise considers the track his favourite and the game s biggest technological accomplishment in regards to the audio K Rool s theme was influenced by the work of Iron Maiden For the title screen theme Wise remixed Nintendo s original Donkey Kong theme to demonstrate how Donkey Kong had evolved since his debut Wise said his primary focus was to make the most of the SPC and he input the music by hand to save memory He noted the process was easier than composing for the NES due to the larger number of sound channels br Eveline Novakovic contributed seven tracks including the world map theme as her first SNES project Novakovic was inexperienced with the SNES hardware and Wise helped teach her as they worked together She attempted to provide the levels a sense of purpose and drew inspiration from film composers like Alan Silvestri and Klaus Doldinger Funky Kong s theme was originally written by Robin Beanland According to Beanland the track was intended for an internal progress video about another Rare game Killer Instinct before Nintendo decided to use it in a Donkey Kong Country promotional trailer Beanland said Tim Stamper liked it and wanted to include it in the game so Wise adopted it br br br Release br br br Marketing br Lincoln unveiled Donkey Kong Country at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago which took place from to June The unveiling was the finale of Nintendo s conference and did not reveal that Donkey Kong Country was a SNES game until the end of the presentation fooling the audience into believing that it was for the upcoming Nintendo Gregg Mayles recalled the audience was stunned in silence before bursting into applause br As one of the flagship games of Nintendo s Play It Loud promotion Donkey Kong Country was backed by an exceptionally large marketing campaign marketing blitzkrieg as Hardcore Gaming put it According to the Los Angeles Times Nintendo spent US million on marketing Donkey Kong Country in America alone at the time major games typically had an average marketing budget of US million Marketing materials emphasised the revolutionary graphics often noting that Rare s SGI workstations had been used to create the Jurassic Park film s dinosaurs and positioned Donkey Kong Country as a direct competitor to Sega s Mega CD and X platforms to remind players it was not for next generation hardware br Nintendo sent a promotional VHS tape Donkey Kong Country Exposed to subscribers of the magazine Nintendo Power Exposed hosted by comedian Josh Wolf provides a behind the scenes glimpse of the Treehouse the Nintendo of America division where games are tested Nintendo World Report wrote that Exposed was probably the first time most people outside of Nintendo learned about the Treehouse and the promotion allowed players to see the game for themself at home rather than having to learn about it secondhand from a magazine Exposed also features gameplay tips and interviews with localisers playtesters and Tim Stamper br In October Nintendo of America held an online promotional campaign through the internet service CompuServe The campaign included downloadable video samples of the game a trivia contest in which people participated and an hour long online chat conference attended by people in which Lincoln Arakawa and vice president of marketing Peter Main answered questions Nintendo s CompuServe promotion marked an early instance of a major video game company using the internet to promote its products Nintendo gave away Donkey Kong T shirts as a pre order bonus and partnered with Kellogg s for a promotional campaign in which the packaging for Kellogg s breakfast cereals featured Donkey Kong Country character art and announced a prize giveaway The campaign ran from November to April Fleetway Publications published a promotional comic in the UK in br A soundtrack CD DK Jamz was released via news media and retailers in November with a standalone release in It was one of the earliest video game soundtrack albums released in the United States A promotional competition oriented version of Donkey Kong Country was sold through Blockbuster Video Its changes include a time limit for the playable levels and a scoring system which had been used in the Nintendo PowerFest and Blockbuster World Video Game Championships II competitions It was later distributed in limited quantities through Nintendo Power The competition version of Donkey Kong Country is the rarest licensed SNES game only cartridges are known to exist br br br Context br br By October Nintendo was still in fierce competition with Sega and its popular Sonic the Hedgehog franchise Donkey Kong Country was released a month after Sonic Knuckles for the Mega Drive The Los Angeles Times characterised the coinciding releases as a battle both featured company mascots boasted Hollywood sized marketing budgets and advertised revolutionary technological advances lock on technology for Sonic Knuckles and D rendered graphics for Donkey Kong Country br Donkey Kong Country was highly anticipated Hardcore Gaming wrote It was everywhere You couldn t escape it It was on the cover of every magazine It was on gigantic imposing displays and marquees at Wal Mart and Babbages For kids of the era November th seemed like the eve of a revolution The Exposed VHS tape contributed significantly to the hype Donkey Kong Country was expected to gross at least US million in the US if it matched sales projections Nintendo anticipated that it would sell two million copies in a month an expectation that Main acknowledged was unprecedented but was based on the off the chart reactions we ve received from game players and retailers br USGamer noted that Nintendo at the time of Donkey Kong Country s release faced difficulty to keep the SNES profitable The fifth generation of video game consoles was on the horizon the bit prowess of Sony s PlayStation and the Sega Saturn far exceeding the SNES s capabilities The Nintendo was not due for release until so Donkey Kong Country wrote USGamer served as Nintendo s bluff to make it seem that the SNES could hold its ground against next generation hardware br br br Sales br Donkey Kong Country was released worldwide in November two weeks ahead of schedule and around the Black Friday shopping season It was released in the UK on November in North America on November in Europe on November and in Japan on November In Japan the game was released under the title Super Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Country set the record for the fastest selling video

s highest grossing film The Santa Clause US million and album Miracles The Holiday Album US million In the UK it was the top selling SNES game in November Donkey Kong Country sold six million copies worldwide in its first holiday season grossing million in worldwide sales revenue Cumulative sales reached million copies Based on available sales figures it is the third bestselling SNES game and the bestselling Donkey Kong game br br br Reception br br Donkey Kong Country received critical acclaim and was lauded as a paradigm shift that set new standards for video games Diehard GameFan and Total said it changed expectations for bit and platform games and Entertainment Weekly wrote it is to most bit games what most bit games are to their Atari forebears Once you ve played it everything else before it seems like a peewee Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM called Donkey Kong Country one of the few games that is actually as good as the hype and Total declared it the best game of GameFan said that Donkey Kong Country set a new quality standard that many developers would attempt to imitate br The visuals were considered the best aspect Reviewers considered them a major technological achievement their detail unprecedented for a bit game EGM said that the graphical quality prompted questions about the purpose of and bit hardware Total said the character animations surpassed those of a Disney film and applauded the parallax scrolling Several critics said the graphics were the best on available hardware with Entertainment Weekly writing that they were comparable to matte paintings The soundtrack and audio were also lauded Total said the music built atmosphere Top Secret wrote the captivating soundtrack asserted itself as a masterpiece in its own right and EGM and Entertainment Weekly said the audio quality was unprecedented for the SNES and on par with a CD s br Reviewers praised the gameplay for its variety and depth Entertainment Weekly appreciated that it did not build upon the original arcade game s design Total described Donkey Kong Country as addictive accessible and exciting with humour imagination puzzles and secrets that proved there was still potential in the platform game genre EGM and GameFan wrote that the game was lengthy and offered plenty of technique and GamePro commended the replay value that searching for bonus stages provided EGM and GamePro found searching for bonus stages was challenging though GamePro said it was easy to breeze through the game without them and criticised the boss fights as simplistic br Critics frequently compared Donkey Kong Country to the Super Mario series particularly Super Mario World Some considered Donkey Kong Country an improvement upon the Mario formula GameFan said it would be a worthy successor to Super Mario World even without the graphics and Total wrote that it took Mario s best elements increased the speed and presented them better Next Generation felt the gameplay though good did not meet the standards of previous SNES games such as the Mario and Legend of Zelda series and prevented it from being a typical Nintendo blockbuster CVG wrote that Donkey Kong Country was the only SNES game that matched Super Mario World but that it would be a conventional platformer without its graphics It warned that experienced players may find the game designed for a broad audience unoriginal br br br Accolades br Donkey Kong Country received many Game of the Year awards For EGM s Best and Worst of it won Game of the Year Best SNES Game and Best Animation Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong won Best Game Duo It also received Video Games The Ultimate Gaming Magazine s awards for Game of the Year Best SNES Game Best Action Game and Best Graphics Donkey Kong Country was the only video game included in Time s Best Products of list coming in second behind the Chrysler Neon and it became the first game to win the Favourite Video Game Kids Choice Award at the Kids Choice Awards br br br Post release br br br Aftermath br In April following Donkey Kong Country s success Nintendo purchased a per cent minority stake in Rare which increased to per cent over time Rare was the first non Japanese studio to enter such a relationship with Nintendo making them a second party developer Nintendo published Rare s subsequent games and allowed them to expand its staff from to over and move out of the farmhouse to an advanced development site elsewhere in Twycross Rare was one of the first developers to receive Nintendo software development kits and decided to start spending more time developing fewer games Nintendo and Rare s partnership produced acclaimed Nintendo games such as GoldenEye Banjo Kazooie Perfect Dark and Conker s Bad Fur Day br A proposed Game Boy port of Donkey Kong Country was repurposed as a separate game Donkey Kong Land after the programmer Paul Machacek convinced Rare that it would be a better use of resources and expand the potential audience Rare began developing concepts for a Donkey Kong Country sequel during production and Nintendo green lit the project immediately after the success Donkey Kong Country Diddy s Kong Quest released in features Diddy rescuing a kidnapped Donkey Kong from K Rool and introduces Diddy s girlfriend Dixie Kong Diddy s Kong Quest was designed to be less linear and more challenging with a theme reflecting Gregg Mayles fascination with pirates Like its predecessor Diddy s Kong Quest was a major critical and commercial success br Other teams at Rare used Donkey Kong Country s technology in the fighting game Killer Instinct and Donkey Kong Land Donkey Kong Land and Donkey Kong Land III which attempted to replicate Donkey Kong Country s visuals and gameplay on the handheld Game Boy Following Diddy s Kong Quest the Donkey Kong Country team split in two one half began working on Project Dream a role playing game that used the Donkey Kong Country technology and the other on Donkey Kong Country Dixie Kong s Double Trouble Rare followed Dixie Kong s Double Trouble with Donkey Kong the first Donkey Kong game to feature D gameplay In Rare was acquired by Nintendo s competitor Microsoft and the Donkey Kong rights reverted to Nintendo br br br Rereleases br br In Rare developed a port of Donkey Kong Country for Nintendo s Game Boy Color GBC handheld console It was released in North America on November in Europe on November and in Japan on January The port was developed alongside the GBC version of Perfect Dark and many assets including graphics and audio were re used from the Donkey Kong Land games Aside from graphical and sound related downgrades due to the GBC s weaker bit hardware the port is mostly identical to the original release One level was redesigned and another was added It also adds bonus modes including two minigames that supplement the main quest and support multiplayer via the Game Link Cable as well as Game Boy Printer support The GBC version was a runner up for GameSpot s annual Best Game Boy Color Game and Best Platform Game awards and during the th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards the Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences nominated it for the Console Family award It sold million copies worldwide br Despite its acquisition by Microsoft Rare continued to produce games for Nintendo s Game Boy Advance GBA since Microsoft did not have a competing handheld It ported Donkey Kong Country as part of Nintendo s line of SNES rereleases for the GBA The GBA version was released in Australia on June Europe on June in North America on June and in Japan on December It adds a new animated introductory cutscene redesigned user interfaces and world maps the ability to save progress anywhere minigames and a time trial mode It features downgraded graphics and sound the former due to the GBA s lack of a backlit screen The GBA version sold million copies including in the US by August Between January and August it was the th highest selling game for a Nintendo handheld console in the US br The SNES version of Donkey Kong Country has been digitally rereleased for later Nintendo consoles via Nintendo s Virtual Console service It was released for the Wii Virtual Console in Japan and Europe in December and in North America in February In September the game was delisted from the Virtual Console for unknown reasons though Kotaku s Jason Schreier suggested it may have been related to licensing problems with Rare Donkey Kong Country returned to the Wii U s Virtual Console in February and was added to the New Nintendo DS Virtual Console in March It was included in the Super NES Classic Edition a dedicated console Nintendo released in September and was released on the Nintendo Switch for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in July br br br Legacy br Donkey Kong Country s visual appeal helped the SNES remain popular in a period of uncertainty for cartridge based games Consumers were unfamiliar with D graphics at the time According to Official Nintendo Magazine by bringing next generation graphics to the SNES just days before the PlayStation s Japanese launch Donkey Kong Country persuaded consumers that an immediate upgrade was unnecessary IGN wrote that the game saved the SNES and revitalised sales by bringing back lapsed fans Donkey Kong Country also helped Nintendo pull ahead of Sega and win the console wars of the s Whereas Nintendo continued to release AAA games such as Donkey Kong Country Sega had alienated audiences with add ons such as the Mega CD and X and its subsequent console the Saturn failed br The Donkey Kong Country series re established Donkey Kong as one of Nintendo s most popular and profitable franchises Donkey Kong Country heralded Donkey Kong s transition from villain to hero Rare s redesign became his standard appearance and its gameplay format was followed by sequels The game inspired an animated series that ran for episodes from to and Diddy Kong starred in a Nintendo racing game spin off Diddy Kong Racing Following Dixie Kong s Double Trouble the Country series went on a hiatus until Donkey Kong Country Returns developed by Retro Studios was released for the Wii on Donkey Kong Country s th anniversary in A sequel Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze was released for the Wii U in Wise who left Rare in returned to compose Tropical Freeze s score br br br Retrospective assessments br Reviewing the Virtual Console rerelease Nintendo Life felt the visuals were still among the SNES s best and Jeuxvideo com said they had offered a new depth of realism IGN and AllGame said the visuals remained impressive for the SNES though IGN thought they were no longer as significant a draw while GameSpot thought the graphics rivalled bit consoles Conversely USGamer said that though technically impressive they did not age well with cringe inducing paper thin backgrounds Hardcore Gaming agreed writing that the visuals looked plastic like did not hold up well once the novelty of pre rendering had worn off and were clearly experimental even if their detail was admirable Critics praised the GBC version for attempting to preserve the visuals in spite of hardware limitations but criticised the GBA version s downgrades which IGN considered detrimental to the experience br br Donkey Kong Country became divisive in the years following its release Eurogamer wrote that it became popular to dislike it in the early s and it was often described as one of the most overrated video games For example Vice wrote that it did not deserve to be considered a classic and alongside GameSpy called its gameplay unremarkable and lacking depth According to IGN critics accused Donkey Kong Country of sacrificing gameplay for the sake of a short run attention grab and quick impulse sales which USGamer attributed to the flimflammery of its visuals and the relative mundanity of its actual game design USGamer wrote the game was often criticised as an example of style over substance with gameplay that was arguably inferior to SNES launch games such as Super Mario World and Super Castlevania IV GameSpy complained that Donkey Kong Country overshadowed games such as Yoshi s Island which it considered superior br Donkey Kong Country is considered one of the greatest video games of all time USGamer wrote that the criticism was unfair because it exudes craftsmanship Rare went to great pains to create a consistent seamless world that managed to convey trompe l oeil immersion something few developers could replicate Though retrospective reviewers criticised the boss fights they praised the rhythm variety and replay value Polygon said that although some aspects had not aged well Donkey Kong Country remained among the best Donkey Kong games and deserved praise for resurrecting the franchise Its soundtrack is considered one of the best in games praised for its atmosphere and diversity Hardcore Gaming said it was the one element that had unquestionably aged well and contained some of the bit era s most memorable music br In the years following its release rumours spread that Miyamoto disliked Donkey Kong Country and found it amateurish and had created the hand drawn art style of Yoshi s Island in retaliation for its pre rendered visuals The author Steven L Kent claimed Miyamoto said that Donkey Kong Country proves gamers will put up with mediocre gameplay if the art is good in a Electronic Games interview Kent said that Nintendo s marketing department had rejected Yoshi s Island as it lacked Donkey Kong Country s pre rendered graphics and that this had possibly motivated Miyamoto s remark Miyamoto denied this in noting he was very involved in Donkey Kong Country and had been in regular correspondence with Stamper until the end of the development In USGamer described Kent s claims as seemingly apocryphal and in the video game historian Frank Cifaldi said the Electronic Games issue with the Miyamoto interview did not contain the alleged quote br br br Influence br Donkey Kong Country exerted revolutionary influence according to GameSpot Kotaku said its unprecedented graphics represented the future of games and Nintendo World Report wrote that it set standards for how platform games could look and play Sega commissioned BlueSky Software to develop the Mega Drive game Vectorman in response to Donkey Kong Country s popularity Many developers imitated the visuals IGN identified the Saturn games Clockwork Knight and Bug as examples USGamer wrote that few games achieved the same quality and that D games such as Crystal Dynamics Pandemonium exposed the illusion upon which Donkey Kong Country was built Kotaku said Donkey Kong Country was an event that could not be replicated in modern times due to the game industry s growth br Naughty Dog s founders Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin cited Donkey Kong Country as the primary influence on their break out game Crash Bandicoot Crash s first functional levels drew upon techniques employed by Donkey Kong Country such as steam vents drop platforms bouncy pads heated pipes and enemies that move back and forth The pre rendered visuals inspired other games including Kirby Super Star and Sonic D Flickies Island and critics have identified Donkey Kong Country references or influence in games such as the Mega CD version of Earthworm Jim Sonic Blast Rayman Origins Mekazoo and Kaze and the Wild Masks The Australian Broadcasting Corporation credited Donkey Kong Country for maintaining the popularity of D games and ensuring the development of new entries in the Mario Kirby and Yoshi series br The soundtrack was also influential and Wise developed a cult following for his work IGN said Donkey Kong Country contributed to an increased appreciation for video game music as an art form Rearrangements of the music appear in Donkey Kong Donkey Kong Country Returns and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze and in crossover games such as Nintendo s Super Smash Bros fighting series Its tracks are often remixed Wise contributing to an OverClocked ReMix album in Aquatic Ambience has been particularly influential It has been described as the Eleanor Rigby of video game music praised by artists such as Trent Reznor and Donald Glover and The A V Club wrote that it spawned a minor cult dedicated to remixes Glover sampled it in his song Eat Your Vegetables to which Wise expressed approval br Donkey Kong Country established Rare as one of the leading video game developers and set the standard for its work It originated conventions characteristic of Rare s later output including an emphasis on collecting items irreverent humour visual appeal and tech demo like design Nintendo and Rare s partnership continued until Star Fox Adventures for the GameCube after which Rare was acquired by Microsoft The game Yooka Laylee and the Impossible Lair developed by Playtonic Games whose staff includes Rare alumni that worked on Donkey Kong Country was noted for its gameplay similarities to Donkey Kong Country though Playtonic s head Gavin Price declined to label it a spiritual successor Nintendo Life also identified similarities between Donkey Kong Country
