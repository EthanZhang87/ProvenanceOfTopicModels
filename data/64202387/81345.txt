Luigi Japanese is a character from the Mario franchise and related media released by Japanese video game company Nintendo Created by video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto Luigi is portrayed as an Italian plumber and the younger fraternal twin brother and sidekick of Mario Defined by his kind hearted yet cowardly demeanor Luigi appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise oftentimes accompanying his brother br Luigi first appeared in the Game Watch game Mario Bros where he is the character controlled by the second player He would retain this role in many future games including Mario Bros Super Mario Bros Super Mario Bros Super Mario World among other titles He was first available as a primary character in Super Mario Bros In more recent appearances Luigi s role became increasingly restricted to spinoffs such as the Mario Party and Mario Kart series however he has been featured in a starring role in Luigi s Hammer Toss Mario is Missing Luigi s Mansion Luigi s Mansion Dark Moon Dr Luigi New Super Luigi U Luigi s Mansion Arcade and Luigi s Mansion In most of said games he is called upon to act as the hero because Mario is in need of rescue Luigi has also appeared in every episode of the three DiC TV series based on the NES and Super NES games br Originally developed as a palette swap of Mario with a green color scheme instead of red Luigi has since developed a personality and style of his own As his role in the Mario series progressed Luigi evolved into a physically distinct character and was made taller and thinner than his brother Nintendo called the period of March to March the Year of Luigi to commemorate the thirtieth anniversary of the character s existence Correspondingly games released in emphasized Luigi An unlockable Luigi themed version of Mario Bros titled Luigi Bros was also included with Super Mario D World br br br Concept and creation br br The events leading to Luigi s creation began in during the development of Donkey Kong where Shigeru Miyamoto had created Mario then known as Jumpman hoping that he would be able to recast the character in a variety of roles in future games Miyamoto was inspired by Joust to create a game with a simultaneous two player mode which led to his development of the game Mario Bros in In that game Luigi was given the role of Mario s brother as the second playable character Miyamoto observed that the Japanese word ruiji means similar thus explaining the similarities in size shape and gameplay of Luigi to Mario br While Miyamoto originally portrayed Mario as a carpenter in Donkey Kong both Mario and Luigi were styled as Italian plumbers in Mario Bros on the suggestion of a colleague Software constraints at the time of the respective game s origins meant that Luigi s first appearance was restricted to a simple palette swap In terms of graphics and gameplay the characters were completely identical the green color scheme adopted for Luigi remained one of his defining physical characteristics in subsequent releases br After the success of Mario Bros Luigi was introduced to a wider audience in with the release of the console game Super Mario Bros Once again his role was restricted to a palette swap and could only be used by the second player The Japanese version of Super Mario Bros in later released in the west as Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels marked the beginning of Luigi s development toward becoming a more distinguished character Luigi s movement was no longer identical he could now jump higher and farther than his brother at the expense of movement response and precision br While this version of Super Mario Bros was released in Japan it was deemed to be too difficult for American audiences at the time Consequently In an alternative release was developed to serve as Super Mario Bros for Western players and later released in Japan as Super Mario USA this version played a key role in shaping Luigi s current appearance The game was a conversion of Yume K j Doki Doki Panic with the graphics altered to represent characters and scenes from the Mario franchise In this release the character of Mama who had the highest jump among the original cast served as the template for Luigi resulting in his taller thinner look combined with his Mario esque outfit and boasting green color scheme There were earlier appearances of Luigi being taller than Mario in Famicom Grand Prix II D Hot Rally and in Super Mario Bros The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach in the previously mentioned anime he wore a yellow shirt a blue hat and blue overalls Promotional artwork for Super Mario Bros and Super Mario World depict Luigi with this new look but the actual games did not adapt this different character design until the game Super Mario Kart Luigi s distinctive appearance from Super Mario USA has been used ever since even for remakes of older games br br br Actor portrayal br br Much like his appearance Luigi s vocal portrayal has fluctuated over the years Mario Kart in which many characters were voiced for the first time some characters including Luigi had two different voices the North American and European versions of the game feature a low pitched voice for Luigi provided by Charles Martinet who also voiced Mario Wario and Waluigi The Japanese version uses a high pitched falsetto voice provided by the then French translator at Nintendo Julien Bardakoff Inconsistent voice acting continued with many Nintendo games all versions of Mario Party feature Bardakoff s high pitched clips from Mario Kart Luigi retained this higher voice in Mario Party In Mario Golf Mario Tennis and Mario Party his voice returned to a lower state Since then with the exceptions of Mario Kart Super Circuit and Super Smash Bros Melee Luigi has consistently had a medium pitched voice performed by Martinet In Mario Kart Super Circuit Luigi s voice was the same high pitched voice from the Japanese version of Mario Kart In Super Smash Bros and Super Smash Bros Melee Luigi s voice is made up of clips from Mario s voice taken from Super Mario with raised pitches In Super Smash Bros Brawl Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U and

released Ennuigi which relates the story of Luigi s inability to come to terms with the lack of narrative in the original Super Mario Bros Reception regarding Luigi s character in Ennuigi ranged from depressed laconic perpetually miserable to an angsty teenager who just finished writing a book report about Albert Camus The Stranger In a Reddit thread Millard commented I think it s a pretty weird implied narrative once you step back and look at it and enjoyed funneling some thoughts about all that into a recharacterization of Luigi as a guy who s as legitimately confused and distressed by his strange life as you d expect a person to be once removed from the bubble of cartoony context of the franchise br br br Year of Luigi br br On March Nintendo began the Year of Luigi This included a
