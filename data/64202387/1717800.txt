falling barrels and can also perform higher jumps by timing his jumps from flipping or by performing a jump while changing direction br The mallet item can be thrown upwards and can be used again if Mario catches it allowing him to bring it to different parts of the stage There are several blocks that allow the player to add bridges ladders and springs anywhere on the screen for a short amount of
