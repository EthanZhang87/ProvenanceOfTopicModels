antagonist Wingo Each level is contained within a miniature diorama like environment that requires puzzle solving and platforming challenges to complete The player also uses the Wii U GamePad to rotate the camera and reveal new information and interact with the environment br The Captain Toad levels in D World started as a prototype concept that was included as side levels in the final product Captain Toad was selected as the main character because his large backpack would justify the lack of jump controls The developers wanted to make the concept into a full game since the start of D World s development and upon Shigeru Miyamoto s request development began after the conclusion of D World Plucking as an action was made for additional gameplay variation and bonus challenges and collectibles were added to help with difficulty The goal throughout development was to make the game enjoyable to as broad of an audience as possible and help normalize the use of camera control in video games br Treasure Tracker was announced at E releasing November in Japan December in North America and the following January in PAL regions All versions received generally favorable reviews being praised for its graphics and concept but criticized for its camera control and never fully leaning into its gimmick The DS and Switch versions were praised for their utilization of hardware though the multiplayer was considered lackluster The Wii U Version sold over million copies making it one of the highest selling games on the console The Switch version sold over million copies placing it inside the top best selling games for the system br br br Gameplay br br In Captain Toad Treasure Tracker the player controls Captain Toad a Toad or his companion Toadette attempting to safely navigate through various obstacles and reach a star at the end of each level As in Super Mario D World Captain Toad and Toadette can walk and run but cannot jump due to their heavy backpacks They are able to pull plants out of the ground to use as projectiles a feature that is also used to interact with other items in the level br Each level is contained in a small environment requiring the player to solve puzzles or complete platforming challenges to complete the level in a linear fashion By using the thumbsticks or motion sensors on the Wii U GamePad the player can rotate the diorama like level to different orientations revealing new paths and parts of the environment The GamePad can also be used to interact with the environment in some levels such as using the touchscreen to move platforms blowing into the built in microphone to move moving platforms and using the motion controls to aim and throw objects at enemies The player has two hitpoints that can be lost by being hit by enemies If the second hitpoint is lost the player must restart the level However if all lives are lost the game is over Mushrooms are hidden in levels that will restore a lost hitpoint when collected br Collectibles are hidden in each level and once a level is beat it can be completed with special conditions such as completing the level without taking damage When a Toad Amiibo is scanned the player is put into a random level and tasked with finding a hidden pixel art of Toad In the Nintendo Switch port the hide and seek pixel Toad challenges do not require a Toad Amiibo to play The re release for the Nintendo Switch in included co op multiplayer the second player controls a pointer that can interact with enemies and toss turnips Additional Amiibo released featuring Super Mario Odyssey characters were also released and compatible with the Nintendo Switch version that unlock four bonus levels based on locations found within Odyssey The levels can be unlocked by scanning the Amiibo or are made available after completing the game additional levels were also released the following year as paid downloadable content DLC With the removal of the Wii U GamePad the Nintendo Switch still retained some of its features when being used portably if the player is playing Treasure Tracker while docked a cursor will appear on the screen that the player controls using motion controls br br br Plot br The game opens with Captain Toad and Toadette ascending a tower together to claim a star The villainous giant crow Wingo appears and steals the star taking Toadette along with him when she grabs hold of it The player guides Toad as he tracks Wingo down to his lair and rescues Toadette Each following chapter sees one of the two captured and the player controls the other Toad on their way to save them In the final scene of the game they defeat Wingo and the introduction to Super Mario D World plays out and Captain Toad is seen following a falling star into the glass pipe For the Switch DS versions the final scene shows Captain Toad following the Odyssey br br br Development br br Captain Toad Treasure Tracker was developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo Shinya Hiratake the lead level designer of Super Mario D Land and Super Mario D World served as the game s lead director while Koichi Hayashida who was a director for D World served as a producer Despite being in a position that was less hands on Hayashida said he was more involved with Treasure Tracker in its latter half than he was D World br br br Super Mario D World levels br Among the many prototypes of what would become D World was a level that Hayashida described as a little diorama stage using Mario the game s camera would look at the level from the outside They found that allowing Mario to jump would result in the level needing to be much larger than intended so the idea as the game s base concept was scrapped However they knew the concept would work if the player character was unable to jump An idea was pitched to the creator of the Mario and The Legend of Zelda franchises Shigeru Miyamoto that featured Link as the featured character The concept was rejected because to him Link would traverse the environment and fight enemies with his sword which took focus away from the puzzle gimmick While considering other characters that would justifiably be unable to jump the developers settled on the character Captain Toad from the video game Super Mario Galaxy because of his large backpack Captain Toad would be included in a series of levels within D World that featured this original concept which released in Since the beginning of the concept s conception they wanted to create a standalone game using it and limited the amount of Captain Toad levels in D World because of it Miyamoto asked them to make it a full game due to his enjoyment of the Rubiks Cube wanting to create a game that featured mechanics similar to it which the staff were happy to do so br br br Design br Each level was designed to be its own unique environment with a linear path to completion The developers wanted camera control to be required to teach new players or those unfamiliar with the concept to use it both in Treasure Tracker and other future Nintendo games Small tunnels and pillars were used to emphasize camera rotation A camera alternative where the player viewed the game in first person was explored but was too complex to include At the start of development the team designed levels and played through them together One of their first problems was stale gameplay since the game lacked jumping they relied on only walking which became repetitive To fix this they added a second mechanic plucking where Captain Toad could pull items from the ground and interact with objects in the environment With the addition of plucking they were able to diversify the level mechanics To make the level selection less overwhelming for the player the levels were split into three groups called episodes that increased in difficulty Bonus challenges and collectibles were added to give an additional challenge for more experienced players and a time limit wasn t included so less experienced players could have however much time is needed to solve the puzzles Various level designs were inspired by Arabian Nights br A two player cooperative multiplayer mode was considered and explored but ultimately scrapped from the final product though the idea was revisited in the Swtich version of the game The game s story was made to be connected to that of D World s the developers also considered connecting the story to Super Mario Galaxy as a story being read by Rosalina Captain Toad was designed to be a treasure hunter to justify his reason to explore so much that it almost becomes a negative character trait Hiratake described Captain Toad as a crow that loves shiny things or a moth to a flame He just loves treasure so much that he can t think about anything else Hiratake ensured that Captain Toad had as much character as possible emphasizing that he was an unlikely hero with personality They included details to his character to show this such as making him dizzy if he is interacted with on the Wii U GamePad or being scared when approached by enemies Miyamoto also pitched in with this idea giving suggestions such as how Captain Toad should never defeat enemies directly only accidentally in attempt to save himself Toadette was made playable further down the line to offer gameplay variance and Hayashida noted that the two were adventure pals in the game br br br Announcement and release br Captain Toad Treasure Tracker was announced at E detailing level mechanics and enemies The game released November in Japan and the following December in North America It released January in Europe although Game Retail Limited began selling copies two weeks early After the game released a Toad Amiibo was created and was made compatible with the game when scanned the player is put into a part of a level and given ten seconds to find a hidden pixel art of Toad br The game was re released to other Nintendo consoles to reach a larger audience of players The original plan was to release the game for the Nintendo DS only because its stereoscopic D effect would better show the level s dimensions While developing the Nintendo DS version Nintendo was also developing the video game Super Mario Odyssey where they found that many players enjoyed playing together with separate Joy Con controllers Because of this they also decided to make release the game for the Nintendo Switch including co op multiplayer The re release was announced for both consoles via Nintendo Direct on March The Nintendo Switch announcement also highlighted the new multiplayer as well as additional levels themed after Super Mario Odyssey Both versions released worldwide July Paid DLC for the Nintendo Switch was announced in February featuring new levels in five courses The DLC released on March br br br Reception br br br Critical reviews br The Wii U version of Captain Toad Treasure Tracker received an of review aggregator website Metacritic indicating generally favorable reviews The Nintendo Switch and Nintendo DS versions received an and respectively also indicating generally favorable reviews br br br Wii U version br Critics praised the visuals especially the small details and an emphasis on cute graphics Curtis Bonds of Nintendo World Report applauded the game s worldbuilding as being much more larger and complex than what was present of them in D World Players reviewer Jan Wobbeking also praised the game s detail and visual design Fitch noted the HD visuals and how they help Treasure Tracker tell its simple yet charming tale remarkably well Electronic Gaming Monthly s Andrew Fitch in particular enjoyed Captain Toad s characterization finding it to be a fresh change of personality from Mario a statement echoed by Marty Sliva of IGN Although Polygon found the plot lacking they believed the gameplay made up for it br Gameplay and usage of the Wii U GamePad were also generally praised Reeves was surprised at the level of depth in the gameplay and the amount of variance that can be found in levels that don t involve jumping Writing for GameSpot Peter Brown enjoyed the boss battles and their evolving difficulty Although Polygon expressed the game did not have much depth as a mainline Mario game the gimmicks and execution were pure Nintendo that continuously evolved and reiterated on itself In a more critical review GamesRadar reviewer Matthew Castle criticized the gimmicks of the game for never being fully justified or explored such as removing the ability to jump forcing the player to use ladders instead Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the utilization of the Wii U GamePad and the ways it used the touchscreen microphone and motion controls to make each level unique Brown considered Treasure Tracker to be a rare example of a Wii U game best played on the Game Pad Sliva expressed some distaste in the GamePad being used excessively and how motion controls were always active and accidentally used when not necessary br Some critics expressed confusion in the game s genre and overall gameplay scope With the lack of multiple objectives in D World Fitch believed the game leaned too much towards being a platformer than a puzzle game Castle expressed similar concerns giving mixed opinions on the gameplay that never leaned toward either direction and making the game feel experimental overall Welsh also felt this but considered Treasure Tracker to be a successful example of a hybrid of puzzle levels and platforming Ultimately he felt that the video game Mario vs Donkey Kong achieved this better with various staff members at Famitsu echoing the statement that any type of audience can enjoy Treasure Tracker Fitch s main gripe with the game was that there was just not enough of it and lacked a noticeable increase in difficulty Brown felt otherwise praising the challenging collectibles and the use of backtracking to give new spins on previous levels Although Reeves also noted the small amount of content he praised how each level was full of depth and lacked puffery br The game camera received negative reception Oli Welsh of Eurogamer found that camera use was often put in an awkward position by being too zoomed in or out and was usually a distraction from gameplay There were some instances were the camera became a hinderance for Fitch requiring it to be turned while in danger of other enemies and becoming difficult to manage Reeves also criticized the camera for not having the option for it to be controlled automatically which alienated him from the experience and cited that it could be problematic for inexperienced or older audiences br br br Other versions br Wobbeking noted it would be tedious for those who need to replay missions to unlock the extra levels themed after Odyssey Reeves cited similar frustrations Although Reeves called the removal of the levels based on D World to be bizarre he considered the newly added levels to be a fair exchange Jeremy Horwitz from VentureBeat was also disappointed that the Switch version did not include levels based on D World Polygon was critical of the new levels finding the majority of them to not match the puzzle quality of those found in the original game The inclusion of multiplayer was appreciated by critics but criticized for being a lackluster and trivial addition Daniel Starkey of GameSpot also criticized the multiplayer based on how gameplay roles were divided between two players leaving the experience to be unenjoyable for both as they have equally little action IGN s Joe Skrebels derided the multiplayer and negatively compared it to the multiplayer in Super Mario Galaxy also criticizing the ability for the second player to defeat enemies immediately and anywhere removing their threat to the players br Nintendo Life s Glen Fox overall declared that people who have already purchased the Wii U version might not be persuaded to buy the game for the additions but it would still be appealing to those who did not own a Wii U to play the original Reeves considered the Switch s motion control to be usable but obnoxious as the cursor will remain on screen long after not being used Fox did not mind the cursor and preferred playing with the console docked for the sake of better graphics br Although the graphic quality was understandably lowered for it to work on the DS Skrebels was impressed by the port and considered it to be one of the best looking games released for the console He also praised the use of D in the game and how they enhanced gameplay beyond the Wii U and Switch versions Writing for Nintendo Life Chris Scullion applauded the port for replicating the use of the Wii U GamePad by putting its interactive features on the second screen but criticized the graphics for their jagged appearance and being difficult to discern when zoomed out Nintendo World Report also positively received the control scheme especially how one hand could be used to control Captain Toad and the other to control the camera with the stylus br br br Sales br The CESA Games White Papers revealed that the Wii U
