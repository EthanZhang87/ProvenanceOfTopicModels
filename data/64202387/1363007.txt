Super Mario was a codename for two different development projects at Nintendo The name was first used in for a sequel to Super Mario for the DD which was canceled The name was reused for a GameCube tech demo at the Nintendo Space World trade show in Nintendo gradually incorporated the demonstrated graphics and physics concepts into the rapid object generation of Pikmin the physics of Metroid Prime and the sphere walking technology of The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and Super Mario Galaxy The Super Mario demo led to widespread analysis rumors and anticipation in the media throughout the s br br br History br br br Super Mario br The name Super Mario was first used as early as January by Shigeru Miyamoto as a possible name for a Super Mario sequel The name Super Mario was also used interchangeably with Super Mario This rumored expansion and sequel to Super Mario was said to be developed for the DD but was canceled due to the DD s commercial failure Miyamoto mentioned at E s August convention that he was just getting started on the project At Nintendo s Space World trade show in November Miyamoto added We haven t decided whether it s two player yet We are currently working with a system where Mario and Luigi can co exist and they are both controllable by the player But we will decide more game elements when we finish everything about Zelda br br We re in the middle of preparing Mario for release on the DD I d like to take advantage of the DD s ability to store information As of now Luigi s also a full part of the game but we haven t started thinking about player gameplay with Mario and Luigi yet We ll tackle that once we ve got the system ironed out we ve figured out the processing power issues so we could do it if we tried br In November Miyamoto said Well for over a year now at my desk a prototype program of Mario and Luigi has been running on my monitor We ve been thinking about the game and it may be something that could work on a completely new game system The game had only a demo of one level made for it Miyamoto claimed that multiplayer functionality was the first aspect of the game that he wanted to include br br Nintendo Power How about the sequel to Super Mario br Miyamoto We ve been thinking about the game and it may be something that could work on a completely new system br Nintendo Power Are you planning on making a two player game with simultaneous cooperative play br Miyamoto We ve actually been considering a four player game with simultaneous play but each screen would need to be very small and we would have to implement new camera work But it s these sort of problems that I like to tackle br br Miyamoto had considered the two next frontiers of the Super Mario series to be a gameplay mechanic of walking on a rotating sphere and coincidentally a setting in space but it took a long time to find a way to resonate these ideas with the production team He loved the novel idea of sphere walking because it was totally unexplored in the game industry and because focusing on a full sphere can eliminate camera movements and thus motion sickness He learned greatly from the world s adaptation to the D gameplay of Super Mario and he briefly experimented with rolling fields during the development of Paper Mario for Nintendo During the development of Doshin the Giant for Nintendo he eagerly proposed that it could become the first sphere walking game but the staff rejected such an exceedingly massive development for the game which was released in December br br br GameCube demo br The name Super Mario gained permanent fame when reused for a new technology demonstration at the Space World event on August This software was controlled by staff to show new gameplay mechanics and the processing power of the upcoming GameCube game console Development of the demo was directed by Yoshiaki Koizumi who would later become the director of Super Mario Galaxy In the demo a large D Mario spawned increasing numbers of smaller Mario figures independently walking across a circular board until the number of onscreen characters reached The terrain in the demo was manipulated rotated and spun like a floppy saucer to show the physics engine software GamePro declared Super Mario to be one of the most anticipated games of Regarding Nintendo s secrecy and lack of elaborate demonstration of the camera system GamePro assumed that The precautions are warranted as developer after developer aped the exact camera mechanism from Mario for their titles br Koizumi said he spent much thought after the event about the close to impossible undertaking of productizing Super Mario as demonstrated Combining that demo s rounded surface with Mario s need to freely roam Koizumi s next imagined groundbreaking objective was to demonstrate Mario walking upon a gravitational sphere To even be able to attempt that would require tremendous technological expertise motivation and achievement from a dedicated team and would not be undertaken until br There had always been distinctly separate development of Super Mario and Super Mario Sunshine which Miyamoto considered to be similar to Super Mario anyway He said obviously we were doing work on the Mario demo that we were showing at Space World and separately we were doing work on experiments that we made into Mario Sunshine At Space World Super Mario Sunshine was unveiled as the next in the Mario series released in br The GameCube game Super Smash Bros Melee alluded to Super Mario with a battle stage titled Super Mario where the player is assailed by a total of tiny Mario figurines br br br Resurfacing br In Miyamoto predicted that Super Mario would let players feel the newness that was missing from Super Mario Sunshine because he thought of that game as more of a revisitation of Super Mario br Rumors said that the reason for Nintendo not having shown Super Mario at E was because the game was extraordinarily innovative and Nintendo did not want other developers stealing the ideas from the game as some had assumed about the Space World show However Miyamoto later confirmed that Super Mario was still in development and that the development team had planned to take the Mario series in a new direction br In Nintendo s George Harrison stated that Super Mario may not appear on GameCube at all Yoshiaki Koizumi who had directed the original Super Mario demonstration joined Nintendo s new EAD Tokyo office There Shigeru Miyamoto pushed him to hold a much bigger vision for the next Mario series game and Koizumi said this By working on Donkey Kong Jungle Beat together I got to know the staff well enough by then and I thought if it was with this team we may just be able to tackle the new and difficult challenge of making spherical platforms work There at EAD in Koizumi s team began working on prototypical spherical platforms in an intensive three month process of iterative demonstrations for Miyamoto Nintendo s President Satoru Iwata requested Miyamoto s singular signature effort to turn this product which would become Super Mario Galaxy into a showcase for the Wii br It was thought that Nintendo would unveil the game at E Miyamoto again confirmed the existence of Super Mario in an interview during February but the game failed to surface Some believed this was due to the announcements of The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and the Nintendo DS both revealed at the show GameSpy asked Miyamoto about the game after E br br It s moving along secretly like a submarine under the water When developing we often look at the different hardware and run different experiments on it and try out different ideas There have been a number of different experiment ideas that we have been running on the GameCube There are some that we have run on DS and there are other ideas too At this point I just don t know if we will see that game on one system or another It is still hard for me to make that decision I am the only director on that game right now I have the programmers making different experiments and when I see the results we will make the final decision IGN later in the year got a similar response Miyamoto again asserted Super Mario s experimental nature br At the GDC Nintendo of America s VP of Marketing Reggie Fils Aim stated that Super Mario would be shown at E probably in the form of a non interactive video However for the third year in a row the game once again failed to surface during E During a GameSpot video interview at E Reggie Fils Aim stated I can only show what Mr Miyamoto gives me to show When a reporter asked if it exists he responded I ve seen bits and pieces In an interview with Miyamoto from a Wired News reporter confirmed that Super Mario would not be produced for the GameCube but rather that it had been definitively moved to the Wii then code named Revolution br In September Shigeru Miyamoto gave his least ambiguous comments regarding Super Mario Questioned as to the status of the game by a Japanese radio station he revealed that Mario would have a new character by his side and reiterated that the game would appear on the Wii with a different name He mentioned that Super Mario had played a large role in the conception of the Wii console then known as Revolution as Super Mario had done for the Nintendo He went as far to say that the Wii was based around this new type of game br In Miyamoto said that he had forgotten whether Super Mario had been prototyped for the DD and said that it s become other games When asked whether he meant that the demo s gameplay functions are being used in other games Miyamoto responded From the time that we were originally making Mario Mario and Luigi were moving together But we couldn t get it working in the form of a game echoing his statements from He also hinted that some elements inspired by Super Mario such as running upon a spherical surface had been incorporated into Super Mario Galaxy br On March Miyamoto delivered the GDC keynote speech He mentioned that Super Mario was merely a demonstration of the GameCube s power and restated that several techniques from Super Mario had become foundational gameplay concepts of the Pikmin series and the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy series He said The one question I m always asked is What happened to Mario Most of you already played it in a game called Pikmin br br br Legacy br Initially presented as a public demonstration of the new GameCube s computational power and of Nintendo s programming prowess the secrecy and hype of Super Mario provoked some of the greatest anticipation in video gaming of and into the s The height of its intrigue is commemorated in the GameCube game Super Smash Bros Melee a battle stage titled Super Mario Event where the player is assailed by a total of tiny Mario figurines br The software technology and concepts within the Super Mario demonstration became or inspired core components of other Nintendo games the explosive herding and wandering behaviors of multitudinous tiny automata in the Pikmin series since the physics of Metroid Prime in the sphere walking gravity of the Super Mario Galaxy series since and the gravity defying feature of the Iron Boots in The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess in The director of the Super Mario demo Yoshiaki Koizumi became the director of Super Mario Galaxy br br br
