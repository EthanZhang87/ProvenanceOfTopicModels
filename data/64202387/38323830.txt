generally favorable reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic whereas Deluxe received universal acclaim Overall reviewers held Mario Kart in high esteem among racing games but considered Deluxe to be the definitive version of the title Deluxe was further called one of the best games in the Mario Kart series or one of the best racing games of all time Some reviewers considered the game to be an essential purchase for Nintendo Switch owners Improvements in Deluxe made certain features of Mario Kart feel worse in retrospect However many reviewers criticized the lack of new content in Deluxe compared to Mario Kart br The main racing mode of Mario Kart was widely praised Eurogamer called it the most vibrant home console racing game in years The rubber banding mechanics present in the game s AI competitors was criticized though Game Informer noted that fans accepted that pitfall as a series mainstay long ago Finding the core racing unchanged they said Deluxe is still the same great title from the Wii U GameSpot and Nintendo Life also considered Deluxe s racing to be as strong as the original Minor mechanical changes such as the ability to hold two items were praised with many liking how it added more strategy to Deluxe s item play Accessibility options like smart steering and auto acceleration received mixed feedback Many felt that the additions made Deluxe the most accessible Mario Kart game and others appreciated how they helped less experienced players enjoy the game despite making the game too easy for veteran players However some reviewers disliked how smart steering was enabled by default and how it could overcorrect or interfere with precision inputs br The main criticism levied at Mario Kart was its battle mode which was less well received than previous entries Easy Allies called it abysmal and Kotaku said it was borderline unplayable Giant Bomb panned the use of repurposed race courses for battle mode in lieu of dedicated battle courses like previous entries which made it difficult to find opponents to engage with By contrast Deluxe s revamped battle mode received widespread acclaim Easy Allies and Kotaku claimed that the new battle mode far outshined the original game and Pocket Gamer said that Deluxe returned battle mode to its original arena battling glory VentureBeat said that they remedied the issue with the original Mario Kart s battle courses However Electronic Gaming Monthly said that the battle mode was not so much a point for Deluxe that these modes are included as it is a retroactive demerit for the original Mario Kart Many critics considered Renegade Roundup to be the best of Deluxe s battle modes though GameRevolution and USgamer said it was their least favorite br Reviewers also focused on the graphics and visual style of the game Eurogamer praised both the vast sense of scale and the exquisite details of the courses Digital Foundry deemed it near perfection with phenomenal attention to detail featuring a magnificent visual package and magical playability Their technical analysis attributes the smoothness of motion and overall gameplay to the consistent performance of frames per second FPS with the split screen mode s effective FPS nonetheless comparing favorably with industry standard Reviewers for Deluxe echoed this praise with some saying that the graphics of Deluxe were an upgrade from the Wii U original GamesTM praised the incredible lighting of Deluxe saying that courses like Rainbow Road and Electrodrome stood out as fantastic showcases for the Nintendo universe and its creative spirit IGN felt that the great art direction in Mario Kart and Deluxe was a major reason for the game s graphics remaining gorgeous Easy Allies called the soundtrack something special saying that both original and returning songs were fantastic and downright catchy Eurogamer called the game s soundtrack outrageously upbeat and that Deluxe s defining moment was the game s live band rendition of Super Mario Kart s main theme br br br Booster Course Pass br Upon announcement the Booster Course Pass received mixed reception from fans Many fans disliked that additional content for a previous game was being prioritized over a new entry in the series citing how it had been nearly eight years since Mario Kart first released on the Wii U The graphics of the courses in the Booster Course Pass were also a point of contention with some saying that they fell short of the standards set by Deluxe br br After release critics were mixed according to Metacritic Waves received mixed or average reviews and Waves received generally favorable reviews Criticism focused on the graphics which were lower in detail compared to courses from the main game Digital Foundry attributed this to the courses being built upon their versions from Mario Kart Tour On the other hand many reviewers felt that the courses that originated in Tour were among the best gameplay wise and Ninja Hideaway in particular was praised as a highlight of Wave Some courses in Wave were lauded with Nintendo Life calling Waluigi Pinball s graphics stunning Another common criticism was that the earlier courses did not include Mario Kart s signature anti gravity or underwater features GameSpot lamented how the Booster Course Pass initially only introduced new courses rather than new characters or customization parts Nintendo Life praised the audio design calling it stellar and a delight The addition of courses that vary every lap was praised by critics with Nintendo Life wishing it would become a mainstay
