Crocodile Isle They once again defeat K Rool who is hurled into the geyser causing it to clog up and explode The explosion causes all of Crocodile Isle to sink as the Kongs watch K Rool escape on a small sailboat br br br Development and release br Development of Diddy s Kong Quest began shortly after the release of Donkey Kong Country but before its commercial success the employees of Rare desired to present new concepts Rare founder Tim Stamper served as director of the game whereas his colleague Brendan Gunn who had worked on the original returned to design the game In response to complaints from veteran gamers the game was designed to be more challenging than its predecessor Several working titles were considered including DK Rescue Diddy s Day Out Diddy s Wild Country and Diddy s Wild Frontier Diddy Kong s Quest was decided on but was slightly altered into Diddy s Kong Quest to create a play on the word conquest The game was announced at E A Virtual Boy port was in development at one time but never released br Like its predecessor Diddy s Kong Quest uses Silicon Graphics SGI and Advanced Computer Modelling ACM rendering technology in which pre rendered images are modelled as D objects and then transformed into D sprites and background layers The game s pirate themed narrative and level design was influenced by designer Gregg Mayles s fascination with the Golden Age of Piracy The team attempted to maintain the sense of speed and requirement of timing from the previous game To avoid reproducing the same game entirely Mayles altered the gameplay to be less linear and more encouraging of exploration while respecting the basics of fluidity and speed br In order to surprise players the team decided to cast Diddy Kong as the main character as opposed to Donkey Kong Mayles said that he dared to do without the iconic character of the series because his team s youth Mayles himself was during development allowed them to disregard risks The team preserved the gameplay mechanic of controlling two characters which led into the creation of Dixie Kong While Donkey and Diddy Kong controlled similarly the team decided to establish a character with very different abilities to force the player to change between characters regularly To achieve this difference the team gave Dixie the ability to hover and descend gradually Dixie was modeled and animated by Steve Mayles According to Gregg the choice to introduce a female character was decided before the creation of her ponytail and neither the hovering mechanism nor the intention to increase female representation in video games were an influence in the matter The ponytail was initially given to create a trailing visual effect when Dixie runs and Gregg decided to put the ponytail to use upon seeing this effect in action The concept of Dixie descending by using her ponytail as a helicopter blade was then created Due to the time consuming nature of the modeling process Diddy s model was used as the base for Dixie the ponytail was then added the clothes were changed and his features were made more feminine Nearly fifty names were considered for Dixie including Didene Dee Daisy Dandi Dolly Dizzie Danni Dippy and Ducky The team initially opted for Diddiane before finally deciding on Dixie Shigeru Miyamoto participated in the creation of the game s characters as he had for the previous game Miyamoto offered different motifs to adorn Dixie s beret with including a banana a heart and a logo namely one inspired by that of the musical group ABBA Rare incorporated the idea for a logo and placed a small version of the company s own on Dixie s beret in early promotional art The creation of Dixie came at the expense of Donkey Kong s fianc e Candy Kong who was removed from the game s cast due to Nintendo s concerns over her sexually provocative nature The design choice to have Diddy and Dixie transform into the friendly animals that were initially mounted in the previous game was made out of concerns over sprite size additionally Gregg noted that having the two player characters clinging onto a parrot would significantly reduce its maneuverability br Donkey Kong Country was released worldwide in late In Australia Nintendo released the Donkey Kong Country Pirate Pak a limited edition bundle of the game and SNES console The game was re released for the Game Boy Advance in br br br Audio br The soundtrack of Diddy s Kong Quest was composed by David Wise and was released in the United States as The Original Donkey Kong Country Soundtrack The soundtrack maintains similarity to its predecessor with its prominent percussion and eclectic genres ranging between big band disco and hip hop The melodies and rhythms are largely comical in tone but occasionally melancholic Certain themes are reminiscent of compositions by Vangelis and Phil Collins Wise cited Koji Kondo s music for the Mario and Zelda games Geoff and Tim Follin s music for Plok and synthesizer based film soundtracks released in the s as influences in creating the music for the Donkey Kong Country series As with its predecessor the music was produced for the SNES s SPC chip for the game to sound similar to the Korg Wavestation synthesizer br The game s soundtrack was the focus of an OverClocked ReMix collaboration Serious Monkey Business The final track Donkey Kong Rescued was remixed by David Wise himself featuring Grant Kirkhope on electric guitar and Robin Beanland on trumpet br br br Reception br br Upon release retailers struggled to meet the demand for the
