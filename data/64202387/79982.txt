Shigeru Miyamoto Japanese Hepburn Miyamoto Shigeru born November is a Japanese video game designer producer and game director at Nintendo where he serves as one of its representative directors as an executive since Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential designers in video games he is the creator of some of the most acclaimed and best selling game franchises of all time including Mario The Legend of Zelda Donkey Kong Star Fox and Pikmin More than billion copies of games featuring franchises created by Miyamoto have been sold br Born in Sonobe Kyoto Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts He originally sought a career as a manga artist until developing an interest in video games With the help of his father he joined Nintendo in after impressing the president Hiroshi Yamauchi with his toys He helped create art for the arcade game Sheriff and was later tasked with designing a new arcade game leading to the game Donkey Kong br Miyamoto s games Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda helped the Nintendo Entertainment System dominate the console game market His games have been flagships of every Nintendo video game console from the arcade machines of the late s to the present day He managed Nintendo s Entertainment Analysis Development software division which developed many Nintendo games and he played an important role in the creation of other influential games such as Pok mon Red and Blue and Metroid Prime Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in July Miyamoto became acting president alongside Genyo Takeda until he was formally appointed Creative Fellow a few months later br br br Early life br br Miyamoto was born on November in the Japanese town of Sonobe Kyoto Prefecture His parents were of modest means and his father taught English br From an early age Miyamoto explored the natural areas around his home He discovered a cave and after days of hesitation went inside His expeditions into the Kyoto countryside inspired his later work particularly The Legend of Zelda a seminal video game br In the early s Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts with a degree in industrial design He had a love for manga and initially hoped to become a professional manga artist before considering a career in video games He was influenced by manga s classic kish tenketsu narrative structure as well as Western genre television shows He was inspired to enter the video game industry by the arcade hit Space Invaders br br br Career br br br Arcade beginnings and Donkey Kong br I feel that I have been very lucky to be a game designer since the dawn of the industry I am not an engineer but I have had the opportunities to learn the principles of game design from scratch over a long period of time And because I am so pioneering and trying to keep at the forefront I have grown accustomed to first creating the very tools necessary for game creation br In the s Nintendo was a relatively small Japanese company that sold playing cards and other novelties although it had started to branch out into toys and games in the s Through a mutual friend Miyamoto s father arranged an interview with Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi After showing some of his toy creations he was hired in as an apprentice in the planning department br Miyamoto helped create the art for the coin operated arcade game Sheriff He first helped the company develop a game after the release Radar Scope The game achieved moderate success in Japan but by Nintendo s efforts to break it into the North American video game market had failed leaving them with a large number of unsold units and on the verge of financial collapse Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi decided to convert unsold Radar Scope units into a new arcade game He tasked Miyamoto with the conversion about which Miyamoto has said self deprecatingly that no one else was available to do the work Nintendo s head engineer Gunpei Yokoi supervised the project br Miyamoto imagined many characters and plot concepts but eventually settled on a love triangle between a gorilla a carpenter and a woman He meant to mirror the rivalry between comic characters Bluto and Popeye for the woman Olive Oyl although Nintendo s original intentions to gain rights to Popeye failed Bluto evolved into an ape a form Miyamoto claimed was nothing too evil or repulsive This ape would be the pet of the main character a funny hang loose kind of guy Miyamoto also named Beauty and the Beast and the film King Kong as influences Miyamoto had high hopes for his new project but lacked the technical skills to program it himself instead he conceived the game s concepts then consulted technicians on whether they were possible He wanted to make the characters different sizes move in different manners and react in various ways However Yokoi viewed Miyamoto s original design as too complex Yokoi suggested using see saws to catapult the hero across the screen but this proved too difficult to program Miyamoto next thought of using sloped platforms and ladders for travel with barrels for obstacles When he asked that the game have multiple stages the four man programming team complained that he was essentially asking them to make the game repeat but the team eventually successfully programmed the game When the game was sent to Nintendo of America for testing the sales manager disapproved of its vast differentiation from the maze and shooter games common at the time When American staffers began naming the characters they settled on Pauline for the woman after Polly James wife of Nintendo s Redmond Washington warehouse manager Don James The playable character initially Jumpman was eventually named for Mario Segale the warehouse landlord These character names were printed on the American cabinet art and used in promotional materials The staff also pushed for an English name and thus it received the title Donkey Kong br Donkey Kong was a success leading Miyamoto to work on sequels Donkey Kong Jr in and Donkey Kong in In January the Arcade Awards gave Donkey Kong the Best Single player video game award and the Certificate of Merit as runner up for Coin Op Game of the Year In his next game he gave Mario a brother Luigi He named the new game Mario Bros Yokoi convinced Miyamoto to give Mario some superhuman abilities namely the ability to fall from any height unharmed Mario s appearance in Donkey Kong overalls a hat and a thick mustache led Miyamoto to change aspects of the game to make Mario look like a plumber rather than a carpenter Miyamoto felt that New York City provided the best setting for the game with its labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes To date games in the Mario Bros franchise have been released for more than a dozen platforms Shortly after Miyamoto also worked the character sprites and game design for the Baseball Tennis and Golf games on the NES br br br NES Famicom Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda br br As Nintendo released its first home video game console the Family Computer rereleased in North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System Miyamoto made two of the most popular titles for the console and in the history of video games as a whole Super Mario Bros a sequel to Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda an entirely original title br In both games Miyamoto decided to focus more on gameplay than on high scores unlike many games of the time Super Mario Bros largely took a linear approach with the player traversing the stage by running jumping and dodging or defeating enemies It was a culmination of Miyamoto s gameplay concepts and technical knowledge drawn from his experiences of designing Donkey Kong Mario Bros Devil World the side scrolling racing game Excitebike and the NES port of side scrolling beat em up Kung Fu Master This culminated in his concept of a platformer set in an expansive world that would have the player strategize while scrolling sideways over long distances have aboveground and underground levels and have colorful backgrounds rather than black backgrounds br By contrast Miyamoto employed nonlinear gameplay in The Legend of Zelda forcing the player to think their way through riddles and puzzles The world was expansive and seemingly endless offering an array of choice and depth never seen before in a video game With The Legend of Zelda Miyamoto sought to make an in game world that players would identify with a miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto where he explored nearby fields woods and caves each Zelda game embodies this sense of exploration When I was a child Miyamoto said I went hiking and found a lake It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it When I traveled around the country without a map trying to find my way stumbling on amazing things as I went I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this He recreated his memories of becoming lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family home in Zelda s labyrinthine dungeons In February Nintendo released it as the launch game for the Nintendo Entertainment System s new Disk System peripheral br Miyamoto worked on various other different games for the Nintendo Entertainment System including Ice Climber and Kid Icarus He also worked on sequels to both Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda Super Mario Bros released only in Japan at the time reuses gameplay elements from Super Mario Bros though the game is much more difficult than its predecessor Nintendo of America disliked Super Mario Bros which they found to be frustratingly difficult and otherwise little more than a modification of Super Mario Bros Rather than risk the franchise s popularity they canceled its stateside release and looked for an alternative They realized they already had one option in Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic Dream Factory Heart Pounding Panic also designed by Miyamoto This game was reworked and released as Super Mario Bros not to be confused with the Japanese game of the same name in North America and Europe The Japanese version of Super Mario Bros was eventually released in North America as Super Mario Bros The Lost Levels br The successor to The Legend of Zelda Zelda II The Adventure of Link bears little resemblance to the first game in the series The Adventure of Link features side scrolling areas within a larger world map rather than the bird s eye view of the previous title The game incorporates a strategic combat system and more RPG elements including an experience points EXP system magic spells and more interaction with non player characters NPCs Link has extra lives no other game in the series includes this feature The Adventure of Link plays out in a two mode dynamic The overworld the area where the majority of the action occurs in other The Legend of Zelda games is still from a top down perspective but it now serves as a hub to the other areas Whenever Link enters a new area such as a town the game switches to a side scrolling view These separate methods of traveling and entering combat are one of many aspects adapted from the role playing genre The game was highly successful at the time and introduced elements such as Link s magic meter and the Dark Link character that would become commonplace in future Zelda games although the role playing elements such as experience points and the platform style side scrolling and multiple lives were never used again in the official series The game is also looked upon as one of the most difficult games in the Zelda series and bit gaming as a whole Additionally The Adventure of Link was one of the first games to combine role playing video game and platforming elements to a considerable degree br Soon after Super Mario Bros was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis Development the game took more than two years to complete The game offers numerous modifications on the original Super Mario Bros ranging from costumes with different abilities to new enemies Bowser s children were designed to be unique in appearance and personality Miyamoto based the characters on seven of his programmers as a tribute to their work on the game The Koopalings names were later altered to mimic names of well known Western musicians in the English localization In a first for the Mario series the player navigates via two game screens an overworld map and a level playfield The overworld map displays an overhead representation of the current world and has several paths leading from the world s entrance to a castle Moving the on screen character to a certain tile will allow access to that level s playfield a linear stage populated with obstacles and enemies The majority of the game takes place in these levels br br br SNES Nintendo Super Mario and Ocarina of Time br br A merger between Nintendo s various internal research and development teams led to the creation of Nintendo Entertainment Analysis Development Nintendo EAD which Miyamoto eventually headed Nintendo EAD had approximately fifteen months to develop F Zero a launch game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Miyamoto worked through various games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System one of them Star Fox For the game programmer Jez San convinced Nintendo to develop an upgrade for the Super Nintendo allowing it to handle three dimensional graphics better the Super FX chip Using this new hardware Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi designed the Star Fox game with an early implementation of three dimensional graphics br Miyamoto produced two major Mario games for the system The first Super Mario World was a launch game It features an overworld as in Super Mario Bros and introduces a new character Yoshi who appears in many other Nintendo games The second Mario game for the system Super Mario RPG went in a somewhat different direction Miyamoto led a team consisting of a partnership between Nintendo and Square it took nearly a year to develop the graphics The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the Super Mario Bros series br Miyamoto also created The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System the third entry in the series Dropping the side scrolling elements of its predecessor A Link to the Past introduced to the series elements that are still commonplace today such as the concept of an alternate or parallel world the Master Sword and other new weapons and items br Shigeru Miyamoto mentored Satoshi Tajiri guiding him during the creation process of Pocket Monsters Red and Green released in English as Pok mon Red and Blue the initial video games in the Pok mon series He also acted as the producer for these games and worked on social gameplay concepts such as trading Pok mon would go on to be one of the most popular entertainment franchises in the world spanning video games anime and various other merchandise br Miyamoto made several games for the Nintendo mostly from his previous franchises His first game on the new system and one of its launch games is Super Mario for which he was the principal director In developing the game he began with character design and the camera system Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take and spent months to select an appropriate camera view and layout The original concept involved a fixed path much like an isometric type game before the choice was made to settle on a free roaming D design He guided the design of the Nintendo controller in tandem with that of Super Mario br Using what he had learned about the Nintendo from developing Super Mario and Star Fox Miyamoto produced his next game The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time leading a team of several directors Its engine was based on that of Super Mario but was so heavily modified as to be a somewhat different engine Individual parts of Ocarina of Time were handled by multiple directors a new strategy for Nintendo EAD However when things progressed slower than expected Miyamoto returned to the development team with a more central role assisted in public by interpreter Bill Trinen The team was new to D games but assistant director Makoto Miyanaga recalls a sense of passion for creating something new and unprecedented Miyamoto went on to produce a sequel to Ocarina of Time known as The Legend of Zelda Majora s Mask By reusing the game engine and graphics from Ocarina of Time a smaller team required only months to finish Majora s Mask br Miyamoto worked on a variety of Mario series spin offs for the Nintendo including Mario Kart and Mario Party br br br GameCube Wii and DS br br Miyamoto produced various games for the GameCube including the launch game Luigi s Mansion The game was first revealed at Nintendo Space World as a technical demo designed to show off the graphical capabilities of the GameCube Miyamoto made an original short demo of the game concepts and Nintendo decided to turn it into a full game Luigi s Mansion was later shown at E with the GameCube console Miyamoto continued to make additional Mario spinoffs in these years He also produced the D game series Metroid Prime after the original designer Yokoi a friend and mentor of Miyamoto s died In this time he developed Pikmin and its sequel Pikmin based on his experiences gardening He also worked on new games for the Star Fox Donkey Kong F Zero and The Legend of Zelda series on both the GameCube and the Game Boy Advance systems With the help of Hideo Kojima he guided the developers of Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes He helped with many games on the Nintendo DS including the remake of Super Mario titled Super Mario DS and the new game Nintendogs a new franchise based on his own experiences with dogs At E Miyamoto showed off Nintendogs with Tina Wood where he promised to show her a few more tricks backstage br Miyamoto played a major role in the development of the Wii a console that popularized motion control gaming and its launch game Wii Sports which helped show the capability of the new control scheme Miyamoto went on to produce other titles in the Wii series including Wii Fit His inspiration for Wii Fit was to encourage conversation and family bonding br At E Miyamoto unveiled The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess appearing dressed as the protagonist Link with a sword and shield Also released for the GameCube the game was among the Wii s launch games and the first in the Zelda series to implement motion controls He also helped with The Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword which featured more accurate motion controls He also produced two Zelda titles for the Nintendo DS The Legend of Zelda Phantom Hourglass and The Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks These were the first titles in the series to implement touch screen controls br Miyamoto produced three major Mario titles for Wii from to Super Mario Galaxy New Super Mario Bros Wii and Super Mario Galaxy br br br present Wii U DS Switch and other projects br Unlike in the s in which he was involved on many projects as producer Miyamoto s activities in development were less pronounced in that decade with Miyamoto only producing Luigi s Mansion Dark Moon and Star Fox Zero Otherwise Miyamoto was credited as General Producer Executive Producer and Supervisor for most projects which are positions with much less involvement in comparison to a producer br Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in July Miyamoto was appointed as an acting Representative Director alongside Genyo Takeda He was relieved of this position in September when Tatsumi Kimishima assumed the role of the company s president He was also appointed the position of Creative Fellow at the same time providing expert advice to Kimishima as a support network alongside Takeda In his capacity as Creative Fellow he provides feedback and guidance to game directors during development br In it was announced that Miyamoto would be working as a producer on The Super Mario Bros Movie based on the Mario franchise by Illumination br Miyamoto was heavily involved with the design and construction of Super Nintendo World a themed area featured at Universal Studios Japan and Universal Studios Hollywood and under construction at Universal Studios Singapore and Universal Epic Universe Miyamoto oversaw the design and construction of the land and its attractions and acted as Nintendo s public representative on the land hosting several promotional materials including a December Nintendo Direct in which he gave a tour of parts of the land br br br Development philosophy br People have paid me a lot of lip service calling me a genius story teller or a talented animator and have gone so far as to suggest that I try my hand at movies since my style of game design is in their words quite similar to making movies But I feel that I am not a movie maker but rather that my strength lies in my pioneering spirit to make use of technology to create the best interactive commodities possible and use that interactivity to give users a game they can enjoy and play comfortably br Miyamoto and Nintendo as a whole do not use focus groups Instead Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun for himself He says that if he enjoys it others will too He elaborates citing the conception of the Pok mon series as an example And that s the point Not to make something sell something very popular but to love something and make something that we creators can love It s the very core feeling we should have in making games Miyamoto wants players to experience kyokan he wants the players to feel about the game what the developers felt themselves br He then tests it with friends and family He encourages younger developers to consider people who are new to gaming for example by having them switch their dominant hand with their other hand to feel the experience of an unfamiliar game br Miyamoto s philosophy does not focus on hyper realistic graphics although he realizes they have their place He is more focused on the game mechanics such as the choices and challenges in the game Similar to how manga artists subverted their genre Miyamoto hopes to subvert some of the basic principles he had popularized in his early games retaining some elements but eliminating others br His game design philosophy typically prioritizes gameplay over storytelling In a interview he said the important thing is that it feels good when you re playing it and that quality is not determined by the story but by the controls the sound and the rhythm and pacing However he requires a compatibility between the story and gameplay because a good story can smooth over that discrepancy and make it all feel natural br His use of real time rendered cinematics not prerendered video serves both his own rapidly interactive development process with no rendering delays and the player s interaction with the game s continuity He prefers to change his games right until they are finalized and to make something unique and unprecedented He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences stating in I will never make movie like games therefore the more than total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout Ocarina of Time deliver more interactive cinematic qualities His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months of the development of Ocarina of Time He said The reason behind using such a simple process as I am sure you have all experienced in the workshop is that there is a total limit on team energy There is a limit to the work a team can do and there is a limit to my own energy We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre rendered images for use in cinema scenes but rather on tests on other inter active elements and polishing up the game br For these reasons he opposes prerendered cutscenes Of Ocarina of Time he says we were able to make use of truly cinematic methods with our camera work without relying on prerendered video br Miyamoto has occasionally been critical of the role playing game RPG genre In a interview when asked whether Zelda is an RPG series he declined but classified it as a real time adventure he said he was not interested in games decided by stats and numbers but in preserving as much of that live feeling as possible which he said action games are better suited in conveying In he described his fundamental dislike of the RPG genre I think that with an RPG you are completely bound hand and foot and can t move But gradually you become able to move your hands and legs you become slightly untied And in the end you feel powerful So what you get out of an RPG is a feeling of happiness But I don t think they re something that s fundamentally fun to play With a game like that anyone can become really good at it With Mario though if you re not good at it you may never get good While critical of the RPG gameplay system he has occasionally praised certain aspects of RPGs such as Yuji Horii s writing in the Dragon Quest series the interactive cinematic approach of the Final Fantasy series and Shigesato Itoi s dialogue in the Mother series br br br Impact br br Time called Miyamoto the Spielberg of video games and the father of modern video games while The Daily Telegraph says he is regarded by many as possibly the most important game designer of all time GameTrailers called him the most influential game

to Miyamoto more than any other person Next Generation listed him in their Most Important People in the Games Industry of elaborating that He s the most successful game developer in history He has a unique and brilliant mind as well as an unparalleled grasp of what gamers want to play br br br Industry br Miyamoto s first major arcade hit Donkey Kong was highly influential It spawned a number of other games with a mix of running jumping and vertical traversal Particularly novel the vertical genre was initially referred to as Donkey Kong type or Kong style before finalizing as platform Earlier games either use storytelling or cutscenes but Donkey Kong combines both to introduce the use of cutscenes to visually advance a complete story It has multiple distinct levels that progress the storyline Computer and Video Games called Donkey Kong the most momentous release of br Miyamoto s best known and most influential game Super Mario Bros depending on your point of view created an

general In Game Informer called The Legend of Zelda no less than the greatest game of all time on their list of The Top Games of All Time saying that it was ahead of its time by years if not decades br At the time of the release of Star Fox the use of filled three dimensional polygons in a console game was very unusual apart from a handful of earlier titles Due to its success Star Fox has become a Nintendo franchise with five more games and numerous appearances by its characters in other Nintendo games such as the Super Smash Bros series br His game Super Mario defined the field of D game design particularly with its use of a dynamic camera system and the implementation of its analog control The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time s gameplay system introduced features such as a target lock system and context sensitive buttons that have since become common elements in D adventure games br The Wii which Miyamoto played a major role in designing is the first wireless motion controlled
