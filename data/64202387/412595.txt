in January br br br Functionality br br The Super Game Boy is compatible with the same cartridges as the original Game Boy original Game Boy cartridges the Game Boy Camera and dual mode Game Boy Color cartridges in Game Boy mode The unit could map the four shades of green to various colors on the screen Later Game Boy games that were optimized to use the Super Game Boy had additional color information and could override the on screen colors display a graphical border around the screen and display special background sprites as seen in the Mario s Picross title screen Those games would have printed a small Super Game Boy Game Pak logo on the box and cartridge The adaptor could support up to colors for the border and colors for the screen Static screens could display all colors Certain games can load multiple borders depending on the player s location in the game such as Dragon Warrior I II br It is also possible for Super Game Boy games to make use of the Super NES hardware for extra effects as demonstrated in Contra The Alien Wars Donkey Kong Kirby s Dream Land A Bug s Life FIFA Road to World Cup Madden Animaniacs and Toy Story these games had expanded sound when used with the Super Game Boy Wario Blast the Game Boy version of Primal Rage the Game Boy version of Killer Instinct and several other titles even allowed the second Super NES controller to be used for two player action The title screen changed to show that these games had a two player option rather than a connection status Using the Super Multitap some games even supported four players The original Super Game Boy does not support game link multiplayer because according to a Nintendo spokesman a two player configuration would interfere with the RF signal from the television br The Game Boy version of Space Invaders allowed players to access a Super NES version of the game as well as a colored version of the Game Boy game The Super NES version is copied into and run from the console s internal KiB work RAM br Some black Game Boy Color cartridge games also have Super Game Boy enhancements although there is not any logo indicating this on the cartridge or on the front of the box as there are for original Game Boy releases Several GBC titles do have a small Super Game Boy compatibility icon located on the back of their packaging such as for Dragon Warrior Monsters Cobi s Journey br br br Hardware br Because the Super NES cannot emulate the Game Boy hardware at full speed the Super Game Boy actually consists of the same hardware as the original handheld inside the cartridge is a separate CPU that processes the games while the Super NES only provided means for user input output of graphics to the screen and the additional coloring br The original Super Game Boy is known to play the game program and its audio faster than other Game Boy hardware This is due to the use of the Super NES s clock speed divided by which ends up being MHz instead of MHz br br br Super Game Boy br br The Super Game Boy was released only in Japan in January Additions included a link port to allow a user to access two player mode via the link cable the green game link LED and the red power LED indicator and it runs at the exact speed of the Game Boy the original model runs faster than a Game Boy In addition it came with eight new default borders which replaced those in the original model though the old borders are still accessible via a code however it retained the same built in palettes and coloring tools as on the original model Also this version of the SGB does not allow one to change borders in some games that have built in borders Some games have features only available through the Super Game Boy such as a special Tetris DX border br br br System menu br The system menu is accessed by pressing the L and R buttons at the same time the menu has five options to choose from br br Color Palette Choose from one of pre made color palettes the Super Game Boy enhanced palette s if available or a user created palette if available A few Super Game Boy games will not allow the palette to be changed Internally the Super Game Boy includes special palettes for several games that came out before the release of the Super Game Boy for example Alleyway Yoshi s Cookie Kirby s Pinball Land Metroid II Return of Samus and Solar Striker have of the default colors by default br Border Choose from one of pre made borders the Super Game Boy enhanced border s if available or a user created border if created br Button Setting Switches between two controller mappings A few Super Game Boy games will not allow the controller setting to be changed br Custom Color Create a custom color palette and get a password to retrieve it later If palette changes are disabled within the game this option will also be unavailable br Graffiti Create a custom border by using several painting tools If plugged into the second controller port the Super NES Mouse could be used for this feature br Some games disable the use of changing colors so the unavailable options are blacked out br br br Predecessors and successors br The Super Game Boy is the successor to Intelligent Systems Wide Boy which connected to the Famicom or NES One difference between the Wide Boy and the Super Game Boy is that the former did not use any part of the Famicom NES other than the video memory Even the controller a single Famicom controller is hardwired directly into the Wide Boy The Wide Boy would continue running even if the reset button is held down on the Famicom NES The Game Boy had twice as many tiles as could fit in the Famicom NES s video memory so the Wide Boy had to refresh the Famicom NES s video memory halfway down the screen br Camerica had a Game Boy to NES adaptor developed by Biederman Design Labs which appeared similar to the Super Game Boy br The Super Game Boy was followed by the Transfer Pak for the Nintendo which allowed one to play the six seven in Japan Game Boy and Game Boy Color Pok mon titles in Pok mon Stadium and Pok mon Stadium in a Super Game Boy like fashion complete with the Super Game Boy enhanced borders and palettes The games were played via the use of a software emulator on the Nintendo However the main role of the Transfer Pak was to transfer data from Game Boy Color to Nintendo games not to play games br The Wide Boy was released for the N in two major versions the CGB version which allowed Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles to be played on a television and the AGB version which also allowed Game Boy Advance games to be played It cost and like the original Wide Boy it was only available to developers and the gaming press These devices were used to take screenshots of Nintendo handheld video games to be in retail media br The GB Hunter is one of two Nintendo items released by EMS Production Ltd the other being the N Passport a Game Boy emulator for the Nintendo An N game is plugged into the back of the item and a Game Boy cartridge is plugged into the top The N game requires a CIC Like the Super Game Boy it connects to the N s cartridge slot and makes it possible to play Game Boy games on it without the game s sound instead the GB Hunter s built in theme song is looped endlessly during the game There is also a cheating device programmed into it called the Golden Finger like the Game Shark along with a trainer option to determine the RAM values that decrement increment change or stay the same This can provide certain cheat codes to try out in the game Holding the L and R buttons simultaneously will cause the game to freeze at that point and the GB Hunter Menu to appear The game screen can be maximized or minimized from this menu allowing the player to play the game in fullscreen The color palette can also be changed from the menu to view the game in a custom variation of the different palettes available to the Game Boy PPU using RGB values These palettes correspond to the background and two sprite palettes There are also preset borders to place around the game with the added support of SGB borders Most sellers of this item on eBay and other places such as the EMS site itself do not mention that the Game Boy game audio is not heard while being played on the GB Hunter br Datel s GameBooster technology was sold in the west by EMS and branded as the GB Hunter It was released for the Nintendo halfway through the console s lifespan It was not officially licensed by Nintendo as it had a slot at the back for an N game to override the lockout technology in the system Datel also made a version for Sony s PlayStation console which uses the Parallel I O port on the back of the console not found on the Series models of the system or the slimline PSone system This version has a graphically better theme lacks the song that is played in the N version has battery save support and has a built in game titled Rebound Mission although the palette customizer only has one palette as opposed to three However it has a built in music CD player which can be used to mimick the original Game Boy game audio The GameBooster was also rebranded as the PowerFlash though many differences are unknown other than the name change br On the GameCube the Game Boy Player was released in which could play Game Boy Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games It allowed these games to be played on a full television screen The GBP attaches to the bottom of the console and a boot disc must be running in the GameCube disc drive in order to boot it although the disc can be removed afterwards The Game Boy Player functions just like a Game Boy Advance letterboxing the games display on a standard television set Some GBA games were programmed with consideration for the Player including activating the vibration feature in GameCube controllers and special color palettes which accounted for a TV s brightness and resolution However the Game Boy Player will not activate Super Game Boy options on a Super Game Boy enhanced cartridge Also when playing a Game Boy or Game Boy Color game on the Game Boy Player a black border will appear between the main border and the gameplay area this is a carry over from the Game Boy Advance br br br Peripherals br br In Japan Hori released a special Super Game Boy controller called the SGB Commander The controller aside from the Game Boy buttons A B Start and Select also has Super Game Boy specific buttons which can enable the user to mute the sound reduce the speed of the game change the colors and modify the display window An additional switch is provided to alternate between Super Game Boy mode and regular Super Famicom Mode br br br Guide br In shortly after the Super Game Boy release Nintendo sent the Nintendo Power magazine subscribers the Super Game Boy Player s Guide a page instruction book guide to using the features of the Super Game Boy The first pages were instructional followed by pages of very brief overview style walkthrough of several games These walkthroughs highlighted various points of the games and often pointed out color schemes to set that area s intended mood Games included Super Mario Land Super Mario Land Golden Coins Wario Land Super Mario Land the newly released Donkey Kong which had a special Super Game Boy border and color palette Metroid II Return of Samus The Legend of Zelda Link s Awakening Kirby s
