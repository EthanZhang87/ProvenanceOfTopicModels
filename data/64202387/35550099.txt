of Princess Peach he also had another cast of characters a princess from outer space and her family of talking stars the Lumas who had a deeper sadder story that was revealed through elegant picture book scenes throughout the game This storybook is known in game as Rosalina s Storybook and tells Rosalina s backstory It was written by Yoshiaki Koizumi late at night so that no one would find out about it saying that for a long time it really felt like telling a story in a Mario game was something that wasn t allowed in an interview In another interview Koizumi stated I felt in this case that the Lumas and Rosalina really needed a story to explain what they were doing out there and to give the players a deeper understanding of their presence So telling her story as a fairytale by reading the book to all the Lumas as if they were young children at storytime just seemed like the mood appropriate way to accomplish this br When Rosalina s character was in early development the Super Mario Galaxy development team contemplated having her character be related to Princess Peach This relationship did not remain as an element of the final story but is the reason for the design similarities between Peach and Rosalina br br br Appearances br br br Super Mario series br In Super Mario Galaxy Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach by raising her castle from the ground with Peach still inside and
