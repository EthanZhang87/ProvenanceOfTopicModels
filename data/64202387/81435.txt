commentary being critical of her longstanding repetitive role as a princess waiting to be rescued She has been described by critics as one of the most iconic and influential female video game characters br br br Concept and creation br br br Characterization br Princess Peach was preceded as Mario s romantic interest by a character named Pauline originally named Lady that appeared as the damsel in distress in Mario s first video game Donkey Kong in Mario s creator Shigeru Miyamoto wanted to use the characters Popeye Bluto and Olive Oyl from the Popeye cartoon as the main characters but failed to obtain the license so he transformed them into Jumpman Mario Donkey Kong and Pauline Donkey Kong established Pauline s role as the female character who is rescued by Mario and appears as the damsel in distress in subsequent games With the arrival of the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Mario Bros Pauline was replaced by Princess Peach Miyamoto later said that Donkey Kong had been designed for arcades which were frequented by male gamers so Nintendo did not consider making a character that would be playable by girls Several characteristics of Princess Peach were introduced in the role playing game Super Mario RPG including her use of a parasol as a weapon and a sleep spell ability that inspired her Final Smash in the Super Smash Bros series br Following the debut of Waluigi in Mario Tennis an evil version of Peach named Walupeach was pitched by Shugo Takahashi co founder of Camelot Software Planning but the concept was rejected by Miyamoto before seeing the design saying that it would be just like Doronjo from the Yatterman anime series The design was pitched again by Waluigi s creator Fumihide Aoki for the video game Mario Power Tennis but was rejected by Nintendo br Reflecting on Peach s role within the franchise Miyamoto said that although Nintendo had intentionally kept her as a damsel in distress who is saved by Mario in the games they had wanted to develop her into a more powerful princess in The Super Mario Bros Movie He said that Peach was one of the characters in the film that evolved the most as her role was changed from a princess that needs to be protected to one who fights for Toad After the release of the film in Peach s appearance was updated on the box art for Princess Peach Showtime to make her appear more angry and determined like her movie counterpart br br br Design br br Peach s initial appearance was drawn by Miyamoto who later asked Y ichi Kotabe to redraw Peach with his instructions He had asked Kotabe to draw her eyes to be a little cat like and wanted her to look stubborn but a little cute A strategy guide titled How to Win at Super Mario Bros which was published around the time of the first Super Mario Bros game in depicted the princess as a human on its cover but also with an alternative design featuring a mushroom head Other merchandise designs created around the time of the first game depicted Peach with straight long blonde hair wearing a red skirt illustrating that her design was not finalized until later games br When discussing Peach s design for Super Princess Peach released in Miyamoto said that it was important for Peach to be Peach like meaning that she evokes the free optimism of a princess He explained that she was designed to convey an image of strength rather than being protected by Mario due to many Nintendo developers being used to a matriarchal figure at home br br br Names br Miyamoto said that Peach s name came from associating princesses with girls and when thinking about girls he would think of pink In Japan Peach s name has always been Princess Peach P chi Hime Princess Peach since her debut in the original Super Mario Bros in However she was localized as Princess Toadstool in the English language manual The English version of Yoshi s Safari released in contained the first usage of the name Peach in the Western world though she was called

the Toads being the predominant race Throughout the mainline series the Mushroom Kingdom is under persistent attack from Bowser and his minions and Peach s role is to be his kidnapping victim Her age has never been officially confirmed but it varies between mid teens and early twenties br Despite being the lead female character of the Mario franchise Princess Peach has rarely been the protagonist

of all time naming her an icon that transcends gaming and commenting that she acts as one of Nintendo s main mascots on a worldwide scale SyFy also described Peach as one of the greatest video game heroines of all time for being a tough female character that embraces the power of being a high femme Alyse Knorr writer for Kotaku noted that Peach is one of many examples of the damsel in distress trope that recurs throughout history commenting that she is such a damsel clich that she mainly existed as a plot device rather than as an individual character and that her role was to provide Mario with a reason to exist Feminist organization Sister Namibia was critical of the fact that Peach always needed to be rescued by reasoning that it propagates that women are helpless and in constant need of saving and she serves quite literally as a trophy for the completion of Mario s quest She is ultimately just another object or reward for Mario to use Mike Fahey of Kotaku created a victimization record for Princess Peach that detailed her many kidnappings within the series commenting There are few women with more kidnappings under their belt than her royal mushroom highness In an article about the impact of princesses on girls Peggy Orenstein of The New York Times said that she loved Peach but noted that her peachiness did nothing to upset the apple cart of expectation She considered Peach to be an ideal postfeminist solution by the melding of old and new standards br Josh Straub of Game Informer cited the repeated failure to find the princess in the first Super Mario Bros game as one of the most memorable moments in gaming history stating that reaching the end of a world and being told by a Toad But our princess is in another castle was a method of torture that forced the player to face another round of platforming Peter Tieryas writer of Kotaku considered Peach to be the best character in Super Mario Bros and emphasized that her floating ability was the first of Nintendo s solutions for fine tuning jumping in platform games Matt Kamen of Wired appreciated the plot of Super Mario Sunshine for having a bit more impetus to a game than rescue Peach again and felt that this offered more depth and personality to the characters Video Games Chronicle s Chris Scullion said that Peach s starring role in Super Princess Peach should have been a turning point for the character but ended up as an average platformer with a questionable central mechanic by focusing on her getting emotional In his review of Super Princess Peach Mark Bozon of IGN thought that Peach s emotion powers and use of coins to shop were borderline insulting and seemed like a girls game made by guys Mike Sholars of Kotaku felt that the introduction of Rosalina in Super Mario Galaxy impacted the Super Mario series so that it no longer needed to rely on the concept of saving the princess and enabled Peach to be more than a plot device br Bryan Vore of Game Informer praised Super Mario D World for being the first game in years of the mainline series since Super Mario Bros to include Peach as a playable character saying that it demonstrated Nintendo s willingness to change the formula Chris Suellentrop writer for The New York Times opined that Super Mario Run was not a family friendly game due to its stale retrograde gender stereotypes and said that Nintendo had failed to update Super Mario for a contemporary audience by beginning the game with Princess Peach being a hostage Sam Loveridge of GamesRadar felt that in Super Mario Odyssey Nintendo was playing him from the start by beginning the game with Peach being abducted by Bowser and ending it with a scene in which she rejects the romantic advances of both Bowser and Mario He commented that Peach shrugs off all those years of being the damsel in distress to forge her own path in the world as a single woman and that in doing so Nintendo was clearly recognizing its female fanbase Rebekah Valentine of IGN said that Princess Peach Showtime was the opportunity to see Peach defined only by herself rather than by Mario Following the game s release Tom Regan of The Guardian found the game to be disappointing and considered it to be patronising to its capable heroine and a wasted opportunity to celebrate the princess Conversely Polygon IGN and Nintendo Life all responded positively and considered it to be the spotlight she deserved Ashley Bardhan of Eurogamer said that rather than casting Peach in her usual role of Bowser s victim the game made her a girl with some agency and thought that her future was no longer doomed with dead end kidnapping but now had limitless potential br Los Angeles Times writer Tracy Brown said that Peach started out as an unappealing character due to being simply a princess waiting to be rescued but was given more personality in later games She further remarked that The Super Mario Bros Movie incarnation had subverted her characteristics by depicting an empowered ruler who is capable of engaging in battle and protecting her subjects without it being at the expense of her femininity Christian Holub of Entertainment Weekly responded positively to Peach s characterization in the film calling her a female protagonist for the Rey generation but also a relatable character for older players Hope Bellingham writer of GamesRadar appreciated her active role in the story describing her as the brains behind the operation even though Mario has the starring role By contrast Julia Glassman of The Mary Sue considered her film incarnation to be a common sexist trope where the badass female character must step aside for an average male by supporting and training him rather than taking the lead Gene Park writer of The Washington Post felt that Peach had been empowered long before her movie incarnation due to being the most visible woman in video games having appeared in more titles than any fictional woman in the medium and hoped that the movie would finally transform her image in the public consciousness Logan Plant of IGN described Peach as one of Nintendo s most iconic characters and felt that Nintendo was finally giving her the attention she deserved in film and video games br br br Legacy br Peach has been described as one of the greatest video game characters by game websites and publications including the version of the Guinness World Records Gamer s Edition and GameSpot which described her as arguably the most famous woman in video game history Several journalists have also described her as a queer icon Time named Peach as one of the most influential video game characters of all time describing her as the quintessential damsel in distress but noted that Nintendo had improved her status over time by making her a playable character and introducing her in other game series like Super Smash Bros Peach was cited to be an influence on other video game developers creating strong female protagonists Tracey John writing for Time commented that Peach s repeated abductions had become a running joke and a pop culture reference In a short comic The Super Crown s some spicy new Mario lore on DeviantArt and Twitter transformed Bowser into a monstrously sinister female resembling Peach that fans named Bowsette which inspired numerous works of fan art In May in an episode of Saturday Night Live Grimes dressed as Princess
