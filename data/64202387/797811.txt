Junior in the North American arcade version and various conversions to non Nintendo systems br The game was principally designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and his coworker and the company s chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi Miyamoto also created the graphics for the title along with Yoshio Sakamoto As with its predecessor the music for the game was composed by Yukio Kaneoka br br br Gameplay br br Like its predecessor Donkey Kong Jr is a platform game There are a total of four stages each with a unique theme DK Jr can run left and right jump and grab vines chains ropes to climb higher on the screen He can slide down faster by holding only one vine or climb faster by holding two Enemies include Snapjaws which resemble bear traps with eyes bird like creatures called Nitpickers some of which can attack by dropping eggs and Sparks which roam across the wiring in one of Mario s hideouts DK Jr can jump over these enemies while on platforms switch from one vine chain rope to another to dodge them or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen br To pass the first three stages DK Jr must reach the key hanging next to his father s cage whereupon Mario flees while pushing the cage off the screen In the fourth stage DK Jr must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong After a brief cutscene the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty A bonus timer runs throughout each stage and any points remaining on it are added to the player s score upon completion br DK Jr loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile falls too great a distance touches the water and falls off the bottom of the screen or if the bonus timer counts down to zero The game ends when the player loses all of their lives br br br Plot br Donkey Kong has been defeated by Mario who has put him in a cage in a forest Donkey Kong s son Donkey Kong Jr follows Mario in an attempt to free his father Mario transports Donkey Kong to his Hideout via helicopter before Mario takes the keys to Donkey Kong s chains and places them around the building Several enemies attack Donkey Kong Jr but he escapes them and makes it to his father releasing him from the chains as Mario falls to the ground Donkey Kong Jr saves Donkey Kong and the two set off together Mario pursues the kongs but flees after Donkey Kong knocks him back br br br Development br During Donkey Kong s development in Shigeru Miyamoto s team had come up with several ideas and full complete levels that wouldn t really fit into the game due to the various constraints His team eventually began fleshing out these concepts and these designs evolved into something all their own The process was so far along with even entire stages conceived that one of the team members suggested they start working on another video game The conversation happened around the same time that Nintendo wanted another Donkey Kong coin op to capitalize on the original s fame giving Miyamoto the perfect opportunity to further explore his newly established franchise Originally Miyamoto wanted the new game to star Donkey Kong himself but there were problems with the character s massive size He wouldn t be maneuverable on the screen so a new star was needed The change brought about a new hero and drove the narrative in an entirely new direction They ultimately came up with the idea to make a smaller Donkey Kong in place of Mario who would be the son of Donkey Kong Since they still wanted a big Donkey Kong on top of the screen they came up with the plot of Mario capturing him after the events of the first game br br br Versions br The order of the levels is different in different territories In the Japanese version the four levels appear in sequence and then repeat just as with the Japanese release of Donkey Kong In the US version the order is and then from then on br br br Kill screen br Donkey Kong Jr has a kill screen at level Due to the level counter only having one digit the counter shows numbers to in levels to seven blanks in levels to and the letters A to F in the levels The kill screen occurs the same way as in
