Satoru Iwata Japanese Hepburn Iwata Satoru December July was a Japanese businessman video game programmer video game designer and producer He was the fourth president and chief executive officer CEO of Nintendo from until his death in He was a major contributor in broadening the appeal of video games by focusing on novel and entertaining games rather than top of the line hardware br Born in Sapporo Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school He majored in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology In he joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while attending the university At HAL he worked as a programmer and closely collaborated with Nintendo producing his first commercial game in Games to which he contributed include EarthBound and many games in the Kirby series Following a downturn and near bankruptcy Iwata became the president of HAL in at the insistence of Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability In the following years he worked in the development of the Pok mon and Super Smash Bros series Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division in br Nintendo saw growth under Iwata and when Yamauchi retired he became the company s president in May Under Iwata s direction Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS and Wii game consoles helping the company achieve financial success As a self declared gamer he focused on expanding the appeal of video games across demographics through a blue ocean business strategy Nintendo attained record profits by and Barron s placed Iwata among the top CEOs worldwide Iwata expanded his strategy by defining a quality of life product line for the Wii that evolved into a ten year strategy to create standalone products Later hardware such as the Nintendo DS and Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii and Nintendo s net sales fell by two thirds from to the company saw its first operating losses in years during this time Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in and again in In after several years of refusal Iwata put a portion of Nintendo s focus into the rapidly growing mobile game market a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA was established that March Throughout his career Iwata built a relationship with Nintendo fans through social media and his regular appearances in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct becoming the public face of the company br In June a tumor in Iwata s bile duct was discovered during a routine physical exam It was removed and Iwata returned to work in October of that year The problem resurfaced in and Iwata died at the age of from its complications on July Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media and fans worldwide established temporary memorials Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Golden Joystick Awards and the D I C E Awards br br br Early life br br Satoru Iwata was born on December and raised in Sapporo Japan where his father served as a prefectural official Throughout middle and high school Iwata displayed leadership skills through service as class president student council president and club president at various times His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game called Game until he mastered it With money saved up from a dish washing job and some additional allowance from his father Iwata purchased an HP the first programmable calculator in After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April he began developing his own games during his junior year The several simple number games Iwata produced such as Volleyball and Missile Attack made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates br He obtained his first computer a Commodore PET in He dismantled and studied the machine out of his desire to understand it The computer coincidentally had a central processing unit MOS similar to the one used by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System NES a gaming console for which he would later develop games Following high school Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in April where he majored in computer science Tomohiko Uematsu an engineering professor noted Iwata s proficiency with software programming and remarked that Iwata could write programs faster and more accurately than any of his other students br While attending the school he was one of several unpaid interns at Commodore Japan assisting the subsidiary s head engineer Yash Terakura with technical and software development tasks One of his main reasons for taking the job was to spend more time around computers and learn of details not openly available to the public Terakura would later serve as a mentor to Iwata teaching him about hardware engineering to supplement Iwata s already extensive software knowledge Iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games Classmates living in nearby apartments referred to Iwata s room as Game Center Iwata He would frequently show off his games to the Seibu department store s computer department and by a group of employees there invited him to join their company HAL Laboratory Inc br br br HAL Laboratory br While attending university Iwata worked for HAL Laboratory as a part time programmer in Among their first creations was a peripheral device that enabled older computers to display graphics for video games With this device Iwata and members of HAL created multiple games that were straight rip offs of Namco s Rally X Galaxian and others HAL became the first company to establish a license with Namco for developing games He joined the company in a full time capacity after graduating in becoming its fifth employee and only programmer Around the same time Iwata s father was elected mayor of Muroran Despite his passion Iwata s family did not approve of his career choice and his father did not talk with him for six months after Iwata joined HAL br Iwata became the company s coordinator of software production in the time during which he helped HAL create a relationship with Nintendo so they would be able to produce games for its newly released Nintendo Entertainment System He traveled to Kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for the NES to which Nintendo obliged His first commercially published game was Joust for the NES a port of the arcade game Other video games he worked on were Balloon Fight NES Open Tournament Golf EarthBound and the Kirby games Nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce Open Tournament Golf however all of them declined as they did not believe the large amount of data could be stored within an NES cartridge Iwata seized this opportunity and recklessly stepped up to develop the game It proved particularly taxing as Iwata had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all courses into the game Similarly HAL had to program parallax scrolling for F Race as the NES hardware did not initially support it br Iwata s proficiency with programming quickly placed him in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike He would often continue to work on weekends and holidays because of his passion With the company on the verge of bankruptcy Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in at the insistence of Nintendo s then President Hiroshi Yamauchi With assistance from Nintendo Iwata helped turn the company around from its billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years Lacking experience in management Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others br Although he was not part of Nintendo at the time Iwata assisted in the development of Pok mon Gold and Silver which were released for the Game Boy Color in November by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games While working as a go between for Game Freak and Nintendo he aided in the programming of Pok mon Stadium for the Nintendo by reading the original coding in Pok mon Red and Green and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week According to Tsunekazu Ishihara the president of The Pok mon Company Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pok mon to Western markets While being president of HAL he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red and Green which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa with Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release Additionally he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros for the Nintendo br br br Nintendo br br br Early years br In Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors Over the next two years he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality During his first two years at Nintendo the company saw profit increases of and percent values which are at least partially attributable to his work When Yamauchi the company s president since retired on May Iwata succeeded as Nintendo s fourth president with Yamauchi s blessing He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in Yamauchi left the company in Iwata s hands with a final request that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal And make software that adheres to that same standard Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed However this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments br At the time of Iwata s promotion Nintendo though still a profitable company was not performing as well as other console makers The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors with Sony s PlayStation and Microsoft s Xbox outselling it His presidency also came at the onset of the popularization of online gaming and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market He took a cautious approach to the issue stating We re not negative toward the idea of going online We re just practical He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube s appeal During an interview in Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of the line graphics br One of his first actions as president was to meet directly with the company s department heads and other employees This contrasted starkly with Yamauchi s practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single annual speech Shigeru Miyamoto described the previous business atmosphere as stuffy and stated Iwata improved the ventilation Iwata was acutely aware that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level If employees disagreed with his view Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own stating creators only improve themselves by taking risks Alongside the increased level of interaction Iwata also brought more data and science into the business aspect of the company Whereas Yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience Iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position Iwata also promoted Miyamoto Genyo Takeda Yoshihiro Mori and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company s board of directors equaling his own position br br br Revitalization of the company br br Following up on his interview Iwata highlighted an urgency in the gaming market in his keynote speech at the Tokyo Game Show During this speech he reflected on the history of the industry and concluded with the declining interest in video games A slump in sales in the Japanese market had begun at the end of the s and continued into the early s Competition between Nintendo and Sony resulted in increasingly hardware heavy consoles however the Nintendo proved to be too cumbersome for developers and software suffered severely After a year long analysis conducted at Iwata s behest Nintendo concluded that pushing hardware was not the most effective way to promote video games and decided to focus on software A major internal reorganization of Nintendo took place in with Iwata consolidating various departments established under Yamauchi He sought to promote collaborative work throughout the company He later established a User Expansion Project in whereby employees normally not associated with game development would submit ideas for new games br In a March interview Iwata stated Games have come to a dead end He stressed that developers wasted far too much time focusing on core gamers and would be unable to turn a profit if they did not tend to the average game player Furthermore he wished to prove that Nintendo considered a conservative company at the time would become a forefront innovator of entertainment Iwata articulated a blue ocean strategy to help Nintendo successfully compete against the other console manufacturers Instead of competing on technical specifications Iwata drew on his previous experience as a game developer to produce novel and entertaining hardware and games br br br Nintendo DS br Iwata helped lead a revitalization of Nintendo s handheld business by transitioning the company from the Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games The idea for using two screens on a single device originated with Yamauchi before his retirement while Miyamoto suggested the use of a touchscreen Miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of the device and its prototypes The Nintendo DS proved to be a highly profitable system and went on to become the second best selling video game console of all time with more than million units inclusive of subsequent iterations sold by September In June Iwata sought a conference with Dr Ryuta Kawashima about a game that could appeal to non gamers This project would later become Brain Age Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day released in May Iwata personally oversaw development of the Brain Age series even foregoing a public appearance on the day of the Nintendo DS s release in Japan on December Miyamoto supported Iwata s work with the series and sent one of his prot g s Kouichi Kawamoto to help develop the game The Brain Age series is partially credited with launching the popularity of the Nintendo DS and the series as a whole sold over million copies by December br Subsequent iterations of the Nintendo DS the DS Lite and DSi also saw positive sales The DS Lite improved upon the original DS featuring brighter screens and a slimmer design in accordance with consumer demand Released in March in Japan and three months later worldwide the DS Lite ultimately sold nearly million units Statistics showed that households often shared a single DS and Iwata sought to expand this from one per household to one per person The console s third iteration the DSi embodies this idea with the i representing a single person Despite concerns that the video game market was already over saturated by the DS and DS Lite Iwata was confident that the DSi would sell especially in European markets The DSi built upon the success of the DS Lite by similarly meeting consumer demand In addition to being slimmed further the DSi featured two cameras SD card support an audio reader and the Nintendo DSi Shop The relatively quick succession of the DS Lite and DSi broke the conventional pattern for release of game systems each being released roughly months apart instead of years Iwata saw the gradual price drop in the five year cycle as a way of indirectly telling consumers to wait to purchase products and a punishment for those who bought it at launch He sought to alleviate this issue with the quick releases br br br Wii br Video games are meant to be just one thing fun Fun for everyone br Discussions between Iwata Miyamoto and Takeda about a new home console began in the first half of With encouragement from Yamauchi Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project telling Takeda to go off the tech roadmap The overall premise was that a Mom has to like it During the console s development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together a feat they ultimately accomplished Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with the GameCube Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo s engineers Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda s team provided the internal components After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes Takeda procured a CMOS sensor that later became the core aspect of the remote With the addition of accelerometers they were able to effectively produce motion controls br Initially codenamed Revolution during a teaser at E following Iwata s goal of creating a gaming revolution Iwata publicly revealed the Wii at E holding it above his head to emphasize its small size and light weight design Reveal of the Wii s signature Wii Remote controller was withheld until the Tokyo Game Show in September During his speech at the conference Iwata reiterated his stance on growing the gaming market but expanded upon it by emphasizing the need to make controls less complicated The controller s remote control design partially stemmed from Iwata s desire to have a device that was immediately accessible to all He also insisted that the Wii Remote be referred to as simply a remote rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to anyone br The Wii ultimately popularized the use of motion control based video games and proved highly successful for Nintendo helping to nearly double the company s stock price Tapping into the market of casual players the Wii marked a breakthrough moment in the history of video games a new genre of gaming was established for the family market Iwata s former experience as a programmer a rarity for technology CEOs was said to help contribute towards his leadership of the company By the end of the fiscal year Nintendo saw record net sales and profit of trillion US billion and billion US billion respectively Due to his success Barron s included Iwata on their list of the top CEOs worldwide from to stating that for Nintendo Wii was a winner stock soars under him br br br Quality of life products br br Starting with the introduction of the Wii in Iwata placed focus on development of products that improved quality of life The Wii Fit series conceptualized by Miyamoto epitomized this movement At E Iwata revealed development of an add on product to the Wii the Wii Vitality Sensor The device measured autonomic nerve functions namely pulse and incorporate acquired data into relaxation products Iwata saw the device as a continuation of the blue ocean strategy previously articulated He indicated that the market of motion controls was turning into a red ocean whereby too many companies would saturate the market and restrict profits The Vitality Sensor was developed in hopes of providing a novel way to interact with video games and continue Nintendo s history of innovation However testing of a prototype device yielded less than desirable results and Nintendo had postponed the release of the product indefinitely by br In January Iwata unveiled a ten year strategy for the company based on quality of life products The target was a new market outside video games Developed under partnerships with Dr Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October Unlike the Vitality Sensor the sleep sensor was to be a stand alone product that would not need to be worn Following Iwata s death in July analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative Despite a planned United States release in March some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it The device was formally discontinued by February however Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue Nintendo based products like the Nintendo Switch designed to encourage use on the go and social interactions the mobile augmented reality game Pok mon Go that requires travelling outside the house and its addition Pok mon Sleep that works based on a player s sleep patterns all represent continuations of Iwata s quality of life initiative The Switch game Ring Fit Adventure which includes accessories that let players manipulate the game through physical exercise is seen as a successor to Wii Fit and continuing the quality of life program br br br Financial downturn br br Subsequent hardware units under Iwata s tenure including the Nintendo DS and Wii U were not as successful as the DS and Wii and Nintendo s finances took a downward turn starting in During the development phase of the DS a handheld device featuring stereoscopic D without the need of accessories Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo s engineers in line It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining However weak sales upon the release of the Nintendo DS caused the company s stock to fall by percent on July The console s poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US to US Sales of the DS continually fell below expectations Iwata later admitted in that he had misread the market and had not appropriately accounted for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii He continually placed focus on family oriented games despite declining popularity br The Wii U released in November was sold below its production cost as Nintendo hoped for stronger software sales to alleviate ongoing losses The addition of HD graphics a feature not present in the original Wii placed unexpected strain on development teams and led to software delays Compounding the frustration of consumers was Iwata s disinterest in competitors such as Microsoft and Sony both of which experienced similar issues during the releases of the Xbox and PlayStation respectively Paul Tassi of Forbes claimed that Nintendo could have handled the change more efficiently by drawing lessons from Microsoft and Sony s transition to HD graphics The console ultimately failed to meet sales expectations and became the slowest selling Nintendo platform with million units sold by June Miyamoto attributed the lackluster sales to public misunderstandings of the console s concept and functionality Iwata later admitted the console to be a failure as a successor to the Wii with games being unable to showcase notable originality in the Wii U The back to back failures of the DS and Wii U prompted Mitsushige Akino of Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co to suggest that Iwata should resign from his position br Nintendo s overall net sales declined from its peak of trillion US billion in to billion US billion in Net income losses were incurred in and In Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of million US which increased to million US million with performance based bonuses In comparison Miyamoto earned a salary of million US million Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in and as apologies for the poor sales while other members of the Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of percent This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo s employees preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short term finances In the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than years earlier Losses continued for the next two years before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the fiscal year The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pok mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U br In June Iwata took on the additional role of Nintendo of America s CEO As one of his first changes as CEO Iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at E and instead have several smaller events each aimed at a certain demographic While traveling to Tokyo in late Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo s games This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later Amiibo proved to be a huge success with more than million figurines sold by the end of roughly a month after launch By March combined sales of figures and cards a product released in exceeded million units proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms br br br Mobile market and Switch br br In early the success of Apple Inc s mobile App Store prompted concern among game developers that the medium was shifting to smart devices That July Iwata acknowledged competition from Apple and considered them the enemy of the future However during an interview the following year Iwata appeared entirely against the idea of Nintendo moving into the mobile market claiming the company would cease to be Nintendo if they did so He reasoned that mobile gaming would lack integrity over the quality of games in an effort to turn a profit A slow shift in this view ensued over the following years as the mobile gaming market continued to grow In he acknowledged that mobile devices provided significant competition but remained confident in his company s abilities In a message to shareholders in March fiscal year Iwata stated I believe that the era has ended when people play all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems He cited the convenience of mobile devices for quick entertainment and expansive capabilities over a handheld console s dedicated software Criticism arose over his continued stubbornness in moving to the mobile market with analysts and investors continually requesting a change in outlook Yoshihisa Toyosaki president of Architect Grand Design Inc claimed that Nintendo is out of touch referring to the company s history of ignoring outside input This ultimately negatively influenced Nintendo s finances and popularity to a degree br In March Iwata put part of Nintendo s focus on the growing mobile game market creating a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA to publish games as traditional hardware console sales began to falter This came in contrast to Nintendo s previous business model which put focus on console exclusives to prompt people to buy their platforms Iwata emphasized that although Nintendo IPs would be utilized in mobile games the company would not compromise their integrity He also stressed that the main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn the most money similar to the idea behind the Wii After the partnership with DeNA was established Iwata reiterated his stance that the common free to play type mobile games which he referred to as free to start threatened the future quality of games He also emphasized that the business model for these games did not match with the core values of Nintendo and could not serve as the basis of long lasting relationship with Nintendo s customers br Iwata oversaw development of the Nintendo Switch through the final months of his life serving as the console s head developer In a February interview with the magazine Time Miyamoto believed Iwata s goal for the system was to make it portable and allow communication between people Iwata focused on the technical aspects of the device during this stage br br br Public relations br br During the earlier years of his presidency at Nintendo Iwata would often forego media appearances unless new hardware was being announced in order to spend more time programming However his attitude towards this changed and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo s public relations Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media and he shared insights on Nintendo s employees games and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks Inspiration for this series which began in September stemmed from Iwata s background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo openness to discuss some of the inner workings of the company br In Iwata helped to institute Nintendo Direct a series of online press conferences open to all that revealed upcoming Nintendo games and products outside of typical industry channels These videos were often quirky and humorous reflecting the personality of Iwata himself This stood completely against the generally serious tones displayed by Sony and Microsoft One such video displayed a mock battle between him and Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils Aim to showcase the inclusion of Mii characters Nintendo digital avatars in Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U These frequently spurred the creation of Internet memes such memes include the phrase please understand which was often used by Iwata for delays or other negative news adding Iwata laughs to forum posts as a reference to his frequent laughter in segments of Iwata Asks and images of Iwata staring silently at a bunch of bananas as part of a pre recorded E video to promote the Donkey Kong franchise br As a byproduct of his presence in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct Iwata became the public face of Nintendo Iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them Even when time did not allow he would mingle with interviewers and chat casually br br br Other projects br Iwata assisted in the founding of Creatures Inc and The Pok mon Company which were established in and respectively by Tsunekazu Ishihara Iwata later coordinated licensing changes domestically and internationally with The Pok mon Company when it became its own entity In Iwata helped his colleague and personal friend Shigesato Itoi establish Hobonichi by working as the company s IT Manager He acquired this position after being asked by Itoi one month prior to the June launch date to arrange a website and the company s technical systems to which Iwata complied Iwata personally enjoyed the role and even still held the position in despite running Nintendo full time by this point Soon after his promotion to president of Nintendo Iwata assigned himself to a development team at HAL Laboratory working on Super Smash Bros Melee for the GameCube to continue his programming passion Stemming from his work with the Brain Age series Iwata assisted in producing educational games such as Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten DS English Training Have Fun Improving Your Skills and Imasara Hito ni Kikenai Otona no Joushikiryoku Training DS He also worked on Animal Crossing Mario Metroid Prime and The Legend of Zelda series of games among others He also had a cameo in WarioWare Smooth Moves Iwata partook in the development of Pok mon Go an augmented reality mobile game starting in The game was publicly revealed in September two months after his death br br br Illness and death br br On June Nintendo announced that Iwata would not attend E due to medical problems Iwata issued a public message to shareholders on June that he had undergone surgery the previous week to remove a tumor in his bile duct discovered during a routine physical examination After roughly four months of recovery from a successful surgery he returned to work in October During this time he lost a notable amount of weight but stated he was feeling healthier as a result Iwata made his first public appearance on a Nintendo Direct announcement on November but looked gaunt and pale He appeared to take this in stride and updated his own Mii avatars used in Nintendo hardware in June to reflect his slimmer self On January Iwata came down with a high fever and was suspected to have influenza a meeting with shareholders was postponed accordingly Some time after attending a different shareholder meeting on June Iwata became ill again and was hospitalized Despite his hospitalization Iwata continued to work via his laptop in his bed and provided feedback on Pok mon Go to Tsunekazu Ishihara He died due to complications from the tumor on July at the age of at Kyoto University Hospital He was survived by his wife Kayoko Nintendo announced his death the following day br Flags at Nintendo s headquarters were lowered to half staff on July Nintendo s regional offices took a day of silence on July across all of its social media accounts in remembrance of Iwata Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their sadness on social media over Iwata s death and gratitude for his accomplishments Fans established memorials across the world including at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow Russia and the Nintendo World Store in Manhattan New York Shuhei Yoshida president of SCE Worldwide Studios stated I pray that Mr Iwata who contributed so much to the development of the gaming industry rests in peace Composer and director Junichi Masuda most known for his work with the Pok mon games tweeted He was a man who understood Pok mon and a great leader When I visited the other day he was well I will pray for his soul from the bottom of my heart The Tokyo Institute of Technology issued a memorial statement on August with Iwata s former classmates and professors contributing their memories At The Game Awards Reggie Fils Aim delivered a tribute to Iwata describing him as fearless and unique in the fullest meaning of the word br Several hours after the announcement of Iwata s death a photograph of a rainbow over Nintendo s headquarters in Kyoto was posted to Twitter and widely shared it was dubbed the Rainbow Road to heaven in reference to a stage in the Mario Kart series Buddhist funeral services for Iwata were held in Kyoto on July and Despite stormy weather produced by Typhoon Nangka an estimated people attended to pay their respects Among the attendees were Reggie Fils Aim Shigeru Miyamoto Genyo Takeda and Iwata s close friend Masahiro Sakurai Following the wake Iwata s remains were cremated and his ashes were buried at an undisclosed place in Kyoto br Following Iwata s death general directors Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda temporarily managed the company together On September Nintendo announced that Tatsumi Kimishima head of its Human Resources Division and former CEO of Nintendo of America would succeed Iwata as the fifth president of Nintendo br br br Influence and legacy br On my business card I am a corporate president In my mind I am a game developer But in my heart I am a gamer br Throughout his life Iwata was known for unconventional ideas and changing the medium of gaming He was seen as the embodiment of Nintendo playful quirky humorous and fun Iwata s proficiency in programming led many to refer to him as a genius in the subject with some likening him to a Japanese Bill Gates His hands on approach to business earned him admiration and respect from both developers and gamers The opening to Iwata s Heart of a Gamer speech at GDC is regarded as the essence of who he was a humble businessman dedicated to video games He alongside others at Nintendo such as Miyamoto are credited with vastly expanding the gaming market and creating a new genre By targeting a new audience instead of competing against Microsoft and Sony Iwata avoided a straight fight with Nintendo s competitors and successfully achieved his goals Accordingly Iwata was referred to as a gentle revolutionary The simplistic appeal of the Nintendo DS and Wii served to expand the market Chris Kohler of Wired magazine stated that thanks to Nintendo s Satoru Iwata we re all gamers now referring to the surge in video game popularity following the releases of the Nintendo DS and Wii Although widely respected he received criticism over his stubbornness in moving Nintendo to the mobile market Following Iwata s

the Wild a game in development at the time of his death A non playable character who bears a striking resemblance to Satoru Iwata asks for the player to go atop Satori Mountain in search of the mystical Lord of the Mountain Given the similarity between Satori and Satoru and the fact that the Lord of the Mountain is seen as a guiding spirit the quest is thought to be an elaborate tribute to Iwata Both the non playable character and the Lord of the Mountain return in The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom br In September modders discovered that an emulated version of the NES game Golf which Iwata programmed is included in the Nintendo Switch firmware accessed by moving the Joy Con controllers similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in Nintendo Direct presentations when the
