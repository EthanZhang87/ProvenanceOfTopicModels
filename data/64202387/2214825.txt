Mario Artist is an interoperable suite of three games and one Internet application for Nintendo Paint Studio Talent Studio Polygon Studio and Communication Kit These flagship disks for the DD peripheral were developed to turn the game console into an Internet multimedia workstation A bundle of the DD unit software disks hardware accessories and the Randnet online service subscription package was released in Japan starting in December br Development was managed by Nintendo EAD and Nintendo of America in conjunction with two other independent development companies Polygon Studio was developed by the professional D graphics software developer Nichimen Graphics and Paint Studio was developed by Software Creations of the UK br Titled Mario Paint in development Paint Studio was conceived as the sequel to Mario Paint for the Super NES IGN called Talent Studio the DD s killer app br br br Suite br br br Paint Studio br br Mario Artist Paint Studio released on December is a Mario themed paint program The user has a variety of brush sizes textures and stamps with which to paint draw spray sketch and animate The stock Nintendo themed graphics include all Red and Blue era Pok mon Banjo Kazooie and Diddy Kong Racing characters Previously titled Mario Paint in development Paint Studio has been described as the direct follow up and spiritual successor to the SNES s Mario Paint and as akin to an Adobe Photoshop for kids br On June Nintendo of America commissioned the independent UK game studio Software Creations soliciting a single design concept for a sequel to Mario Paint in D for the N John Pickford initially pitched a D living playground where the user edits the attributes of premade models such as dinosaurs playing with their sizes behaviors aggression speed and texture design The project s working title was Creator then Mario Paint then Picture Maker as demonstrated at Nintendo s Space World trade show in November and then Mario Artist Camera Software Creations reflected on political infighting between Nintendo s two sites eventually the Japanese took control and rejected many of the ideas which had been accepted enthusiastically by the Americans steering the project in a different direction after John left Software Creations to form Zed Two and throwing away loads of work br The audio functionality was split out into Sound Studio also known as Sound Maker at Nintendo Space World where it was mentioned but not shown By development reportedly included music producer Tetsuya Komuro It was canceled br Published as a bundle with the Nintendo Mouse it is one of the two DD launch games on December along with Doshin the Giant Using the Nintendo Capture Cassette cartridge released later in a bundle with Talent Studio the user can import images and movies from any NTSC video source such as video tape or a video camera The Japanese version of the Game Boy Camera can import grayscale photographs via the Transfer Pak The studio features a unique four player drawing mode Minigames include a fly swatting game reminiscent of that in Mario Paint and a game reminiscent of Pok mon Snap where a player can also take photos and change creatures textures br br br Talent Studio br Mario Artist Talent Studio released on February is bundled with the Nintendo Capture Cartridge Its working title was Talent Maker as demonstrated at Nintendo s Space World trade show in November It was described by designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a newly reborn Mario Paint upon a brief demonstration at the Game Developers Conference in March as his example of a fresh game concept br The game presents the player s character design as being a self made television stage talent or celebrity It is a simple animation production studio which lets the user insert captured images such as human faces onto D models which had been made with Polygon Studio dress up the models from an assortment of hundreds of clothes and accessories and then animate the models with sound music and special effects The player can connect an analog video source such as a VCR or camcorder to the Capture Cartridge and record movies on the Nintendo A photograph of a person s face from a video source via the Capture Cassette or from the Game Boy Camera via the Transfer Pak may be mapped onto the characters created in Polygon Studio and placed into movies created with Talent Studio br IGN describes Talent Studio as the DD s killer app with a graphical interface that s so easy to use that anyone can figure it out after a few minutes letting the user create fashion shows karate demonstrations characters waiting outside a bathroom stall and more which feature the user s own face Paintings can be imported into the completely separate DD game SimCity Nintendo designer Yamashita Takayuki attributes his work on Talent Studio as having been foundational to his eventual work on the Mii br According to Shigeru Miyamoto Talent Studio s direct descendant is a GameCube prototype called Stage Debut using the Game Boy Advance s GameEye camera peripheral and linking to the GameCube via a cable to map self portraits of players onto their character models It was publicly demonstrated with models of Miyamoto and eventual Nintendo president Satoru Iwata Never having been released its character design features became the Mii the Mii Channel and features of games such as Wii Tennis br br In my mind it s still alive There s a portion of the Stage Debut game which essentially became the Miis and the Mii Channel So if we were to ask the question of what would we do if we were to make the Miis more realistic and lifelike then that might turn into something more like Stage Debut So of course we still have the staff who worked on that and it s something that is done but in my mind it s something that s always alive br br br Communication Kit br Mario Artist Communication Kit released on June is a utility application which allowed users to connect to the Net Studio of the now defunct Randnet dialup service and online community for DD users In Net Studio it was possible to share creations made with Paint Studio Talent Studio or Polygon Studio with other Randnet members Other features included contests and printing services available by online mail order for making custom D papercraft and postcards The Randnet network service was launched and discontinued alongside the DD running from December to February br The disk has content that may be unlocked and used in other games in the series such as Paint Studio br br br Polygon Studio br Mario Artist Polygon Studio released on August is a D computer graphics editor that lets the user design and render D polygon images with a simple level of detail It has been described as a consumer version of the professional D graphics suite N World also by Nichimen Graphics It was originally announced as Polygon Maker at Nintendo s Space World trade show demonstrated at Space World in November and renamed to Polygon Studio at Space World It was scheduled as the final game in the original Starter Kit s mail order delivery of DD games but it did not arrive on time leading IGN to assume it was canceled until it was later released The Expansion Pak and the Nintendo Mouse are supported peripherals br The idea of minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo s fifth generation of video game consoles and some early minigames appear in Polygon Studio in the style that were later used in the WarioWare series Certain minigames originated in Polygon Studio as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R D s so called WarioWare All Star Team In Polygon Studio you could create D models and animate them in the game but there was also a side game included inside In this game you would have to play short games that came one after another This is where the idea for WarioWare came from br The art form of papercraft was implemented by modeling the characters in Polygon Studio and then using Communication Kit to upload the data to Randnet s online printing service The user finally cuts folds and pastes the resulting colored paper into a D physical figure br br br Unreleased br An additional Mario Artist game Mario Artist Sound Maker would have allowed users to create their own music tracks but was ultimately cancelled Three additional Maker titles unrelated to the Mario Artist suite were also announced consisting of Game Maker Graphical Message Maker and Video Jockey Maker though none of them ever saw release br br br Reception br br Nintendo World Report described the Mario Artist series as a spiritual successor to Mario Paint IGN collectively described the Mario Artist suite as a layperson s analog to professional quality graphics development software They stated that the combination of the DD s mass writability and the Nintendo s D graphics allowed Nintendo to leave CD systems behind by offering something that couldn t be done on any other gaming console on the market to people who want to unleash their creative talents and perhaps learn a little bit about graphics design on the side The designer of Paint Studio Software Creations roughly estimated that copies of that game may have been sold br IGN rated Paint Studio at Good out of Peer Schneider described it as a powerful affordable and easy to use D and D content creation tool unmatched by other video game consoles although minimally comparable to personal computer applications He likened it to an edutainment version of Adobe Photoshop for children and a good neophyte introduction to the Internet He considered Paint Studio to embody Nintendo s originally highly ambitious plans for DD and to thus suffer greatly due to the cancellation of most Paint Studio integrated disk games and the application s incompatibility with cartridge based games br Rating it at Great out of IGN called Talent Studio the DD s killer app with a graphical interface that is so easy to use that anyone can figure it out after a few minutes and featuring breathtaking motion captured animation br br br Legacy br Polygon Studio contains the minigame Sound Bomber which consists of several microgames This concept envisioned by programmer Kouichi Kawamoto inspired the creation of the WarioWare series br Talent Studio gave rise to an unreleased GameCube prototype called Stage Debut which in turn yielded character design features which became the Mii the Mii Channel and features of other games such as Wii Tennis br br br See also br Mario Paint br Super Mario Maker br Super Mario Maker br Famicom
