Production br br br Development br After the critical and commercial failure of the Super Mario Bros film adaptation the Japanese video game company Nintendo became wary of licensing its properties for film adaptations According to Shigeru Miyamoto the creator of Mario the idea for a new Mario film came from bringing their older games to the Virtual Console and other services Such transitions took time for the company and Miyamoto recognized that our content business would be able to develop even further if we were able to combine our long beloved software with that of video assets and utilize them together for extended periods Miyamoto knew that the process of making a film was far different from that of making a video game and wanted a film expert to lead the effort br Following the November hack of Sony Pictures emails between producer Avi Arad studio chief Amy Pascal TriStar Pictures head Tom Rothman and Sony Pictures Animation president of production Michelle Raimo Kouyate were released revealing that Sony had been attempting to secure the film rights to the Mario franchise for several years Arad visited Nintendo in Tokyo in February and July in an attempt to secure a deal In October Arad emailed Pascal and said he had closed the deal with Nintendo Pascal suggested recruiting Sony Pictures Animation s Hotel Transylvania director Genndy Tartakovsky to help develop the project while Kouyate said she could think of movies right out of the gate and hoped to build a Mario empire However after the emails leaked Arad denied that a deal had been made stating that negotiations had only begun BuzzFeed News noted that the emails did not take into account potential conflicts with Sony Pictures corporate sibling Sony Interactive Entertainment one of Nintendo s chief competitors br Through Nintendo s work with Universal Parks Resorts to create Mario based attractions later resulting in Super Nintendo World Miyamoto met Chris Meledandri founder of Universal Pictures Illumination animation division Miyamoto found Meledandri s creative process similar to his own and felt he would be the proper lead for a Mario film They had started more earnest discussions by knowing that if they felt it would not work that they could easily walk away In November reports emerged that Nintendo was collaborating with Universal and Illumination to make an animated Mario film Then Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima clarified that a deal had not been finalized but that an announcement would come soon Kimishima hoped that if the deal were successful a release date would be possible br In January Nintendo announced that the film would progress with Miyamoto and Meledandri co producing Meledandri said the film was a priority for Illumination and that it would most likely come out in He added that Miyamoto would be front and center during production In January Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that the film was moving along smoothly with an expected release date Furukawa also said Nintendo would own the rights to the film and both Nintendo and Universal would fund the production br br In August it emerged that Teen Titans Go creators Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic were directing the film after the discovery of an Illumination animator s LinkedIn profile that included the film in their list Following the full casting announcement Horvath and Jelenic were confirmed to be directing with Matthew Fogel attached as the screenwriter after previously scribing Illumination s Minions The Rise of Gru According to Khary Payton who has collaborated with Horvath and Jelenic on various projects at Warner Bros Animation the duo flew to Illumination Studios Paris a month after the release of their first feature film Teen Titans Go To the Movies in September br In September it was announced by New York Comic Con that the film s teaser trailer would be released on October the teaser formally revealed the film s title The Super Mario Bros Movie Shortly thereafter Ed Skudder who previously worked with Horvath on Unikitty confirmed that he worked as head of story on the film br br br Writing br Jelenic and Horvath wanted their work on the film to be the opposite of the irreverent Teen Titans Go aiming to develop a faithful adaptation of the games which they both felt had not been done before as well as something more cinematic and more emotional than Teen Titans Go When people probably first heard our names attached to the movie they expected we d do the Teen Titans Go treatment to Mario said Jelenic But every project we come to we make new choices depending on who the audience is and what we re going for Horvath asserted that Nintendo involved themselves with every aspect of the production from story to visual development to the animation br The duo wanted the film to serve as an origin story for Mario and Luigi opting to portray them as blue collar guys by focusing on their previous backgrounds as Italian American plumbers from New York City in early games specifically Brooklyn as in older American media They also wanted to reflect how gamers win in the games by not giving up in spite of making mistakes turning that into a character trait for the film s portrayal of Mario The duo chose to interchange Princess Peach s and Luigi s roles from the games with Peach helping Mario rescue a kidnapped Luigi because they felt having them in their original roles was too straightforward The duo drew inspiration from Super Mario D World and its portrayal of Peach as a playable character stating they wanted to focus on her role as the Mushroom Kingdom s monarch and how strong that person would need to be to protect the Toads For Bowser they decided to make that character scary but the other side of Bowser is somebody who s vulnerable and funny br br br Casting br br In February Mario voice actor Charles Martinet said the possibility of reprising his role in the film would be a marvelous thing and that if he were asked to voice Mario he would go in and play with great joy and happiness In August Sebastian Maniscalco revealed he was voicing Spike Mario and Luigi s boss from the game Wrecking Crew br During a September Nintendo Direct presentation Shigeru Miyamoto announced that Chris Pratt Anya Taylor Joy Charlie Day Jack Black Keegan Michael Key Seth Rogen Kevin Michael Richardson Fred Armisen and Maniscalco would headline the voice cast and that Martinet would be featured in surprise cameos The announcement was met with a mixed reaction from fans while some welcomed the idea of celebrity actors voicing the characters others questioned and criticized the choices in particular Pratt as Mario instead of Martinet who had voiced the character since or an Italian actor Martinet voices the brothers father as well as a citizen of Brooklyn named Giuseppe the latter using Mario s game voice Additionally voice acting veterans Rino Romano John DiMaggio and Jessica DiCicco voiced Mario and Luigi s uncles Tony and Arthur and mother respectively as the intention was to cast actors of Italian ancestry for the brothers family br Meledandri said Pratt would not be voicing Mario in a thick Italian accent as Martinet had traditionally done Voice actor Khary Payton described Pratt s original voice during production as a New York Italian guy and a cousin to the Sopranos but the accent was scrapped for sounding too similar to the character Tony Soprano Voice actress Tara Strong criticized Pratt s casting and expressed a preference for Martinet to voice Mario instead lamenting what she described to be Hollywood s disregard for professional voice actors In response to criticism of Pratt s casting Horvath stated For us it made total sense He s really good at playing a blue collar hero with a ton of heart For the way that Mario is characterized in our film he s perfect for it For his part Pratt acknowledged the character s passionate fanbase and that Mario s traditional voice was the soundtrack to fans youth You don t want someone to come along and cynically kind of destroy it as a cash grab with a movie I fully understand that You do not want that to happen Regarding his own vocal performance he encouraged audiences to come watch the movie Go watch the movie and then we can talk br Charlie Day originally voiced Luigi with a New York accent similar to the film Goodfellas during production The accent was scrapped when directors told him it sounded too similar to the gangster film to which Day responded to the change with Alright I think you re wrong but fine Plot details were kept secret from the actors during recording according to Day who noted he had to record his dialogue in many different ways after which the directors selected the version they believed would be best suited for the film br Upon the trailer s release both Payton and Eric Bauza confirmed their parts in the film Payton voices the Penguin King and Bauza voices the Toad General During the COVID pandemic Payton recorded his lines in a closet at his home though he was unsure if he would appear in the final cut br In response to backlash for voicing Donkey Kong in his normal speaking voice Rogen explained I was very clear that I don t do voices and If you want me to be in this movie then it s going to sound like me and that s it That was the beginning and end of that conversation He added further I think in the film and in the game all you seem to know about Donkey Kong is that he throws barrels and does not like Mario very much And that s what I ran with br br br Animation and design br The film was animated by Illumination Studios Paris in Paris France Production was underway by September with animation ending in October Post production work wrapped by March Jelenic said that Illumination updated their lighting and rendering technology for the film with Meledandri claiming that it pushed the technical and artistic capabilities of the studio to new heights br Jelenic and Horvath wanted the animation to juggle stylized animation with realism with Horvath claiming that there are moments of cartoony fun but we wanted it to feel like a big adventure film and that there are stakes and maybe you believe that these characters can die so they re not super squashy and super stretchy and we used consistent volume on the characters to make them feel a little more grounded For the go karts featured in the film the directors worked with a vehicle design artist and artists at Nintendo to create go karts that fit their portrayal in the film while drawing inspiration from their portrayal in the Mario Kart games br In an interview with GameSpot Horvath said that he and Jelenic took a blockbuster approach when making The Super Mario Bros Movie To me this is a movie that s been like years in the making you know and I ve always considered Mario more of an action game The characters look comedic but the story is always high stakes you gotta save the princess or save the world or whatever in the game So we wanted to reflect that action sensibility The two brought in artists they knew from television and worked closely with them to craft the film s action sequences Skudder in particular was crucial in making the action especially the Rainbow Road sequence According to Jelenic and Horvath Skudder spent months working on the sequence which they also described as the film s most technically challenging The road itself was a visual effect and every shot of it had to go through the visual effects department which was time consuming and expensive br Donkey Kong s design was changed for the first time since the video game Donkey Kong Country For his new design artists incorporated elements of both his modern design and his original design from his debut appearance in Donkey Kong For Mario s family Horvath and Jelenic were given early designs of Mario by Nintendo as references they ended up using slightly altered versions of those designs in the film br br br Music br br During an October Nintendo Direct presentation Meledandri confirmed that Brian Tyler was set to compose the film s score Tyler worked closely with longtime Mario composer Koji Kondo to incorporate themes from the games He described the composition as big featuring an orchestra choir and bands as well as Italian instruments accordions live drums mandolins whistling human voices and eight bit sounds Recording sessions began on October at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros Mixing took place at Skywalker Sound where Kondo and Miyamoto responded positively to a minute suite of new themes Tyler had written The film s music references leitmotifs from Super Mario Bros Super Mario and Super Mario D Land among other Mario games br Songs from Jack Black and Keegan Michael Key were improvised for the film Black Hydra composed the music for its official trailer Super Mushroom based on the Super Mario Bros theme The instrumental was released on November on YouTube br In a March video Seth Rogen shared that Donkey Kong was introduced in the film accompanied by the title theme music from Donkey Kong DK Rap composed by Grant Kirkhope In contrast to the licensed songs used in the film Kirkhope did not receive credit for DK Rap in the film s end credits an oversight the composer found disappointing br Jack Black co wrote the song Peaches wherein Bowser professes his love for Princess Peach alongside the directors editor Eric Osmond and song producer John Spiker Having Bowser perform a love song was Black s idea Peaches was released on April with a music video directed by Cole Bennett According to Black it was filmed in a few hours On its release Peaches was on the iTunes streaming chart It later appeared on the Billboard Hot debuting at and peaking at br br br Marketing br br On October the teaser trailer was released live in a Nintendo Direct presentation In a short questions and answers period following the trailer reveal at New York Comic Con Jack Black stated that Bowser has a musical side in the film teasing a theme for the character The teaser trailer received over three million views in hours Journalists generally praised the trailer s visuals and tone as well as Black and Key s performances as Bowser and Toad However Pratt s performance as Mario was described as lacking in emotion and sounding too similar to his normal speaking voice Vic Hood from TechRadar noted a slight New York accent in Mario s lines calling it a possible throwback to Mario s depictions in American media such as The Super Mario Bros Super Show and the film before Charles Martinet debuted as the character s official voice actor in Mario s Game Gallery where he spoke full dialogue for extended periods of time In a newsletter from The Guardian the response to Pratt s voice was likened to the backlash against the first trailer of Sonic the Hedgehog br On November the first official trailer was shown in a Nintendo Direct Public reactions were still largely favorable though online discourse continued to center on Pratt s performance as Mario br On December the first clip of the film showing Toad guiding Mario through the Mushroom Kingdom and to the entrance to Peach s Castle was revealed at The Game Awards The Verge s Ash Parrish commented Despite the skepticism surrounding Chris Pratt s performance as Mario the movie s visuals and I cannot stress enough only the visuals look incredible br On January a preview clip of the film was released during the NFC Championship Game Some entertainment news sites pointed out the addition of Rogen s iconic laugh heard as Donkey Kong in the clip Emma Roth from The Verge commented I m pleasantly surprised at how well his voice and laugh suits the character while Luke Plunkett from Kotaku commented Seth Rogen has been hired to just be Seth Rogen br On February a commercial for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII featuring a rendition of the title theme from The Super Mario Bros Super Show A corresponding website which was featured in the trailer was also released which advertises the Super Mario Bros Plumbing Service from the film as if it were according to Plunkett a struggling small business servicing the Brooklyn and Queens areas br br br Release br br br Theatrical br The Super Mario Bros Movie held its world premiere at Regal LA Live in Los Angeles California on April with the cast and crew in attendance It was released theatrically in the United States on April and later in Japan on April in

Bros Movie received mixed reviews from critics On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads While it s nowhere near as thrilling as turtle tipping your way to lives The Super Mario Bros Movie is a colorful albeit thinly plotted animated adventure that has about as many Nintendos as Nintendon ts Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale while of those polled by PostTrak gave it a positive score with saying that they would recommend it Miyamoto felt that the critics who gave the film low ratings contributed to the film s success and creating the buzz around it br Ross Bonaime of Collider gave a positive review writing Obviously The Super Mario Bros Movie is in many ways a feature length advertisement for Nintendo as a brand However Jelenic Horvath and F ogel make this feel more like a labor of love as they ve been given the keys to the Mushroom kingdom and are allowed to go all in with what any fan would want to see in a film like this In many ways The Super Mario Bros Movie reminds of Wreck It Ralph and the glee that came from seeing these characters on screen Writing for the Datebook section of The San Francisco Chronicle Zaki Hasan said he enjoyed the visuals but felt the film s strong adherence to and copious references to the games left it lacking in narrative and that it tried too hard to avoid the failures of the film calling it a blandly efficient piece of brand management br IGN s Tom Jorgensen gave a generally positive review He praised the film s energy its musical score despite the inclusion of shoehorned pop songs and its visuals for setting a very high bar He also commended the use of callbacks but criticized some character arcs for being underdeveloped Jorgensen had slight criticism towards Pratt and Day s attempt at New York accents for Mario and Luigi as certainly not going to be taking home any commendations from the good people of Brooklyn and stated There s definitely been a flattening of the more cartoonish qualities However he applauded the actors for embodying each character s heroism and for a grounded delivery that balances well with the fantastical trappings of the Mushroom Kingdom Jorgensen commended Black s performance as Bowser for being standout and fitting to the character br Kyle Anderson of Nerdist celebrated the animation for its game accuracy and called Illumination the perfect choice to make Mario movies but opined that those expecting something akin to The Lego Movie might be left a bit cold due to lack of a plot outside the main beats given the film s short run time Soren Andersen of The Seattle Times commented that while the film succeeded in appealing to the Mario fanbase by creating the feeling of being inside a video game he found the characters to be lacking in personality and criticized their voice performances remarking everyone expresses themselves at the tops of their voices sound and fury signifying not a whole lot Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert a self described lifelong fan wrote that the vocal performances were uniformly mediocre and that the film is Illumination s most soulless to date and doesn t reflect the franchise s creativity in the slightest The Los Angeles Times Katie Walsh applauded the film for its humor and eye popping animation She praised Black s performance as Bowser but criticized both Pratt and Day s lead performances of Mario and Luigi as so unremarkable that it could have been anyone at all br Calum Marsh writing for The New York Times criticized Pratt s performance as grating and unctuous while describing the overall film as bland witless and flagrantly pandering Kristy Puchko from Mashable commended the fan service and music but was critical of the writing the characters and Pratt s lack of accent commenting whatever voice Pratt is doing isn t Brooklyn and it isn t anything particularly specific consistent or exciting Screen Rant s Molly Freeman praised the film for being a love letter to fans but criticized it for offering little else She described most of the voice cast as fun with Black s Bowser being a standout while noting that Pratt s performance was not so bad as to be distracting but not strong enough to be at all interesting either which she said was an analogy for the film as a whole Josh Spiegel from SlashFilm considered the film s portrayal of Princess Peach not in need of rescuing as unquestionably a good thing but also the most subversive decision of a film from years ago not from He further criticized the film for an exceedingly straightforward narrative characters lacking complexity and Pratt s performance as Mario as being blandly heroic concluding that This movie exists and that s about as high as it aspires br br br Accolades br br br Future br br br Sequel br In May Furukawa said that Nintendo was interested in producing more animated films based on its intellectual properties if the Mario Bros film was successful In a Variety cover story before the film s release producer Meledandri was asked about potential sequels or projects adapted from other Nintendo properties and answered Our focus right now is entirely on bringing the film out to the audience and at this time we re not prepared to talk about what s coming in the future br On April following the film s box office success Nintendo stated that there would be more films based on their properties though they did not directly confirm a sequel to The Super Mario Bros Movie In June Pratt stated that while news on a sequel would come soon development on the project had been put on hold due to the Writers Guild of America strike saying that it would only resume once the writers felt comfortable moving forward In November it was revealed that Universal was making plans to build a larger franchise around the film while also confirming a sequel br On March as part of Mario Day celebrations Miyamoto and Meledandri officially announced a new Super Mario Bros movie along with a release date of April in the United States and more dates between April for other territories Horvath Jelenic and Fogel will return as co directors and screenwriter respectively Meledandri stated that Illumination s team was in the process of storyboarding and developing set designs for new environments br br br Possible spin offs br In February Day expressed interest in reprising his role as Luigi in a Luigi s Mansion film and reiterated his interest in March In April Rogen expressed interest in Donkey Kong Country forming the basis of future
