Super Luigi U br br Also featured in the Nintendo Direct was New Super Luigi U downloadable content DLC for the Wii U game New Super Mario Bros U It originally served as an expansion pack that would be downloadable from the eShop at an unspecified date and would include an additional levels on top of the base game The levels were designed to be much more difficult so the time to complete them was made shorter so less experienced players would be encouraged to continue according to producer Takashi Tezuka At E Nintendo announced that Mario would be completely omitted from New Super Luigi U and would be replaced by Nabbit a now playable non player character who originally appeared in New Super Mario Bros U In addition Nintendo also announced that the expansion pass would be released as a

mixed opinions on Luigi s handling as well as its difficulty and the time allotted to complete levels br br br Mario Luigi Dream Team br br In the same Nintendo Direct Nintendo announced the fourth installment in the Mario Luigi series Mario Luigi Dream Team scheduled for a summer release During the Direct Iwata specified that the majority of the game would take place within Luigi s dream where he might not be as traditionally cowardly to better centralize Luigi s role The game released July in Europe the day after in Japan and August in North America Alongside the release a demo was made available on the Nintendo eShop Due to the last entry in the series Bowser s Inside Story focusing primarily on Bowser instead of Mario and Luigi series developer AlphaDream conceived ideas for another game focusing solely on Luigi After conceptualizing the idea of having a lot of Luigis on the screen that you could control and who would run around they set Dream Team s setting within a dream to justify its inclusion According to game director Akira Otani AlphaDream used Luigi as the butt of gag jokes too often and wanted to equalize Luigi with Mario In another Iwata Asks interview about Dream Team s development Otani was surprised to see the Year of Luigi s announcement and was shocked Luigi was as old as he was meaning AlphaDream s emphasis on Luigi was pure coincidence br br

investigate When Luigi gets distracted and sleeps on a bed in the castle s artifact room a Dream Portal opens up and its hostile inhabitants kidnap Peach and wreak havoc on Pi illo island Mario sets out to retrieve the Dream Stone artifact to contain the inhabitants which involves frequent use of Luigi s dreams to his advantage Gameplay centralizes around Pi illo island in an overworld fashion with Luigi s dreams the Dream World involving platforming elements When Mario is in the Dream World a sleeping Luigi can be physically interacted with to alter what happens in the Dream World for example making Luigi sneeze will create a gust of wind in the Dream World Reception for Dream Team was positive being praised for its writing characters and turn based combat and criticized for its plot length and use of backtracking The game was also revered for its Dream World elements especially the dynamic between the real world Luigi and his more superior Dream World counterpart br br br Dr Luigi br br The last full game is Dr Luigi which was announced via Nintendo Direct December and released December in North America and January internationally the following year The sixth entry in the Dr Mario series Dr Luigi has four different modes Operation L which uses L shaped pills instead of traditional Dr Mario pills Virus Buster which uses the Wii U GamePad and stylus instead of standard button controls multiplayer which includes both local and online gameplay and Retro Remedy which doesn t use any gimmicks and is rather unaltered Dr Mario gameplay Luigi replaces Mario and stands on a pedestal that has a Year of Luigi theming Critical reception was positive being praised for the inventiveness of the Operation L gamemode and multiplayer features and criticized for its lack of new content in comparison to the Dr Mario predecessors and some critics reevaluated the series as a whole to be non inventive and too simple to hold interest br br br Other br br br Super Mario D World br
