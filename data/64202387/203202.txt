Betty Boop is an animated cartoon character designed by Grim Natwick at the request of Dave Fleischer She originally appeared in the Talkartoon and Betty Boop film series which were produced by Fleischer Studios and released by Paramount Pictures She was featured in theatrical cartoons between and She has also been featured in comic strips and mass merchandising br A caricature of a Jazz Age flapper Betty Boop was described in a court case as combin ing in appearance the childish with the sophisticated a large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button framed in a somewhat careful coiffure with a very small body of which perhaps the leading characteristic is the most self confident little bust imaginable Although she was toned down in the mid s as a result of the Hays Code to appear more demure she became one of the world s best known and most popular cartoon characters br br br History br br br Origins br Betty Boop made her first appearance in the cartoon Dizzy Dishes released on August the seventh installment in Fleischer s Talkartoon series Inspired by a popular performing style but not by any one specific person the character was originally created as an anthropomorphic French poodle Clara Bow is sometimes given credit as being the inspiration for Boop though Fleischer told his artists that he wanted a caricature of singer Helen Kane who performed in a style shared by many performers of the day Kane was also the one who sued Fleischer over the signature Boop Oop a Doop line Betty Boop appeared as a supporting character in ten cartoons as a flapper girl with more heart than brains In individual cartoons she was called Nancy Lee or Nan McGrew derived from the Helen Kane film Dangerous Nan McGrew usually serving as a girlfriend to studio star Bimbo br Within a year Betty made the transition from an incidental human canine breed to a completely human female character While much credit has been given to Grim Natwick for helping to transform Max Fleischer s creation her transition into the cute cartoon girl was also in part due to the work of Bernard Wolf Otto Feuer Seymour Kneitel Roland Doc Crandall Willard Bowsky and James Shamus Culhane By the release of Any Rags Betty Boop was forever established as a human character Her floppy poodle ears became hoop earrings and her black poodle nose became a girl s button like nose br br Betty was first voiced by Margie Hines Later several different voice actresses performed the role including Kate Wright Bonnie Poe Ann Rothschild also known as Little Ann Little and especially Mae Questel who began voicing Betty Boop in Bimbo s Silly Scandals and continued with the role until returning nearly years later in Disney s Who Framed Roger Rabbit Today Betty is voiced by Cindy Robinson since br Although Betty s first name was assumed to have been established in the Screen Songs cartoon Betty Co ed this Betty is a different character which the official Betty Boop website describes as a prototype of Betty Boop At least Screen Songs cartoons featured Betty Boop or a similar character br Betty Boop was the star of the Talkartoons by and was given her own series that same year beginning with Stopping the Show From that point on she was crowned The Queen of the Animated Screen The series was popular throughout the s br Since the character was created by an Austrian Jew and eventually voiced by a Jewish actress Mae Questel animation fans sometimes try to pinpoint various aspects that hint at Betty s Jewishness The Talkartoon Minnie the Moocher featured the only appearance of Betty s parents a strict immigrant couple who get upset that Betty does not want to eat the traditional German foods hasenpfeffer rabbit stew and sauerbraten Benjamin Ivry of Forward says that any of this evidence is ambiguous as these are not kosher foods and the accents of the parents are comical German accents rather than Jewish br Betty appeared in the first Color Classic cartoon Poor Cinderella her only theatrical color appearance in In the film she was depicted with red hair as opposed to her typical black hair br br br Contemporary resurgence br The Betty Boop films were revived after Paramount sold them for syndication in UM M and National Telefilm Associates were required to remove the original Paramount logo from the opening and closing as well as any references to Paramount in the copyright line on the main titles However the mountain motif remains on some television prints usually with a UM M copyright line while recent versions have circulated with the Paramount Publix reference in cartoons from br The original Betty Boop cartoons were made in black and white As new color cartoons made specifically for television began to appear in the s the original black and white cartoons were retired Boop s film career had a revival with the release of The Betty Boop Scandals of becoming a part of the post s counterculture NTA attempted to capitalize on this with a new syndication package but because no market existed for cartoons in black and white they sent them to South Korea where the cartoons were hand traced frame by frame in color resulting in the degradation of the animation quality and timing Unable to sell these to television largely because of the sloppy colorization they assembled a number of the color cartoons in a compilation feature titled Betty Boop for President to connect with the election but it did not receive a theatrical release br The release of the films on video cassette for home viewing created a new market for the films in their original form The American Movie Classics cable television channel showcased a selection of the original black and white Betty Boop cartoons in the s which led to an eight volume VHS and LV set Betty Boop the Definitive Collection Some of the nonpublic domain Boop cartoons copyrighted by Republic successor Melange Pictures Paramount Global s holding company that handles the Republic theatrical library have been released by Olive Films under Paramount s license while the Internet Archive hosts Betty Boop cartoons that are public domain br br br Portrayal br br br Sex symbol br Betty Boop is regarded as one of the first and best known sex symbols on the animated screen she is a symbol of the Depression era and a reminder of the more carefree days of Jazz Age flappers Her popularity was drawn largely from adult audiences and the cartoons while seemingly surreal contained many sexual and psychological elements particularly in the Talkartoon Minnie the Moocher featuring Cab Calloway and his orchestra br Minnie the Moocher defined Betty s character as a teenager of a modern era at odds with the old world ways of her parents In the cartoon after a disagreement with her strict parents Betty runs away from home accompanied by her boyfriend Bimbo only to get lost in a haunted cave A ghostly walrus rotoscoped from live action footage of Calloway sings Calloway s song Minnie the Moocher accompanied by several other ghosts and skeletons This haunting performance sends the frightened Betty and Bimbo back to the safety of home Minnie the Moocher served as a promotion for Calloway s subsequent stage appearances and also established Betty Boop as a cartoon star The eight Talkartoons that followed all starred Betty leading her into her own series beginning in With the release of Stopping the Show August the Talkartoons were replaced by the Betty Boop series which continued for the next seven years br Betty Boop was unique among female cartoon characters because she represented a sexual woman Other female cartoon characters of the same period such as Minnie Mouse displayed their underwear or bloomers regularly in the style of childish or comical characters not a fully defined woman s form Many other female cartoons were merely clones of their male co stars with alterations in costume the addition of eyelashes and a female voice Betty Boop wore short dresses high heels a garter and her breasts were highlighted with a low contoured bodice that showed cleavage In her cartoons male characters frequently try to sneak a peek at her while she is changing or simply going about her business In Betty Boop s Bamboo Isle she does the hula wearing nothing but a lei strategically placed to cover her breasts and a grass skirt This was repeated in her first cameo appearance in Popeye the Sailor A certain girlish quality was given to the character She was drawn with a head more similar to a baby s than an adult s in proportion to her body This suggested the combination of girlishness and maturity that many people saw in the flapper type which Betty represented br While the character was kept pure and girl like onscreen compromises to her virtue were a challenge The studio s Christmas card featured Betty in bed with Santa Claus winking at the viewer The Talkartoons The Bum Bandit and Dizzy Red Riding Hood both were given distinctly impure endings Officially Betty was only years old according to a interview with Fleischer although in The Bum Bandit she is portrayed as a married woman with many children and with an adult woman s voice rather than the standard boop boop a doop voice br Attempts to compromise her virginity were reflected in Chess Nuts and most importantly in Boop Oop a Doop In Chess Nuts the Black King goes into the house where Betty is and ties her up When she rejects him he pulls her out of the ropes drags her off to the bedroom and says I will have you The bed however runs away and Betty calls for help through the window Bimbo comes to her rescue and she is saved before anything happens In Boop Oop a Doop Betty is a high wire performer in a circus The ringmaster lusts for Betty as he watches her from below singing Do Something a song previously performed by Helen Kane As Betty returns to her tent the ringmaster follows her inside and sensually massages her legs surrounds her and threatens her job if she does not submit Betty pleads with the ringmaster to cease his advances as she sings Don t Take My Boop Oop A Doop Away Koko the Clown is practicing his juggling outside the tent and overhears the struggle inside He leaps in to save Betty struggling with the ringmaster who loads him into a cannon and fires it Koko who remained hiding inside the cannon knocks the ringmaster out cold with a mallet while imitating the ringmaster s laugh Koko then inquires about Betty s welfare to which she answers in song No he couldn t take my boop oop a doop away According to Jill Harness of Mental Floss these portrayals of Boop fighting off sexual harassment on the animated screen made many see her as a feminist icon br br br Under the Production Code br Betty Boop s best appearances are considered to be in her first three years due to her Jazz Baby character and innocent sexuality which was aimed at adults but the content of her films was affected by the National Legion of Decency and the Production Code of which imposed guidelines on the motion picture industry and placed specific restrictions on the content films could reference with sexual innuendos This greatly affected the Betty Boop cartoons br No longer a carefree flapper from the date the code went into effect on July Betty became a spinster housewife or a career girl who wore a fuller dress or skirt Additionally as time progressed the curls in her hair gradually decreased in number She also eventually stopped wearing her gold bracelets and hoop earrings and she became more mature and wiser in personality compared to her earlier years Right from the start Joseph Breen the new head film censor had numerous complaints Breen ordered the removal of the suggestive introduction that had started the cartoons because Betty Boop s winks and shaking hips were deemed suggestive of immorality For a few entries Betty was given a new human boyfriend named Freddy who was introduced in She Wronged Him Right Next Betty was teamed with a puppy named Pudgy beginning with Betty Boop s Little Pal The following year saw the addition of the eccentric inventor Grampy who debuted in Betty Boop and Grampy br br While these cartoons were tame compared to her earlier appearances their self conscious wholesomeness was aimed at a more juvenile audience which contributed to the decline of the series Much of the decline was due to the lessening of Betty s role in the cartoons in favor of her co stars not to mention Fleischer s biggest success Popeye This was a similar problem experienced during the same period with Walt Disney s Mickey Mouse who was becoming eclipsed by the popularity of his co stars Donald Duck Goofy and Pluto br Since she was largely a musical novelty character the animators attempted to keep Betty s cartoons interesting by pairing her with popular comic strip characters such as Henry The Little King and Little Jimmy hoping to create an additional spin off series with her pairing with Popeye in None of these films though generated a new series When the flapper jazz era that Betty represented had been replaced by the big bands of the swing era Fleischer Studios made an attempt to develop a replacement character in this style in the Betty Boop cartoon Betty Boop and Sally Swing but it was not a success br The last Betty Boop cartoons were released in and a few made attempts to bring Betty into the swing era In her last appearance Rhythm on the Reservation Betty drives an open convertible labeled Betty Boop s Swing Band through a Native American reservation where she introduces the people to swing music and creates a Swinging Sioux Band The Betty Boop cartoon series officially ended with Yip Yip Yippy While Yip Yip Yippy appears at the end of the Betty Boop series it is actually a one shot about a Drug Store mail order cowboy wannabe without Betty which was written mainly to fill the release schedule and fulfill the contract br br br Media

Fleischer Studios Max Fleischer and Paramount Publix Corporation for the deliberate caricature that produced unfair competition exploiting her personality and image While Kane had risen to fame in the late s as The Boop Oop a Doop Girl a star of stage recordings and films for Paramount her career was nearing its end by and Paramount promoted the development of Betty Boop following Kane s decline The case was brought in New York in On April Fleischer testified that Betty Boop purely was a product of his imagination and detailed by members of his staff br Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified that Kane had witnessed an African American child performer Baby Esther Esther Jones using a similar vocal style in an act at the Everglades Restaurant club in midtown Manhattan in April or May Under cross examination Bolton said that he had met with Kane at the club after Esther s performance but could not say when she had walked in Bolton also stated that Paramount s lawyers had paid him to come to New York Esther s name was given in the trial as Esther Jones During the trial Lou Bolton who was Esther Jones manager also testified his belief that she was probably in Paris An early test sound on disc film lost after the trial was produced which featured Esther performing in this style and introduced as evidence In the film Esther sings three songs that had earlier been popularized by Helen Kane Don t Be Like That Is There Anything Wrong with That and Wa da da which writer Mark Langer says was hardly proof that Helen Kane derived her singing style from Baby Esther br Jazz studies scholar Robert O Meally stated this evidence though might very well have been cooked up by the Fleischers to discredit Kane whom they later admitted to have been their model for Betty Boop O Meally also questioned if some sort of deal existed between Paramount and Bolton and questioned if Esther were ever paid for her presumed loss of revenue br New York Supreme Court Justice Edward J McGoldrick ruled The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force In his opinion based on the totality of the evidence presented in the trial the baby technique of singing did not originate with Kane No confirmed recordings of Jones are known to exist br Under current US copyright law Betty Boop is due to enter the public domain in Later versions of her character will enter the public domain in the years that they become eligible br br br Lawsuits and recent ownership br Ownership of the Boop cartoons has changed hands over the intervening decades
