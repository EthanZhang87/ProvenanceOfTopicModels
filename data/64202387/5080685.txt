Kong the gameplay involves the player guiding several Mini Marios through platform stages with the touch screen as they attempt to defeat Donkey Kong The game also marks the return of Pauline who had not been seen since s Donkey Kong br March of the Minis received positive reviews from critics with praise for its gameplay level design and control scheme although some criticized its short length A sequel called Mario vs Donkey Kong Minis March Again was released in June In October the game was released on the Wii U eShop under the Virtual Console branding br br br Gameplay br Instead of controlling with the D pad Mario vs Donkey Kong March of the Minis uses the touch screen to control the Mini Marios in the same vein as Lemmings The object of the game is to get the Mini Marios in each level to the door The Mini Marios have no concept of self preservation having no problem walking into spikes or lava and as such the challenge comes from managing multiple moving toys on their way to the goal while avoiding their destruction br To move the player must use the stylus to turn a Mini Mario s direction to move them in that direction Swiping up enters pipes climbs ladders or makes them jump Swiping across the Mini Marios left or right causes them to move in that direction and swiping down causes them to enter a pipe that is below their feet Tapping once causes them to stop The D pad and the face buttons move the camera i e X and Up move the camera up and in DK stages pressing L and R causes a line to appear temporarily showing the path the launched Mini Mario will take The timer does not start until the player either moves blocks or taps a Mini Mario However the player may move elevators change the direction of pipes or conveyor belts and scout the level out without starting the timer br The game consists of eight worlds or floors each with nine levels or rooms totaling levels or rooms altogether a minigame and a DK stage In addition to these levels are the Roof which consists entirely of the final DK stage and the basement which consists of two extra boss stages that are only accessible by earning silver stars and gold stars totaling stars altogether When a chain of Mini Marios enters the door at the end a combo occurs meaning for the first for the second for the third etc If the stage contains a Gold Mini Mario and it is the end of the chain the point bonus doubles For instance if there are two normal Mini Marios and a Gold Mini Mario in a stage and they enter in that order the points will go like this At the end of every room the player s score is tallied up with points for each second remaining The player may also earn any combination of three bonuses All Minis which means every Mini Mario made it into the door Perfect Chain which means that there was no break between Mini Marios entering the door and Nonstop which means that at least one Mini Mario was not stopped by being tapped with the stylus stopping on elevators or waiting for platforms don t ruin this bonus There are three medals or stars that can be earned upon meeting their requirements bronze silver and gold br In each room there is a Mini Mario Card and coins Collecting all nine Mini Mario Cards in a floor will spell out MINIMARIO and unlock that floor s minigame The minigame involves tapping Mini Shy Guys as they come out of the Pipes and avoiding the Bob ombs that will occasionally come out of the Pipes as well Touching a Bob omb in the minigame will have a result of the player losing five points There are two types of coins small and large Small coins are worth points and large ones are worth Collecting coins helps in meeting the score required for a Gold Star br The DK stages play a bit differently from the main game In these stages the bottom screen shows a cannon loaded with a Mini Mario a belt upon which the cannon moves on and a button labeled Shoot that the player must tap to fire the Mini Mario The top screen shows the player s remaining Mini Marios which depends on how many Mini Marios the player led to the door throughout the entire floor DK s remaining hitpoints which always starts out at six DK s location and objects the player needs to hit with a Mini Mario in order to damage him If a Mini Mario collides with DK s side that will damage him as well The only way to lose a Mini Mario is if it is hit with an object or if DK breaks it DK s movement varies with the stage In some it is similar to a shell game in that there are three locations he can appear and the player must predict where he will appear next based on a pattern In the others he is on a swinging platform If a Mini Mario collides with the swinging platform s spikes on the bottom of it the Mini Mario will break Floor s DK Stage involves him moving between ropes like Donkey Kong Jr does in Donkey Kong Jr In Floor s DK stage if a Mini Mario collides with DK the Mini Bird or any of the Mini Snapjaws the Mini Mario will break Once the player hits DK six times with Mini Marios or any falling objects from the Mini Marios the stage ends and the score is tallied up with points for each second remaining and points for each surviving Mini Mario The extra three DK stages are modeled after stages in the original Donkey Kong arcade game br br br Construction Zone br March of the Minis incorporated a feature that was meant to be included in the cancelled Donkey Kong Plus The player could create levels and upload them wirelessly or over the Nintendo Wi Fi Connection for friends to play For each floor completed in the main game its corresponding kit was unlocked for use in the construction zone In addition when the player completed the minigames for the first floors floors and all floors Special Kits and were unlocked respectively The player could save up to of their own levels and download up to levels made by their friends The special kits resembled the Pipe Works Kit Toadstool Castle Kit and Jungle Hijinks Kit with similar music except for the first kit which played a different version of the Mushroom Mayhem kit Another difference is that the players could move Mini Toad Mini Peach and Mini DK respectively instead of a Mini Mario br All online features were retired in May br br br Plot br March of the Minis opens with the grand opening for the Super Mini Mario World amusement park based on the highly successful mechanical toys developed by the Mini Mario Toy Company Immediately following the ribbon cutting ceremony Mario presents his VIP guest Pauline with a Mini Mario toy while at the same time Donkey Kong offers her a Mini Donkey Kong toy When Pauline chooses the Mini Mario toy Donkey Kong becomes infuriated and storms off with her to the roof Mario unable to follow sends the Mini Mario toys in pursuit to save Pauline br The Mini Mario toys work their way through eight floors each with nine challenging rooms confronting Donkey Kong on each floor Eventually Mario and the Mini Mario toys reach the roof and defeat Donkey Kong Afterwards Mario is relieved to find Pauline safe and sound in a cozy room surrounded by presents presumably from Donkey Kong in an attempt to impress her and holding a cup of tea Donkey Kong enters the room feeling remorse for his behavior and Pauline picks up a Mini Donkey Kong toy and kisses it making Donkey Kong feel better knowing that she has forgiven him br br br Reception br br The game received favorable reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic As of July the game has sold million copies worldwide br br br Notes br
