Hepburn romanization Hebon shiki r maji lit Hepburn style Roman letters is the main system of romanization for the Japanese language The system was originally published in by American Christian missionary and physician James Curtis Hepburn as the standard in the first edition of his Japanese English dictionary The system is distinct from other romanization methods in its use of English orthography to phonetically transcribe sounds for example the syllable i is written as shi and t a is written as cha reflecting their spellings in English compare to si and tya in the more systematic Nihon shiki and Kunrei shiki systems br In Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary codifying a revised version of the system that is known today as traditional Hepburn A version with additional revisions known as modified Hepburn was published in br Although Kunrei shiki romanization is the style favored by the Japanese government Hepburn remains the most popular method of Japanese romanization It is learned by most foreign students of the language and is used within Japan for romanizing personal names locations and other information such as train tables and road signs Because the system s orthography is based on English phonology instead of a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary individuals who do not speak Japanese will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems br br br History br br In American Presbyterian missionary doctor James Curtis Hepburn published the first Japanese English dictionary in which he introduced a new system for the romanization of Japanese into Latin script He published a second edition in and a third edition in which introduced minor changes The third edition s system had been adopted in the previous year by the R maji kai Romanization Club a group of Japanese and foreign scholars who promoted a replacement of the Japanese script with a romanized system br Hepburn romanization loosely based on the conventions of English orthography spelling stood in opposition to Nihon shiki romanization which had been developed in Japan in as a script replacement Compared to Hepburn Nihon shiki is more systematic in its representation of the Japanese syllabary kana as each symbol corresponds to a phoneme However the notation requires further explanation for accurate pronunciation by non Japanese speakers for example the syllables i and t a which are written as shi and cha in Hepburn are rendered as si and tya in Nihon shiki After Nihon shiki was presented to the R maji kai in a dispute began between the supporters of the two systems which resulted in a standstill and an eventual halt to the organization s activities in br After the Russo Japanese War of the two factions resurfaced as the R maji Hirome kai Society for the Spread of Romanization which supported Hepburn s style and the Nihon no R maji sha Romanization Society of Japan which supported Nihon shiki In Hepburn was revised by educator Kan Jigor and others of the R maji Hirome kai which began calling it the Sh sei Hebon shiki modified Hepburn system or Hy jun shiki standard system br In a Special Romanization Study Commission headed by the Minister of Education was appointed by the government to devise a standardized form of romanization The Commission eventually decided on a slightly modified compromise version of Nihon shiki which was chosen for official use by cabinet ordinance on September this system is known today as Kunrei shiki romanization On September at the beginning of the occupation of Japan after World War II Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur issued a directive mandating the use of modified Hepburn by occupation forces The directive had no legal force however and a revised version of Kunrei shiki was reissued by cabinet ordinance on December after the end of occupation br Although it lacks de jure status Hepburn remains the de facto standard for some applications in Japan As of many government organizations used Hepburn including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires the use of Hepburn on passports and the Ministry of Land Infrastructure and Transport requires its use on transport signs including road signs and railway station signs According to a survey by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs in the Japanese primarily use Hepburn to spell place names br Hepburn is also used by private organizations including The Japan Times and the Japan Travel Bureau br American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese ANSI Z based on modified Hepburn was approved in and published in by the American National Standards Institute In it was proposed for International Organization for Standardization ISO standard but was rejected in favor of Kunrei shiki ANSI Z was deprecated as a standard in br In January the Cultural Affairs Agency proposed revising the Cabinet ordinance to make Hepburn the standard romanization system of Japan br br br Variants br br There are many variants of the Hepburn romanization The two most common styles are as follows br br Traditional Hepburn as defined in various editions of Hepburn s dictionary with the third edition often considered authoritative although changes in kana usage must be accounted for It is characterized by the rendering of syllabic n as m before the consonants b m and p for example Shimbashi for br Modified Hepburn also known as Revised Hepburn in which among other changes the rendering of syllabic n as m before bilabial consonants is no longer used Shinbashi for The version of the system published in the third and later editions of Kenkyusha s New Japanese English Dictionary are often considered authoritative it was adopted in by the Library of Congress as one of its ALA LC romanizations and is the most common variant of Hepburn romanization used today br In Japan itself there are some variants officially mandated for various uses br br Railway Standard Tetsud Keiji Kijun Kitei which mostly follows Modified Hepburn except syllabic n is rendered as in Traditional Japan Railways and other major railways use it for station names br Road Sign Romaji Hepburn D rohy ji no r maji Hebonshiki used for road signs which otherwise follows Modified Hepburn closely but specifies that macrons are not to be used br Ministry of Foreign Affairs Passport Standard Gaimush Ryoken Kitei a permissive standard that renders the syllabic n as m before b m and p Most of the long vowels are not rendered Moreover this standard explicitly allows the use of non Hepburn romaji hi Hebon shiki r maji in personal names notably for passports In particular the long vowel can be romanized oh oo or ou Satoh Satoo or Satou for br Details of the variants can be found below br br br Obsolete variants br The romanizations set out in the first and second versions of Hepburn s dictionary are primarily of historical interest Notable differences from the third and later versions include br br br Features br The main feature of Hepburn is that its orthography is based on English phonology More technically when syllables that are constructed systematically according to the Japanese syllabary contain an unstable consonant in the modern spoken language the orthography is changed to something that better matches the real sound as an English speaker would pronounce it For example is written shi not si This transcription is thus only partly phonological br Some linguists such as Harold E Palmer Daniel Jones and Otto Jespersen object to Hepburn since the pronunciation based spellings can obscure the systematic origins of Japanese phonetic structures inflections and conjugations Since the vowel sounds in Hepburn are similar to the vowel sounds in Italian and the consonants similar to those of many other languages in particular English speakers unfamiliar with Japanese will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems br br br Long vowels br In Hepburn vowel combinations that form a long sound are usually indicated with a macron Other adjacent vowels such as those separated by a morpheme boundary are written separately br br All other vowel combinations are always written separately br br E I sei fuku seifuku uniform despite E I often being pronounced as a long E br U I karu i karui light in weight br O I oi oi nephew br br br Loanwords br In foreign loanwords long vowels followed by a ch onpu are indicated with macrons br br se ra s r sailor br ta ku shi takush taxi br ko n ku ru konk ru competition br ba re bo ru bar b ru volleyball br so ru s ru sole of a shoe etc br Adjacent vowels in loanwords are written separately br br ba re e baree ballet br mi i ra miira mummy br so u ru souru soul Seoul br br br Variations br There are many variations on the Hepburn system for indicating long vowels with a macron For example is properly romanized as T ky but can also be written as br br Tokyo not indicated at all Common for Japanese words that have been adopted into English and the de facto convention for Hepburn used in signs and other English language information around Japan br T ky indicated with circumflex accents as in the alternative Nihon shiki and Kunrei shiki romanizations They are often used when macrons are unavailable or difficult to input due to their visual similarity br Tohkyoh indicated with an h only applies after o This is sometimes known as passport Hepburn as the Japanese Foreign Ministry has authorized but not required it in passports br Toukyou written using kana spelling as ou or oo depending on the kana This is also known as w puro style as it reflects how text is entered into a Japanese word processor by using a keyboard with Roman characters W puro more accurately represents the way that is written in kana by differentiating between as in Toukyou in w puro and as in tooi in w puro however it fails to differentiate between long vowels and vowels separated by a morpheme boundary br Tookyoo written by doubling the long vowels Some dictionaries such as the Pocket Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionary and Basic English Writers Japanese English Wordbook follow this style and it is also used in the JSL form of romanization br br br Particles br In traditional and modified br br When is used as a particle it is written wa br In traditional Hepburn br br When is used as a particle Hepburn originally recommended ye This spelling is obsolete and it is commonly written as e Romaji Hirome Kai br When is used as a particle it is written wo br In modified Hepburn br br When is used as a particle it is written e br When is used as a particle it is written o br br br Syllabic n br In traditional Hepburn br br Syllabic n is written as n before consonants but as m before labial consonants b m and p It is sometimes written as n with a hyphen before vowels and y to avoid confusion between for example n a and na and n ya and nya but its hyphen usage is not clear br annai guide br Gumma Gunma br kan i simple br shin y trust br In modified Hepburn br br The rendering m before labial consonants is not used and is replaced with n It is written n with an apostrophe before vowels and y br annai guide br Gunma Gunma br kan i simple br shin y trust br br br Long consonants br Elongated or geminate consonant sounds are marked by doubling the consonant following a sokuon for consonants that are digraphs in Hepburn sh ch ts only the first consonant of the set is doubled except for ch which is replaced by tch br br kekka result br sassato quickly br zutto all the time br

sounds in words in other languages br Digraphs with orange backgrounds are the general ones used for loanwords or foreign places or names and those with blue backgrounds are used for more accurate transliterations of foreign sounds suggested by the Cabinet of Japan s Ministry of Education Culture Sports Science and Technology Katakana combinations with beige backgrounds are suggested by the American National Standards Institute and the British Standards Institution as possible uses Ones with purple backgrounds appear on the version of the Hy jun shiki formatting br br The use of in these
