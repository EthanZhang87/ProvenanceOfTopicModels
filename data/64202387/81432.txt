Yoshi is a fictional dinosaur who appears in video games published by Nintendo Yoshi debuted in Super Mario World on the SNES as Mario and Luigi s sidekick Throughout the mainline Super Mario series Yoshi typically serves as Mario s trusted steed With a gluttonous appetite Yoshi can gobble enemies with his long tongue and lay eggs that doubly function as projectiles Yoshi is the title character of the Yoshi series and a supporting character in Mario spin off games such as Mario Party and Mario Kart as well as many Mario sports games He also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting game series Super Smash Bros Yoshi is a member of the same named species which is distinguished for its wide range of colors br Yoshi has been well received with some critics noting that he is one of the most recognizable characters and one of the best sidekicks in video games Yoshi s image has also appeared on a range of products including clothes and collectibles br br br Concept and creation br br Shigeru Miyamoto the video game designer at Nintendo credited with inventing the Mario series had wanted Mario to have a dinosaur companion ever since the first release of Super Mario Bros however Nintendo engineers could not add such a character into the game due to the limitations of the Nintendo Entertainment System NES The inspiration for Yoshi can be traced back further to the green dragon Tamagon in the video game Devil World also designed by Miyamoto both are green lizards that hatch from eggs and can eat enemies with their large mouth and also emit the same noise when they hatch During the development of Super Mario Bros Miyamoto had a number of sketches around his desk including an image of Mario riding a horse Takashi Tezuka a Mario series developer speculated that Miyamoto s love of horse riding as well as country and western themes influenced Yoshi s creation The concept of Mario riding a dinosaur also came from the NES video game Excitebike which featured people riding motorcycles br Once the more powerful Super NES was released Miyamoto was finally able to implement Yoshi into the series putting Yoshi into the video game Super Mario World As development of Super Mario World progressed the team opted to set the game in a dinosaur land so Tezuka asked designer Shigefumi Hino to draw a reptile like creature based on Miyamoto s sketches Hino originally produced a design that Tezuka deemed too reptilian and didn t really fit into the Mario world so he encouraged the designer to create a cuter character Also according to Hino the reasoning behind the design is that when Mario punches Yoshi Yoshi is so surprised that his tongue leaps out This was later passed off as Mario merely pointing forward to signal Yoshi to stick out his tongue Alongside the individual Yoshi Super Mario World also introduced other members of the Yoshi species characterized by their variety of colors br Yoshi proved to be popular in this debut which caused the next game in the series Super Mario World Yoshi s Island to focus on the Yoshi species At Miyamoto s prompting Hino landed on the idea of using Yoshi as the main character of a platforming game with the goal of being more accessible than previous games in the Mario series To give the gameplay a more gentle and relaxed pacing the levels lack time limits and feature more exploration elements than previous games Yoshi s flutter jump also makes him easier to control in the air than Mario In this game he is responsible for Baby Mario which leads him to Bowser s Castle where he is reunited with Baby Luigi Yoshi successfully pulls the twins together just in time to go home after beating a huge Baby Bowser br The version of Yoshi seen in the live action Super Mario Bros film was realized using a metre tall ft animatronic dinosaur Yoshi was designed in the film by Dave Nelson The animatronic had nearly meters ft of cable and hundreds of moving parts inside of it and was controlled by nine puppeteers The body was cable controlled while the head was radio controlled Nelson described the overall process as being difficult The creation of Yoshi was handled by a company independent from the filmmakers br br br Appearances br br br In Super Mario series br br Super Mario World was the first video game to feature Yoshi as a companion to Mario Yoshi s rideability was inspired by

Miyamoto apologized br In Super Mario Yoshi makes a minor cameo A cannon outside the castle becomes available if Mario collects all Power Stars which can be used to access the Mushroom Castle s roof
