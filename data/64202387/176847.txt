Fleischer Studios was an American animation studio founded in by brothers Max and Dave Fleischer who ran the pioneering company from its inception until its acquisition by Paramount Pictures the parent company and the distributor of its films In its prime Fleischer Studios was a premier producer of animated cartoons for theaters with Walt Disney Productions being its chief competitor in the s br Fleischer Studios included Out of the Inkwell and Talkartoons characters like Koko the Clown Betty Boop Bimbo Popeye the Sailor and the comic character Superman Unlike other studios whose characters were anthropomorphic animals the Fleischers most successful characters were humans with the exception of Bimbo a black and white cartoon dog The cartoons of the Fleischer Studio were very different from those of Disney both in concept and in execution As a result they were rough rather than refined and consciously artistic rather than commercial but in their unique way their artistry was expressed through a culmination of the arts and sciences This approach focused on surrealism dark humor adult psychological elements and sexuality Furthermore the environments were grittier and urban often set in squalid surroundings reflecting the Great Depression as well as German Expressionism br br br History br br br The Silent Era br The Fleischer Studio was built on Max Fleischer s novelty film series Out of the Inkwell The novelty was based largely on the results of the rotoscope invented by Fleischer to produce realistic animation The first Out of the Inkwell films were produced through The Bray Studio They featured Fleischer s first character The Clown which became known as Ko Ko the Clown in br In The Bray Studio ran afoul with legal issues having contracted for more films than it could deliver to its distributor Goldwyn Pictures The Fleischer Brothers left and began their own studio Out of the Inkwell Films with Dave Fleischer as director and production supervisor and Max as producer at East th Street later to Broadway Times Square midtown Manhattan New York City In animator Dick Huemer came to the Out of the Inkwell Films studio and redesigned The Clown for more efficient animation Huemer s new design and experience as an animator moved them away from their dependency on the rotoscope for fluid animation In addition to defining the clown Huemer established the Fleischer style with its distinctive thick and thin ink lines In addition Huemer created Ko Ko s companion Fitz the Dog who would evolve into Bimbo in br Throughout the s Fleischer was one of the leading producers of animation with clever moments and numerous innovations These innovations include the Rotograph an early Aerial Image photographic process for compositing animation with live action backgrounds Other innovations included Ko Ko Song Car Tunes and sing along shorts featuring the famous bouncing ball a precursor to karaoke br In distributor Edwin Miles Fadiman and Hugo Riesenfeld formed the Red Seal Pictures Corporation Riesenfeld was the theatrical manager of the Strand Rivoli and Rialto theaters on Broadway Because the Out of the Inkwell films were a major part of the program in Riesenfeld s theaters the Fleischers were invited to become partners The Red Seal Company committed to an ambitious release schedule of films with The Inkwell Studio as the primary supplier The following year Red Seal released films that included documentaries short comedy subjects and live action serials Carrie of the Chorus also known as Backstage Comedies was one of the Red Seal series that featured Max s daughter Ruth in a supporting role Ray Bolger made his screen debut in this series and dated Ruth for a short time br Red Seal released cartoon novelty series such as The Animated Hair cartoons by cartoonist Marcus and Inklings The Animated Hair series resembled the on screen hand drawing gimmick established in Out of the Inkwell In this case Marcus produced high quality ink line portraits of celebrities and political figures Then through stop motion animation techniques the lines and forms would break away to entertainingly re form the portrait into another Inklings was similar in concept to the Animated Hair films but was more of a visual puzzle novelty using a variety of progressive scratch off reveal techniques and rearranged animated cutouts to change the images br It was during this time that Lee de Forest started filming his Phonofilms experiments featuring several of the major Broadway headliners The Red Seal company began acquiring more theaters outside of New York and equipped them with sound equipment produced by Lee de Forest displaying talkies three years before the sound revolution began Because of Max s interest in technology Riesenfeld introduced him to de Forest It was through this partnership that Max produced a number of the Ko Ko Song Car tunes as sound releases Of the song films produced between and were produced as sound films beginning in with standard silent versions as well The first sound release was Mother Pin a Rose on Me Other sound releases included Darling Nellie Gray Has Anybody Here Seen Kelly When the Midnight Choo Choo Leaves for Alabam Coming Through the Rye My Wife s Gone to the Country Margie Oh How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning Sweet Adeline Old Black Joe Come Take A Trip in My Airship and By the Light of the Silvery Moon br Red Seal owned theaters extending as far west as Cleveland Ohio But after only two years of operation Red Seal was broke Max Fleischer sought an appointment of receiver in bankruptcy in October Just as the situation looked hopeless Alfred Weiss appeared from the horizon with a Paramount contact br The Paramount deal provided financing and distribution but due to legal complications of the bankruptcy the title to Out of the Inkwell was changed to The Inkwell Imps and the studio was renamed Inkwell Studios One year into the relationship the Fleischer Brothers discovered mismanagement under Weiss and left before the end of the Imps contract Out of the Inkwell Films Inc filed bankruptcy in January In March Max formed Fleischer Studios with Dave as his partner Operations were first set up at the Carpenter Goldman Laboratories in Queens With a skeleton staff Fleischer Studios started out doing industrial films most notably Finding His Voice a technical demonstration film explaining Western Electric s Variable Density recording and reproduction system Max Fleischer secured a new contract with Paramount to produce a revival of the Bouncing Ball song films re branded as Screen Songs with The Sidewalks of New York as the first release on February br br br Sound films br The early experiments with sound synchronization gave Fleischer Studios experience in perfecting the post production method of recording aided by several inventions by founder Max Fleischer With the conversion to sound Paramount needed more sound films and cartoons could be produced faster than feature films As the Screen Songs returned Fleischer to the established song film format a new sound series Talkartoons replaced the silent Inkwell Imps the first being Noah s Lark released on October Earlier entries in the series were one shot cartoons until the appearance of Bimbo as of the fourth entry Bimbo evolved through several redesigns in each cartoon for the first year While the intent was to develop him as the star of the series it was the cameo appearance of a Helen Kane caricature in the seventh entry Dizzy Dishes that took center stage Audience reactions to the New York preview were so great that Paramount encouraged the continued development of the most famous character to come from the Fleischer Studio by that time Betty Boop While originated as a hybrid human canine character Betty Boop was transformed into the human character she is known as by Having become the main attraction of the Talkartoons she was given her own series which ran until br The Jazz Baby Flapper character Betty Boop lifted the spirits of Depression Era audiences with her paradoxical mixture of childlike innocence and sexual allure Being a musical novelty character she was a natural for theatrical entertainment Several of her early cartoons were developed as promotional vehicles for some of the top Black Jazz performers of the day including Louis Armstrong I ll Be Glad When You re Dead You Rascal You Don Redman I Heard and most notably the three cartoons made with Cab Calloway Minnie the Moocher Snow White and The Old Man of the Mountain This was considered a bold action in light of the Jim Crow policies active in the South where such films would not be shown br In the Hays Code resulted in severe censorship for films This affected the content of all of Paramount s films as well which tended to reflect a more mature tone in the features of the Marx Brothers W C Fields and most of all Mae West As a result each of these stars was released as Paramount changed the content of its films to reflect a more general audience in order to comply with the new Code and stay in business Paramount had also gone through three reorganizations from bankruptcy between and The new management under Barney Balaban set out to make more general audience films of the type made at MGM but for lower budgets This change in content policy affected the content of cartoons that Fleischer was to produce for Paramount which urged emulation of the Walt Disney product br While Paramount was a large organization with a network of theaters its fiscal consciousness was largely responsible for preventing Fleischer Studios from acquiring the three strip Technicolor process leaving it available for a four year exclusivity with Walt Disney who created a new market for color cartoons established by Academy Award winner Flowers and Trees br Paramount acquiesced to the release of the Color Classics series starting in but with the exclusivity of the three color process still held by Disney Fleischer Studios used the available two color processes Cinecolor a two emulsion red and blue process and Two color Technicolor using red and green By the Disney exclusivity had expired and Fleischer Studios used the three color process in its color cartoons beginning with Somewhere in Dreamland and continued using it for the remainder of its active years br The Fleischer Studio s greatest success came with the licensing of E C Segar s comic strip character Popeye the Sailor beginning in Popeye eventually became the most popular series the studio ever produced and its success surpassed Walt Disney s Mickey Mouse cartoons documented by popularity polls With the availability of full spectrum color the Fleischer Studios produced three two reel Popeye featurettes Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor Popeye the Sailor Meets Ali Baba s Forty Thieves and Popeye the Sailor Meets Aladdin s Wonderful Lamp This series of longer format cartoons were an indication of the emergence of the animated feature film as a commercially viable project beginning with Walt Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs br The Fleischer Studios had reached its zenith by with four series and annual releases Due to the phenomenal success of the Popeye cartoons Paramount demanded more and the Fleischer Studio experienced rapid expansion in order to balance out the increased workload The crowded conditions production speedups drawing quotas and internal management problems resulted in a labor strike beginning in May which lasted for five months This strike was a test case the first launched in the motion picture industry and produced a nationwide boycott of Fleischer cartoons for the duration br br Max Fleischer had been petitioning Paramount for three years about producing an animated feature Paramount vetoed his proposals until the proven success of Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Paramount now wanted an animated feature for a Christmas release This request came at the time of preparations for relocating to Miami Florida While the relocation had been a consideration for some time its final motivation was made a reality due to lower corporate tax structures and an alleged escape from the remaining hostility from the strike br The new Fleischer Studio opened in October and production on its first feature Gulliver s Travels went from the development stage begun in New York to active production in Miami The score was by Paramount staff composer Victor Young and recorded at the Paramount west coast facilities While limited to only theaters in a one month release Gulliver s Travels earned more than million in spite of exceeding its original estimated cost Accordingly a second feature was ordered for the Christmas period Mr Bug Goes to Town br br br Fall of Fleischer br The personal relationship between Max and Dave Fleischer deteriorated during the Miami period due to complications associated with the pressures of finishing the studio s first feature film and Dave s very public adulterous affair with his secretary Mae Schwartz Max and Dave stopped speaking to each other altogether by the end of communicating solely by memo br Dave gained total control of production in relegating Max to business affairs and research The studio was in need of new products going into the new decade but the new shorts series that debuted in and Gabby Stone Age Cartoons and Animated Antics were unsuccessful Theater operators complained with the Popeye cartoons having the only value br Paramount acquired the rights to comic book superhero Superman in and the Fleischers were assigned to work on a series of animated Superman shorts The first entry Superman had a budget of the highest ever for a Fleischer theatrical short and was nominated for an Academy Award br The animated Superman series with its action adventure and science fiction fantasy content was a huge success but that did not help the studio out of its financial trouble It was penalized for going over budget on Gulliver s Travels and the revenues earned from the rentals of the Popeye cartoons had to be used to offset the loss of incurred by the rejection of cartoons in br br br Acquisition by Paramount br br While profits dwindled Paramount continued to advance money to Fleischer Studios to continue the production of cartoons with its focus mainly on Popeye Superman and Mr Bug Goes to Town a new feature film for the Christmas season On May Paramount demanded reimbursement on the penalties still owed after months and assumed full ownership of Fleischer Studios Inc The Fleischers remained in control of production until that November Mr Bug Goes to Town intended for release in December was not released until February and never recouped its costs br In spite of living up to his contractual obligations and delivering the film Max Fleischer was asked to resign Dave Fleischer had resigned the month before and Paramount finished out the last five months of the Fleischer contract without the Fleischer brothers The last cartoon produced at the credited Fleischer Studios was the Superman cartoon Terror on the Midway Paramount formed a new company Famous Studios as a successor to Fleischer Studios effective on July br br br Television br With the exception of the Superman and Popeye cartoons Paramount s cartoon library of releases prior to October was originally sold to U M M TV Corporation in A condition of the purchase required the removal of the Paramount logos and copyright lines from the main titles br As soon as the Fleischer library was sold to television Max Fleischer noticed that some of the cartoons were being shown without his name in the credits which was a violation of his original contracts On June Max Fleischer filed suit against Paramount and its TV distribution partners seeking in damages The infringement on his name was corrected on all subsequent prints exhibited on television br Before U M M had finished the title alterations the company was bought by National Telefilm Associates NTA placed their logo at the heads and tails of the films and blacked out references to Paramount Technicolor Cinecolor and Polacolor The majority of the Fleischer cartoons were off the air by the mid s when the original copyrights were due for renewal NTA

Goes to Town various Betty Boop cartoons and the Color Classic The Tears of an Onion are among the few films that remain under copyright to Melange Pictures LLC br In the mid s NTA converted black and white Betty Boop cartoons to color through Fred Ladd s Color Systems company The process was done by having the cartoons traced and re colored by Korean animators These were packaged in under the title Betty Boop for President This was refashioned as a compilation feature Hooray for Betty Boop and ran on HBO in br Paramount has reacquired ownership of the original Fleischer film library
