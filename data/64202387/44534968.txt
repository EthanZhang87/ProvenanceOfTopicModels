The Spiny Shell colloquially known as the blue shell is a power up item in the Mario Kart video game series Originating in Mario Kart and featured in every main entry of the series since then the Spiny Shell when used aims directly at the racer in first place stopping them on impact The Spiny Shell acts as a catch up mechanic with racers ranked towards the bottom having a better chance of it spawning when driving into item boxes giving them a better chance at diminishing the lead of the racer in top position In addition to the Mario Kart series the blue shell appeared in the Super Smash Bros series from s Melee onwards it has been directly featured as a power up item from Super Smash Bros for Nintendo DS and Wii U onwards and in Mario Hoops on A character based on the item appears in the film The Super Mario Bros Movie voiced by Scott Menville br Initially the blue shell was impossible to stop or dodge once fired until Mario Kart Super Circuit and subsequent games allowed ways for the targeted racer to do so albeit only with combinations of precise timing and specific items As it is likely to spawn at least once during a race the power up item has earned a reputation of frequently destroying a player s lead or suddenly ruining their chances of winning Because of this the blue shell has largely come to be seen as one of the best and most famous yet also one of the most frustrating items in video game history br br br History br The Mario series features some visually similar figures which predate the blue shell such as the red Spinies from the original Super Mario Bros and blue Koopa Troopas from Super Mario World br In Mario Kart racers in th th place can obtain the blue shell Since the release of Mario Kart Double Dash the series sees the blue shell being more common to characters closer to the lead if the leader pulls away from the rest of the pack and in all releases prior to Mario Kart it is unable to hit characters on its way to the lead as it flies above the track using wings rather than gliding upon its surface br There are few techniques possible in some Mario Kart games to evade a blue shell such as using a timed boost from a Mushroom item in Mario Kart DS onwards In Mario Kart and Mario Kart Deluxe it is possible to use the new Super Horn item to destroy blue shells A toy model of the blue shell is included in the limited edition package of Mario Kart A blue shelled Koopa General voiced by Scott Menville appears in the film The Super Mario Bros Movie obliterating much of the film s depiction of Rainbow Road after shouting Blue shell as a battlecry br br br Development br In a interview with Kotaku Hideki Konno who directed Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart was asked about the blue shell s inclusion in the series He stated that it was introduced in Mario Kart to keep players together due to the limited processing power of the Nintendo and that we wanted to create a race where everyone was in it until the end In a interview with Eurogamer Kosuke Yabuki the director of Mario Kart and Mario Kart said that Nintendo has experimented with removing the blue shell from the games but it feels like something s missing Like there s something not quite enough in the game So for now we ve kept it in br br br Reception br Alex Langley s The Geek Handbook names as one of Mario Kart s greatest frustrations to be hit by a blue shell shortly before reaching the finish line David Murphy from PCMag and Jamie Andrew from Den of Geek both called the Blue Shell the Blue Shell of Death In Keith Stuart of The Guardian included the blue shell as one of the greatest video game objects in history calling it the most controversial item in the Mario universe br Calling it The Great Equalizer for its enhancement of the elements of struggle and luck Kotaku s Nathan Grayson considered the blue shell to be the most despised and best item of the Mario Kart series Kotaku s Yannick Le Jacq considered the blue shell to be the most notable and game changing among Mario Kart s most notorious items adding that this made it a lot more fun to use in Super Smash Bros for DS and Wii U too br Nintendo Power called the use of a Mushroom to dodge a blue shell a defining moment of gameplay in Mario Kart Wii Maxwell McGee of GameSpot considered the ability to destroy the dreaded blue shells with a new item the Super Horn to be a particularly exciting feature of Mario Kart Steve Watts of GameSpot said in that the Blue Shell has become synonymous with Mario Kart and is now an icon within video game history br br br
