another and certain other enemies may have defenses up that prevent them from being damaged If an enemy walks into Mario or Mario jumps on an enemy he cannot jump on he will lose a life The game is over if Mario runs out of lives The game utilizes a scoring system and a level has to be completed in a certain length of time Defeating more enemies with a Koopa Troopa shell in a row results in more
