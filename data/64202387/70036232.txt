points at the end of a game winning the game However the game takes many liberties with the sport Aggressive tackles and attacks are completely allowed though they give the opposing player items to use at their disposal Items often function in the same way as Mario Kart or Mario Tennis banana peels can be placed on the field and characters will slip on them while shells can be shot at characters to temporarily knock them over No out of bounds exists on the field instead an electric fence is placed around the field players can check and knock opponents into this fence to stun them Additionally collecting a glowing orb that appears on the field allows the player to perform a Hyper Strike and score a point goal if the move is charged up without interruption br In the game the player picks a major Mario franchise character like Mario or Princess Peach and a team of three other characters to round out the rest of the team All characters have various strengths and weaknesses and Battle

the addition of the online mode saying the leap forward in supporting a competitive landscape is a massively unexpected delight but criticized the lack of innovation upon prior entries Nintendo Life gave Battle League stars out of and called it a masterclass in competitive game design while heavily lauding the core gameplay and the title s accessibility depth and visuals Shacknews similarly gave

player modes woefully undercooked while expressing discontent over the lack of variety between matches GameSpot and GamesRadar called Battle League a slim and a thin package respectively with GamesRadar in particular noting that The game mechanics don t change it doesn t alter how you play and of the time you can t even see the Stadium you ve chosen because you re looking solely at the pitch via a top down perspective IGN thought similarly stating If you ve played any games in the series before there won t be many surprises in store for you and the small roster of characters and game modes is definitely disappointing Shacknews thought Battle League was merely an average Sunday game that s playing on Univision good for a few hours of entertainment and little more than that br
