series br br WarioWare also known as WarioWare Inc known in Japan as Made in Wario Japanese Hepburn Meido in Wario is a series of games featuring the Nintendo character Wario The series was established in with the release of Mega Microgames for the Game Boy Advance While the first two games were developed by Nintendo R D subsequent games have been co developed by Intelligent Systems br The distinctive feature of all WarioWare games is that they are collections of short simple microgames presented in quick succession The player is given four lives at the beginning of these microgames Each of these microgames lasts about three to five seconds and must be completed or else a life will be lost For example there is a microgame where the player must zap a spaceship in another Wario must collect coins in a Pac Man like maze The numerous microgames are linked together randomly and steadily increase in speed and difficulty as the player progresses On each level losing four games results in a game over After a certain amount of microgames have been played the player faces a stage specific boss microgame the player must complete these to regain a lost life with a maximum of four lives at any given time Boss microgames are considerably longer and more complex than other microgames For example a boss microgame in Mega Microgames instructs the player to hit a nail with a hammer multiple times in a row br The idea of microgames or minigames was popularized generally during the Nintendo s fifth generation of video game consoles and some early minigames appear in the Nintendo DD s Mario Artist Talent Studio in the style that would give rise to the WarioWare series Certain minigames originated in Mario Artist Polygon Studio as explained by Goro Abe of Nintendo R D s so called Wario Ware All Star Team In Polygon Studio you could create D models and animate them in the game but there was also a side game included inside In this game you would have to play short games that came one after another This is where the idea for Wario Ware came from Teammate Yoshio Sakamoto continued To add on that we got the idea of using Wario and the other characters because we couldn t think of anyone else who would be best for the role Wario is always doing stupid things and is really idiotic so we thought him and the rest of the characters would be best for the game p br Game Wario released in is a spin off of the WarioWare series br WarioWare Gold was released worldwide in br WarioWare Get It Together was released on September br WarioWare Move It was released on November br br br WarioWare games br br br Microgames br Microgames are simple video games created by the fictional company WarioWare Inc Nintendo s line of WarioWare games each feature these microgames which are generally less than seconds long Microgames are even simpler and shorter than the minigames found in other games such as the Mario Party series Gameplay in all WarioWare games is distinct from most other games as they involve the player or players trying to beat the microgames as soon as possible Most games present instructions in the form of a verb and quickly drop the player into the situation where they must perform said verb The extremely stripped down gameplay has intrigued some game researchers who have used WarioWare both as a case study in understanding the relationship between rules and play in videogames and as a target domain for investigating automated game design br All microgames are strung together in a random order within different stages each hosted by a different character First the player is presented with a quick one or two word instruction such as Eat or Rub Then the microgame will appear and the player will have to complete the game according to the instruction br Microgames usually have only one task to complete For example in one microgame the player is told to Enter and is presented with a scene from The Legend of Zelda The player must use the directional buttons to move Link to a cave entrance before the time runs out In another microgame the player is told to Avoid and must drive a car avoiding oncoming traffic Most microgames have a sound effect that signifies when the task is completed The games by themselves are so brief so as to potentially demand the sharp reflexes of a quick time event br Boss microgames always occur at a set point in a stage They are usually more challenging than regular microgames have no time limit as described below and give lives back upon completion If a stage is played for the first time it is completed after the boss microgame The sound effect will usually play after the task is fulfilled and then the score screen will return On repeated plays if the player has less than four lives one will be restored br The unit of time for all microgames is beats In Mega Microgames and Twisted a standard microgame is beats double length microgames usually IQ genre games last beats Fronk s microgames in Twisted and Gold only last beats In most games the BPM will start out relatively slow and will increase as the player completes microgames br In WarioWare Touched the beat standard has been dropped for all microgames so many last longer than beats This may be a way to make the game easier for those unaccustomed to the Nintendo DS s touch screen interface To retain pace the microgames will automatically end if cleared before a four beat measure is met br To show the time left to complete a microgame a small bomb appears at the bottom of the screen The fuse and a countdown timer show the amount of time left to complete the microgame When time runs out the bomb explodes and in most cases the player loses a life The fuse burns faster when the BPM increases br Some microgames are intrinsically harder than others and an increased BPM increased speed will make any microgame more difficult to complete than the same microgame at a slower BPM This is usually reflected in the microgames clear scores the score one must reach while playing a microgame in the practice modes to obtain credit for clearing it Smooth Moves and D I Y lack this feature br Each microgame features three difficulty levels Most modes start at the easiest level and progress to the next upon a Level Up usually achieved after passing a boss microgame Once the maximum level is reached sequential Level Up s will typically be replaced by Speed Up s an increase in BPM br Using the above The Legend of Zelda microgame as an example the first version of this microgame usually places Link very close to the cave entrance that he must enter The second version places the entrance further away and places an enemy that blocks Link and the last version places the entrance yet further and has a second enemy that shoots at Link from a lake br br br WarioWare characters br There are two major types of character in the WarioWare series The first are the WarioWare Inc developers who both create and host the microgames Each one has a unique theme or twist depending on the game For instance Jimmy T s microgames in Twisted are focused around large spins while in Touched his microgames involve rubbing objects with the stylus The second group of characters often show up within the introduction cutscenes the most notable being Fronk who hosts Pop Up microgames in Twisted and Gold and pops up in the most unlikely of places br br br Major characters br Volt Japanese Hepburn Faibuwatto lit Watt is Volt s mother and makes a few appearances in the WarioWare
