Popeye the Sailor is a fictional cartoon character created by Elzie Crisler Segar The character first appeared on January in the daily King Features comic strip Thimble Theatre The strip was in its tenth year when Popeye made his debut but the one eyed sailor quickly became the lead character and Thimble Theatre became one of King Features most popular properties during the s Following Segar s death in Thimble Theatre later renamed Popeye was continued by several writers and artists most notably Segar s assistant Bud Sagendorf The strip continues to appear in first run installments on Sundays written and drawn by R K Milholland The daily strips are reprints of old Sagendorf stories br In Max Fleischer adapted the Thimble Theatre characters into a series of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoon shorts for Paramount Pictures These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the s and Fleischer Studios which later became Paramount s own Famous Studios continued production through Cartoons produced during World War II included Allied propaganda as was common among cartoons of the time These cartoon shorts are now owned by Turner Entertainment and distributed by its sister company Warner Bros br Over the years Popeye has also appeared in comic books television cartoons video games hundreds of advertisements peripheral products ranging from spinach to candy cigarettes and the live action film directed by Robert Altman and starring Robin Williams as Popeye br Charles M Schulz said I think Popeye was a perfect comic strip consistent in drawing and humor In TV Guide ranked Popeye number on its Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time list br br br Fictional character and story br Popeye s story and characterization vary depending on the medium In his debut storyline Popeye s superhumanly proportioned strength and endurance stemmed from the luck he acquired by rubbing the feathers of the head of Bernice a whiffle hen thus enabling him to survive fifteen gunshot wounds By the end of however Popeye s strength had become a regularized fixture of his character with spinach by becoming the primary repository of his prowess Swee Pea is Popeye s ward in the comic strips but his custody is inconsistent in cartoons br There is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories although certain plot and presentation elements remain mostly constant including purposeful contradictions in Popeye s capabilities Popeye seems bereft of manners and uneducated yet he often comes up with solutions to problems that seem insurmountable to the police or the scientific community He has displayed Sherlock Holmes like investigative prowess scientific ingenuity and successful diplomatic arguments In the animated cartoons his pipe also proves to be highly versatile Among other things it has served as a cutting torch jet engine propeller periscope musical instrument and a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot He also eats spinach through his pipe sometimes sucking in the can along with the contents Since the s Popeye is seldom depicted using his pipe to smoke tobacco br Popeye s exploits are also enhanced by a few recurring plot elements One is the love triangle among Popeye Olive Oyl and Bluto sometimes called Brutus and Bluto s endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye s expense Another is his near saintly perseverance in overcoming any obstacle to please Olive who often if temporarily renounces Popeye for Bluto br br br Thimble Theatre and Popeye comic strips br br Segar s Thimble Theatre debuted in the New York Journal on December The paper s owner William Randolph Hearst also owned King Features Syndicate which syndicated the strip Thimble Theatre was intended as a replacement for Midget Movies by Ed Wheelan Wheelan having recently resigned from King Features While initially failing to attract a large audience the strip nonetheless increasingly accumulated a modest following as the s continued At the end of its first decade the strip resultantly appeared in over a dozen newspapers and had acquired a corresponding Sunday strip which had debuted on January within the Hearst owned New York American paper br br Thimble Theatre s first main characters were the lanky long nosed slacker Harold Hamgravy rapidly shortened to simply Ham Gravy and his scrappy headstrong girlfriend Olive Oyl In its earliest weeks the strip featured the duo alongside a rotating cast of primarily one shot characters acting out various stories and scenarios in a parodic theatrical style hence the strip s name As its first year progressed however numerous elements of this premise would be relinquished including the recurring character Willie Wormwood introduced as a parody of melodrama villainy soon rendering the strip a series of episodic comic anecdotes depicting the daily life and dysfunctional romantic exploits of Ham Gravy and Olive Oyl It could be classified as a gag a day comic during this period br In mid Segar began to increasingly engage in lengthier often months long storylines by the end of the following year the strip had effectively changed fully into a comedy adventure style focusing on Ham Olive and Olive s ambitious but myopic diminutive brother Castor Oyl initially a minor character yet arguably the protagonist of the strip by Castor and Olive s parents Cole and Nana Oyl also made frequent appearances beginning in the mid s By the late s the strip had likewise acquired a number of notable characters beyond the sphere of Ham Gravy and the Oyl family including Castor Oyl s wife Cylinda to whom he was married from to her wealthy misanthropic father Mr Lotts and Castor s fighting cockerel Blizzard all of whom had exited the strip by the close of although Cylinda would eventually maritally reunite with Castor under R K Milholland s authorship almost a century later br Popeye first appeared in the strip on January as a minor character He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham Gravy to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the head feathers of Bernice the Whiffle Hen Weeks later on the trip back Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork an undercover stooge of Fadewell s but survived by rubbing Bernice s head After the adventure s conclusion in June Popeye left the strip but owing to reader reaction he was brought back after an absence of only five weeks br Ultimately the Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role by the following year and the strip was taken up by many more newspapers as a result Initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye but she eventually left Ham to become Popeye s girlfriend in March precipitating Ham s exit as a regular weeks later Over the years however she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor Initially Castor Oyl continued to come up with get rich quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures By the end of however he settled down as a detective and later on bought a ranch out west Castor s appearances have resultantly become sparser over time As Castor faded from the strip J Wellington Wimpy a soft spoken and eloquent yet cowardly hamburger loving moocher who would gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today was introduced into the Sunday strip in which he became a fixture by late After first appearing in the daily strip in March Wimpy became a full time major character alongside Popeye and Olive br Thimble Theatre was renamed Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye in It was eventually renamed simply Popeye the name under which the strip continues to run br In July Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail whom he adopted and named Swee Pea Other regular characters introduced into the strip following its retool in were George W Geezil an irascible cobbler who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy Rough House the temperamental owner of a budget diner who served as a long suffering foil to Wimpy Eugene the Jeep a yellow vaguely doglike animal from Africa with magical powers the Sea Hag a terrible pirate and the last witch on Earth Alice the Goon a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag s henchwoman and continued as Swee Pea s babysitter the hapless perpetually anxious King Blozo Blozo s unintelligent lackey Oscar Popeye s lecherous scheming father Poopdeck Pappy and Toar an ageless dim witted caveman br Segar s strip was quite different from the theatrical cartoons that followed The stories were more complex often spanning months or even years with a heavier emphasis on verbal comedy and many characters that never appeared in the cartoons among them King Blozo Toar and Rough House Spinach usage a trait introduced in July was comparatively infrequent and Bluto appeared in only one story arc Segar signed some of his early Popeye comic strips with a cigar his last name being a homophone of cigar pronounced SEE gar Comics historian Brian Walker stated Segar offered up a masterful blend of comedy fantasy satire and suspense in Thimble Theater Starring Popeye br Owing to Popeye s increasingly high profile Thimble Theatre became one of King Features most popular strips during the s A poll of adult comic strip readers in the April issue of Fortune magazine voted Popeye their second favorite comic strip after Little Orphan Annie By Thimble Theatre was running in newspapers and over licensed Popeye products were on sale The success of the strip meant Segar was earning a year at the time of his death The strip continued after Segar s death in under a succession of artists and writers Following an eventual name change to Popeye in the s and the cancellation of the daily strip in in favor of reprints the comic now solely a Sunday strip remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today br br br Toppers br Thimble Theatre had a number of topper strips on the Sunday page during its run the main topper Sappo ran for years from February to May Sappo was a revival of an earlier Segar daily strip called The Five Fifteen aka Sappo the Commuter which ran from December to February For seven weeks in Segar replaced Sappo with Pete and Pansy For Kids Only Sept Nov br There were also a series of topper panel strips that ran next to Sappo Segar drew one of them Popeye s Cartoon Club April May The rest were produced by Joe Musial and Bud Sagendorf Wiggle Line Movie September November Wimpy s Zoo s Who November December Play Store December July Popeye s Army and Navy July September Pinup Jeep September April and Me Life by Popeye April br br br Artists after Segar br br Following Segar s illness and eventual death in with his final Thimble Theatre strip appearing October of that year numerous people were hired to draw and write the strip Tom Sims the son of a Coosa River channel boat captain acted as the writer for Thimble Theatre beginning in August and established the Popeye the Sailorman spin off Doc Winner who had previously filled in for Segar between January and May initially acted as Sims artist with Bela Zaboly succeeding him by December In Sims relinquished writing duties on the daily strip to Ralph Stein who would continue to collaborate with Zaboly until both the daily and Sunday strips were taken over by Bud Sagendorf in br Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until and continued to write and draw the Sunday strip until his death in Sagendorf who had been Segar s assistant made a definite effort to retain much of Segar s classic style although his art is instantly discernible Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years especially O G Wotasnozzle and King Blozo Sagendorf s new characters such as the Thung also had a very Segar like quality What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar it sometimes took an entire week of Sagendorf s daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount br From to the daily strip was written and drawn by Bobby London who after some controversy was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize abortion London s strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations but kept the spirit of Segar s original One classic storyline titled The Return of Bluto showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip comic books and animated films The Sunday edition of the comic strip was drawn by Hy Eisman from to Following Eisman s retirement the Sunday strip was taken over by R K Milholland who had previously contributed Popeye cartoons to the web only feature Popeye s Cartoon Club in and The daily strip has featured reruns of Sagendorf s strips since London s firing br On January years since the death of his creator Segar s comic strips though not the various films TV shows theme music and other media based on them became public domain in most countries but remain under copyright in the United States Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Thimble Theatre strip it is treated

comic books from Dell Comics King Comics Gold Key Comics Charlton Comics and others originally written and illustrated by Bud Sagendorf In the Dell comics Popeye became something of a crimefighter thwarting evil organizations and Bluto s criminal activities The new villains included the numerous Misermite dwarfs who were all identical br Popeye appeared in the British TV Comic becoming the cover story in with stories written and drawn by Chick Henderson Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye s only nemesis throughout the entire run br A variety of artists have created Popeye comic book stories since then for example George Wildman drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from until the late s The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by Bill Pearson with some issues written by Nick Cuti br Popeye also had his own manga series published by Sh nen Gah sha written and drawn by Robotan and Marude Dameo creator Kenji Morita which ran from to br In Ocean Comics released the Popeye Special written by Ron Fortier with art by Ben Dunn The story presented Popeye s origin story including his given name of Ugly Kidd and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover A second issue by the same creative team followed in The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person an idea also used in the comic strip on December and April In to celebrate Popeye s th anniversary Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one shot comic book The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl written by Peter David The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship However this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published br In writer Roger Langridge teamed with cartoonists Bruce Ozella Ken Wheaton and Tom Neely among others to revive the spirit of Segar in a issue comic book miniseries published by IDW Publishing Critic PS Hayes in reviewing the series stated br br Langridge writes a story with a lot of dialogue compared to your average comic book and it s all necessary funny and entertaining Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye Not only Popeye but Popeye s whole world Everything looks like it should cartoony and goofy Plus he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn t really need it You ll swear that you re looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye only it s better Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog the panels never look cramped at all br In late IDW began reprinting the original s s Sagendorf Popeye comic books under the title of Classic Popeye br In November the publication of a new manga inspired series called Eye Lie Popeye by Marcus Williams was announced the series will be published in by Massive Publishing br br br Webcomics br In January in celebration of its years of character King Feature Syndicate launched the webcomic Popeye s Cartoon Club In a series of Sunday format comics a wide assortment of artists depicted the characters in their own styles in one comic each including Alex Hallatt Erica Henderson Tom Neely Roger Langridge Larry deSouza Robert Sikoryak Jeffrey Brown Jim Engel Liniers Jay Fosgitt Carol Lay and Randy Milholland At the end of the year Milholland s Cartoon Club comic was declared the number one comic of the year on King Features website Comics Kingdom br From February through April Cartoon Club ran an additional five comics by Milholland which was followed by an extended run from May through July making Milholland the first person to write a daily update Popeye comic for King Features since br In August a new twice weekly Tuesdays and Thursdays webcomic titled Olive Popeye debuted Milholland writes and draws the Thursday strips which focus on Popeye and his extended family while Tuesday strips focus on Olive and her own adventures These were initially drawn by Shadia Amin who was later replaced by Emi Burdge in October The two storylines run in parallel and occasionally intersect br br br Theatrical animated cartoons br br In November King Features signed an agreement with Fleischer Studios to have Popeye and the other Thimble Theatre characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons released by Paramount Pictures The first cartoon in the series was released in and Popeye cartoons remained a staple of Paramount s release schedule for nearly years William Costello was the original voice of Popeye a voice that was replicated by later performers such as Jack Mercer and even Mae Questel Many of the Thimble Theatre characters including Wimpy Poopdeck Pappy and Eugene the Jeep eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons though Olive Oyl s extended family and Ham Gravy were absent Thanks to the animated short series Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips and by polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood s most popular cartoon character br Although Segar may have used spinach as a prop a few times it was Max Fleischer who realized its potential as a trademark In almost every Popeye cartoon the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation upon which usually after a beating a can of spinach becomes available and Popeye quickly opens the can and consumes its contents Upon swallowing the spinach Popeye s physical strength immediately becomes superhuman and he is easily able to save the day and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation It did not stop there as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed as in The Man on the Flying Trapeze where it gave him acrobatic skills This cartoon incidentally was the only appearance of Olive Oyl s mother Nana br br In May Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio which they renamed Famous Studios The early Famous era shorts were often World War II themed featuring Popeye fighting Nazi Germans and Japanese soldiers most notably the short You re a Sap Mr Jap In late the Popeye series began to be produced in Technicolor beginning with Her Honor the Mare Famous Paramount continued producing the Popeye series until with Spooky Swabs being the last of the Famous shorts in the series Paramount then sold the Popeye film catalog to Associated Artists Productions which was bought out by United Artists in Through various mergers the rights are currently controlled by Warner Bros Discovery br In Cartoon Network under the supervision of animation historian Jerry Beck created a new incarnation of The Popeye Show The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios Popeye shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits taken or recreated from various sources onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon or in some cases in their complete uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front and end Paramount credits The series aired Popeye shorts over episodes until March The Popeye Show continued to air on Cartoon Network s spin off network Boomerang br While many of the Paramount Popeye cartoons remained unavailable on video a handful of those cartoons had fallen into public domain and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than years King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the s made for television Popeye the Sailor cartoons to which it retained the rights in In the meantime home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from CBS Fox Video to MGM UA Home Video in and eventually to Warner Home Video in In Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the Popeye cartoons produced for theatrical release between and on DVD restored and uncut Three volumes were released between and covering all of the black and white cartoons produced from to In December a fourth volume featuring the first color shorts from to was released on DVD and Blu ray from Warner Home Video through the Warner Archive Collection br br br Original television cartoons br In King Features Syndicate commissioned a new series of cartoons titled Popeye the Sailor but this time for television syndication Al Brodax served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features Jack Mercer Mae Questel and Jackson Beck returned for this series which was produced by a number of companies including Jack Kinney Productions Rembrandt Films Larry Harmon Productions Halas and Batchelor and Paramount Cartoon Studios formerly Famous Studios The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets and cartoons were produced in only two years with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of and the last of them debuting during the television season For these cartoons Bluto s name was changed to Brutus as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name Bluto Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag Since King Features has exclusive rights to these Popeye cartoons they have been released on home video with of them included in a th anniversary Popeye DVD boxed set in br Popeye Olive Oyl Swee Pea and Wimpy were featured prominently in the cartoon movie Popeye Meets the Man Who Hated Laughter which debuted on October as one of the episodes of The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie In this cartoon Brutus also appears as a turban wearing employee of the nemesis Dr Morbid Grimsby br On September The All New Popeye Hour debuted on the CBS Saturday morning lineup It was an hour long animated series produced by Hanna Barbera Productions which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts Mercer continued to voice Popeye while Marilyn Schreffler and Allan Melvin became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto respectively The All New Popeye Hour ran on CBS until September when it was cut to a half hour and retitled The Popeye and Olive Comedy Show It was removed from the CBS lineup in September the year before Jack Mercer s death These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD br During the time these cartoons were in production CBS aired The Popeye Valentine s Day Special Sweethearts at Sea on February br Popeye briefly returned to CBS in for Popeye and Son another Hanna Barbera series which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr who hates the taste of spinach but eats it to boost his strength Maurice LaMarche performed Popeye s voice as Mercer had died in The show lasted for one season USA Network later picked up reruns of the series after CBS s cancellation Additionally the series aired on The Family Channel from until br In Lionsgate produced an animated television special Popeye s Voyage The Quest for Pappy to coincide with the th anniversary of Popeye Billy West performed the voice of Popeye describing the production as the hardest job I ever did ever and the voice of Popeye as like a buzzsaw on your throat The uncut version was released on DVD on November and was aired in a re edited version on Fox on December and again on December Its style was influenced by the s Fleischer cartoons and featured Swee Pea Wimpy Bluto Olive Oyl Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters On November Lionsgate re released Popeye s Voyage on DVD with redesigned cover art br br br Web series br On December a Popeye web series named Popeye s Island Adventures produced by WildBrain subsidiary WildBrain Spark Studios premiered on the official Popeye YouTube channel With intent on drawing in a younger contemporary international audience the new series has updated the Popeye characters to fit the times For instance Popeye grows his own spinach and has replaced his corncob pipe with a bosun s whistle Bluto no longer sports a beard and focuses his time on stealing Popeye s spinach rather than his girlfriend Olive Oyl is shown as an inventor and engineer The characters are drawn to appear younger than

married His gravestone has an image of Popeye engraved on it Segar regularly sent money to Fiegel as a thank you for the inspiration according to Segar s assistant and successor Bud Sagendorf and Popeye historian Michael Brooks br Additional hometown residents of Chester have inspired other Segar characters including Dora Paskel an uncommonly tall angular lady who ran a general store in town and was the origin for Popeye s gal Olive Oyl She even wore a hair bun close to her neckline William Windy Bill Schuchert a rather rotund man who owned the local opera house and was Segar s early

around the Popeye was performed by shuffling and moving one s arms placing one arm behind and one arm in front and alternating them going through the motion of raising a pipe up to the mouth and alternate sliding or pushing one foot back in the manner of ice skating similar to motions exhibited by the cartoon character According to music historian Robert Pruter the Popeye was even more popular than the Twist in New Orleans The dance was associated with and or referenced to in several songs including Eddie Bo s Check Mr Popeye Chris Kenner s Something You Got and Land of a Thousand Dances Chubby Checker s Popeye The Hitchhiker Frankie Ford s You Talk Too Much Ernie K Doe s Popeye Joe Huey Piano Smith s Popeye The Sherrys Pop Pop Pop Pie and Harvey Fuqua s Any Way You Wanta A compilation of Popeye dance songs was released in under the title New Orleans Popeye Party br br br Spinach br Initially Popeye s chief superhuman characteristic was his indestructibility rather than super strength which was attributed to his having rubbed the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen numerous times after being shot Popeye later attributed his strength to spinach The popularity of Popeye helped boost spinach sales Using Popeye as a role model for healthier eating may work a study revealed that children increased their vegetable consumption after watching Popeye cartoons The spinach growing community of Crystal City Texas erected a statue of the character in recognition of Popeye s positive effects on the spinach industry There are also statues in Springdale and Alma Arkansas which claims to be The Spinach Capital of the World at canning plants of Allen Canning which markets Popeye branded canned spinach In addition to Allen Canning s Popeye spinach Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package In when spinach contaminated with E coli was accidentally sold to the public many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons br A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer s choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content In the story a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an measurement of spinach s iron content leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been The error was not a slipped decimal point but a measurement error that was corrected in the s however the myth of extraordinarily high iron content persisted br br br Word coinages br The strip is also responsible for popularizing although not
