Crazy Kong Kureij Kongu is an arcade game developed by Falcon released in and similar to Nintendo s Donkey Kong Although commonly believed to be a bootleg version it was officially licensed for operation only in Japan when Nintendo couldn t keep up with domestic demand even though Donkey Kong was still released there and is based on different hardware It retains all the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong but its graphics were redrawn and re colorized Falcon breached their contract by exporting the cabinets overseas leading Nintendo to revoke the license in January Like the original game Crazy Kong had bootleg versions under such titles as Congorilla Big Kong Donkey King and Monkey Donkey br There are two versions of the original Crazy Kong and Crazy Kong Part II The differences between them are in minor cinematic artifacts and bugs color palette choices and minor gameplay differences the first part then shows no copyright or company name on the title screen Both run on modified Crazy Climber hardware there are other versions that run on Scramble Jeutel Orca and Alca hardware The official Crazy Kong came in two stand up cabinets featuring a large and angry rather than comic ape they were manufactured by Zaccaria also Italian distributor of the game br br br Differences from Donkey Kong br The game s title screen shows the text Crazy Kong written in girders dependent upon which version is running There is no copyright or graphic of Kong on the main screen just the year The girder text does not flash different colours for a few seconds before stopping as in Donkey Kong br The color palette is almost completely different Most of the girders have been switched from magenta purple to neon green including those on the title screen br Some graphics were redrawn While the Donkey Kong character looks almost the same from side view his frontal appearance is noticeably different when he opens his mouth he is taller and fiercer looking br Many animations are removed For example in the classic first level barrels appear from Crazy Kong as opposed to showing the rolling animations Kong is locked in the horizontal roll animation but does not reach for the other barrels or move when rolling barrels vertically Frames of animation are also removed at the beginning and ending of each level br The sound effects are altered and generally cruder The background humming music is removed sans the Scramble hardware release and Mario makes a digital sample hi yah sound when jumping A lot of the in game sounds such as Kong s chest beating can also be found in the game Crazy Climber on those versions that run on its proprietary hardware br Some aspects of the game are considered more difficult than Donkey Kong as the collision detection is less forgiving and certain elements of the game move faster br The first level can be completed with the following cheat Climb up the ladder at the far right of the bottom platform Make sure Mario s back is facing you while tapping the joystick until his right foot is hanging over the ledge Jump off the platform If done correctly he drops through the floor below and the level is completed br The ghost like flames at the m mark the rivet level are replaced with the oil fire enemies that inhabit the other levels br After completing the m mark the heart that normally exists between Mario and Pauline is positioned near the round indicator br When entering a high score any of the available characters that is not used is replaced with a dash br Mario wears the brown and muddy red colors similar to those in the original Super Mario Bros except in the m level where he appears in a corrupted orange and green palette br All of the game s sounds are taken from Crazy Climber br On the m level it is possible to touch and walk past Crazy Kong without losing a life br On the m level Mario can farm points by standing by the pole supporting Pauline facing Kong and jumping while tapping the opposite direction in mid air br The hammer can be dropped by wiggling the joystick back and forth rapidly If this is done on the conveyor belt the invisible hammer will continue to hit objects and rack up points br br br Differences in Crazy Kong Part II br During attract mode a scene is shown where Crazy Kong is breaking out of a cage along with a rudimentary one channel audio tune br Most of the steel girders have been switched from a magenta purple color to an orange red color including the title screen br After completing the m mark the text GIVE UP appears br During round and on when L gaps appear in the girders of the m mark the sloped level br In the m level some slopes are cut off so that they no longer go downward past the ladder br Unlike Crazy Kong Mario has accurate traditional colors br br br Legacy br As Nintendo released Donkey Kong Jr a Donkey Kong sequel Falcon developed and published a cloned sequel as well entitled Crazy Kong Jr also known as Crazy Junior but unlike the previous one it was unlicensed by both Nintendo and Nintendo of America br br br br br br External links br Crazy Kong at the Killer List of Videogames
