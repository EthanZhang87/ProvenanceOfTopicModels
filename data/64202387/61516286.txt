The Piranha Plant known as Pakkun Flower Pakkun Furaw in Japan is a fictional plant species from Nintendo s Mario franchise media It usually appears as a leafy green stalk topped with a white spotted red or green globe with a maw lined with sharp teeth reminiscent of piranhas Piranha Plants are typically portrayed as tethered enemies which emerge from green coloured warp pipes scattered throughout the game world that player characters must evade or overcome though multiple subspecies with different abilities as well as physical attributes have appeared in various titles some may simply stick up from the ground and in some cases even walk freely on its own roots br Regarded as one of the most iconic recurring elements or motifs of Mario franchise media the Piranha Plant has appeared in nearly every video game title in the franchise since s Super Mario Bros as well as numerous appearances outside of it Most notably it has been adapted as a fully mobile playable character which is made available through downloadable content DLC for the crossover fighting game Super Smash Bros Ultimate developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd This iteration of the character has been met with a generally positive reception br br br Development br The Piranha Plant s Japanese name Pakkun Flower is derived from paku paku an onomatopoeic Japanese word for mouth movements made when eating First appearing in s Super Mario Bros Piranha Plants are originally depicted as stationary carnivorous plants confined to green warp pipes bristling out of the game world lying in wait for prey to come within range like a Venus flytrap Within the context of video game design the Piranha Plant is a low risk hazard that is tied to a single location within the game world akin to a trap The purpose behind its design is to create platforms which are temporarily safe and sometimes dangerous occupying a role between an environmental challenge and an enemy challenge for the player character br The Piranha Plant s maw pointed upwards and full of sharp teeth serves as an important visual cue for the player not to let their character touch it from above which shapes the player s expectations for the remainder of the game as part of its ongoing visual vocabulary Later titles subvert the notion that player characters cannot come into physical contact with a Piranha Plant without being harmed in Super Mario for example players could safely dispatch a Piranha Plant by having Mario execute a stomp attack on it while airborne In Super Mario D World players could pick up Piranha Plants which grow on pots by holding the run button which allows them to be weaponized against opponents br Super Smash Bros Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai chose the Piranha Plant as a post release addition because he considered it to be a very well known character and felt that making it a complimentary early purchase bonus as part of a limited time offer would be an effective promotional effort While Sakurai acknowledged that the Piranha Plant is an example of a playable character that lies outside of players typical expectations he emphasized that having a good balance is prioritized over the element of
