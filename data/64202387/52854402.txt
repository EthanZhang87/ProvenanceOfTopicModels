games br br br Gameplay br br Super Mario Odyssey is a platform game in which players control Mario as he travels across many different worlds known as Kingdoms within the game on the hat shaped ship Odyssey to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser who plans to forcibly marry her The Kingdoms in the game return to the exploration based level design featured in Super Mario Each Kingdom has Mario searching for and clearing various objectives in order to obtain items known as Power Moons which are the power source of the Odyssey and grant access to new Kingdoms Checkpoint flags littered throughout each Kingdom allow Mario to instantly warp to them once activated Certain levels feature areas called flat zones where Mario is placed in a D side scrolling environment similar to his appearance in the original Super Mario Bros br In addition to his pre existing moves like triple jumping and wall jumping Mario can throw his cap the physical form of a hat spirit named Cappy in multiple directions to attack enemies and use as a temporary platform When the cap is thrown at certain objects enemies or non playable characters Mario is able to take possession of them referred to as capturing allowing him to use unique abilities For example Mario can capture a Bullet Bill to fly across large gaps a Tyrannosaurus to trample things a bolt of electricity called a Spark Pylon to climb up electric wires and a tank called a Sherm to fire at enemies and break blocks for passage Some actions can be accelerated by using motion controls in the Joy Con controllers but the game is otherwise fully playable with the Joy Con attached to the console Throughout the game Mario can pick up coins which come in two types regular gold coins and purple ones unique to each kingdom to spend on items such as new hats and outfits some of which are required for completing certain objectives The game uses a health system similar to the Super Mario Galaxy games although Mario has unlimited lives the only penalty for dying is paying up to ten coins The player can also collect items known as Life Up Hearts which grant three extra hit points The game also features cooperative play in which a second player takes control of Cappy and can move more independently of Mario br The game requires a minimum number of Power Moons to be collected from each Kingdom to move onto the next though these may be obtained from any source making major objectives largely optional Once Bowser is defeated each kingdom is repopulated with more Power Moons to collect Collecting enough Power Moons allows for additional outfits to be purchased and unlocks two bonus levels One of these levels is a boss rush called Dark Side with Power Moons required to enter The other is a platforming gauntlet called Darker Side that combines many elements of the game and requires Power Moons to enter In addition to this there is also a level based on Peach s Castle from Super Mario unlocked by beating the game This level allows Mario to face harder versions of previously defeated bosses and earn additional Power Moons by completing in game achievements br The game features a photo mode that allows players to use a free moving camera to take and save screenshots with additional options such as filters and stickers Use of the Odyssey themed Mario Peach and Bowser Amiibo figurines allow for special in game abilities and unlocking special costumes which are otherwise unavailable until after the player completes the game and collects enough Power Moons Other Amiibo can be scanned to provide hints to finding Power Moons br A hide and seek minigame called Luigi s Balloon World was released as part of an update on February In it players have seconds to hide a balloon somewhere in a kingdom which is then able to be played by others attempting to find it A leaderboard system ranks the players who have found the most balloons br The game was updated in to be compatible with the Nintendo Labo virtual reality kit In this mode Mario must complete challenges in a number of Kingdoms to recruit musicians and give them instruments by completing tasks related to musical notes br br br Plot br Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach from the Mushroom Kingdom and takes her aboard his airship intent on forcibly marrying her Mario also aboard attempts to rescue her but is knocked off the ship by Bowser s hat after a brief fight and falls into the neighboring Cap Kingdom With Mario gone Bowser stomps on Mario s cap and lets it drift into the ship s rear propellers shredding it to pieces A piece of the hat is grabbed by Cappy one of the Cap Kingdom s sentient hat like creatures called Bonneters The two meet and he explains to Mario that Bowser also kidnapped his sister Tiara to be used as Peach s wedding tiara Cappy joins Mario and takes the shape of Mario s cap providing him with the ability to throw his cap and temporarily control or capture other creatures and objects and utilize their abilities They travel to the nearby Cascade Kingdom recover an airship called the Odyssey and begin hunting Bowser down br Mario and Cappy explore the various kingdoms to collect Power Moons to fuel the Odyssey and battle the Broodals a team of anthropomorphic rabbit wedding planners hired by Bowser who steal items including a dress a cake and a bouquet from different kingdoms to set up Bowser s wedding Eventually they catch up to Bowser in his own kingdom however Bowser subsequently departs for his wedding on the Moon and leaves the two to fight the Broodals in their Mecha Broodal They defeat the Mecha Broodal and follow Bowser to the Moon br Mario and Cappy fly the Odyssey to the Moon s surface and confront Bowser inside a cathedral After Mario falls through a trapdoor set up by Bowser the two battle in the Moon s interior where Bowser is defeated and Mario frees Peach and Tiara however the cavern quickly begins to collapse Upon landing deeper in the moon Mario takes control of an unconscious Bowser using Cappy and escapes to the surface with Peach and Tiara Back on the surface Mario prepares to propose to Peach but Bowser regains consciousness and proposes as well The two fight over her hand in marriage before an overwhelmed Peach demands they stop and she boards the Odyssey with Cappy and Tiara The rivals are both heartbroken until Peach tells Mario to come home with her Mario boards the ship just in time leaving Bowser stranded on the moon br In the post game Mario and Cappy collect more Power Moons that were released from Moon rocks to traverse other parts of the Moon known as Dark Side and Darker Side to complete other challenges Meanwhile Peach and Tiara travel the world on their own terms and meet up with Mario along the way giving him Power Moons each time they meet br br br Development br br Super Mario Odyssey was developed by Nintendo s Entertainment Planning Development division with additional assistance from Up Studio The game was produced by Yoshiaki Koizumi and Koichi Hayashida the same producers behind Super Mario D World and directed by Kenta Motokura Shigeru Miyamoto reassumed his role of what he calls the Creative Fellow and the developers gave him concepts and he gave feedback in return According to Koizumi Miyamoto left us to our own devices quite a lot br Odyssey was designed to appeal somewhat more to Mario s core audience a departure from the series then recent focus on casual players the game focuses more on dense open world exploration rather than the linear gameplay recent Mario games have taken following instead the format of games such as Super Mario or Super Mario Sunshine br According to Miyamoto after Super Mario Galaxy and D World linear gameplay was focused on less and the game would go back to the roots to Mario Sunshine The game did intend to have camera control that was much easier to use than Sunshine however The first concept that came to be for Odyssey involved Koizumi using motion controls he pictured motion actions that the Joy Con controllers could be used for and the most natural fit was throwing an object To create a sense of connection to this gimmick Mario s own hat was the object chosen to be thrown br br br Design br In an interview with Koizumi he stated that every core gameplay concept was decided on very early into the game s development cycle with the philosophy of creating an entirely new experience for the series these ideas consisted of traveling between kingdoms collecting Power Moons and other settings Cappy was also created in the first prototype and motion controls were built off of this Another goal was keeping the game running at frames per second Certain locations such as New Donk City contained realistic looks and humans this design choice was to emphasize the feeling of a new location that is different from the normal br One of the main aspects considered was the Switch s capabilities of portability and TV docking which affected how the game could be played Motion controls were also implemented being able to use the two controllers in each hand The developers were careful in making sure the game was fun to play in these distinct ways To bridge the two the game was balanced to allow gameplay in short bursts or long sessions to satisfy both fields Kenta Motokura mentioned at an interview at E that the game was made possible to play in these two ways the player has the choice of either following a set storyline or can find power moons simply by exploring They also made sure each platforming stage had numerous ways of completion br A game the designers considered when designing Odyssey was the sandbox video game Minecraft They initially believed a game that had camera movement would be difficult for children but they later passed this as sufficient due to Minecraft s popularity and excessive use of camera control br br br Setting and characters br br The developers constructed prototypes of gameplay gimmicks or platforming stages first from there they would discuss what kind of setting or theme the prototype would best fit within and the locations would be constructed second Thirdly the locations would be taken and more ideas were designed specifically for them The game s locations were built around the themes of journey and surprise according to Kenta Motokura The kingdoms have purchasable souvenirs to help make them more relatable and easier to connect to Since the kingdoms were also open world areas the developers filled them with diversity and small details to give them a sense of empathy by making the player feel connected to them Each kingdom was based on personal experiences from the designers and they built off these locations by experimenting with how Mario could interact with them The ability to take in game screenshots was also considered by the team to be a natural fit br br Cappy was created into a character a little later after the hat throwing mechanic was introduced because the developers wanted a buddy to travel alongside Mario The developers prioritized the city environment when selecting which environments to represent in Odyssey They wanted a familiar aspect from the series to anchor players in the novel setting and so chose Pauline a character who first appeared alongside Mario in Donkey Kong to be the mayor of New Donk City br br br Music br While doing character work for Pauline they gave her an interest in jazz music This led her to becoming a singer with the inclusion of the song Jump Up Super Star Super Mario Run had previously featured a track with vocals that was added in an update released one month prior to Odyssey A swing music inspired song Jump Up Super Star was composed by the game s lead composer Naoto Kubo with vocals by Kate Higgins The song s chorus was made simple to be memorable and easy to sing along to Lyrics were written in Japanese by Nobuyoshi Suzuki and translated to English by Rob Heiret Another theme song Break Free Lead the Way followed a similar process Other music was written by Shiho Fujii and series sound director Koji Kondo br A sampler album containing tracks from the game was released on iTunes in December A four disc soundtrack containing tracks was released in Japan in by Being Inc The soundtracks include English Japanese and instrumental versions of Jump Up Super Star and Break Free Lead the Way The discs also include commentary from some of the development staff br br br Release br br The game was teased via the Nintendo Switch console announcement trailer in in January during a Nintendo presentation Odyssey was formally announced to be in development and was followed shortly after with gameplay footage A section at E was themed around New Donk City and was filled with kiosks that allowed people to play a demo The announcement at E was the most popular part of the presentation on social media and was considered the best part of the show by other attending developers Critics also noted the game s density of secrets and noted the format of open world exploration br Two weeks before the game s release Nintendo uploaded a Broadway inspired promotional music video of Jump Up Super Star which featured live action dancers alongside a CGI animated character of Mario The song was released on the digital music storefront iTunes shortly after and became one of the top best sellers in the United States br The game officially released October alongside Amiibo of Mario Peach and Bowser in their respective wedding attire In addition a limited time Odyssey themed Nintendo Switch was released containing the console Joy Con reminiscent to the color of the character Cappy a Switch console carrying case and a Nintendo eShop digital download code for Odyssey Later that December Nintendo partnered with food manufacturing company Kellogg s to release a limited quantity breakfast cereal Super Mario Cereal in the United States The back of the box contains an NFC tag that can be scanned like an Amiibo toy which provides exclusive in game extras br br br Reception br br Super Mario Odyssey received universal acclaim according to the review aggregator Metacritic As of Metacritic ranks Odyssey as the joint third highest rated game of all time br Andrew Webster of The Verge thought that the structure of the game lent itself well to the portable nature of the Switch which players could play for either long sessions in order to follow the missions or in short bursts while collecting Power Moons which the author compared to the shrines or hidden mini dungeons which were scattered throughout Breath of the Wild Despite the praise Webster noted that the motion controls felt frustratingly imprecise preferring the accuracy of standard controls The ability for Mario to turn into his D Super Mario Bros form in certain segments was compared to the puzzles featured in The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds while VentureBeat noted the game s similarities to the Sonic the Hedgehog series br Edge praised the inventiveness of the game s new ideas and the risks Nintendo had taken to deviate from the established formula of Mario games which they believed had paid off They likened the game to Super Mario and called it the spiritual successor that had previously not yet been achieved The magazine also complimented the introduction of Cappy and the capturing mechanic which they called the most versatile ability in the Mario series to date and enjoyed how the ability allowed Nintendo to reinvent a number of their favorite gameplay activities Famitsu gave the game a score of the same as Super Mario and the highest score for a D Mario game since then Perfect scores were also awarded by IGN and GameSpot who both praised the game s originality br In contrast Ian Dallas the creator of What Remains of Edith Finch gave Super Mario Odyssey a lukewarm review He explained My problem with Super Mario Odyssey is that it s not actually satisfying to finish This is not to say it isn t worth playing it absolutely is I just don t think it s worth finishing Phil Hornshaw of Digital Trends gave the game stars saying that Mario s first turn on the Switch is fun but lacks the innovation and creativity of Nintendo s best Hornshaw also noted that the Controls and camera can be imprecise and frustrating br The song Jump Up Super Star debuted at number on the Billboard Japan Hot for the week of November In Japan the song reached No on the Japanese iTunes Store On the US iTunes Store the song debuted at in the All Genres category Kate Higgins performed Jump Up Super Star live at The Game Awards ceremony br br br Sales br Three days after release more than two million copies of the game were sold worldwide with

involving individuals with depression compared the effects of the video game the cognitive program and standard treatments including medication and psychotherapy over six weeks Participants playing the video game reported higher treatment motivation and showed notable improvements in depressive symptoms The study also assessed cognitive functions finding improvements in visuo spatial memory in both the video game and cognitive training groups but more selectively in the video game group Despite these positive results the study had limitations like participant awareness of the group assignment and a small sample size potentially affecting the results generalizability br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website
