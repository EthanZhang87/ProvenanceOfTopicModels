Waluigi is a character in the Mario franchise He plays the role of Luigi s arch rival and accompanies Wario in spin offs from the main Mario series often for the sake of causing mischief He was created by Camelot employee Fumihide Aoki and was voiced from to by Charles Martinet who described Waluigi as someone with a lot of self pity Waluigi s design is characterised by his tall stature thin

defining characteristics and minimal backstory Waluigi has attained a cult following especially helped through his use as an Internet meme Although he has never appeared in his own video game or any mainline Mario game critics have described him as one of Nintendo s mascots and a cult hero br br br Concept and creation br br Waluigi was created during the development of the game Mario Tennis to serve as the bitter rival to Luigi He was originally introduced as Wario s younger brother in the American version of the game His character design was created by Fumihide Aoki His name is a portmanteau of Luigi s name and the Japanese adjective warui meaning bad hence a bad Luigi br Waluigi was conceived as a sidekick for Wario to team up with in the doubles matches of Mario Tennis In an interview with Nintendo Dream Shugo Takahashi said that he initially asked Nintendo to create a new character but was given instruction to develop a character at Camelot The character s name was agreed from the beginning before his design was finalised Initially the idea was to change one letter to make him similar to Wario but Takahashi said that as a bad version of Luigi he was named Waluigi An early idea for the symbol on Waluigi s hat was a W but as this was the same as Wario it was changed to the letters W and L Y ichi Kotabe who supervised the character at Nintendo decided that this should be an upside down L as an inversion of Luigi just as the letter W in Wario is an upside down letter M for Mario Waluigi s appearance was designed to be lean to create a balanced team combination with the stoutness of Wario Camelot took inspiration from Boyacky and Tonzura from the Doronbo Gang in the Yatterman series His purple colouring was chosen to create a balance of colours alongside those of the other characters in the game and his moustache created in the shape of the letter L Takahashi said that Waluigi was characterised as the rival of Luigi with them having a similar relationship to Mario and Wario br Upon his debut in Mario Tennis Waluigi was voiced by Charles Martinet who continued to voice the character until stepping back from recording character voices in to take on a new role as Mario Ambassador at Nintendo br Waluigi s appearance in Super Mario Strikers gained attention for a celebratory taunt that became known as the Crotch chop The taunt involves the character thrusting his hips forward while gesturing towards his crotch Despite looking like the letter V Waluigi s chop using both hands was supposed to represent the W in his name The game s director Mike Inglehart said that the development team at Next Level Games wanted to make Waluigi a bit edgier than Wario and explore his character He thought that Waluigi s character was about blaming others whereas Wario was about self loathing Inglehart said that when it was presented to Nintendo nobody batted an eye so he was surprised that the taunt was allowed to remain in the game without question br br br Characteristics br br Waluigi is portrayed as a mischievous villain and an exaggerated mirror version of Luigi He bears a large pink nose and crooked moustache His stature is tall and his frame thin and lanky He is the rival of Luigi and is the same age His Super Smash Bros Melee trophy describes him as hardworking by stating that he spends his time training and perfecting his skills in order to antagonise the Mario brothers Although he has a scrawny physique Waluigi is technically skilled and athletic but sometimes cheats in game His design comprises black overalls a purple long sleeved shirt a purple hat with a yellow symbol an inverted L paralleling Wario s W as an upside down M br Martinet stated that the cornerstone of Waluigi s personality is one of self pity a character who feels that everything goes right for everyone but himself Waluigi was created to be the tennis partner of Wario in Mario Tennis and early material from Nintendo of Europe portrayed them as brothers but their relationship has since been ambiguous When asked whether Waluigi was a brother to Wario in Martinet stated that while he did not know he felt that they were just two nice evil guys who found each other br Despite having appeared in more than video games Waluigi has been provided with little backstory and has few defining traits other than the need to be liked an
