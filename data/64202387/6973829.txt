Xbox One br br br Development br Conker was introduced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in The game Conker s Quest was presented by Rare as a D platformer aimed at a young audience for the Nintendo Later the same year Conker s inclusion in Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo was confirmed In early Conker s Quest was renamed Twelve Tales Conker In Conker made his first solo debut in Conker s Pocket Tales for the Game Boy Color br During development of the Conker series Rareware had struggled to release Twelve Tales Conker formerly named Conker s Quest citing issues with project management in addition to oversaturation of Mario style games in the gaming market at the time Realizing that Conker lacked any uniqueness as a platform game they cancelled Conker and restarted the project Multiple delays and a lack of updates led the press to believe that Twelve Tales was quietly cancelled br In Twelve Tales Conker was retooled into Conker s Bad Fur Day with a large amount of scatological humour Conker the Squirrel who previously appeared as a family friendly character was retooled to be a foul mouthed fourth wall breaking alcoholic armed with guns throwing knives and a frying pan After E Chris Seavor came on board as designer The first level the beehive added machine guns shooting wasps which Rare found funny and kept going with this idea to be raunchy and different After two more years of development the game emerged as Conker s Bad Fur Day which targets adults rather than children with its mature content According to Rare co founder Chris Stamper When people grow up on games they don t stop playing There aren t games for people who grew up on the early systems The game suffered from relatively poor sales but received a cult following br After the release of Conker s Bad Fur Day Rare began development of a new Conker game referred to as Conker s Other Bad Day Designer Chris Seavor said that it was to be a direct sequel dealing with Conker s somewhat unsuccessful tenure as King He spends all the treasury money on beer parties and hookers Thrown into prison Conker is faced with the prospect of execution and the game starts with his escape ball and chain attached from the Castle s highest tower It was never confirmed which console Conker s Other Bad Day was for but it was likely the Nintendo GameCube as with Donkey Kong Racing In Microsoft purchased Rare from Nintendo so instead of finishing and releasing the game Rare remade Conker s Bad Fur Day for the Xbox in renaming it Conker Live Reloaded It features improved graphics and minor alterations to gameplay and was also censored It has a new multiplayer adaptation for Xbox Live After Live Reloaded Rare started development on Conker Gettin Medieval an online multiplayer third person shooter game but it was ultimately cancelled br At E Conker was announced as a character in Project Spark In Conker returned in a new episodic campaign for Project Spark The campaign titled Conker s Big Reunion is set ten years after the events of Bad Fur Day and Seavor reprised his voice role The first episode was released on April the same year for Project Spark however before any more additional episodes could be made Project Spark s online services were shut down and the game was abandoned In Conker s Bad Fur Day was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One br In Microsoft announced Young Conker as the next installment into the series released for the Microsoft HoloLens The trailer was released in February and was almost universally panned by the public with many complaining that it lacked the humour and overall style of its predecessors The trailer received more than dislikes against just over likes A petition was created to cancel the game s release but failed Some video game critics and general YouTube commentators have boycotted the game br br br Reception br Reception for the Conker series has been largely focused on the protagonist of the series Conker the Squirrel and the critical success of the games Conker s Bad Fur Day and Live and Reloaded The contrast between Conker s innocent appearance and his coarse behavior has been well received by the public Critics have noted that the storylines and variety of characters for Conker s Bad Fur Day and Live and Reloaded in combination with the crude humour and seemingly innocent graphics are noteworthy appeal to mature audiences Rare listed Conker as the fifth Rare s video game character who most improved with age br Jordan Devore of Destructoid stated about Conker s appearance in Project Spark Conker s Big Reunion DLC that there was no getting around the disappointment of seeing a long abandoned but never forgotten character return not in his own adventure but in a DLC pack for a videogame about making games Conker s appearance on the Microsoft HoloLens trailer for Young Conker received mostly negative reviews Chris Plante of The Verge criticized it and said that Young Conker doesn t feature the original Conker Sam Loveridge of Digital Spy claimed that the scene of Conker and the bees is weird br br br
