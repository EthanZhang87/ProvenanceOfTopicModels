from games produced by Nintendo The show is also part of an hour long block in Season with The Adventures of Super Mario Bros and with Super Mario World in Season in a half hour block br br br Origins br The character Captain N first appeared in Nintendo Power magazine created by Nintendo staff member and magazine editor Randy Studdard The original concept involved Captain N originally known as Captain Nintendo as a Nintendo employee and the Mother Brain as a piece of programming from a Nintendo game pack that went rogue Captain N had the power to temporarily give life to characters and items from Nintendo games br The story left a door open for a sequel Mother Brain is temporarily defeated but her return was said to be inevitable and Captain N vows to stop her when the time comes Nintendo of America Inc later decided to follow Studdard s ideas and create a cartoon series opting neither to credit nor to compensate its creator DIC Entertainment was shopped as the animation studio and changed various aspects of the original idea while keeping the main premise of the Captain opposing Mother Brain as he interacted with a number of video game characters br Captain Nintendo also appeared in a prerecorded Nintendo Universe tip line series by Nintendo that was updated weekly Captain Nintendo was joined by a computer companion named Emerald to offer tips on popular Nintendo Game Paks as well as upcoming game announcements br br br Premise br At the outset of the first episode the hero of the series Kevin Keene a teenager from Northridge California and his dog Duke are taken to another universe known as Videoland when they are sucked into a vortex called the Ultimate Warp Zone that formed in his television br To fulfill an ancient prophecy Kevin is destined to become the hero Captain N The Game Master and save Videoland from evil forces led by Mother Brain from the floating world fortress called Metroid By the time Kevin arrives on the scene Mother Brain has almost succeeded in capturing the Palace of Power and conquering all Videoland Kevin who in Videoland is armed with a Zapper and a belt buckle shaped like an NES controller and Duke appear suddenly on the other side of the Ultimate Warp Zone before the N Team which consists of Princess Lana Deschain the acting ruler of Videoland as the first episode explains the absence of her father the King Simon Belmont Mega Man and Kid Icarus none of whom show any confidence in Kevin s ability in the beginning However after Lana is kidnapped by the enemy shortly after Kevin s arrival the reluctant group puts their differences aside to go on a rescue mission where Kevin eventually gains the others confidence During season Game Boy a human sized supercomputer shaped like the console joins the N Team br In most episodes the N Team s enemy is a group of video game villains usually led by the boisterous and loud Mother Brain who is accompanied by her minions the Eggplant Wizard from Kid Icarus the thuggish King Hippo from Punch Out and the scheming Dr Wily from Mega Man A villain of the week is featured in some episodes when a particular video game becomes the setting such as Malkil of Wizards Warriors Several other characters make recurring appearances including Donkey Kong The Count from Castlevania and Dr Light from Mega Man The cast of the Legend of Zelda cartoon reprise their respective roles for several guest appearances during the series br The focus of the show is mostly action adventure sourced from the video games they feature with comic relief in the form of the character s interactions with one another and the environment and their quirks and catchphrases Sometimes humor intentionally or unintentionally also stems from the comparatively loose interpretations of the laws of reality that apply in Videoland br br br Characters br br br The N Team br Kevin Keene portrayed by Dorian Barag in the live action sequences voiced by Matt Hill in animated sequences the teenage leader protagonist and main character of the series Initially he is a reluctant hero and is often found at odds with the rest of the N Team When he comes to Videoland he is armed with a belt and holster that has a Power Pad an NES controller shaped device which can stop time allow him to leap over objects or give him super speed over short distances and an NES Zapper like gun which dispatches or dematerializes enemies possibly a nod to Nintendo s content policies at the time which forbid the use of the word kill The Zapper can also shoot ice shaped like Tetris blocks His expert use of these tools combined with his overall friendly if competitive demeanor eventually earns the trust of the others In many episodes he tries to foster a big brotherly role to characters suffering from a particular plight He is most often called Captain N by the other cast members except Princess Lana who regularly addresses him by his first name The Varsity letter N on his jacket is for swimming br Princess Lana Deschain voiced by Venus Terzo the current regent of Videoland after her father King Charles was banished to the Mirror by Mother Brain She rules over all the lands in Videoland from the Palace of Power Though she reflects a kind character typified by a princess role she is able to keep up with the rest of the N team through their adventures and is not afraid of conflict having been trained to defend herself from a young age Though she is good friends with the members of the N Team Lana shows a longing for her own family She often acts as a mediator between the members of the N team when their competitive natures lead them to infighting Both Kevin and Simon compete for Lana s affections but she seems to prefer Kevin over Simon and kisses him on several occasions including the last episode Her appearance and dress consists of boots a two piece dress and top a tiara and a necklace with three green gems Production art showed her holding a large staff br Duke voiced by Tomm Wright Kevin s dog who jumped into the Ultimate Warp Zone immediately after Kevin was sucked in and ended up in Videoland as well Although he acts intelligently he shows occasional uncontrollable typical dog behavior like the chase reflex Duke is usually with Kevin through all the action in a given episode and sometimes sees his own action Duke wears a bandanna around his neck In the live action scenes shown in the first two episodes as well as the intro Duke is shown to be a Golden Retriever while he appears to be a beagle in the actual cartoon br Simon Belmont from Castlevania voiced by Andrew Kavadas until Captain N s arrival vampire hunter Simon Belmont from Castlevania regarded himself as Princess Lana s highest ranking servant He displays extreme arrogance and vanity often prefacing declarations of his character or capabilities by referring to himself in the rd person He enjoys courting and complimenting Princess Lana openly declaring his romantic interest in her which she rebuffs but sometimes is flattered but he enjoys tending to his appearance and physique even more On one occasion when he was forced to face his worst fears in a dream world it turned out his worst fear was a humorous form of body horror as his muscles sagged away his teeth fell out and he lost all his hair In his own distorted way however he does show regard for other members of the N team even if it outwardly seems back handed He is very competitive and he regards Captain N as a major rival for Princess Lana s attention He wears a blue fabric outfit pilot goggles boots and large gloves and carries around a backpack with a seemingly endless capacity of miscellaneous things he takes out and uses He brandishes a whip which occasionally has a mind of its own but like Captain N s zapper it can also dematerialize foes Simon Belmont s look was at least partially based upon his voice actor Andrew Kavadas looking less like his appearance in the Castlevania game series br Kid Icarus from Kid Icarus voiced by Alessandro Juliani the diminutive angel Kid Icarus from Mount Icarus is very loyal to and protective of Princess Lana and while he shows childish behavior he is not short on courage He is not very physically effective in action situations and often bemoans his small stature but is the only N Team member who can fly and usually is a very accurate archer His quiver holds regular arrows which can dematerialize foes but also has various specialized gadget arrows He often ends many words in his speech with the suffix icus He comes from the world of Mount Icarus His appearance in Season resembles his sprite and box art from Kid Icarus Of Myths and Monsters for Game Boy br Mega Man from Mega Man voiced by Doug Parker almost as diminutive as Kid Icarus Mega Man is a robot constructed by Dr Light who is from the world of Megaland He too is protective of Princess Lana Despite his size he is incredibly strong physically durable and extremely agile His body is clad in multi tone green armor and he wears a visor He has two forearm mounted energy blasters that function like Captain N s zapper He occasionally begins his words with the prefix mega His home world along with Dr Light is Megaland In the episode Happy Birthday Mega Man he is upset with the fact he is a nonliving robot and is transformed from a robot into a living man although later in the series he is still shown to possess his robotic abilities br Game Boy voiced by Frank Welker debuting in the first episode of the second season Gameboy aired September Game Boy is a human sized supercomputer designed like the Nintendo product of the same name an bit handheld video game device developed and manufactured by Nintendo When the portal to Mirror World opened King Charles sent him in his place to help Captain N He announces himself as being programmed to play games but when action arises he is usually capable of meeting the challenge His body exhibits elasticity when he stretches out his arms and hands from his casing Game Boy also uses his display to materialize many things including objects and monsters mainly for the team s target practice He also has an onboard computer which can analyze substances and track enemies br br br Main villains br Mother Brain from Metroid voiced by Levi Stubbs the primary villain of the series Mother Brain is a trash talking abusive power hungry brain looking alien in a giant bottle who comes from the world of Metroid In the pilot episode her troops are marching at the door of the Palace of Power and she had already captured and banished King Charles the King of Videoland to the Mirror World on Excalibur Though proud of her form and presence she is not above any subterfuge if it gets her goal accomplished She also displays great vanity almost as much as Simon Belmont She spends most of her time stationary in a control room on her floating world Metroid where she uses a special mirror to spy on the members of the N Team as she looks for weaknesses to exploit She also has retractable prehensile tentacles she uses to lash or electrically shock her usually incompetent minions to encourage them to do better br King Hippo from Punch Out voiced by Garry Chalk the monstrous pear shaped beast King Hippo is the heavyweight who is short on brains and big on muscle and comes from the world of Punch Out which is inspired by the game of the same name He is cruel indulgent and sharp tongued but most of his ire is usually directed to his counterpart the Eggplant Wizard br Eggplant Wizard from Kid Icarus voiced by Michael Donovan a one eyed human sized eggplant from Mount Icarus Eggplant Wizard is a main foe of Kid Icarus but mostly serves as a target of abuse for Mother Brain due to his incompetence He is also the chief foil for King Hippo as the two usually appear at the same time Eggplant Wizard also has the ability to conjure various vegetable themed gadgets to aid in mischief Unlike King Hippo Eggplant Wizard has shown some signs of taking the initiative to come up with his own schemes and is not above turning against Mother Brain on rare occasions br Doctor Wily from Mega Man voiced by Ian James Corlett the least shown of the main villains Dr Wily is a short beady eyed and slightly grizzled old dwarf man from Megaland who is loyal to Mother Brain and arguably the most competent of her main henchmen He is a stereotypical mad scientist who uses his genius to build wild gadgets or develop complicated schemes to defeat the N Team One notable episode had him using a mind reading device to find out the greatest fears of the team members then constructing a robot in the likeness of a school bully Kevin s greatest fear He speaks with a German accent and is

fights to defend the Triforce and Hyrule from enemies and wields a double edged sword He is Kevin s idol and favorite video game character There was minor friction between them when Zelda complimented Kevin on his skills and intelligence causing some jealousy and mild resentment on Link s part but this was later defused when he and Kevin worked together to defeat Ganon and they became close friends Unlike his appearance in the Legend of Zelda cartoon Link is older and portrayed as being more mature and no longer obsessed with trying to steal a kiss from Zelda She repeatedly kisses him voluntarily br Prince Lyle Deschain big brother to Princess Lana Lyle left home at an undisclosed time after feeling out of place Despite his lineage he displays few leadership skills or heroism and

character who falls in love with Kevin and becomes Lana s rival for his affections When asked by a fan why Samus did not appear in the television series Jeffrey Scott said that he never heard about her An article at UP COM describes Samus as rambunctious reckless and gets into contests with Lana over Kevin s affections which makes for some of the most entertaining situations in the series The reviewer added Not to say that the deadly quiet contemplative Samus who fights for truth and justice in the more recent Metroid games isn t awesome but there s something compelling about a Samus who s greedy and conniving and is proud to admit it br Mother Brain s second in command became Uranos the God of the Sky based on a regular enemy from Kid Icarus Pit s toga was changed from white to yellow and in most of the stories Lana s dress was purple However in the comics Lana has a weapon a scepter she had in concept art but only had a very brief appearance on one episode of the show br In the
