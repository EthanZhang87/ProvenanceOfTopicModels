what we re doing So if you hate it we really do not care because we do what we want to do and it s working for us br br br Composition br Like previous Alestorm albums Curse of the Crystal Coconut has been described as pirate metal power metal folk metal heavy metal and hard rock In a review of the album Exclaim considered Treasure Chest Party Quest Fannybaws and Pirate s Scorn to have some of the hookiest choruses in the band s catalogue While describing the song Treasure Chest Party Quest Outburn stated the fact that the song emerges from behind a veil of s cock rock with the usual folk metal adjunct and a bellowing metalcore vocal staccato is an indication from the off that Alestorm is flirting with reinvention and doing it as absurdly as imaginable Outburn also described the song Wooden Leg Part The Woodening as an eight minute multi faceted take on prog metal storytelling accented by mournful thrash symphonic blackness la Bal Sagoth and even smidges of death metal They even described Call of the Waves as the band s most serious moment of its career Metal Injection notes thrash like riffs on the songs Chomp Chomp and Zombies Ate My Pirate Ship The song Tortuga has been described as pop nu metal and rap metal because of the rap verse by Captain Yarrface The song Pirate s Scorn is a version of a song that appeared in the Donkey Kong Country animated series from the

Ate My Pirate Ship br br br Reception br br Curse of the Crystal Coconut received generally positive reviews from critics Jason Roche of Blabbermouth net called the album another indicator that the secret behind the band s longevity is their stellar knack for never letting the overall themes drown out the catchiness of their song craft In a positive review Alan Faulkner of Distorted Sound stated the lyrics may be silly and some of the songs are a bit out there but that is what Alestorm are about having fun and enjoying the music br Manus Hopkins of Exclaim gave the album a positive review stating it s incredible that Alestorm haven t run out of pirate riffs and lyrics about drinking pillaging and sailing the seas but this record is packed with all those and even more Holly Wrigh of Metal Hammer called the album another gem in the Scots steadily improving repertoire of jolly foul mouthed metal shanties that go far beyond the confines of gimmickry br Max Morin writing for Metal Injection was also positive calling the album another killer addition to a packed roster and is dying to be played lived Mike Elfers of Punknews called the album eleven tracks of their signature pirate metal and recommended it to anyone that likes drinking and or fun br Metal Storm called the album an improvement on the uneven songwriting that made No Grave But the Sea a modest disappointment Nick Balazs of Brave Words praised the album calling it more consistent than past efforts He also stated that since the band has continued to embrace their silliness it has resulted in stronger song development and even short tracks like the foul mouthed but musically elegant minute Shit Boat No Fans and the under minute accordion led Pirate s Scorn retain credibility and better yet flow brilliantly within the context of the album br Deadpress and Ghost Cult Magazine were less positive Carlos Zelaya of Deadpress described the album as one of many examples of hollow empty vessels having the most loudest unbearable resonations Gary Alcock of Ghost Cult Magazine was slightly more positive stating Curse of the Crystal Coconut does feature some gloriously stupid moments and a few seriously catchy hooks but like the Indiana Jones movie with a similar title the lack of ideas apparent on certain tracks suggests the joke might finally be wearing thin even with the band themselves
