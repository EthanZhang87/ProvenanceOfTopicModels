group of former Rare employees attempted to create a spiritual successor to Banjo Kazooie They joined under the Twitter handle Mingy Jongo the name of a boss from the second Banjo game Banjo Tooie

however in August a video game company named Playtonic Games was incorporated by this group and the account was revived under the name of its new company Playtonic announced that they were planning a spiritual successor to the Banjo Kazooie franchise titled Yooka Laylee formerly codenamed Project Ukulele At the start of development six people were involved To finance the game the development team

another record for the fastest game to get US pledged in the history of the platform Within a few weeks the game had garnered million from over backers br The game was intended as a resurrection and modernization of the collectathon D platforming game genre of the late s and early s with an emphasis on progression by collecting various different items Some of the collectibles were created using D sprites Additional post launch downloadable content was planned which began production following the game s release with crowdfunding participants receiving this content for free The game s native language is featured in English it features French German Italian and Spanish localizations Wil Overton a former artist for Rare illustrated the game s instruction manual br The game was created with the Unity engine with help from middleware tools This allowed for bugs to be more easily repaired and the incorporation of ten thousand polygons The phoneticizing of ukulele was an early idea that went through several versions e g Hawaiian terms Yoku meaning to eat bugs and Laylee meaning to fly until the final title Yooka Laylee Yooka Laylee features D worlds by environment artist Steven Hurst who also worked on the Banjo Kazooie series as well as Viva Pi ata The game s characters were designed by Kevin Bayliss who helped design the modern Kong characters in the Donkey Kong Country series and Ed Bryan who designed the characters in Banjo Kazooie Originally character art director Steve Mayles imagined Yooka as a lion but eventually made him a chameleon and created Laylee as a bat because of how their abilities could accommodate the gameplay Player characters were deliberately left without voices so as to enhance player choice The game s perk system was based upon what was done in video games outside the D platform genre Layered animations were among other things employed to improve character movement Along with Kirkhope former Rare composers David Wise and Steve Burke collaborated to compose the game s orchestral score A soundtrack CD was released and rewarded to certain supporters of the crowdfunding campaign The increase in memory availability since working on

a nostalgic ride through time bringing the collect a thons from the N era into the modern age James Kozanitis of Game Revolution felt that Yooka Laylee improved on the gameplay and structure of classic titles in particular the relevance and importance of the collectables Chris Carter of Destructoid praised the expansive levels and the colorful design but concluded that due to the throwback designs it would not be for everyone Marty Sliva of IGN called Yooka Laylee a good reminder that this genre once thought to be dead still has some life left in it He also noted different aspects of the game that felt authentic to games from the s praising the level design soundtrack and characters while also criticizing how the game controlled at certain points and stated it was not anymore

in some instances convoluted level design br On the other hand Colm Ahern was more negative about the game s intention to capitalize on people s nostalgia especially noting camera issues ambiguous puzzles a distinct lack of signposting and voices that will make your ears bleed while the game itself could not decide whether it was aiming at children or adults as an audience Furthermore while he was positive about the first level he claimed that all other levels in the game were falling short finding them repetitive and confusing Chelsea Stark of Polygon noted that Yooka Laylee was proof that sometimes our fondest memories should stay in the past She called the game s combat mechanics a chore and was critical of the controls GamesRadar also noted the game s repetitive missions and objectives with reviewer David Houghton noting that some of the game s power ups especially the flight ability render most puzzles and level design choices obsolete br br br Spin off and other
