The Super Mario Bros theme officially known as the Ground Theme is a musical theme originally heard in the first stage of the Nintendo Entertainment System video game Super Mario Bros It was one of six themes composed for the game by Nintendo sound designer Koji Kondo who found it to be the most difficult track to compose for it The theme is set in the key of C major and features a swing rhythm with prominent use of syncopation While the original theme is composed within the sound limitations of the NES s bit hardware in later installments with more powerful sound hardware it is often scored as a calypso song led by steel drums br After Super Mario Bros it went on to become the theme of the series and has been a fixture in most of its titles It has been reused and remixed in other Nintendo published games including Tetris DS Nintendogs Chihuahua and Friends WarioWare Inc Mega Microgames and every entry in the Super Smash Bros series br In the Super Mario Bros theme was chosen by the U S Library of Congress as the first ever video game recording selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry br br br Composition br br Of the six tracks of the Super Mario Bros soundtrack this theme took the most time to develop according to its composer Koji Kondo He stated that he would write one piece and the team would put it in the game If it did not accentuate the action did not time up with Mario running and jumping or did not harmonize with the sound effects well enough he would scrap it He composed the music using only a small keyboard br The composition takes influence from the song Sister Marian by T Square a Japanese fusion band In a interview by Game Maestro Vol Kondo affirms that the overworld theme in Mario might show some influence from the Japanese fusion band T Square too The rhythms in their music were easy for Japanese listeners to follow The first theme he made for Super Mario Bros was based on an early prototype of the game which simply showed Mario running around a big empty area Kondo described this early theme as a bit lazier slower tempo and more laid back As the game underwent changes he realized that his theme no longer fit so he increased the pace and changed it around to fit better In an interview Kondo explained that compositional ideas come to him during everyday activities br Kondo was given complete creative freedom over the soundtrack of Super Mario Bros and would collaborate with Shigeru Miyamoto the game s director through their daily interactions Miyamoto would share his records and music scores of the type of themes he liked with Kondo but did not tell him exactly what he wanted It was composed with a Latin rhythm When the player has less than units of time left to complete the stage the music s tempo accelerates At the Game Developers Conference in Kondo commented that the theme features rhythm balance and interactivity He demonstrated this with a short clip of Super Mario Bros showing the character s movements and players button presses syncing with the beat of the music He also added that the theme reflects the action oriented gameplay of the series Kondo stated that he was not sure if he could make any future music of his catchier than it br br br In other media br The theme was reused in multiple other media including the anime film Super Mario Bros The Great Mission to Rescue
