Super Mario Bros also known as Super Mario Bros The Movie is a fantasy adventure film based on Nintendo s Super Mario video game series The first feature length live action film based on a video game it was directed by the husband and wife team of Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel written by Parker Bennett Terry Runt and Ed Solomon and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures through Hollywood Pictures It follows brothers Mario Bob Hoskins and Luigi Mario John Leguizamo in their quest to rescue Princess Daisy Samantha Mathis from a dystopic parallel universe ruled by the ruthless King Koopa Dennis Hopper br Development began after producer Roland Joff obtained the Mario film rights from Nintendo Given free creative license by Nintendo which believed the Mario brand was strong enough for experimentation the screenwriters envisioned Super Mario Bros as a subversive comedy influenced by Ghostbusters and The Wizard of Oz The setting was inspired by the game Super Mario World with elements drawn from fairy tales and contemporary American culture The production innovated and introduced many filmmaking techniques now considered pivotal in the transition from practical to digital visual effects including the use of Autodesk Flame Filming took place from May to July br Released on May Super Mario Bros was a critical and financial failure grossing million worldwide against a budget of million Although the film received generally unfavourable reviews at release and appeared on several lists of the worst films ever made it has developed a cult following over the years It has been reappraised as a cult classic by many for its creative liberties with the source material and others for being so bad it s good In a webcomic sequel was produced in collaboration with Bennett br After Super Mario Bros Nintendo would not license another film based on the Super Mario game series for years until an animated reboot titled The Super Mario Bros Movie was released on April br br br Plot br Following the impact of a meteorite into the Earth million years ago the universe is split into two parallel dimensions Surviving dinosaurs escape into the new dimension evolving into a humanoid race and founding the city of Dinohattan In a large egg and a rock are left at a Catholic orphanage and the egg hatches into a baby girl br Twenty years later Italian American brothers Mario and Luigi Mario working as plumbers in Brooklyn are close to being driven out of business by mafioso Anthony Scapelli s construction company Luigi meets Daisy an NYU archaeology student who shows him she has been excavating for dinosaur bones under the Brooklyn Bridge There they witness Scapelli s men sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open Mario and Luigi fix it but Iggy and Spike henchmen and cousins of King Koopa the leader of the other dimension kidnap Daisy after mistakenly kidnapping other girls including Mario s girlfriend Daniella The brothers pursue them through an interdimensional portal to Dinohattan where they lose track of Daisy and the rock which is stolen by Big Bertha the bouncer at the Boom Boom Bar br Daisy learns she is descended from dinosaurs and the long lost princess of the other dimension Her father the king was devolved by Koopa then a general in the king s army into a fungus that has since spread across Dinohattan and her mother the queen took her to Brooklyn only to be killed when the portal was sealed Iggy and Spike realize that they lost Daisy s rock a meteorite fragment Koopa needs to merge the worlds They believe only Daisy can do so because of her royal heritage Mario and Luigi escape prison and go to rescue Daisy aided by the fungus as well as Toad a good natured guitarist who was devolved into a Goomba a semi humanoid dinosaur as punishment for a protest against Koopa Daisy s own escape attempt is aided by Yoshi a pet of the royal family and Iggy and Spike who were mentally evolved to become intelligent and decided to turn on Koopa While Luigi rescues Daisy Mario saves Daniella and the other girls mistaken for the princess br Koopa s jealous girlfriend Lena tries unsuccessfully to kill Daisy then obtains the rock with plans to overthrow him but is fossilized when she merges the worlds In Brooklyn Koopa attempts his takeover by rousing his army and turning Scapelli into a chimpanzee but Mario shields himself from being devolved with a mushroom from the fungus Luigi and Daisy remove the fragment from the meteorite separating the worlds Mario and Luigi obtain devolution guns and use them to defeat Koopa by devolving him into primeval slime Daisy s father evolves back to normal and is restored as king and the citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything with Koopa s likeness Daisy decides to stay in Dinohattan and kisses Luigi goodbye as she opens the portal for him and Mario to return to Brooklyn br Three weeks later the Mario brothers are heralded as heroes Daisy arrives at Mario and Luigi s apartment in Brooklyn and asks them to help her on a new mission br br br Cast br br br Production br br br Development br Beginning in the s numerous producers attempted to purchase the rights to make a Super Mario Bros film In Nintendo gave DIC Entertainment the right to make a film out of The Super Mario Bros Super Show but it was never produced In Dustin Hoffman attempted to purchase the rights to produce a film with himself as Mario Danny DeVito as Luigi and Barry Levinson directing However this was not made because of scheduling conflicts for DeVito Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall Producer Roland Joff first came up with the idea of making a live action adaptation of the video games himself during a script meeting at Eberts production company Lightmotive Joff met Nintendo of America president and Hiroshi Yamauchi s son in law Minoru Arakawa He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script One month after their meeting Joff went to Nintendo s headquarters in Kyoto to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project Joff left with a million contract giving the temporary control of the character of Mario over to Joff Nintendo retained merchandising rights for the film through a creative partnership with Lightmotive br When Yamauchi asked Joff why Nintendo should sell the rights to Lightmotive over a major company Joff assured them that Nintendo would have more control over the film However Nintendo had no interest in creative control and believed the Mario brand was strong enough to allow an experiment with an outside industry Joff said I think they looked at the movie as some sort of strange creature that was kind of rather intriguing to see if we could walk or not He wondered How do we catch this wonderful mixture of images and inputs and strangeness The first screenplay was written by Oscar winning screenwriter Barry Morrow His story followed brothers Mario and Luigi on an existential road trip so similar to Morrow s prior Rain Man that production titled the script Drain Man Morrow described his screenplay as a study in contrast like Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello that would have an odyssey and a quest like the game itself Co producer Fred Caruso later said that Morrow s story was more of a serious drama piece as opposed to a fun comedy br Screenwriters Jim Jennewein and Tom S Parker were brought on next to write a more traditional adaptation Jennewein said So right away we knew that the best way to do this is to essentially have a journey into this world not unlike The Wizard of Oz His and Parker s take on the story was to subvert and satirize fairy tale clich s and to focus on the relationship between Mario and Luigi Jennewein said Essentially what we did was what Shrek did And we knew the story had to be about the brothers and that the emotional through line would be about the brothers Greg Beeman of License to Drive was attached to direct and development had already moved into pre production but the failure of Beeman s recent Mom and Dad Save the World led to his dismissal by nervous producers Joff then offered Harold Ramis the director position but though he was a fan of the video game Ramis declined the opportunity which he later said he was glad about and which the Associated Press would observe was his smartest career decision br Joff said We tried some various avenues that didn t work that came up too medieval or somehow wasn t the right thing I felt the project was taking a wrong turn And that s when I began thinking of Max Headroom Joff traveled to Rome to meet with creators Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel Morton said We come from the Tim Burton school of filmmaking because our background is in animation and comic books So we started off basing everything in reality and then tried to have fun and exaggerate it as much as possible Joff Morton and Jankel agreed their approach to adapting the video games should follow the darker tone popularized by the Batman and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Joff said This wasn t Snow White and the Seven Dinosaurs The dino world was dark We didn t want to hold back Morton described the film as a prequel to the video games that tells the true story behind Nintendo s inspiration Joff viewed the games as a mixture of Japanese fairy tales and bits of modern America and wanted to create a slightly mythic vision of New York Screenwriter Parker Bennett elaborated Our take on it was that Nintendo interpreted the events from our story and came up with the video game We basically worked backwards The film also took inspiration from Die Hard Mad Max and Blade Runner br The concept of a parallel universe inhabited by dinosaurs was inspired by Dinosaur Land from the recently released Super Mario World Jankel envisioned the parallel dimension as a whole world with a reptile point of view dominated by aggressive primordial behavior and basic instincts while Morton considered the ecological and technological consequences of a dinosaur society that holds fossil fuels sacred Joff noted It s a wonderful parody of New York and heavy industry We call it the New Brutalism Screenwriters Parker Bennett and Terry Runt were tasked with balancing comedy with a darker tone Bennett said Ghostbusters was the model We were aiming towards funny but kind of weird and dark br Though working well with the directors Bennett and Runt were dismissed by the producers for being too comedic and the British writing team of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were brought on to deliver a more adult and feminist tone Princess Daisy and Lena s roles were expanded and Bertha was introduced as a black woman With this script the main cast signed and Bob Hoskins was finally convinced to take the role of Mario The film officially moved into pre production However producers Joff and Eberts feared the project had both skewed too far from the intended young adult and family audiences and had become too effects heavy to film within budget so without informing directors Morton and Jankel or the signed cast they hired screenwriters Ed Solomon and Ryan Rowe to provide a more family friendly script with more restrained effects requirements The script doctoring was partially motivated by a studio purchasing the film s distribution rights The cast only discovered the new screenplay upon arriving in Wilmington North Carolina br Directors Morton and Jankel considered leaving the project but decided to stay after discussing together and realizing that no other director could at that point understand the material enough to properly adapt it Morton and Jankel also said they owed it to the cast and crew and believed they could reclaim their vision during production Rowe returned home to work on another project but Solomon remained for several weeks to provide additional rewrites Without invitation Bennett and Runt took a road trip to Wilmington whereupon they were immediately re hired They would remain through production to provide final rewrites dialogue for ADR and the dialogue for the expository animated dinosaur opening The intelligent fungus was inspired by both the Mushroom Kingdom from the games and tabloid reports of a discovered gigantic fungus Production Designer David Snyder recalled As each script developed the fungus was sort of a metaphor for the mushroom element in a Nintendo game Joff reflected For me a screenplay is never finished You work a screenplay all the time When you bring actors in a screenplay goes through another evolution So you can say that rather like the fungus in the movie the screenplay constantly evolves br br br Casting br After securing the rights to the film Lightmotive began the casting for the characters Hoffman continued to express interest in portraying Mario However Arakawa did not believe that he was right for the role DeVito was offered both the role of Mario and director Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Keaton were approached to play Koopa but both turned down the role The studio considered Tom Hanks for the role of Luigi but a string of recent box office failures dropped him from consideration Actors Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo were ultimately cast as Mario and Luigi br Initially Hoskins disliked the script and did not want to do another children s film I d done Roger Rabbit I d done Hook I didn t want to become like Dick Van Dyke Hoskins wondered how he would prepare for the role saying I m the right shape I ve got a mustache I worked as a plumber s apprentice for about three weeks and set the plumber s boots on fire with a blowtorch Producer Roland Joff kept sending Hoskins new script revisions until finally the actor agreed Co director Jankel said Bob was a no brainer Unabashed shameless physical type casting Bob was brilliant at assuming the character in a slightly amplified way that would be in keeping with his supposed subsequent game iteration br Leguizamo said What I liked about the script was the adventure and the action that was involved He joked that You always see a lot of Italians playing Latin people like Al Pacino did in Scarface Now it s our turn Jankel said John was a brilliant up and coming stand up comic and actor We went to see him at Second City and we were sold He had a wonderful combination of empathy and irreverence but was entirely without guile It was not specifically scripted to be cast with a Hispanic or Latino actor but it made perfect sense that the Mario Bros themselves should be this contemporary unconventional family so the small unit of just two couldn t be pegged as one thing or another Mojo Nixon said he was cast as Toad because the production wanted an actual musician for the character but their first choice Tom Waits was unavailable Nixon s agent pitched him to casting as a third rate Tom Waits for half price br br br Filming br Several weeks before shooting was to begin Disney purchased the distribution rights to the film and demanded significant rewrites Morton said the final result was a script that was not at all like the script that he Jankel and the cast had signed on to film and that the tone of the new script was not at all compatible with the sets which had already been built Leguizamo said It s eight year olds who play the game and that s where the movie needed to be aimed But the directors kept trying to insert new material They shot scenes with strippers and with other sexually explicit content which all got edited out anyway br Principal photography of the film began on May and wrapped on July It was filmed at Carolco Studios in Wilmington North Carolina Contrary to many reports directors Morton and Jankel did complete the contracted shooting of the film though director of photography Dean Semler and several second unit directors provided additional reshoots Morton and Jankel would even provide such instructions as the camera aperture settings to which Semler responded by questioning his employment on the production Morton said I was locked out of the editing room I had to get the DGA to come and help me get back into the editing room I tried to get the editor to cut it digitally but they refused They wanted to edit on Moviola and Steenbeck machines so the process was laboriously slow which didn t help us get the special effect cut in on time br br br Production design br Production Designer David Snyder approached turning the Mushroom Kingdom into the live action setting of Dinohattan also known as DinoYawk or Koopaville by taking all the elements that are in the video game and turning them into a metaphor and combining them with D and real characters Art Director Walter P Martishius said Koopa gets a single glimpse of Manhattan at the beginning of the movie This inspires Koopa to recreate Dinohattan but he didn t get it quite right The place is twisted off balance different And he doesn t even know it br Co producer Fred Caruso located the deserted Ideal Cement Co plant in Wilmington North Carolina Snyder found the location a unique opportunity In this building with all the existing concrete structure we could hang the scenery from the structure and not have to build scaffolding and could integrate the concrete structure into the film s design Snyder said In Blade Runner a film he was the Art Director on the street was one level Here I have a street level a pedestrian walkway and above that Koopa s Room plus six or seven stories in height I have more flexibility in layering of levels It s a major major opportunity You d never be able to do this on a sound stage There isn t a sound stage big enough We ve designed this film with the idea of looking at New York while on some mind altering drugs The intelligent fungus was created from a fishing lure base and hot glue by prop designer Simon Murton br br br Creature effects br Lead creatures designer and supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos was aware of the concurrent Jurassic Park production so he consciously designed the dinosaurs for Super Mario Bros to be more cute and cartoon like with inspiration from Beetlejuice Tatopoulos described Yoshi as an abstract fantasy T rex and designed the baby dinosaur with large eyes to evoke a softer and less menacing quality Lead SFX sculptor Mark Maitre compared Yoshi to a cross between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and an iguana Four versions of the Yoshi puppet were built a stand in a wireless model a half puppet for the tongue and a fully functional model The fully functional puppet utilized cables and nine operators costing equivalent to in Producers from Jurassic Park visited the set and were so impressed with the Yoshi puppet they briefly considered hiring its engineers for a second Jurassic Park creatures shop Originally the Goombas were only background characters but their final designs were so impressive that directors Morton and Jankel promoted them to main characters with major stunts br br br Visual effects br Super Mario Bros innovated and introduced many techniques considered pivotal in the transition from practical to digital visual effects It is the first film to have used the software Autodesk Flame now an industry standard It is also the first film scanned with a digital intermediate allowing for the compositing of more than visual effects shots The disintegration effect for the inter dimensional merge was inspired by the transporter from Star Trek br br br Reception br br br Box office br In the United States and Canada Super Mario Bros only collected million during its opening weekend ranking in fourth place at the box office below Cliffhanger Made in America and Dave It grossed with approximately tickets sold in the United States In Asia the film earned million million from distribution rentals in Japan and sold tickets in the South Korean capital of Seoul In Europe the film grossed in the United Kingdom sold tickets in France and sold tickets in Germany In total the film grossed internationally for a worldwide total of br br br Critical response br On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews with an average rating of The site s consensus states Despite flashy sets and special effects Super Mario Bros is too light on story and substance to be anything more than a novelty Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned a score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of B on scale of A to F br Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times said It s a movie split in two wildly accomplished on one level wildly deficient on another He gave the film high marks for its effects and the sheer density and bravura of the production design but ultimately provided a low final score for poor writing Janet Maslin of The New York Times also commended the film s visual effects and suggested Bob Hoskins could handle any role with grace and good humor but concluded it doesn t have the jaunty hop and zap spirit of the Nintendo video game from which it takes ahem its inspiration Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune said The movie s no stinker lauded Hoskins and Leguizamo for their brotherly dynamic and called the Goombas wonderfully daffy supporting characters Hal Hinson of The Washington Post likewise praised the film for its performances and creature effects and proclaimed In short it s a blast br Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film two thumbs down on the television program Siskel Ebert at the Movies citing tonal inconsistency and lack of narrative and the film was on their list for one of the worst films of Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun thought Yoshi had more personality than all the human actors put together br br br Home media br The film was first released on LaserDisc in the United States on December It was released for rental on VHS in the United States in January It was released on DVD in the United States on June and again in The DVD release is presented in non anamorphic widescreen with an English Dolby Digital audio track br It was released on Blu ray by Second Sight Films in the United Kingdom on November and was re released as a limited edition Blu ray SteelBook by Zavvi in the UK in February It was released on Blu ray in Japan on December which has the same features and extras as the Second Sight Films release br An Australian Blu ray release by Umbrella Entertainment was released in October with the same bonus features as Second Sight s release plus the original workprint including deleted scenes This release of the film is region free and can be played on systems from any region As of fan website Super Mario Bros The Movie Archive was working with original VFX Supervisor Christopher F Woods on a K resolution transfer and restoration In Umbrella released the film on K Blu ray to commemorate its th anniversary br br br Legacy br In a interview Hoskins was asked what he considered the worst choice in his acting career He responded Super Mario Bros It was a fuckin nightmare The whole experience was a nightmare It had a husband and wife team directing whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set Fuckin nightmare Fuckin idiots He and Leguizamo got drunk before each day of filming and continued to drink between takes In a interview he was asked What is the worst job you ve done What has been your biggest disappointment and If you could edit your past what would you change His answer to all three was Super Mario Bros His son Jack Hoskins is a fan of the Mario series as well as the film and praised his performance br Though Leguizamo wrote in his autobiography that he hated the film and regretted acting in it it was widely considered his breakout role in film acting He prepared a video message for the film s th anniversary in saying I m glad people appreciate the movie it was the first nobody had ever done it before I m proud of the movie in retrospect br Hopper disparaged the production recounting in It was a nightmare very honestly that movie It was a husband and wife directing team who were both control freaks and wouldn t talk before they made decisions Anyway I was supposed to go down there for five weeks and I was there for It was so over budget He added My six year old son at the time he s now he said Dad I think you re probably a pretty good actor but why did you play that terrible guy King Koopa in Super Mario Bros And I said Well Henry I did that so you could have shoes and he said Dad I don t need shoes that badly br In years after its release Mathis said the film is not my proudest moment as an actor but added I t s maybe the one that I get asked the most about There are a lot of people who are really excited to meet me because I was Princess Daisy That s all you can ask for as an actor that your work and something you were part of left an impression on people and makes them feel good br Co director Morton reflected on the film in as a harrowing experience Morton felt very uneasy being put in the position of having to defend the new script In addition working with Dennis Hopper was really really hard Really hard I don t think Hopper had a clue what was going on He described the experience as humiliating but was proud of the film s originality For the film s th anniversary Morton said I wanted parents to really get into it At that time there was a very hardcore movement against video games and a lot of anti video games sentiment I wanted to make a film that would open it up and get parents interested in video games br Co director Jankel said I do feel in my heart it was a hell of an achievement to have made it under those circumstances and it has in time happily achieved cult status I am often hearing how many people loved it growing up watch it repeatedly and are genuine fans br Producer Joff remains proud It s not that I defend the movie it s just that in its own extraordinary way it was an interesting and rich artefact and has earned its place It has strange cult status He never heard what Yamauchi or Nintendo thought of the finished product He said They never phoned up to complain They were very polite though Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils Aim said in that the film left a really bad taste in the mouth of our developers and that he had heard horror stories about its production from Nintendo employees br Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto said In the end it was a very fun project that they put a lot of effort into The one thing that I still have some regrets about is that the movie may have tried to get a little too close to what the Mario Bros video games were And in that sense it became a movie that was about a video game rather than being an entertaining movie in and of itself br In a interview with Aaron Horvath co director of The Super Mario Bros Movie he praised the film in retrospect br br br Cultural impact br Ryan Hoss a longtime fan of the film launched the fansite Super Mario Bros The Movie Archive explaining to Playboy for the film s th anniversary I had this collection and the Internet was growing in terms of fansites during that era the late s and I always knew the Mario Bros movie was misunderstood and a sore spot in people s minds at least the way it was being portrayed on the Internet the worst movie ever kind of deal He characterized the site It s a way to celebrate the film itself and showcase the work of all the people who had a part in it warts and all good and bad br In Steven Applebaum joined the site as editor in chief to help collect production materials and organize interviews He said Most of the cast and crew were very happy about it because at the time it was a very revolutionary movie They were introducing a lot of great special effects that hadn t been done before and they had these really talented actors and it was a project they were proud to work on Giving them a chance to talk about everything they did it really helped them to share what they contributed and what they felt was important to the industry The film returned to theaters through fan efforts in and in for the th anniversary The Nintendo Power th anniversary retrospective issue states that the fact that the film was made regardless of quality shows how much the game series had impacted popular culture br br br Themes br Thomas Leitch has written that Super Mario Bros is an example of post literary adaptation and that it drops facetious references to The Wizard of Oz Star Wars and Doctor Zhivago Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun compared the Goombas to the winged monkeys of The Wizard of Oz suggesting they similarly evoke a mix of pity and terror The phrase Trust the Fungus has been compared to May the Force be with you from Star Wars br br br Sequel webcomic br In fansite editors Steven Applebaum and Ryan Hoss teamed with one of the film s original screenwriters Parker Bennett on a fanfiction webcomic sequel Development on the sequel began after a interview in which Bennett admitted the sequel hook was more an homage to the ending of the original Back to the Future and was not a serious indication of a potential continuation However Applebaum and Hoss later asked Bennett what he would have done if given the opportunity and Bennett provided broad points about the consequences of the first film and the themes that they would have explored br The adventure picks up with Mario and Luigi returning to Dinohattan to aid Daisy in defeating mad scientist Wart the final boss from Super Mario Bros We did heavily discuss the world of the film from its backstory to the character s motivations says Applebaum Bennett provided general direction before passing the torch to Applebaum and Hoss br br br Extended cut br On June editor and film restorationist Garrett Gilchrist and members of The Super Mario Bros Movie Archive released a semi official restoration of the extended cut of Super Mario Bros The restorationists named it The Morton Jankel Cut because it was based on an earlier VHS workprint of the film which had been discovered Gilchrist was hired to get the most out of the low quality VHS The film is extended by twenty minutes in this cut with additional scenes including Koopa devolving a technician into slime for the crime of sneezing Mario s rivalry with the mafia affiliated Scapelli plumbing company and an anti Koopa rap by Spike and Iggy at the Boom Boom Bar backed up with scantily clad lizard dancers Though the Morton Jankel Cut was theoretically intended as an official Blu ray extra there are no plans for this to happen and it was leaked to Internet Archive instead The Australian Blu ray by Umbrella released October used a raw edit of the VHS workprint rather than Gilchrist s restoration br The Trust the Fungus Super Mario Bros th Anniversary Collector s Edition was released on Blu ray by Umbrella Entertainment in This featured deleted scenes and the Lasagna Workprint from the same VHS source used previously for the Morton Jankel Cut but restored differently for this edition br br br Soundtrack br br The soundtrack released on May by Capitol Records features two songs from Roxette Almost Unreal which was released as a single and Cinnamon Street which is an alternate version of the song Cinnamon Street from Roxette s album Tourism The music video for Almost Unreal was inspired by the film featuring scenes from the film and a de evolution theme Almost Unreal was originally written for the film Hocus Pocus but was switched out to an En Vogue song instead Roxette subsequently gave the song to the Mario film Roxette co founder Per Gessle said the film turned out to be ridiculous so thought Dennis Hopper by the way I met him at a Formula race many years ago discussing this but the song isn t that bad br br These tracks were not included in the U S and Canada releases only on the international versions of the album br br br animated film reboot br br Rumors of a more source accurate theatrical animated Mario film began in late with leaked emails between film producer Avi Arad and Sony Pictures head Tom Rothman suggesting that Sony would be producing the film On November Universal Pictures and Illumination announced a computer animated Mario film On January Nintendo of America announced its partnership with Illumination stating that the film would be co produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Chris Meledandri On November Meledandri stated that the film would be a priority for the studio with a tentative release date while reaffirming that Miyamoto would be involved front and center in the film s creation Speaking of the challenge of adapting the series into an animated film Meledandri stated the film would be an ambitious task taking things that are so thin in their original form and finding depth that doesn t compromise what generations of fans love about Mario but also feels organic to the iconography and can support a three act structure br The Super Mario Bros Movie was released in the United States on April It received mixed reviews from critics and was a major commercial success grossing billion worldwide and setting multiple box office records including the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film and the highest grossing film based on a video game It became the second highest grossing film of the third highest grossing animated film of all time and the highest grossing film
