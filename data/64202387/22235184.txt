CraveOnline described it as the series everyman The video game incarnation has been made into several plush toys br br br Concept and creation br br Goombas were introduced in the video game Super Mario Bros and were the last enemy added to the game after playtesters stated that the Koopa Troopa was too tricky as an enemy As a result the designers decided to introduce the Goomba as a basic enemy However they had very little space left in the game They used a single image twice to convey the notion that the Goombas are walking flipping it back and forth causing it to look lopsided as it walks and giving the appearance of a trot The Goomba s resemblance to the Super Mushroom forced designers to change the mechanics and appearance of the Super Mushroom They used the Goomba s ability to be jumped on and defeated to teach players how to deal with enemies and to not fear the Super Mushroom br Goombas resemble shiitake with bushy eyebrows and a pair of tusk like teeth sprouting from their lower jaw similar to a bulldog They also appear to have shoe like feet coming from their stalks br Early concept art for the live action Super Mario Bros film showed that the design of the Goombas were originally intended to be for Koopa Troopas another kind of Mario enemy A separate company from the primary makeup departments designed the Goombas in the film br br br Name br The name Goomba is derived from Goombah from Sicilian cump which translates to mate or fellow which refers to an Italian American man Also in Hungarian gomba means mushroom In Japan Goombas are called Kurib
