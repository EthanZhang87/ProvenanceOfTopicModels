on the Ox King from the Toei Animation film Alakazam the Great However Nintendo designer Takashi Tezuka pointed out that the character looked a lot more like a turtle than an ox Miyamoto and Tezuka then began to redesign his look to reflect a leader of the turtle like Koopa Troopas In his final design Miyamoto commented that he could make Bowser look cool now br Miyamoto named him Daima Kuppa Kuppa came from the Japanese name for gukbap a Korean dish Miyamoto had also considered the names Yukke and Bibinba also Japanese names of Korean dishes yukhoe and bibimbap respectively For the later North American release of the game which also introduced the anglicized spelling Koopa the character was named Bowser His Korean name is not Gukbap but Kupa which is essentially a phonetic round trip translation The name was anglicized to Kuppa rather than Koopa in the Japanese versions up until the release of Super Mario World br Bowser was once imagined as an upright Koopa Troopa with spines on his back and fangs according to the oldest known design During the development of Super Mario Bros Miyamoto contemplated commissioning the game s art to a manga artist or illustrator However due to a lack of time he created the game s original box art himself Bowser is depicted in this artwork in a way that differs from later renditions with the most noticeable differences being his gray blue complexion and lack of horns Miyamoto received inspiration for the character s appearance from an anime film version of the Chinese novel Journey to the West which was renamed Alakazam the Great during the film s Ameri period Y ichi Kotabe based Bowser s final design on the Chinese softshell turtle which he recognized as highly aggressive reflecting Bowser s short temper br Within early
