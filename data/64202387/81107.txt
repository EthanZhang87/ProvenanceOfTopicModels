Mario Bros sometimes nicknamed as Pipeline is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo as an arcade video game in It was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi Nintendo s chief engineer Italian twin brother plumbers Mario and Luigi exterminate creatures like turtles Koopas and crabs emerging from the sewers by knocking them upside down and kicking them away The Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System version is the first game produced by Intelligent Systems It is part of the Mario franchise but originally began as a spin off from the Donkey Kong series br The arcade and Famicom Nintendo Entertainment System versions were received positively by critics Elements introduced in Mario Bros such as spinning bonus coins turtles that can be flipped onto their backs and Luigi were carried over to Super Mario Bros and became staples of the series br An updated version titled Mario Bros Classic is included as a minigame in all of the Super Mario Advance series and Mario Luigi Superstar Saga Mario Bros has been re released through Nintendo s online stores for later systems br br br Gameplay br br Mario Bros features two plumbers Italian brothers Mario and Luigi having to investigate the sewers after strange creatures have been appearing down there The objective of the game is to defeat all of the enemies in each phase The mechanics of Mario Bros involve only running and jumping Unlike future Mario games players cannot jump on enemies and squash them unless they were already turned on their back Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen along with an object called a POW block in the center Phases use wraparound meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side The game has a point system and continues until the player loses all lives br Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this the enemy will flip itself back over and recover br There are four enemies which emerge from the pipes br the Shellcreeper the Sidestepper the Fighter Fly which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform and the Slipice which turns platforms into slippery ice A fifth enemy fireballs floats around the screen instead of sticking to platforms POW blocks which flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below are also included The game additionally contains bonus rounds br br br Development br br Mario Bros was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi two of the lead developers for the video game Donkey Kong In Donkey Kong Mario dies if he falls too far For Mario Bros Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height which Miyamoto was not sure of thinking that it would make it not much of a game He eventually agreed thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities He designed a prototype that had Mario jumping and bouncing around which he was satisfied with The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it observing that it would work since there were multiple floors However it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they ve been flipped to defeat them This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below Because of Mario s appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls a hat and a thick moustache Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter and designed this game to reflect that Another contributing factor was the game s setting it was a large network of giant pipes so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him The game s music was composed by Yukio Kaneoka br A popular story of how Mario went from Jumpman to Mario is that an Italian American landlord Mario Segale had barged in on Nintendo of America s staff to demand rent and they decided to name Jumpman after him Miyamoto also felt that the best setting for this game was New York because of its labyrinthine subterranean network of sewage pipes The pipes were inspired by several manga which Miyamoto states feature waste grounds with pipes lying around In this game they were used in a way to allow the enemies to enter and exit the stage through them to avoid getting enemies piled up on the bottom of the stage The green coloring of the pipes which Nintendo late president Satoru Iwata called an uncommon color came from Miyamoto having a limited color palette and wanting to keep things colorful He added that green was the best because it worked well when two shades of it were combined br Mario Bros introduced Mario s brother Luigi who was created for the multiplayer mode by doing a palette swap of Mario The two player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by Joust To date Mario Bros has been released for more than a dozen platforms The first movement from Mozart s Eine kleine Nachtmusik is used at the start of the game This song has been used in later video games including Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix and Super Smash Bros Brawl
