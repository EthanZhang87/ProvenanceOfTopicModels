The Perils of Pauline is a American melodrama film serial produced by William Randolph Hearst and released by the Eclectic film company shown in bi weekly installments featuring Pearl White as the title character an ambitious young heiress with an independent nature and a desire for adventure br Despite popular associations Pauline was never tied to a railroad track in the series an image that was added to popular mythology by scenes in stage melodramas of the s in serials featuring the resourceful railroad girl Helen Holmes in her long running series The Hazards of Helen and in other railroad themed Holmes cliffhangers such as The Girl and the Game The images of Holmes railroad adventures were blended in the public mind with Pearl White s cliffhanging adventures probably because

was hesitant to accept the title role but signed up for week and a large amount of publicity br William Randolph Hearst was involved in plot development He was also present at the premiere at Loew s Broadway Theatre on March According to The Truth About Pearl White by Wallace E Davis the general release was approximately April br E A McManus head of the Hearst Vitagraph service organization was the person who proved how successful a serial could be He co operated with the largest film equipment and production company in the world at that time a France based company named Path to produce this serial which was Path s first entry into the medium George B Seitz tried to follow the cliffhanging pattern of The Adventures of Kathlyn but each chapter was mostly self contained br After retiring from law enforcement William J Flynn former director of the Bureau of Investigation forerunner of the FBI became a scenario writer for the motion picture industry through his acquaintance with the actor King Baggot who was considered the greatest film star in the country at that time in Producers Theodore and Leopold Wharton commissioned him to write story lines for their films including Pauline The Whartons also eventually adapted Flynn s experiences into a part spy thriller titled The Eagle s Eye starring Baggot br Surviving chapters of the French condensation of Pauline are noteworthy for their unintentionally funny re translations of their title cards and dialogue captions in the English version filled with misspellings poor punctuation terrible grammar and odd expressions The film was recut and adapted for home movie use and all of the printed captions were translated into French Later when the American home movie industry beckoned the original English titles had been scrapped so the French technicians tried to translate the titles back into English These errors have also been blamed on Louis J Gasnier director and supervisor of the production Gasnier as explained by Crane Wilbur made linguistic mistakes that confused the French speaking crew The new title cards also renamed the villain s character Raymond Owen as Koerner in reference to German villainy during World War I br br Much of the film was shot in Fort Lee New Jersey where many early film studios in America s first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the th century Scenes were also filmed in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and Staten Island New York The term cliffhanger may have originated with the series owing to a number of episodes filmed on or around the New Jersey Palisades though it is also likely to refer to situations in stories of this type where the hero or heroine is hanging from a cliff seemingly with no way out until the next episode or last minute resolution br Pearl White performed most of her own stunts for the serial but also was stunt doubled by a man Filmed in the Adirondacks in New York the stunt double rode a horse off a cliff into the lake below Considerable risk was involved In one incident a balloon carrying White escaped and carried her across the Hudson River into a storm before landing miles away In another incident her back was permanently injured in a fall br One of the more famous scenes in the serial which depicted a curved railroad bridge was supposedly the Ingham Creek trestle in New Hope Pennsylvania on the Reading Company s New Hope Branch now the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad line The railroad is a tourist attraction today Other supposed locations for the railroad scenes include the Belvidere Delaware Railroad in Lambertville and Raven Rock New Jersey and the Long Island Rail Road in the Hamptons on Long Island These stories are likely legends since there were no major scenes involving action with trains in the serial br Milton Berle claimed The Perils of Pauline as his first film appearance playing the character of a young boy though this has never been independently verified and is unlikely as no child characters appear in the serial The serial did mark one of the early credits for the cinematographer Arthur C Miller who was transferred to the project from the Path News department br Path established an American factory and studio facility in Jersey City New Jersey in and also established the Eclectic Film Company as a subsidiary distribution company for both its American and European products Although the Jersey City plant produced moderately popular comedies dramas and newsreels largely directed at the US market Pauline was the first American made Path effort to achieve worldwide success under the Eclectic banner br The final peril has Pauline sitting in a target boat as the Navy opens fire The idea was also used in To the Shores of Tripoli br br br Sequels and remakes br br This successful serial was quickly followed by The Exploits of Elaine also starring White Many imitations and parodies followed heralding the first golden age of the American film serial br The title The Perils of Pauline was reused by Universal Studios for a sound serial with a different plot by Paramount Pictures as the Betty Hutton vehicle The Perils of Pauline and by Universal again in as an updated comedy br An abortive mixed media musical was planned to be based on the film called Who s That Girl meant to be premiered by The Boys from Syracuse producer Richard York on Broadway in with a book written by Lewis Banchi and Milburn Smith and with the planned participation of the songwriting duo Ray Evans and Jay Livingston br br br Legacy br The Perils of Pauline is the prime example of what scholar Ben Singer has called the serial queen melodrama There has been a recent reassessment of Singer s model in light of broader film forms br The film s style was later subject to nostalgic caricature in many forms e g Dudley Do Right but the original heroine was neither as helpless as the caricatures nor did the original series include the much parodied tied to railroad tracks or tied to buzzsaw scenarios which appeared in later films in this vein Even the title phrase Perils of was often adopted by later serials for example in Universal s Perils of the Secret Service Perils of the Wild and Perils of the Yukon and Republic Pictures Perils of Nyoka br The cartoon series The Perils of Penelope Pitstop was patterned after this serial and included the plot point of the villain trying to eliminate the heroine so he can keep her inheritance br The Thunderbirds episode The Perils of Penelope was inspired by The Perils of Pauline br br br See also
