Italian American plumbers from Brooklyn The live action segments a parody of contemporary sitcoms are set in Brooklyn and deal with the peculiarities of running a plumbing business in the late s br The Super Mario Bros animated segments feature Mario and Luigi after they accidentally warp into the Mushroom Kingdom while fixing a bathtub drain Each episode begins with Mario reciting an entry into his Plumber s Log then teaming up with Luigi to assist Princess Toadstool and Toad in preventing King Koopa from taking over the Kingdom with a sinister plot generally one parodying a book film or historical event Each episode s plot featured characters and situations based upon the NES games Super Mario Bros and Super Mario Bros as well as several sound effects and musical cues from both games Despite being based on the games some episodes featured inconsistencies between the serials and the video games For example in the animated serials Mario receives fire powers from a Super Star whereas the star grants temporary invincibility in the game with the Fire Flower granting pyrokinesis br The Legend of Zelda animated segments follow the adventures of the hero Link and Princess Zelda as they defend the kingdom of Hyrule from Ganon who somehow came into possession of the Triforce of Power Most episodes consist of Ganon or his minions either attempting to capture the Triforce of Wisdom from Zelda kidnap Zelda or conquer Hyrule In some episodes Link and Zelda are assisted and accompanied by a fairy princess named Spryte who dislikes Zelda as she considers her to be a competitor for Link s affections Throughout the series Link is a moaning self centred teenager who repeatedly fails to convince Zelda that he deserves a kiss for his heroic deeds Although Zelda is sometimes the damsel in distress she is a headstrong self sufficient princess who is Link s equal Link frequently meets Zelda s angry remarks with his sarcastic catchphrase Well excuse me Princess br br br Cast br Lou Albano

and development br Before the series was conceived Andy Heyward the then CEO of DIC Enterprises spent about a year trying to convince Nintendo to license the characters In an interview with USA Today Heyward said The Mario Bros is such a unique property we had to do it in a different way We wanted to do a cartoon but also do a show that extended beyond the cartoon The project originated as Super Mario Bros Power Hour a one hour long animation block that would have featured series based on a number of intellectual properties Concept art was produced for adaptations of Super Mario Bros The Legend of Zelda Metroid Castlevania Double Dragon and California Games With the exception of Mario and Zelda none of these additional adaptations were ultimately produced Double Dragon would receive a later adaptation from DIC which aired from to but this did not make use of the s concepts and was instead based on the SNES titles released in the interim br The show premiered in September To promote the series Lou Albano appeared on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee in May with his beard shaven When the series first aired it was distributed by Viacom Enterprises and was marketed by MTV In addition DiC planned to produce an animated film based on the series to be released in the summer of The film was never produced and a live action adaptation was instead released in br In David Sheff s book Game Over Bill White the then director of advertising and public relations for Nintendo said that the purpose of the television series was to boost awareness of the characters br The Legend of Zelda animation was only produced for one season Writer Phil Harnage said that the reason it was cancelled was partly because it was tied to The Super Mario Bros Super Show rather than being its own show It was tied to it and they didn t want to renew The Mario Bros and Zelda got shuffled off He also said that the show received some letters from children asking for it to not be cancelled but this positive feedback was not enough to keep the show in production br br br Format br br Each episode of the program consisted of two live action segments one at the start and the other towards the end dubbed Mario Bros Plumbing in which Lou Albano and Danny Wells portrayed the roles of Mario and Luigi respectively in comedic story accompanied by a laugh track These segments involved a celebrity guest star joining the pair either as themselves or as a character connected to the segment s plot who were often a popular television star or professional athlete including WWE then WWF stars of the time such guests included Nedra Volz Norman Fell Donna Douglas Eve Plumb Vanna White Lyle Alzado and Magic Johnson br Alongside guest stars both Albano and Wells portrayed additional characters in a number of episodes related to Mario and Luigi In one episode Albano played as himself but had to make the character of Mario absent for this to work while in a number of episodes the pair were joined by Maurice LaMarche in the live action role of the animated character Inspector Gadget making it the first appearance of the character in live action predating the live action film by ten years before his eventual role in voicing the character in Inspector Gadget s Last Case and Gadget the Gadgetinis In an interview for Shout Factory s first DVD release of the show in which exclude some episodes that involved Cassandra Peterson as Elvira alongside Gadget s second appearance and a few other episodes Albano stated that filming of the live action segments involved mainly himself and Wells receiving a central plot and mostly improvising the dialogue as they went along The live action segments were directed by Steve Binder and were filmed before a studio audience br The rest of the episode in between these live action segments were dedicated to animated serials For the majority of episodes between Monday and Thursday each episode of The Super Mario Bros Super Show featured an animated serial of the Super Mario Bros which both Albano and Wells voiced their respective characters A total of serials were aired under this schedule until November For every subsequent Friday the animated segments consisted of serials of The Legend of Zelda with scenes featuring during the live action segments on the preceding Super Mario Bros Super Show episodes during the week and then broadcast as sneak peeks A total of serials were aired under this schedule and following November were repeated for the remaining episodes of The Super Mario Bros Super Show until its eventual conclusion br br br Writing br According to screenwriter Bob Forward the writing team on the Legend of Zelda segments was given significant freedom to develop the series as they wished particularly with regards to the script and character design Nintendo offered little advice or guidance to the writers except for providing a franchise bible character designs and the first two video games in the series As a result the writers who were not gamers conducted their own research and decided to focus on story instead of gameplay The episodes featured a combination of action drama and comedy with much emphasis placed on the relationship between Zelda and Link br The fairy character named Spryte was inspired by Forward s childhood obsession with the character Tinker Bell from Walt Disney s animated film Peter Pan Forward also explained that Link s catchphrase Excuse me Princess was based on a popular Steve Martin comedy routine He decided to include it in every episode of the series as a way to poke fun at DIC s VP of Creative Affairs Robbie London who had forced him to use the phrase Forward also stated that the relationship between Link and Zelda was influenced by the dynamic between the characters of the American television series Moonlighting which were portrayed by Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd br The writers revealed that in addition to having a show bible as a reference for the main characters they were influenced by their own interests when creating episodes in the series Eve Forward said that although the monsters and weapons were based on the game a lot of the various swashbuckling stuff I liked to put in was based on things that had happened in our D D games br The show is one of the few instances of Link having dialogue in The Legend of Zelda franchise It was the first time that the characters were given voice actors having never been voiced in the games and being composed of just a few pixels This allowed the writers freedom of interpretation Bob Forward said that we very much made it up as we went along The games intentionally do not give Link dialogue The Legend of Zelda video game series producer Eiji Aonuma has explained that since people have played Zelda over the years they have their ideas of how Link might sound If we were to put a voice in there that might not match up with someone else s image then there would be a backlash to that So we ve tried to avoid that br br br Songs br br Each episode featured two main theme songs used during its broadcast br br Mario Brothers Rap composed by Haim Saban Andrew Dimitroff and Shuki Levy the theme is performed by unknown artists one version to open the show and another version before the Super Mario Bros animated segments Both versions are based on the original Overworld theme from the Super Mario Bros video game The song was later featured in The Super Mario Bros Movie performed by Ali Dee br Do the Mario performed by Albano in front of a greenscreen of the animated show s backgrounds it acted as the closing theme for The Super Mario Bros Super Show br During each Super Mario Bros animated segment a cover of a popular song would be played Notably one episode originally used a cover by Huey Lewis and the News with lyrics that were considered inappropriate for this show When the program was re released onto DVD in North America these songs were replaced by instrumentals of songs from The Adventures of Super Mario Bros and one song from Super Mario World br br br Reruns br br br Club Mario br The first set of reruns of the program were aired during the TV season again in syndication but with significant changes in the live action format While it retained the program s original scheduling arrangement of broadcasts and the animated serials of Super Mario Bros and The Legend of Zelda the live action segments of Albano and Wells were replaced with a new continuity of five minute live action segments entitled Club Mario br The format for these segments focused on a new set of characters Mario obsessed teenagers Tommy Treehugger Chris Coombs and Co MC Michael Anthony Rawlins hijacking the Super Show s satellite

generally mixed to negative reviews from critics who were critical of its animation humor live action segments storylines and Albano and Wells acting Upon the series premiere in September Mike Hughes of USA Today described the series as a surprising disappointment opining that the series had little of the wit and spark and relied too heavily on slapstick In a retrospective review for the series DVD Mark Bozon of IGN referred to the series as the biggest offender among Nintendo s many embarrassing moments but thought that the animated shorts were interesting to look back on Bozon gave the overall series a out of while giving the DVD itself a out of Common Sense Media rated the show out of stars stating that the stereotypes of Italians on the show have not aged well br br br The Legend of Zelda br The Legend of Zelda segments when reviewed individually have also received a mixed reception IGN rated the DVD release of The Legend of Zelda a out of or Bad citing poor writing repeated plots and over the top acting Link s catchphrase Well excuse me Princess is an internet meme and commonly used in joke used by video game players especially Zelda fans and is spoken by Link on occasions throughout the episodes br James Rolfe of Cinemassacre has shown a more positive response to the series While acknowledging that the dialogue can make you cringe he favored Link and Zelda s characterizations and found the action satisfying He labeled The White Knight as the best episode for showing Link s heroic nature against the more pompous and vain Prince Facade but described the following episode Kiss N Tell as his least favorite for Link complaining throughout br Michael Mammano for Den of Geek commented that the series falls squarely into the category of guilty pleasure and continued it s not very good but that doesn t stop it from being eminently enjoyable It s quality nostalgia and at a total running time of just over three hours not a bad way to kill an afternoon However he also described Link s characterisation as appalling describing him as a whiny obnoxious barely competent creep and also considered the writing and animation to be poor quality br Nathan Simmons of SVG considered the animation to be pretty stiff but also opined that the greatest sin of this cartoon series might be it s sic characterization of Link who is portrayed as a creep and that for longtime fans however it was simply painful to watch br Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted shoddy animation poor voice work execrable humour and terrible writing make it one of the decade s worst cartoons but also commented for all its flaws there s something about it that defies genuine ridicule Something charming He responded more positively to the show s faithful presentation of the artwork from the original The Legend of Zelda game and the music stating that it featured great renditions of the game s most memorable music especially the intro s version of the trademark title theme br Dave Trumbore for Collider described the series as a th century mess and commented Despite years of beloved video games that have evolved with each of Nintendo s successive video game systems the one and only animated series remains a blight on an otherwise impressive record This disaster and similar ill fated animated live action adaptations of Nintendo s intellectual properties left a foul taste in the IP owners mouths essentially locking out any additional adaptations outside of the video game realm br Writing for Destructoid Chris Moyse commented that the series was merely one more harmless entity in a thousand mediocre cartoons but opined that it harmed the future potential of the franchise because we most certainly would have had a new Legend of Zelda anime movie or live action series by now br br br Ratings br Upon the first week of its premiere the series had a cumulative rating share making the series the highest rated first run syndicated series at the time Within the next two weeks the series was beat out by Buena Vista Television s Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers and faced competition with Claster Television s Muppet Babies reruns br br br br br br External links br br The
