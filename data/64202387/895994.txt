involvement Due to the delays of Banjo Kazooie Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas thus making the decision to centre the game around Diddy Kong br Diddy Kong Racing received critical acclaim upon release The graphics audio and gameplay were among the most lauded aspects while some criticism was directed at the game s repetition It sold million copies since release and stands as the Nintendo s eighth best selling game A sequel named Donkey Kong Racing was in development for the GameCube but

In Diddy Kong Racing players can choose one of ten characters who have access to three different vehicles car hovercraft and aeroplane The car is an all round vehicle but it is the slowest on certain surfaces like sand and water The hovercraft is designed for both sand and water areas but lacks in acceleration and manoeuvrability The aeroplane is designed to access aerial areas it is good at acceleration and manoeuvring but has the slowest speed Each racetrack has a set of boosters known as zippers that temporarily boost the player s speed as well as featuring regenerating balloons of various colours that provide power ups There are five different types of balloons red blue green yellow and rainbow Red balloons grant missiles to attack racers ahead blue balloons grant a speed boost yellow balloons grant shields to protect the player from attacks green balloons grant deployable traps to delay other racers and rainbow balloons grant a magnet ability that brings the player closer to the nearest racer If multiple balloons of the same colour are picked up the power up is upgraded to a more powerful version A total of two upgrades are available for each balloon Additionally racetracks contain non regenerating bananas that add to speed when they are picked up A maximum of ten bananas will improve the speed but can also be obtained to prevent other players from gaining speed If a racer gets hit two bananas are deducted br In Adventure Mode players control the racer of their choice to progress through the story Players begin in the hub world which links five interconnected worlds Dino Domain Snowflake Mountain Sherbet Island Dragon Forest and Future Fun Land The worlds are opened up by collecting balloons except for Future Fun Land which is unlocked after defeating Wizpig for the first time and rank st place in all four Trophy Races of the original worlds Each world contains four racetracks an unlockable battle stage and a race against a boss character If the player defeats Wizpig in Future Fun Land obtains all amulet pieces and collect all the gold medals the player will be able to play in a mode called Adventure In this mode all the balloons change colour to platinum and the tracks are inverted from left to right The game also features four battle modes which consist of two deathmatch maps a capture the flag style battle and a mode which involves opponents capturing eggs The battle modes are not initially selectable and must be unlocked by collecting special keys hidden in each of the worlds br br br Plot br The plot of Diddy Kong

attempt to invade Timber s Island the islanders travel to Future Fun Land for a second challenge When Wizpig loses the second race the rocket he rides on malfunctions and launches him to the moon However an additional cutscene reveals Wizpig s spaceship flying through the sky unscathed br br br Development br br Development of the game began after the release of Killer Instinct in which a team was split into making Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo and a new racing game for that console During development the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom with which Nintendo had no involvement In June the game was altered to Pro Am an unrelated follow up to the NES racing game R C Pro Am According to Lee Schuneman the Pro Am project featured three wheeled trikes in contrast to radio controlled cars br With Banjo Kazooie being delayed until the summer of the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video game in time for s Christmas season Rare felt that Pro Am did not have a strong enough intellectual property to capture the attention of consumers and thus changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong According to Lee Musgrave the decision to choose Diddy Kong rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice a decision which Nintendo enjoyed Once the intellectual property was changed the team were left to adapt the visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it could be released Musgrave recalled that the ultimate goal of the game was to make it run as fast as Mario Kart which proved difficult during development as the latter game utilised D character sprites whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully D models Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall project due to the small team of people who worked on it In an October interview Musgrave said that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character of Pro Am had the intellectual property for Diddy Kong Racing not been conceived Two of the characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing Banjo the Bear and Conker the Squirrel starred in games Banjo Kazooie and Conker s Bad Fur Day respectively which were unveiled to the public before Diddy Kong Racing at the June Electronic Entertainment Expo E but ultimately not released until after Diddy Kong Racing Rare stated that they chose not to exhibit Diddy Kong Racing at E because of the proprietary animation technology used in the game br br The game s soundtrack was composed by David Wise The soundtrack was first released in Japan on April with tracks while a version of the album was released in Europe with the same number of tracks For its United States release only tracks were featured The disc itself was specially shaped in the form of Diddy Kong s head which was unplayable in certain CD players br br br Release br Due to most of the Nintendo s planned Christmas season line up being delayed until Diddy Kong Racing became the main Nintendo release for the holiday shopping season and a majority of Nintendo s million advertising budget for the entire year was allocated to promoting the game The game had a million marketing budget in North America Diddy Kong Racing also held the distinction of being the only game in the North American Christmas season line up for which development was contracted by Nintendo the other two first party Nintendo games in the line up Bomberman and Mischief Makers were both licensed from Japanese third party publishers br br br Reception br br The game received critical acclaim upon release The Nintendo version holds an aggregate score of at GameRankings based on reviews and at Metacritic based on reviews whereas the Nintendo DS remake received a score of at GameRankings based on reviews and a score of at Metacritic based on reviews Diddy Kong Racing sold approximately million copies worldwide which included million copies sold in the United States and PAL regions and copies in Japan At the Milia festival in Cannes it took home a Gold prize for revenues above million in the European Union during the previous year It stands as the Nintendo s eighth best selling game and broke one million units sold in the United States within three weeks of its release br The graphics and gameplay were the most praised aspects of the game Some critics noted how it minimised pop up without resorting to the use of distance fog Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot disputed this saying that the game has both pop up and distance fog in amounts comparable to the average Nintendo game He nonetheless stated that the game was a pleasure to look at and praised the detail of the tracks Doug Perry of IGN heralded the visuals as the most spectacular of its kind and praised Rare s ability to master dynamic animation through enabling polygons to span larger surfaces without loss of framerate Furthermore Perry stated that the game s technical achievements were enough to leave even the most critical Japanese gamer to look upon with smiling eyes br Although Crispin Boyer opened his review of the game for Electronic Gaming Monthly EGM with the warning Don t dismiss this out of the blue racer as a Mario Kart clone most reviews compared the two games Gerstmann suspected Nintendo of rushing Diddy Kong Racing to market in order to fill a quarter left vacant by delays of other Nintendo games and argued it was much too soon after Mario Kart s debut to release such a similar game Other critics including Boyer s EGM co reviewers focused on Diddy Kong Racing s perceived superiority to Mario Kart Dan Hsu of EGM said it beats Mario Kart in every department particularly mentioning the superior balance and level designs Edge praised the adventure and progression aspect of the game stating that the game s single player mode is everything Mario Kart should have been br The character designs met with a variety of opinions EGM s Shawn Smith praised the characters as hilarious Next Generation by contrast said the character designs are pathetic and obvious molded from the same cookie cutter as Banjo Kazooie and Conker noting the formulaic use of anthropomorphic animal characters and the simplistic application of each animal s characteristics to gameplay Perry felt that the vocals of characters in the game were heartwarming and comical while also stating that some of the characters are just too damn cute and are certain to annoy older gamers br Overall assessments of the game were mostly positive GamePro gave it a out of for sound and a perfect in control graphics and fun factor calling it a feverishly fun Nintendo racer that combines elements of Mario Kart Wave Race and Pilotwings into one spectacular game EGM named it Game of the Month with its four reviewers lauding the challenging gameplay and numerous objectives to tackle Gerstmann instead counted the latter as the game s greatest weakness arguing that having to repeatedly play through the same courses with slightly different objectives makes the game excessively repetitive He concluded that the game is far better than Mario Kart but the repetitiveness ultimately kills it Next Generation fell more in line with the majority remarking that the combination of racing and adventure elements works well and that Diddy Kong Racing shows Rare s pure craftmanship displaying keen subtleties that eventually win players over br In a retrospective review Andrew Donaldson of Nintendo Life stated that the game was visually incredibly vibrant and captivating for a game of the early Nintendo era Scott McCall of AllGame acknowledged its only shortcoming was its excessive amount of clipping although he admitted it was not unbearable He praised the wide range of audio in the game including its voice acting and soundtrack he heralded the music as interesting and fitting to its race tracks also considering it superior to that of Mario Kart Donaldson criticised game s presentation as too cutesy especially in terms of the characters voices However he praised the upbeat and catchy soundtrack saying that each track had its own unique tune to suit the distinct environment In Official Nintendo Magazine ranked the game th on a list of the greatest Nintendo games of all time br EGM named Diddy Kong Racing Racing Game of the Year at its Editors Choice Awards Diddy Kong Racing was awarded with Console Racing Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts Sciences in beating Mario Kart Moto Racer and NASCAR br br br Legacy br br br Cancelled sequel and spin offs br After the release of Diddy Kong Racing Rare began development on a sequel named Donkey Kong Racing for the GameCube which featured Donkey Kong as the titular character A pre rendered CG video of the game was shown at E which displayed a parody of the speederbike scene from Return of the Jedi According to Lee Musgrave the game featured a unique mechanic which involved riding on animals rather than driving vehicles The player could switch between different types of animals mid race larger animals could destroy obstacles whereas smaller ones allowed more manoeuvrability Development of Donkey Kong Racing was cancelled when Nintendo turned down the opportunity to purchase its remaining percent stake in Rare and the developer was bought out by Microsoft for million in br After the buyout Rare took what had been done with Donkey Kong Racing and created a prototype for the Xbox which expanded into an adventure game similar to the original setup of Diddy Kong Racing Musgrave stated that the concept was essentially built from scratch and featured a limited multiplayer version at one point The concept was in development over months and evolved from being an animal orientated racing game to an open world game with Tamagotchi style features in which nurturing animals was a key mechanic By this point Donkey Kong Racing had evolved into Sabreman Stampede part of Rare s Sabreman series Sabreman Stampede was set for release on the Xbox but was cancelled due to a lack of focus and Rare s unfamiliarity with the hardware br Aside from Donkey Kong Racing two other sequels to Diddy Kong Racing were in development One named Diddy Kong Pilot with planes as the only vehicle was planned for a release on the Game Boy Advance Originally announced alongside Donkey Kong Racing at E the game became Banjo Pilot after Nintendo sold their share of Rare to Microsoft At the time of its announcement the game featured the ability to play using a tilt function as well as a D pad and contained at least five tracks The other titled Diddy Kong Racing Adventure was a rejected pitch made by Climax Studios for the Nintendo GameCube around The project was never announced to the public in any capacity and only became known after a video game archivist acquired the prototype and published a video about it in November br As Timber was bypassed as the main character in Diddy Kong Racing Rare s next game was planned to keep Timber as the main character according to Kev Bayliss This game was originally planned as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo with Timber as a time traveller to a prehistoric period and gameplay similar to The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time but over time they found it better to replace Timber with wholly new characters This game became Star Fox Adventures for the GameCube at the suggestion of Nintendo br br br Remake br Diddy Kong Racing DS is a Nintendo DS remake of Diddy Kong Racing Developed by Rare and published by Nintendo it was released in February in North America and April in Europe and Australia This version received enhanced visuals and framerate in addition to touchscreen functions and Rumble Pak support for force feedback Four new Donkey Kong themed racetracks were included in the remake along with several modifications to the soundtrack Banjo and Conker were replaced by Tiny Kong and Dixie Kong while new playable characters Taj and Wizpig were also added The DS version also features new modes which allow the player to create their own racetracks customise their characters through recording voices and an online multiplayer function The battle modes were restricted to multiplayer only with the custom racetracks replacing them in Adventure Mode The game was met with mixed reviews upon release with critics asserting that the new additions were gimmicky and the touchscreen controls felt horribly sensitive br br br The Diddy Laugh br In the game s opening sequence the sound of children laughing can be heard when the Rare logo is displayed This stock sound effect is part of a library called The Premiere Edition Volume released by sound producer and distributor The Hollywood Edge for use of stock sounds in media Although it had been used previously in various films and television shows this sound effect has come to be commonly referred to as the Diddy laugh due to its association with the game br br br br br br Further reading br br br External
